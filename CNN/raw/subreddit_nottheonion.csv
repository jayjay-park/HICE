298940,0,t1_cfbqnnp,It was kind of a fluke how we ended up. Basically back in  the conservative party pissed the entire country off and the progressive party got elected. Then the conservative party was in a bit of a mess because of how bad they lost  lots of senior politicians lost their seat. They went through a series of different leaders and just happened that the really crazy guy had just been made leader when the progressive party had a leadership meltdown see my other post but they basically sacked the prime minister  months from an election and by default the crazy leader of the conservatives was seen as having been effective. The progressive party won the election but continued having leadership problems for  years until the next election the australian public got sick of their shit even though they were getting stuff done and voted for anyone but them thus electing the by this point super crazy conservatives who miss took the other partys problems as their successes while trialing crazy tactics.Hopefully at our next election we fix this all up again.

The price for a videocassette that was allowed to be rented out was typically over  per copy. The idea was that the store would rent each copy multiple times and be able to make that money back and eventually turn a profit before selling the movie as used. If the first person to rent the movie paid . to have it for a few days then neglected to bring it back or pay the late fees the store would be out a decent sum of money.

Theyre selling the result of a fortune spent on RampD.Ultimately I think the Indian govt will end up shooting itself in the foot if it does this repeatedly as pharmaceutical companies may simply stop selling to anyone in India.Regarding your first point I didnt say it was fair  if its not fair then its unethical.

Martins girlfriend was on the phone with him and overheard Martin confront Zimmerman about following him. Martin leaves Zimmerman behind then returns to argue with him.  And purportedly attacks him physically out of anger rather than self defense.

549032,0,t1_cg2lw3l,I agree that it wouldnt make sense to talk about God on the show but there are reasons why that is so those reasons being that there is no empirical evidence to support the claim that God created everything. We have evidence that the universe emanated outwards from a singularity which is why science rejects the prior claim and regards the theory of the Big Bang as being permissible to speak of in a scientific context. The multiverse as far as I have been told in this thread is a foray into the realm of speculation. It sounds sciency but it has not been put through the crucible of the scientific method and thus the question of why it should be assumed to be relative to science is perfectly legitimate. Now Im probably naive in thinking that anyone in this thread actually has the slightest idea about what a multiverse is or what has prompted theorists to pursue the idea. There are probably some very good reasons that some extremely intelligent people have developed the theory reasons that people in this thread simply cannot articulate to me. I guess the answer Im looking for is that the theory of the multiverse is speculative but that its the simplest most elegant explanation given what we know about the structure of our own universe and what we know about the Big Bang. And given its simplicity it at least passes the criteria of Ockhams Razor which lends it the quality that induces the wonder that scientific discovery often begins with. However instead of receiving that answer Ive been treated like an idiot for asking questions by a bunch of supposed proponents of scientific thinking which is disheartening to say the least.,nottheonion,cg2oj9l,1,t5_2qnts

608197,0,t1_cg9d5og,I was going to reply to each point but after reading through it I think it needs to be pointed out that your definition of free speech is not actually free speech. Free speech doesnt stop people from taking actions to oppose you as long as those actions still ensure your right to say what you want. Free speech says you can say anything you want. And ChickFilAs douchebag owners can they can say they hate Gays they can support groups who support killing homosexuals they can oppose legislation to create equal rights. Thats their right to speech. What free speech doesnt do is say everyone has to support you even if youre a hateful bigot. Free speech doesnt say people have to go to your restaurant even though they despise you. Free speech is not the freedom to run a profitable business. Only the freedom to speak. They have the freedom to open a business but whether its profitable depends entirely on them.If I move into Harlem and open a barber shop called KKKKuts thats my right. I can go in open the shop and run my business. Hell I can tell every customer who comes in all about how much I hate Blacks Hispanics Asians and everyone else! Theres no way anyone can legally stop me from doing this. But no where in the freedom of speech does it say the community has to support me. No where does it say bigots need to be allowed to run successful restaurants. If an owner of a business goes out of their way to insult denigrate or piss off a large portion of its customer base than thats the owners fault. Not the customer bases. You are putting the blame for what happened on the wrong people. And to be clear the USA does not have completely free speech you cant yell fire in a crowded theater as everyone loves to point out.

762953,1,t1_cgqzobr,I dont condone directing hate at police across the board I apologize if I misrepresented myself there. On treating police as tools of society I dont think its that clear cut. As you said police have discretion in most situations. Typically quite a bit of discretion. Tools dont have agency but police do. And there is quite a bit of inconsistency in law enforcement. For example whether or not you get a ticket for speeding can depend on a threeminute conversation on the side of the road. Whether you go to jail for drug paraphernalia or four ounces of pot can depend on how generous the lead cop is feeling. Ive had some great experiences with police.And I think were both arguing for discretion in the end but I supposed I got mixed signals there and thought you were trying to minimize the blame against the police. I agree with you that the lawmakersor rather the corporate interests that elect them and buy laws from themare the ultimate source of all these problems. And like I said I dont condemn police as a whole. I want them to be better. I want everyone to be able to have positive interactions with police.You raise a good point in that for starters everyone has to treat the police with the respect due their station. That would help quite a bit. But its a snake eating its tail. People have bad experiences with police which causes them to hate the police which causes police to see people as enemies which causes people to have bad experiences with police. We gotta start somewhere and the easiest place I can see is greater police accountability. I want police officers to be held accountable always because sadly not all of them can be trusted to serve the public unsupervised. And so I say they should be held culpable for atrocious acts like this law or no law. Greater discretion greater accountability.,nottheonion,cgr057r,-3,t5_2qnts

1037819,0,t1_chm4af9,im gonna have to disagree with this. selfdiscipline and vigrous exertion does not equal asceticism Self control is different from extreme self denialmortification. Ascetics do this to gain Enlightenment which Paul says in  Col specifically the rd verse but read all of it for context especially from  on that asceticism is worthless so dont do it. this chapter goes into this a bit saying to avoid the philosophy of men of which asceticism apparently is. tim   especially is a very good supporting scripture for this thread in general. It completely blasts the Ascetic lifestyle.also to support this there are plenty of verses in the bible that show we are meant to have a good time but in moderation. What does the Bible say? The Scriptures show that when God completed his creation of the earth he declared that everything he had made was very good. Genesis  God intended for man and woman in the garden of Eden to enjoy material things. The very name Eden means Pleasure or Delight. God is not capricious. Hes not gonna give you good stuff thats enjoyable then tell you nope dont do it!If you look at Jesus life he was no ascetic. there are plenty of scriptures that said he enjoyed good things and having a good time. Luke  and my favorite scripture here cause Jesus himself makes wine and makes it good p John . So even if Paul was saying in your quoted verses to be an ascetic Jesus trumps him. but that doesnt make sense because the bible supports itself so if verses seem to contradict each other there needs to be a closer examination of them.Ascetics are looking for Enlightenment through their actions but true wisdom is reasonable not extreme. James  why would God created our physical bodies with the capacity to enjoy many pleasures in life? He wants us to be happy. look at what the Bible says at Ecclesiastes  . have come to know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good during ones life and also that every man should eat and indeed drink and see good for all his hard work.

As such we have to resist these peoples efforts.Guns are as much of a sport as archery is.Many people want to defend gun ownership for uses outside of competition.  The Second Amendment of the Constitution is the Right to Bear Arms not the right to participate in shooting sports.  Owning a gun for the purposes of using it as a weapon is a protected right in this country.It means actively going out and finding the guns that arent registered.  It means actively going door to door to innocent people and taking their guns away from them process them for registration and then giving them back.Thats illegal in this country also under the Constitution.This is why doing something about it is something that has to come from the people themselves not the government.Youre assuming that the problem is gun ownership.  Were arguing that gun ownership is not the problem.Right now this simply wont happen because it seems that most americans are against any form of gun control.Were against most of what youve outlined in your post and for very good reasons.,nottheonion,chqmqay,4,t5_2qnts

1111702,0,t1_chumto0,gtsometimes there are churches built literally right next to each otherSo what? I live in Edmonton Alberta and we have a street that has or had the world record for churches on one street. That doesnt mean the city is religious and horribly stifling.As an atheist Id rather have churches than the endless parading of homosexuality that Salt Lake City has.gtI dont hate LDS people in fact I married one. I would just appreciate a more diversified population.If you want a more diverse population move to a metropolitan area. Thats what big cities are for cosmopolitan life. I find it refreshing to be able to go to a small town or the country and leave the endless bullshit and agendas behind. If anything you should find appreciation in places like that where the corruption and degradation of big city life hasnt completely ruined everything. Sure they do stupid shit like photoshop shirts on girls. I can think of far worse in cities that consider themselves diverse and enlightened.gtI grew up here feeling like there was something wrong with me because I didnt believe in something all my friends did.Thats unfortunate but if they were really your friends I doubt it had a huge impact. gtI was made a project by some of the guys in the ward where they would try to befriend me with the sole purpose of converting me only to stop contacting me when they figured out that i wasnt interested in joining the church.Why were you even there? Did your family move you there with the intent of conversion or did you grow up there without integrating? Seems weird.gtThe seminary teacher I had told the class I was going down a dark path and made it sound like I was doing drugs or something when I decided to stop going to seminary. He pretty much made shit up about me. So forgive me if I sound a little frustrated by the prevalent culture here.I dont understand why your family was living there without being part of the community. Thats the thing with tight communities you either join them or you dont. I dont see a problem with it. They dont want people from the outside with notions of diversification and assimilation. People with your mindset are trying to assimilate them just as much as they are trying to assimilate you. They have every right to protect their way of life. The onus isnt on them but they did make the effort to try and bring you into their fold. You have the choice. You do whats best for you and they do the same.One thing I cant stand is all this propaganda about diversification multiculturalism and immigration. This is destroying cultures more than its helping them. The whole point of different cultures is for them to be pristine and observable.gtIm not claiming Im better than anyone. I just had a bad experience growing up here because this culture can suck. If more people move here that arent LDS for the mountains and the great industry here that cant be a bad thing in my mind.Well you seem like you think they should change for you and other immigrants. Thats a backwards mentality that has been propagated by the government and the media for a long time now and it is completely wrong and destructive.I can imagine how it would suck for you but if people want to move to a region for the atmosphere and the work they need to contribute to the culture and help it function or they need to develop their own. These Mormons came to the area with the hopes of a better life too and they made it on their own. You expect them to provide welfare to newcomers without contribution? Thats not how things should work even though in most paces in the US it does now because the US is a big welfare nanny state where culture is only okay if you have a themed restaurant in a city downtown where the pretentious go to eat and pretend they are part of a multicultural society.,nottheonion,chunq5l,-1,t5_2qnts

Learn this! If your friend or loved one is suffocating in a tank or well do not go after them. They are dead and you will be too if you try to save them by jumping after them. You can not carry them out when you yourself have no air to breathe.In extreme cases of no air available one person could be securely tied to a rope and supported by several people to lower them in while holding their breath to grab the fallen person.

Babies are not born with a concept of god. This is defined as atheism. Whether you agree with this definition is kind of beside the point children are not born with a concept of a god.gt I do believe the philosophical atheism only exists as a concept because theism exists. A word doesnt have to mean anything to an individual question for it to be accurate. An indigenous people that live on an island and have no concept of god are still accurately described as atheist. Whether they would find this word to mean something is very much beside the point. For example a person that was born in a vegetative state is a vegetable.

Also just because youre not a victim doesnt mean your sacrifice is meaningless. I never once suggested that men are automatically guilty of some crime. Hell Im a guy myself. Just because I think that soldiers are not victims because they choose to participate in war doesnt mean Im somehow sexist against men.

1287095,0,t1_ciecc60,Of course lies can be opinions  you can be simply be mistaken and state what you incorrectly think is fact. Or even more interestingly know that objective facts blatantly contradict your opinion but still hold the opinion to be true.Your given examples are... poor I think. I think its beautiful is not an objective fact  it is an internal opinion. It does not matter if they are a boolean value they are arrived at in a nontestable and nonrepeatable manner. They are essentially inventions of your mind justifying a emotional response as there is no universal standard of beauty by which to measure.For example  I could hold the opinion that the atomic mass of gold is . This is a lie. The objective testable fact is that it is . but that would not stop me from holding that opinion. It would be considered foolish and easily contradicted but if I held fast to my conviction that the atomic mass of gold is  then that would be my opinion. I would also make a very poor chemist.But I believe that youre indicating that the nuance is the intent when stating a falsehood  that would be impossible to discern.

They were lower than those in the UK partially as an incentive to get people to move to and settle the colonies.  The taxes werent to cover wars in Europe either they were to cover the costs of defending the American colonies during the French amp Indian War. Even then they were only asking for taxes to cover a third of those costs.  The issue is that they werent represented in Parliament like the rest of British subjects which is fair enough.

1474801,0,t1_cj147re,Exactly. When you have sex with someone who really wants to have sex with you then if you have any empathy at all having sex with someone who isnt really into it is unappealing. But that means you have to be aware paying attention and have to have had sex with someone who wants it. Up until that point then the how was I supposed to know she didnt want it? thing makes sense. It doesnt excuse it but it explains the mindset. I might note the same kind of psychology applies in the stupid friendzone thing. When you go out with someone whose company you enjoy and who seeks you out to spend time with you then you can see through the silliness of being owed a relationship with someone because you think theyre pretty. But until that happens then its a bit alien and you can only go on what movies have taught you which is not a good thing. ,nottheonion,cj153h0,3,t5_2qnts

1476309,0,t1_cj1b03o,Sorry for being overly brief. Mobile use begets laziness on my part Im afraid. It is unethical to me because I dont that any human being has any business purchasing another for use and quick disposal. Sure you can make an argument for services rendered but your relationship with the plumber is probably less intimate unless you suddenly find yourself in a porn film. Youre paying for the prostitutes body whereas youre paying more for the end product of the plumbers work  and youll probably be enjoying that work for years to come unless you got a really shitty plumber. In that respect youre paying more for the human being than what theyve really done for you. I also think the introduction of money to sex complicates the question of consent. It may not be cut and dry rape probably isnt in the majority of cases but its a huge gray area to me. Id be concerned about whether or not a woman felt she was able to withdraw consent whether to a specific act or to the whole thing. Is it better than the situation in underground brothels?

1488293,0,t1_cj2t88g,Yes but the point everyone else is making is this if all it takes to make switching from humans to machines profitable is a minimum wage hike the replacement will happen anyway. Theres a sort of rule in computing called Moores law that basically says computers will get twice as powerful every two years for the same price. This also implies that a fixed amount computing power will get cheaper and cheaper.The takeaway is that if the replacement is computer based its going to quickly get cheaper. Increasing minimum wage would move up the profitability transition point by a few years at most. And minimum wage would have to start exponentially decreasing to keep human workers more profitably indefinitely.,nottheonion,cj2tzc2,13,t5_2qnts

If you reread my comment the stuff I linked was are? a couple articles relating to the post and I gave my opinion on how I disagree with people joking about or making light of a deplorable system that directly causes me emotional pain. I was commenting on how I disagree with publicity stunts like this that make prison out to be anything but a multibillion dollar industry that openly siphons tax money while failing at  of its fundamental mission statement.The purpose of a prison isA Deterrence  FAILB Personal reformrehabilitation  FAILC Punishment  SUCCESSIts easy to throw a shotgun blast criminal label on a population and push them out of our minds but at the end of the day there are people that will never be free again for things like drug abuse nonviolent crimes and most importantly mental illness. In my opinion the break a few eggs adage doesnt apply when dealing with human life and by not striving harder to fill cracks our fallen brothers and sisters can fall through we are failing at the core of what makes us human beings.The U.S punitive system wrote the book on the easiest way to deal with an undesirable population while creating jobs and supplementing communities. There are whole local national and international economies directly tied to prisons and more poignantly tied to keeping humans imprisoned. Just because prisons do some good for some people doesnt mean we should ignore an overall broken system that continually fails its core mission and is not even close to being cost effective in the long term.Dont confuse my frustration with the punitive system in the U.S as an argument against incarceration everyone knows that taking criminals out of the equation and deterring crime is a huge component of any civilized society. There is no bubble gum magic solution to this travesty but there is enough data from cases  where governments both local and national are getting it right that we no longer have an excuse to not implement some of their strategies. This system highlights the worst thing about U.S citizens and our elected government laziness greed and a chosen blissful ignorance toward the suffering of people that dont directly impact our comfort zone.We could sit here all day and ping pong the pros and cons of prison but the facts are out and the system we have in place right now is absolutely unequivocally   fucking wrong on every economic political social cultural and most importantly MORAL level.

1528659,0,t1_cj7vk1i,I think the point is to pull the power away from internal oversight.  One of my professors favorite sayings was Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? which roughly translates to who watches the watchmen.  Im no legal historian but I think when faced with a problem like this the courts generally like take the power away from internal oversight and give it to the hands of the jury.  Which means coming up with some sort of standard to allow citizens to more effectively sue police officers departments directly.  Once there people would be able to prove their suit in the same manner as anyone else can for any other type of civil harm.  Also lobby for criminal laws aimed at punishing police misconduct.  ,nottheonion,cj7w7k8,6,t5_2qnts

While forced migration and deportations are a war crime and a crime against humanity it is most certainly a crime of lesser magnitude than genocide.The Zionist movement of which Likud represents a fairly mainstream variety has no conflict with the Palestinian people in so far as their existence. They merely want all of Israel to themselves.

1669790,0,t3_2dgjdm,A couple of weeks ago I was taking out my garbage and saw that comcast was working on the lines in my alleyway. I went back to my home saw the connection go down and come back up again  minutes later. The following day I went over to my next door neighbors house and she told me about how her comcast had been down since the day prior. I told her that I saw them doing work in the area the previous day but they were already long gone. So my friend dials up comcast and the CSR tells her that there is currently a maintenance window in the area and that it will be back up in a couple of hours. My friend waits a few hours dials them back and they tell her that the window has been extended for a few more hours. At that point I go to my computer see that my connection is working fine and let my friend know. The next day my friend calls comcast and they tell her that there is still a maintenance window for the area. My friend has already been pissed with comcast for a very long time so she asked to cancel her account. The CSR literally told her that she can not cancel her account during a maintenance window. My friend gets pissed and demands to be transferred to the cancellations department she then gets told to wait on hold for a moment and she was actually put on hold for a total of  hours until she hangs up.The next day she calls them up again and is told that he service window is still ongoing and that she cant cancel. Again she is put back on indefinite hold.She called back the next day and asked for the billing department. When she says that she wants to cancel they outright refuse to cancel on the basis that the service is not functional. The CSR insists that she can resolve all of the problems. My friend hangs up calls back a few hours later and lies saying that she can not pay for it anymore. They threw a few discount offers at her but she insists she cant afford it.They sent her a few shipping boxes for her modem dvr etc a few days later but only a single shipping label. She ended up paying for the extra labels out of her own pocket. Shes now with uverse not all that better and I ran an ethernet cord from my apartment to hers where she pays me month for a share of my mbps internet service. ,nottheonion,cjpn0ds,37,t5_2qnts

1732484,0,t1_cjxd58o,When I married my wife I was a virgin and she was not. With her prior partners she had never orgasmed during sex. The first time we had sex I was a virgin. We had sex for about an hour and she came  times. To this day she wishes she had just waited for sex with me after we got married. Ive obviously gotten better but a lot of it really comes down to love and being ready to care about another persons physical well being as much as your own.   If you spend a good chunk of your early life waiting to have sex and setting up anticipation for it you can definitely be good at it once the time comes. I think many people want virgins because its understandable to want something fresh.... not used. I was able to give my wife everything I had emotionally and she can know a part of me is not with people in my past and she regrets not doing the same.  Virginity is NOT overrated.

However pederasty was still practiced and it was still considered normal for an adult male to pursue younger boys. Nevertheless actual penetration was illegal unless with a slave and beyond the actual pederastic relationship the pursuit of other men merely for pleasure was considered homosexual and disgraceful. But to educate young boys on how to achieve prowess sexually and socially was considered admirable and would not have been seen as homosexual. Regardless I never said Greek men had sex with each other. Greek men and Greek adolescents engaged sexually with one another in order to teach the younger males how to improve as men.

I cant imagine that this was something that was left up in the air.  The entire point of having participants sign contractswaivers in the first place is to ensure that there is no grey area about what is and isnt acceptable use of the footage.This leads me to believe that the agreement was very clear one way or the other.  The fact that none of the other contestants are coming forward disputing her claim of a guarantee that the privates would be blurred suggests that it is most likely that she is telling the truth absent other evidence.gtthis contract as described in this thread by people who dont know what it actually says was just waiting to be broken. Any reasonable person would have found not a risk but an expectation that it would be broken.I think you are only looking at half of the equation.When I sign a contract I recognize that there is a risk that the contract may be broken by the other party.However I also recognize that IF they break the contract I have a legal right to sue for damages and compensation which is exactly what she is doing.It is disingenuous to point out the risk that contracts may be broken while ignoring the obvious legal avenues available for restitution.gtI really doubt VH gave this woman the contract and terms we seeom to think they did. Youd have to be an idiot to guarantee someones snatch pics would never go public knowing those images always go public.Who said that those were the terms of the contract?  My understanding is that she isnt suing them for the general result of the pictures entering the public domain.  She is suing for the specific action of the company of failing to blur her vagina when it aired the episode on national TV.While it isnt possible for a company to guarantee that nobody ever will see the pictures and put them into the public space it is certainly within the power of the company to ensure that they specifically dont put those images in the public domain as part of a nationally televised broadcast. ,nottheonion,cjyxkx2,1,t5_2qnts

He was  when he passed away leaving a widow my moms best friend and a  year old daughter my friend.  The last year of his life was terrible.  He lost the ability to speak or eat.  Always thin he was a skeleton with skin stretched over it when he died.  And the worst part was that he was totally cognizant the whole time up until about the last few days when he was asleep most of the time as his body shut down.   The other one was a woman who was a patient at my pharmacy.  I saw her go from a chatty middle aged lady who taught school to a woman who had to communicate by writing on a dry erase board.  She had to have a handkerchief handy to mop up the constant saliva that dripped out of her mouth.  Eventually she went into hospice and later I saw her obituary in the paper.ALS is awful.

Having it open to the public as a museum was never Barnes wish but thats a battle from  years ago. Apart from the extensive financial problems and community restrictions that compounded over years of the museum attempting to operate as an antimuseum the old house in Merion where the collection was previously held became incredibly illsuited to the conservation of the collection.

1851413,0,t1_ckc7nbi,Ive been following the Arab Spring nearly since the start and have written about it. To those of us watching we were not surprised at this outcome. From mid  to about early  it was a mostly Syrian led revolution with the FSA leading the charge. If the international community were to step in it would have been then. The problem is that it was unavoidable that it would be hijacked by more radical Sunni elements. Many dont realize that many of these groups get money and support from wealthy SunniArabs throughout the area. Fast forward today it has spiraled out of control. Its ground to stalemate with no end in sight. With Libya slowly falling apart due to a power vacuum the Assad government is starting to look pretty good. Here is the thing about the Assad regime its mostly Alawite. It became this way after the dissolution of the French Mandate of Syria and the Alawite Stat many Alawites took key positions in the military then throughout many parts of the government with the accession of Hafez alAassad. Being apart of religious minority  of the population means you cant get away with too much. In fact the Assad regime really isnt that bad when compared to Col. Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein. Bashar alAssad needs to step down for gross overreaction to civil protests and crimes against humanity documented use of cluster bombs on civilian population.. I could write a  more words.

1913560,0,t1_ckhuyy6,you seem confused.my objection is not with the act of comparing black people to monkeys which are not apes by the way because noone did that especially not me.I was objecting to the tendency for americans to be so overly sensitive to race that when someone makes a statement completely unrelated to race but happens to use a word that in thier minds might in some distant way be somehow linked to the race of the person theyre talking about the immediate response is to scream RACIST and claim the moral high ground.I never mentioned his race nor did my comment have anything to do with race. i likened an untalented and egocentric entertainer to a dancing monkey. The act of linking the completely coincidental fact that the person i was talking about is black and also that the word i used has occasionally been used as an insult to black people and therefore immediately jumping on my statement that had absolutely nothing to do with race and accusing me of being racist betrays the raceobsessed culture of  and latent racism of the accuser not the accused.,nottheonion,ckjrrz2,1,t5_2qnts

I would argue yes but I have to admit its subjective.In the rape scenario the consent of the victim is ignored completely. Thats what makes it rape. There is no moral or legal standing that justifies a rape. It is legally morally and objectively wrong.Consent takes on two completely different forms across these two very different scenarioswhich is why I make the distinction I do.

2231188,0,t1_clne17a,Im coming from the point of view that if there is no harm done its fine. If people wouldnt buy it anyway theres no harm done in terms of monetary loss. You appear to be approaching this issue in terms of principle. I suspect you think it is akin to stealing i.e. taking something that isnt yours. A case could be made for a lack of respect for the creators wishes if they have expressed not wanting people to pirate their stuff. But there are times when the creator is fine with people pirating e.g. Minecraft but their publishermanageretc isnt so there are no feelings involved in such cases. Besides considering the impact and the creators wishes theres also the case for simply adhering to the relevant moral principles because we should  in this case not taking what doesnt belong to you. However I would argue that most moral principles exist at all either because they aim to prevent harm from being caused or because adhering to them helps you to become a better person. Assuming people dont want to pay at all neither is relevant in the case of piracy.My point on convenience was an explanation for the motivations behind piracy rather than a justification. Also I am going on the assumption that people will not pay anyway so no income is being deprived from the creator. I do think that if people want the item specifically then they should pay for it.I also just thought of another point that piracy can actually be helpful to the creators by earning them loyal fans who will pay for their future works. If I had to pay for an item I had no idea about there is a risk to me that I wont enjoy it and thus waste my money. People might decide that the upfront cost is too big a risk and thus never try out the creators stuff at all. However if they could get it through piracy and like it many will decide to legitimately support the creators future releases again Steam. ,nottheonion,clnfr0o,1,t5_2qnts

Of which I congratulate you.However unfortunately there are many who dont.And I can understand why people would find it offensive. Its more than just   or  people. Its grown to a far larger number than that. I can empathize to what theyre coming from.  Do the San Diego Aztecs offend me. No. But if they announced the change to the Brownskins it would raise an eyebrow. Theres a long history of racism and discrimination based on the color of ones skin. It pushes peoples buttons. Personally if it were the San Diego Brownskins I wouldnt get all angry over it but I would understand why others perhaps those who have experienced worse racism than I have would get angry.I wouldnt tolerate anyone calling me Brownskin. I would ask them to stop. I dont see this being much different.Just thinking out loud really and would love your input This seems to be a stark contrast to this with Blacks. The PC term for Black is African American which is of course stupid since not all Blacks come from Africa nor are all Blacks American. All my Black friends call themselves Black and prefer to be called Black which is obviously nonoffensive to them. Theres an interesting point of discussion why this is accepted as OK among Blacks whereas there are Natives offended by the term Redskin and I would be offended by the term Brownskin.However along the original lines though if a Black person told me to refer to them as African American I would happily oblige. ,nottheonion,clse8sm,1,t5_2qnts

Might shake things up but the w parties will work collectively to squash anyone who even tries to make a dent. Studies show that you can absolutely buy votes through PAC spending.. so anyone who tries to break in gets crushed by both sides . The only thing to stop them would be to vote for independent candidates but that would only happen with a serious education effort the type that would involve educating the masses about the system and where theyre getting kicked in the head by both the red and the blue boot. Get them to understand the issues as opposed to ranting about how goodbad one color of boot is and then vote based on issues not soundbytes celebrities or which guy parts his hair in which direction yes millions go towards determining stupid shit like that bc it will influence a certain  of voters  But even then most people in the US are so stupid that even knowing the facts theyd still root for a party like they do for their favorite sports team.Id love to see a blind vote where people only had a persons qualifications and skill sets on a list.

I think theres something fishy going on here.Sure China might increase demand to some degree given that prices might come down some but they wouldnt overcompensate for a reduction in US demand.Also you can make current technologies cheaper than fossil fuels by simply taxing fossil fuels or providing incentives to use the alternative ones. Its not the best case scenario since it requires lots of countries with differing interests to get on board but its technically feasible and mostly economically sound.

There hasnt been a whole lot of reform taxes increased very minimally and not a lot has changed. More people have health insurance now millions in fact but the system has changed very little and is unlikely to change so long as the people in power are making money. The ACA did very little in the way of reform a Republicans just heavily opposed it because of partisanship. It also works very well and has actually accomplished more than it ever intended to with drawn back funding.

2436887,0,t1_cmcryqs,Nope youre not an idiot. In an atmosphere the math is a little less than perfect but the science is still all there. When you shoot straight up the bullet decellerates at ms. That means every second the bullet travels is slows by ms until it stops. This is the force of gravity slowing the bullet. Once the bullet stops all the kinetic energy the bullet consumed to get to its altitude has been converted into potential energy. Now the bullet will start to accelerate back towards earth at the same ms. Every second it travels it accelerates by ms. This is the force of gravity once again. By the time the bullet reaches the point where it was fired its moving its original speed again. Its important to note that the bullet doesnt get the same ballistic benefits on its return trip as it did on its initial trip because its now tumbling and has lost all its spin. Regardless its going mostly the same speed as when it left. Maybe a little slower but easily fast enough to kill.,nottheonion,cmcwl90,2,t5_2qnts

2450297,0,t1_cmejr5w,Immigration is difficult on people and integration is especially difficult for the first generation. If you live in an Eastern US City you can see how what is happening now is just a repeat of what happened in the past. In my city we have separate zones. In one place all the streets are Polish names. A few blocks down theyre German. Then youve got the Italians and the Irish. At one point in time these were all separate communities of immigrants all living segregated from each other. You look at the communities today and aside from the street names none of them bear any ethnic segregation anymore. The second and third generation children of these families integrated and nobody thinks twice about it anymore. The same thing will happen to the Hispanics.

On a macrolevel theres no such thing as worthiness and you just have to decide whether you want huge populations of Arab Muslims taking over huge sections of your capital city.  I personally am in favor of forcefully deporting every Muslim from Europe.Concerning free speech you are probably for free speech in a vacuous sense.  What I mean by this is that you dont actually exchange ideas with the types that would be in the BNP and others you disagree with all you do is let them make whatever mouth noises they want.  The result is that exercising such ideas in a country filled with people who take the same stance as yourself would just be the same thing as outrightly banning the idea which is what is happening in the United States and western Europe.  You have a tragicomic situation in which the US prides itself as a bastion of free expression but then the residents there are such pieces of shit that the actual amount of information exchange about genuinely new ideas the whole point of free speech is as close to zero as possible so that when you spout an idea which is political heresy the population is so shut off that the expression of the idea may as well be banned.

Its a pretty alright and even funny thing to do when youre at a football game but when someones contemplating suicide its absolutely one of the most messed up and inhumane things you can do.It takes a real freethinking human to break out of it.Typically the bigger a mob the more its members lose selfawareness and become willing to engage in dangerous behavior.  Second physical anonymity also leads to a person experiencing fewer social inhibitions.  When people feel that their behavior cannot be traced back to them they are more likely to break social norms and engage in violence.

Where I worked it was simple You turned your assistive device into a weapon or use it in an unsafe manner it was removed from your possession until you had been reevaluated for your own safety and that of others.     THE PROBLEM HERE isnt the removal of the cane heck I even agree with the giving of another object less likely to hurt somebody that would appease the comfort factor of having the cane while the child is being reevaluated. If you dont know what I mean think about walking around work without a shoes on theres not necessarily something wrong with that but youd feel better and in a more level place with slippers on than nothing at all.    The real problem could be lack of providing alternative assistance You remove the cane fine you dont give a  support by a aide or something else thats NOT fine.

Additionally informal practices in real estate and public educational organization allow unequal segregation to continue in many spheres of society.But the black community has problems of its own! Paternal responsibility and abiding by the law is not adequately taught to much of young black America!Um ok sure. But that doesnt make these other systemic issues any less of a problem that we should address.Look once you address your internal issues then we can address these alleged structural issues.Those arent mutually exclusive propositions! We can try to do both at the same time and we are!

You are naive if you think thats how rape victims are generally treated. People also pull what you did claiming I cant have an opinion on this due to personal experience. Sometimes personal experience is relevant to discussion it is ok to be human. And the moniter is for others protection. We dont have a good way to rehabilitate rapists. Hes likely to rape again. I think keeping others from being raped is more important than poor him feeling stigma and having trouble getting a job. Maybe he shouldnt have brutally raped a child.

Science governs our physical life while our soul and thus religion governs our free will and is responsible for the non physical characteristics such as love and honesty which we carry into the next life.For the record Christ was not at the Nicene Counsel nor did He appoint anyone to do so in His place. What I am saying is that nobody should be a Popepriest and nobody should have dictated which books were to be officially sanctioned and which werent. They wereare in fact a historical records and testimonials by the Apostles and thus each iswas a valid account of what happened at the time of Christ. To think that a man could come along and alter that dialogtestimonial some  odd years later is just appalling. To think many Christians have no clue this happened is even more appalling. Thankfully the desert is returning these records to us and before long we will have an even more accurate account of the Revelation of Christ. ,nottheonion,cnyyyae,2,t5_2qnts

Doctors wouldnt need to charge money because they would be fairly compensated by their patients without being asked. Food vendors wouldnt need to charge money for food because hey we all love each other right? The point that Im making is that its ok to do something because you fear retribution. Thats the whole point of every law the fear of legitimate use of force. The idea that fear precludes people from kindness is...insane. The idea that religious people actively harm others is less so but still...Thats the responsive argument. If you arent doing something to be altruistic then youre going to harm someone in the future. Why? Why is that the case? Most JW dont harm others in fact they go out of their way to be nice to others. They believe that their outward appearance and actions stand as a measure of their lifestyle. Ive yet to meet an unkind JW. The only real harm they conduct is when one of their own betrays them and their societys rules. Which while harsh is anthropologically consistent with like all societies. We do the same thing here when you commit treason except we execute you. The scale is different.

2955696,0,t3_2u0d5b,Without even reading this comment thread I can tell you right now that there is a lot of misunderstanding about what a trademark is going on here because reddit reads trademark and thinks patentcopyright.You can trademark anything.  It is not a patent for words.  It does not automatically prevent anyone else from using them.  There are different strengths of trademarks and how strong a trademark is for enforcement purposes depends largely on how generic it is.  Apple has trademarked Apple.  It does not mean that you can no longer use the word Apple without paying.  It does not mean you cannot use the word Apple in a business name.  It does mean that if you make a computerphonemusic distribution company you might have difficulty calling it Apple.  This does not mean TS is the only one who can use the phrase in music.  It does mean that if a similar artist starts using the phrase or if clothing companies try to market shirts with the phrase towards her fans she can make them stop.  Trademarks only apply when there can be some confusion or exploitation in the minds of consumers.  They are the least restrictive of the IP law trio of trademarkcopyrightpatent.Almost everything a popular figure does that could be marketable is trademarked as much to prevent knockoffs from making her look trashy as to actually exploit the mark themselves.,nottheonion,co42sdi,37,t5_2qnts

He stole my ideas isnt using the word in the same way as he stole my bike. You still have your ideas. Theres no way to give ideas back. You cant say pirates steal movies in the same sense that thieves steal bikes because the movies dont go anywhere. Youre only using theft as a sloppy shorthand for a vague sense of lost potential.

Those were majority of the toys I played with I still have all of them in boxes somewhere. I know this has to suck for the older fans except my dad Hes  and enjoyed the prequels. Hes still a kid at heart but damn.. Those toys were great. Beyond great from my standpoint it was before a lot of them became really cheesy and there was a HUGE variety. Not just the prequel toys though they made SOOO many awesome action figures for the old films. One of my favorite was a Darth Vader that had the top of his helmet and mask come off like how Luke took it off him in episode  and has a lot of detail on the face. I was also lucky to have had a dad that also loved Star Wars so he probably loved seeing me have such an amazing time with the whole series as a child. There was nothing I loved more than Star Wars as a kid.All of this makes sense though they made A LOT of toys for even the smallest characters. Remember those bug eye space politic fuckers? There were toys for those. I still have a few booklets that showed a lot of them right after Episode III came out. As much as I would have like to have felt the original Star Wars experience because older fans have said the kids today or at least around my age and younger are missing out I was born at just the right time where I believe you guys were missing out.

There are Christian groups in the US that believe God made women subservient though they largely avoid that word to their fathers and husbands and they love talking about how much joy they get from being wives and mothers and how sorry they feel for all those poor women who work vote communicate with their husbands go to college and have hobbies outside the home. But the majority of them rarely set foot outside their home or church and they were basically taught that their father and then their husband is god. They dont know any different. Theyve been taught since birth that the only things women should do are cook clean have babies and obey men.Many women who grew up this way and had the opportunity to go to college or otherwise be exposed to the outside world have left that environment and condemn it as essentially brainwashing.

3021534,0,t1_cob4k5w,gtSuppose its the kind of white supremacist who simply believes academically that his ethnicity makes him an allaround superior being? He doesnt lynch anybody hes just an asshole. For whatever reason you know hes an asshole. Well being an asshole is not a protected class either. You can kick someone out of your bakery for being an asshole.gtMaybe because he ordered a Swastika cake....and this is also a different situation. If white supremacists were a protected class I would be legally obligated to do business with them  to sell them a cake  but I still could not be compelled to write a message or include a design I found offensive. If I offered a workaround  say selling them a blank cake and the supplies to ice it however they wished  that would be a different matter.The important reason why we have protected classes is that there have been concerted and widespread efforts to discriminate against members of those classes. Youre not allowed to refuse to do business with black people because there were a lot of people discriminating against them in the past and those restrictions were necessary to protect them from bigotry.There has been no such widespread campaign to persecute anyone and everyone who holds white supremacist beliefs.gtgtHow the hell is forcing church attendance relevant to any of the above? Its a completely different situation.gtIts actually an identical situation. Its a law compelling you to participate in a situation you would rather not. Youve already said you would prefer to keep your right to refuse service to a racist asshole so why does that right only exist when its being used to avoid people you want to avoid?If I am in a business there are legal restrictions on my ability to discriminate against wouldbe customers. That has nothing whatsoever to do with a hypothetical situation requiring me to attend a church unless I were somehow in the business of filling pews. Its not a comparable situation.gt edit By the way a thoughtcrime law is a law that criminalizes intent or motivation rather than the act itself. This is what hate crimes are. Assault is already a crime. Making it extra illegal to assault someone while also thinking a certain way is exactly thoughtcrime.No it really isnt. We have always taken intent into account when prosecuting crime thats why selfdefense is a valid legal defense. Thats why crimes of passion are handled differently from premeditated crimes.Any action that can be designated a hate crime was already a crime. If you hate black people but dont commit an act of violence against them you havent done anything illegal. Therefore no its not thoughtcrime.Hate speech regulation might be construed as thoughtcrime but at least in the United States we have no such restrictions as the First Amendment serves as a bulwark against them.,nottheonion,cob6gt5,1,t5_2qnts

Im willing to bet you have no such arrogance as to explain it.Measles is a nonfatal almost  survivable virus that for hundreds of thousands of years parents deliberately infected their children with to provide lifetime inoculation.The measles vaccine that you have to pay for is less effective even than condoms at preventing pregnancy yet has almost virtually no studies proving that it doesnt cause autism.The measles vaccine that we know today is FAR different than the original measles vaccine which was highly effective and caused virtually no sideeffects but wasnt very profitable due to spoiling. BigPharma greed has introduced other ingredients to that vaccine in order to boost profits mainly ingredients that serve as preservatives. These other ingredients have been altered recently.Explain.Finally no doctors are studying ways to prevent measles encaphalitis because they horridly believe that everyone should be FORCED AGAINST THEIR WILL to get a measles vaccine despite the lack of any studies demonstrating the safety of modern measles vaccines because if you try to study the saftey of measles vaccines youll be outed as an antivaxxer by a bunch of fucking antiscience deniers otherwise known in the vernacular as faggots.,nottheonion,cohqebe,-12,t5_2qnts

Yes if it werent for the banks it wouldnt have happened. But if people had made better choices they wouldnt be in the financial shithouse. Do you get what Im trying to say here? The banks did not force anyone to get a loan. They gave loans that they knew couldnt be payed back and they probably didnt do all they should have to prevent that but they didnt force anyone. People made their own decisions its as simple as that. I understand that it was a terrible situation and that those people probably needed that money but that does not change the fact that they were the ones who made the choice. Therefore theyve got themselves to blame.,nottheonion,cohvan7,1,t5_2qnts

3184292,0,t1_corrq3i,This is an incredible abuse of power and absolutely evil. However to answer your question. ICU RNs have a large amount of autonomy in addition when an MD orders a medication i.e lopressor a drug that can lower blood pressure heshe may write for mg IV but it comes in a mg vial. We pull all of our medication independently and administered everything independently and do the math on it independently that is in RN scope of practice. Its not the MDs job to check the work. MDs have very little patient contact the vast majority of their time is spent diagnosing and creating a treatment plan. It is the RNs responsibility to monitor the patient note changes and administered the appropriate medication that is often written prn. Example being if I call an MD and state I have a patient with a SBP of  unresponsive to fluid boluses  heshe might say start neo at mcghr. The MD then assumes it is done correctly cause heshe should. This isnt a break down in a system this is one evil person who abused his power to be a murder. Source ICU RN,nottheonion,cos1vev,4,t5_2qnts

When we were done so were they and Id help them out with whatever they needed the one would drive me and my cousins home.I think there are more good cops than bad but it may be that thats just my area. Or that your area has a higher number of bad cops. Similarly our football players werent really as a whole stupid cruel or jerks. But our coach also had something to do with that he was VERY big on sportsmanship and once cut a student who probably was the best player our school had in years because he was a bully. He got a warning when he didnt stop he was cut and not allowed to try out again. The school board had kittens over it but they didnt dare mess with Coach.In schools where football is king our school was big in football but as said the coach did not take shit. I cant see where bitterness would bloom. At my middle schooldifferent school district football players were fucking royalty. They could do no wrong. Had I stayed in a school like that I might not be willing to think of football players as anything but jerks. One nearly raped me. I was expelled for among other reasons going to the police.My family are into football probably one out of every two boys and so far six girls have played either in middle school or high school. So Ive been well exposed. Ive seen the assholes and Ive seen the decent kids who are in it for a chance at college no one in our family could go without scholarships or because they love the game. Ive also seen the kid who got such severe brain damage from a tackle that he now has the mental capacity of a  year old. He was really smart before his injury. Sports is great for some people. Not for me Im terrible at them. But for some cousins it was the best years of their lives for others it was how they got to have good lives. And I cant say thats a bad thing.

3375013,0,t1_cpcovhb,Oh boy Im back in my sociology class!  Too bad I just went on Spring Break today this wouldve provided an excellent discussion this morning.As a man I would feel a lot safer and I would appreciate the consideration of being given an opt out option. Im  and living in NorthEastern US. Cost of living is expensive in this general area Im unemployed and Im a student. These are TERRIBLE circumstances to be given an ultimatum such as either being a father being a deadbeat dad being a father who puts their kid up for adoption possibly never seeing them again or being the father of a dead kid. I am equally scared of failing as a father in those respects as I am raising a child in a shitty environment that would be beyond my control. Thats why I dont even want to bring a child into this world voluntarily. Though these are the reasons why I dont have unprotected sex unless I KNOW for. a fact that my partner is on some form of birth control as you said accidents do happen. I do believe men should be given the choice to opt out if they are financiallymentallyemotionallyphysically unstable. There should be carefully reviewed cases of both parties interests and wants provided by the court systems that way there wont be so many men taking advantage of the system which mind you WILL happen.If societys values are consistent and there is no sexist doublestandard for men being able to opt out or vote to abort with ease then you can expect a bit of pushback from the religiousprolife crowds. We can handle that though the brave women who exercise their right to abort do it every day. That said I see no reason why our society cant allow it its another right that will have to be acknowledged amp amended.In absolutely agree with your standards for equallysplit abortion costs as it takes two to tango. If you were both irresponsible and as a result became parents you fucked up. Own up to it. Pay your share. If you were responsible and an accident still happened treat it like it is an accident. They happen and they usually cost money. Over and done with.,nottheonion,cpcz5ss,1,t5_2qnts

Ive heard many stories about people of different races visiting China being victims of casual racism purely because the locals dont know its wrong. The reasons for moving to Africa is because a lot of the countries are developing and its generally easy to set up shop.

As you point out the article states that abortion rights activists are seeking to ... put a positive spin on abortion.  It doesnt say that the operators of this clinic are seeking to put a positive spin on abortion.  Read closely  the author of this article chooses her words carefully because she cannot ascribe thoughtspositionssentiments to the clinic owners that they dont actually admit to having.  Dont confuse the authors views with the views of the Carafem owners.My guess is if you asked the Carafem owners directly are you trying to put a positive spin on abortion? they would answer no.  But mine is only a guess.gt It should not be destigmatized ...As long as women and men retain parental instincts abortion wont be destigmatized.  And so long as this remains a hot social issue abortion wont be destigmatized.  So long as this debate continues and there are no signs of it ending soon there will always be a loud voice in society describing abortion as worthy of disgrace or disapproval per Googles definition.  The stigma of abortion should rightfully weigh on a womans conscience when she is deciding whether or not to get an abortion.  BUT  once she has made the decision to terminate her pregnancy its time for the prolife campaign to lay off.

3621102,0,t1_cq4zknb,Still a few mistakes here but were getting closer.  First its not your religious bullshit.  Im an atheist who fully supports LGBT.  The question here is not do gays deserve equal rights and treatment  of course they do.  The question is to what extent are we going to force people to treat gays the way we want them to.  I dont like it when business owners are mean to customers either but Im not so despotic and tyrannical that I would legislate that as such.But the crux of your argument is that the religious defenses are a smokescreen.  You havent actually defended this point at all or made at any argument except for retyping it in caps.  Maybe you want to give it another shot?  Ill again repeat my argument since you didnt seem to catch it.  The old testament says that homosexuality is an abomination.  So there are some jews and christians who may personally be totally cool with gays and have no personal bigotry at all but they adhere to the teachings of the old testament.Maybe an analogy will help you grasp this point  imagine that I am a police officer.  Personally I think marijuana should be legal but I still arrest people for smoking pot because I also believe in the law.  If it wasnt clear to you the distinction is between personal beliefs on marijuana and homosexuality being overridden by a belief in power that takes precedence the law or gods will.Religious belief is very different from personal bigotry and you only hurt gays when you claim otherwise.

And even if even if we assume that he does in fact deserve that colossal pay hike over his employees does he realistically need that much money? Wouldnt that money be better spread out to people who will actually use it as opposed to stashing it away?Perhaps and Im going to wax philosophic here for a moment our job as a society isnt to reward greed and selfaggrandizing but rather to help raise the median standard of living for all citizens in our society. Perhaps our job as a society is to ensure the continued care and support of our species in spite of our individualistic animal tendencies. Perhaps our job as a society is to embrace our evolution and rise above the eat or be eaten brutality of nature.In short perhaps our job as a society is to step forward as human rather than step back as ape.But what do I know?

Then you might want to SERIOUSLY reassess if you think you should be a teacher.   percent of teaching is the parents you get  percent of teaching is classroom control and about  percent of teaching is actually going through the content. Im pretty sure they dont tell you that in college.  I hope you have student teaching or a practicum before your last semester.  It is...eye opening.  Look for a placement in a district you are likely to work in. DO NOT take a placement in the burbs with high incomes and parents that care about their kids. That isnt where firstyear teachers work. They work in public schools in the shitty part of town. Take a placement there and a get a good long drink of reality. If your kids think you can get railroaded  and honey you sound like youve got the spine of a wet paper bag  youre going to last about two years in education because you cant control your classroom. If a teacher cant keep kids under control or at least have an effective way to get rid of the kids who are causing problems send them in the hall to office detention suspension etc. etc. etc. then the other  percent of the class wont learn dick all year other than how to bully each other and their woe begotten teacher. ,nottheonion,cqd7zlg,15,t5_2qnts

BUT you end up with laws like this one in Kansas that hold classroom teachers liable legally for basically offending a student and you see part of the underlying problem. We also as a larger culture need to respect our teachers and realize the importance of educators. Youll see throughout this thread people that believe teachers are overpaid get too much time off and have ZERO idea what is required of educators in the classroom and outside the classroom  and they dont believe their childrens most important influencers should be paid like rockstars.  They think teachers should be paid as teenage babysitters and they dont actually work.

3716048,0,t1_cqfuise,gt Scrap the greens That was one of my first thoughts. For the price paid for each of those greens other foods could be substituted. You mentioned peanut butter. Good choice. The bread  I can get a pound of bread for  cents at walmart. Ramen   cents  and it tastes real good. The fresh greens could also be switched out for frozen vegetables. Kroger near me sells all kinds of frozen veggies for a dollar a bag. Bananas are another cheap nutritious choice. What are they   cents a pound? Yeah bad choices for a budget she made. Looks like she set out to get ingredients to make some vegetarian tacos for dinner and forgot that shed have to make the  dollars last for a week.Also I wonder what store shes shopping at. I hope she didnt take her food stamp budget shopping to a trendy upscale hipster organic food market. What I know is that in my area and many others WalMart has the best prices on just about any food items. Lots of people have a moral issue with Walmart but on  a week you cant be picky. Also some of the stores have good weekly deals and shopping has to be done based on whats on sale rather than what you want.Oatmeal is another good choice you mentioned and I think Im going to make a bowl of oatmeal right now....,nottheonion,cqfutm1,2,t5_2qnts

3763397,0,t1_cqku2k4,Um what? I live in the US. Believing all Muslims are terrorists is not the same as simply disliking Muslims and banning them. You are exaggerating.Also these religions are NOT the same. Do you actually know anything about Islam? Its fundamentally different from Christianity and Judaism and is more comparable to Mormonism. Incidentally a religion liberals have no problem constantly shitting on. Can you tell me why that is? There is absolutely a moral high ground that Christians have. For starters their founder wasnt a genocidal warlord rapist and child molester. Oh and you conveniently ignore the part where Judaism and Christianity have already gone through reform and have been utterly neutered.People with attitudes like you are part of the problem. Shielding Islam because youre afraid of looking like a racist going as far as saying theres no difference between Islam and other religions. Its ludicrous.

3780390,0,t1_cqn5t4o,Basically the syrup producers voted to create a board that would help to stabilize the maple syrup prices after a disastrous year in  when they produced WAY too much syrup and the price dropped to nothing. A bunch of buyers bought a lot of syrup and stockpiled at that low price and then for a few years afterwards the producers had a hard time making money.So they now have a control board that helps them to control the market to prevent that from happening. The prices have stabilized and thats good but the board is starting to behave like a cartel.Some of the complaints against the board are a bit silly  of course you have to pay such an organization somehow and I dont think  cents per pound sold is a terrible price especially when the price of maple syrup is hovering above  per pound. On the other hand there are some very legit complaints  the producers get paid PAINFULLY slowly by the board. Its really unacceptable. Theres one guy in the article who says the board owes him over  for syrup sold back in . Its ridiculous that he hasnt been paid and in response hes moved some of his operation into the states where the market is freer and he gets paid directly from buyers immediately. The rebels are people who are selling syrup illegally outside of the monopoly of the board. The board is naturally upset at this because its preventing them from getting their  cent cut. However I have a hard time blaming the producers for going around the board because there are few faster ways to make people rebel against an organization like that than to refuse to pay them on time which is exactly what the board appears to be doing.,nottheonion,cqn6x51,7,t5_2qnts

Lets assume the answer is no and that we have no government and no insurance companies. The question remains who pays? If you dont somebody else does. No government or insurance industry required.Why would we assume that there are no insurance companies?  Its true that others would eat the cost.  Thats what happens when you pay into an insurance pool.  Its an investment and like all investments there is always risk of loss.gtAre you comfortable with the idea of having a health care system that is efficient yet inaccessible to much of the population?Not at all.gtAlso can you tell me where I can find a free market healthcare system so I can independently verify that it is more efficient than other systems? Does efficiency include a metric that accounts for accessibility?Yes and yes. The U.S. up until the early s had a relatively free market healthcare system.  It wast totally free market but it was close.  It was by far the most efficient healthcare system and was the envy of the world.  It had the highest quality care still does the lowest costs and the most accessibility. Health insurance served its actual function  measuring risk  and was only necessary for things like major surgeries.  Otherwise almost everything could be paid for out of pocket doctor visits drugs etc. The idea that people who couldnt afford to pay were turned away is nothing but statist propaganda.  Today Britain has the best healthcare system in the world.  But even they are spending about x the amount of money per capita inflation adjusted on healthcare compared to what the U.S. was spending in  and they still dont have the highest quality Technology and quality of care that the U.S. does.  Like I said inefficient.gtIf that is what you got from Ive addressed it repeatedly in this thread then I dont know what else can be done here aside from repeating myself which is something Im absolutely tired of doing.

With social media people can take justice into their own hands and spread their own stories. The mistrust in official forms of media even professional news reporters and editors have been revealed to twist the facts and leave out crucial information in order to get people to think in a certain way and blame the wrong person. Its probably no wonder people are far more likely to believe a story that came from a friend or relative. The fear of pedophiles is unfortunately justified when you hear of stories of children being targeted or abducted in broad daylight. Suddenly the entire public of anonymous people are out to steal your children even the smallest kind of interaction is cause for fear. The freedom people have to use social media to spread their own propaganda it is particularly effective when it taps into the fears of others. Official media presenters get to chose how they tell a story but its equally destructive when it comes from the person involved youre pretty much guaranteed to get a onesided story.Thats just what came to my mind when reading this story theres other things as well but I would just be rambling on at this point.,nottheonion,cr6fi8t,3,t5_2qnts

You are allowed to take slaves as your property. Your slaves children are your slaves and you can pass your slaves down to your children. There were different rules for Isrealites though. For them it was more like indentured servitude but with a loophole. If you gave your slave a wife and kids you got to keep his family once his term was up. But if the slave didnt want to leave his family then he could stay and be your slave forever. I didnt let the facts get in the way. The facts support my argument.

Additionally a number of accidents involving the cars were not tallied as the Google Cars were not at fault. This is fair but then the statistics for humans need to be adjusted to make a fair comparison.So with these in mind Id bet that a typical nonimpaired human driving in clear weather would statistically be expected to exceed  million miles without any atfault accidents.

4093521,0,t1_crmriy6,I dont think the abolishment of religion will achieve much if anything. People arent necessarily compelled by religious doctrine and often subscribe to a religion or for that matter any belief personal or otherwise because it justifies their preexisting behaviour. A lot of nonreligious belief systems which can influence a persons behaviour and livelihood as much as any religion can have had varying degrees of success passing themselves off as a science as well such as various forms of Quantum Woo or depending on who you talk to the singularity and libertarianism among many others. To make matters worse theres tentative evidence that humans religious or not evolved reason as a tool for winning arguments rather than as a tool for finding the truth. And people neednt be religious to have cognitive biases either in fact from what Ive gathered all humans are wired with cognitive biases. On top of all of that religion offers people a sense of community that the scientific method itself is no replacement for and although likely erroneous religion provides answers to questions that the scientific method has been unable to answer and may never be capable of answering.Dont get me wrong Im not defending religion.

Youre either ok with the laws that you are instituting or youre not. If youre not. Then why the fuck is it the law? If it was perfectly legal for someone to walk down the street with a badger duct taped to their leg yet every time you did it the police would stop you to ask why you had a badger strapped to your leg wouldnt it seem like a complete waste of time for everyone? Im completely against the idea of allowing everyone to be armed as a general rule. I live in the UK and I cant imagine walking through a town centre and seeing someone with an AR strapped over their shoulder. Its not a normal situation. However. It seems that everyone in the states wants this tune the norm until it edges over into the slightly uncomfortable realm of being abbot too real.

They have slightly differing genetic traits just as someone from Germany has slightly differing traits from somebody from Kenya. But thats the thing the differences are incredibly slight. I mean INCREDIBLY slight to the point where from a biologists perspective theres no appreciable difference. We latch on to the obvious physical differences skin color hair consistency etc. But these are just the most noticeable traits which are dictated by incredibly slight genetic variances.

Except in this case its an empty lot.  No door.  So a notice would have been mailed to the owner of records.Step  Citation issued.  At this point theres a fine and you still have to fix it.  The citation would have been mailed to the owner of record since again its an empty lot.Step  Summons.  The citation wasnt paid and the issue wasnt fixed.  She was likely summoned to the court for failure to pay the citation within the allotted time probably  days.  The summons should have been delivered by a sheriff to the owner of record or more likely by certified mail.Step  Warrant.  She still hasnt taken care of the mowing.  She still hasnt paid the citation.  And now she blew off court.  What else are they supposed to do?  The proper step here is to issue a warrant and bring her in.  But its not really dangerous or even criminal so theyre not going to put too much effort into it.So really its no different than someone getting a warrant for unpaid speeding tickets.  The fact that the original citation was for a nuisance property doesnt really have anything to do with it except as a fineable offense.The failure here is that she the owner of record did not get the notifications.

Simply because other segments of latin america arent represented as much. My exposure to this topic is very broad. Ive traveled to Brazil Argentina Ecuador and Mexico. There Ive seen first hand the racial mixture of the Americas. A region you cannot at all call racially homogenous. It is in effect a mixture of mixed ethnicity pure first nation people and the pure descendants of European colonials.

I felt the same way but then I think look at all these polticians and there are literally millions of them local state federal global. All these people think they are good enough to govern others. That their ideas are the best ideas for the populace so who is someone else to say their ideas arent. People like to talk about a perfect form of government. This ones broke that ones broke. This type of government has a bad name because of some association with bad historical events but there is no perfect government. A government where people are happy enough to not do anything to change their government seems to be good enough. Youd get more things done with a dictatorship than any other form of government the problem is who you have up there as dictator and history doesnt care about the uneventful dictators. As for people invading against an actual military force or their own government. Its not actually happening. Citizens will never have the capability technology or organization of a national military but progun arguments require some sort of delusion to push the cause. ,nottheonion,csjc0ts,1,t5_2qnts

4428717,1,t3_3brifa,With respect bad mouthing christians as a whole is stupid. So many redditors never cease to amaze me at how bigoted they can be. Most Christians in fact all of the ones that I personally know do not disdain gays. I dont view it as a sin nor do many others. But you who are so quick to spout hate at Christians fail to acknowledge how most Christians have been raised. They are taught the traditional definition of marriage. That in turn becomes THEIR belief.   And just as many desire gay marriage there are those who do not. Does that make them evil. No. And for those of you that think it does then I really pity you for all the hatred that you perpetuate. To view Christianity as a whole as gayhating or whatever is so absurd. If someone wants to believe in traditional marriage...let them. Most Christians are not out there with pitchforks trying to destroys gay marriage...that falls to a select few who I will agree are idiots themselves. So how about we show a little bit more respect for people in general. Im a Christian...gay marriage is not an abomination its not wrong. Its not about gayhating. Its about them protecting what they have been raised to believe. It is their belief and they are free to believe whatever they want. So every time you talk bad about a Christian you might just want to think about if you are making the world a better place or not. Even if you do think Christians are full of hatred you cannot fight hatred with hatred. In conclusion grow up reddit.,nottheonion,csoxhp7,4,t5_2qnts

4441070,0,t1_csq771a,This isnt a question of power in the sense that youre describing it. The police should not be allowed to seize property in this manner as a matter of constitutional principal. Unfortunately the Supreme Court has been becoming more politically polarized along with the rest of society and back in the s issued one of its more blatantly stupid rulings on a case of Civil Asset Forfeiture...The majority ruling on the issue based its decision to accept the practice as constitutional on the specious reasoning that  because civil forfeiture laws were on the books when the Constitution was drafted the Framers must have been ok with it and intended it to be allowed.  Which proves that even really smart people can delude themselves into believing really stupid things as long as those stupid things support a consistent mental narrative of reality...In this case there were two narratives being maintained by the conservative majorityThe first narrative is that we are obliged to follow a strict constructionist approach to evaluating constitutional law...Which is ridiculous because there was never complete consensus among the writers of the constitution about anything...And because unless you can point to extremely specific and well documented statements made by the founders youre relying on your own interpretation of whatever information you choose to decide for yourself what they actually believed.  Which means you can simply choose to believe that the framers intentions align with your own biases and desires...Which means that youre just making shit up as you go anyway. And the second is that the law should always favor and defer to the people involved in enforcement of the laws...Rehnquist and the other  who agreed with him were of the law and order stripe of conservative and had a strong tendency to rule in favor of giving authority and deference to local authorities rather than constrain their power. Some specific information about the case is avaliable in this Forbes articleBut the bottom line here is that we need to either legislatively eliminate asset forfeiture by getting both state and federal legislative bodies to rewrite the laws possible at the federal level but unlikely to be consistently applied at the state level...Or we need another case to come along that can be used to challenge the constitutionality of civil forfeiture in a way that lower courts cant use the current shitty case law provided by the Bennis v. Michigan decision to dismiss it.  Then it can go back to the Supreme Court for what will hopefully be a more rational interpretation.,nottheonion,csqhc3n,1,t5_2qnts

4474849,0,t3_3cbf9h,My parents did  times worse things than send my ass to fend for myself in a tent outside. That wouldve bern a dam blessing if they did that. I get a whole week to myself away from my evil parents??? Are you kidding me? That sounds amazzzinggg. Plus im sure camping is loads of fun. My dad used to beat me everyday throw me down flights of stairs pick me up over his head and slam me on the floor and then jump on my back for not being perfect. I would be doing my homework in my room and he would call me because he always called me when he needed something. For example the tv remote that was sitting a few inches from his hand. I would have to run to him to put it in his hand. When i was extremely young sometimes i just wouldnt hear him call me the first time and he would beat me for hours for not running to him as soon as he called me. However after some time i developed really good ears for hearing his voice. It actually became a problem because i would randomly hear my dad call me when in reality he really did not. My dad made me eat any food i dropped on the floor. I was never allowed to leave the kitchen table until all my food was consumed. Sometimes it could take me up to  hours to consume what he had given me. Everyday when i finished my homework it had to pass inspection from my dad. If any question was answered wrong i would be beaten and made to go redo it. My parents never showed me the internet or tv and even if they did internet was slower and i wouldnt have known to use it. So it was likely that i could get the same problem wrong multiple times which would lead to hours and hours of continuous beatings. I was beat multiple times everyday for about  years. Hell i still hang out with my dad. Im with him right now on vacation. If i dont talk to him everyday hell get mad. But now that im  ive gotten as close to perfect as i can be. I can tell when my dad is about to get mad and basically just learned what to do. Never sit down never rest be the first one awake make everyone breakfast before they wake clean the house hold the broom correctly. Basically if I find myself standing still for even  second without knowing what else to do he will get mad so just be perfect.

4519849,0,t3_3cxj8o,I thought Simon Says was a bullshit game as a kid and its much bigger bullshit as a law. I understand that we need to address sexual assult but this doesnt effectively do that it really only hurts the people who are consent to sex by legally denying the magic of spontaneity. Its like copyright protection it doesnt actually stop pirates who find ways to work around it it just inconveniences and sometimes wrongfully punishes the honest user.  gt Bregman said the new law will help eliminate but she didnt say no as a response to rape allegations and over time change the conversations people have about sex.    Part of me suspects that at least some writerssupporters of these laws are hoping that the conversation will change to well obviously we should just not hook up at all ever and save it for marriage.   This kind of reasoning will eventually lead to legally requiring the filming and filing of all sex acts so that consent can be verified.,nottheonion,ct0db92,3,t5_2qnts
4520013,0,t1_ct0d8o4,The main purpose of these laws is that if some one is passedout drunk or otherwise incapacitated they cannot give consent so any sex with a person in that state should be sexual assault.

4530297,0,t3_3d3pj3,In all seriousness this creeps me the fuck out. When I was in middlehigh school I was dating a guy who was active in the AOH and around St Paddys day they would go to all the different parades in our area to march. With out fail at each parade my then SO would complain of older women trying to reach up his kilt. Remember that we are school age so we are both sub .  I personally witnessed women who were old enough to be our mothers grab the hem of his kilt and flick it up to expose him he wore boxer briefs thankfully and out right reach their hands up and under to pinch and cop a feel. The brigade would be standing in a group waiting to march and they would walk right up and do it then become pissy when a guy would tell them to fuck off.  The worst I saw was a lady walk out into the parade formation as it was marching by and force her hand up the front of my  year old boyfriends kilt. He had to physically remove a  year old womans hand from his junk in front of a couple hundred people.  The lady thanked him for being a good sport.What. The. Fuck. If  year old men were reaching up the skirts of  year old girls it would be pandemonium. No one would be laughing ans the phrase sexual predator would get thrown around. But when a woman does the same its all in good fun no matter how many times the kid in question has asked her to stop sexually assaulting him....,nottheonion,ct1oh3o,343,t5_2qnts

We care for our employees as much as we care for our customers. We want to make sure everyone feels safe here.No I wouldnt say the same thing. There is a double standard in our culture where men groping women is seen as a crime and the reverse as a joke or as something to be dismissed. Its seen as highly impractical as a business to have your customers arrested. That could have been a marketing disaster.In this case they can come across as progressive while still achieving their original marketing goal of coming across as traditionally Scottish. Now that the message has come through not to grope the staff ifwhen they reintroduce the kilts they can start pushing back on the gropers.But while I do think the greater value in this situation was in standing pat and making cutefunny signs that leave no doubt that violators will be prosecuted I cant really fault the establishment for going with the less risky option.,nottheonion,ct1q76g,-1,t5_2qnts

There are separate ideological groups that call themselves feminists that dont agree with each other on what feminism is. Unfortunately none of the groups calling themselves feminists are willing to give up that title for something else for their particular ideological set. So group A calling themselves feminists wants everybody to be equal and safe from discrimination and group B wants to harm men or kill trans women or something awful and also call themselves feminists. Then comes the No True Scotsman arguments where feminism is concerned and people bicker over whether feminists are good or evil or whatever and a whole divisive mess and neither women nor men gain any equality because semantics get argued about instead.   ,nottheonion,ct1whvr,4,t5_2qnts

This is a question with an answer. I can ask What do you think the difference between eating in and eating out is?See how dumb that sounds.That is not asking anything of substance.gtSomeone recently got jailed for raising his mice in terrible conditions. Pets.These are pets. If I am cruel to my domestic miceI can go to jail.If I am cruel to a field mouse......nothing wrong.Another prime example of why animal cruelty laws are bullshit.gtIts not about the cuteness factor and if you honestly cant answer this yourself you need to reevaluate your moral compassIt is  morally ok for a girl to see a spider on the deck and freak out and smash it to death with a shoe and then have the baby spiders scatter out and she then smashes them to death and afterwards smiles and says YEAH GOT IT!This is ok but doing to to cute ducks is wrong.Hypocritical bullshit. If a man runs over a bunch of cute ducklings in a fit of rage...wow he has awful and mentally ill.In the EXACT set of circumstances the man sees a mother rat with  rat babies and runs them over we say Yeah you got those nasty fuckers!!!Hypocritical bullshit. People kill animals directly or indirectly ALL THE FUCKING TIME.You are  of people on here are meat eaters.You will go out and buy a nice steak and eat it and enjoy the fuck out of it.Ever been in a bad mood Maybe angry like this guy in question and use food as a release?Of course you have.So you can go out and enjoy eating the flesh of an animal but if you kill the animal that is cruel.What intellectual dishonesty.It is cruel to kill the animal and enjoy it but it is  ok if you make somebody else kill it and enjoy eating it afterwards.Utter bullshit.Animal Cruelty legislation is moronic illogical nonsensical contradictory and is purely passed as emotionally based garbage to please intellectually weak see yourself people who cannot reconcile reality with visceral reactions.,nottheonion,cti3u6e,0,t5_2qnts

From what I read it only claims that hypercholesterolemic people should restrict butter consumption whereas the normocholesterolemic population is fine with having moderate butter intake. Also I dont think a subjects diet really matters all that much in this case. Studies prefer to use healthy subjects sure but that just makes it easier to detect changes in them. This means that even if it is expanded to the population we should expect to see similar differences assuming that the guidelines of the study are followed. Will it always be detectable? Im not sure but we can see the differences according to this one. I doubt that this will be the end of the study as corporations are vastly interested in the matter.

I was absolutely stunned when Obama was voted into office. I was of the mind like many people he simply didnt have the experience necessary to run a country. Considering what he has accomplished compared to his other more experienced  predecessors Id say I was right. Theres a lot of common sense politics in the Clinton administration that could benefit our country.Hillary isnt trying to pander shes trying to get things done in the most practical way possible. She doesnt have time to be bothered by the faction of our country cry facing about how God hates gays and abortions. We should appreciate that considering its not what we need to be worried about right now.

4996744,0,t1_cuo9ehj,Actually thats not the case with twins or esepcially triplets. To ELI the female body when pregnant essentially has a weight limit before it begins to go into labor. In a normal single child pregnancy this weight limit usually coincides with when the baby is supposed to born.But with twins and triplets even if they are smaller than a single baby add up to exceed that weight sooner than a single child. So going to  months with triplets isnt impossible but statistically unlikely to the point it might as well be. ,nottheonion,cuoalic,163,t5_2qnts

5033821,0,t1_cusolpx,gtA war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the Indian race becomes extinct.  California Governor Peter H. Burnett January Quoting out of context is fun! Heres some more context on the quote bolded for what you included but rest you left off even the must be expected bitgtThe white man to whom time is money and who labors hard all day to create the comforts of life cannot sit up all night to watch his property and after being robbed a few times he becomes desperate and resolves upon a war of extermination. This is the common feeling of our people who have lived upon the Indian frontier. The two races are kept asunder by so many causes and having no ties of marriage or consanguinity to unite them they must ever remain at enmity. That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected. While we cannot anticipate this result but with painful regret the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power or wisdom of man to avert. Situated as California is we must expect a long continued and harassing irregular warfare with the Indians upon our borders and along the immigrant routes leading to the States Although few in numbers and unskilled in the use of fire arms they seem to understand all the advantages of their position and they consequently resort to that predatory warfare most distressing to us and secure to them. They readily flee before every considerable force called out to meet them and retire to haunts in the mountains where it is vain for us to pursue. As time is to them of no value they can readily content themselves to lie in wait for weeks at secure points ready to attack small parties of miners remote from assistance. From their irregular mode of warfare and the features of the country in which they wage it there is reason to believe that they will prove far more formidable than is generally supposed and that in the end we shall lose man for man in our encounters with them.For the sake of argument kinda sounds like selfdefense to me and not genocide. Theyre trying to kill us while we want peace so we have no choice but to fight back until they stop.

On the engineering side we do know how to make longer lasting roads since the same people who design vehicular roadways do aviation runways. The issue as always is politics and funding. No taxpayer wants to pay higher taxes to fund the transportation bills needed to improve infrastructure and no politician wants to earn their ire by doing so. The answer is likely somewhere in between better budget management and taxes but either way the money isnt there to adequately replace every roadbridgestructure. So they do what they can when they can and sometimes there is only money for emergency repair work which is a quick fix and not a long term solution. These fixes are much more prone to issues sooner rather than later but its better than leaving the problem for  more years while funding lines up.

5154038,0,t1_cv6s39h,EDIT This unexpectedly turned into a rant sorry!I know Im a bit late to this but I must ask. What are the majority of Iranians views of Americans in general? If you were to ask me the same question Id say Im not really sure theres too many people here to know for certain. But if you ask what my views are I have absolute zero issues with the Iranian people. None. In fact I absolutely adore you guys and would love to hang out. I do not subscribe to the same views as those who seem to be calling for military action against Iran. I shouldnt have to name names. Which to be quite honest is mindboggling. I utterly despise our Americas geopolitical polices and just wish for more people to see that all anyone really wants is to live in peace. Fuck war. Fuck warmongering. Fuck hatemongering. Fuck the powerhungry. Thats the most honest I can put it.To keep it simple we do not want war. No matter what our politicians claim. It is simply not true not even in the slightest sense. The bad news is there are these people we call hardliners mostly older people who seem to want it. These are the same people who grew up indoctrinated with hate for other nationalities Vietnamese Chinese Arab Persians middleeasterners in general and whove never seemed to get to know people outside of their little nationalitycirclejerk. The good news is theyre dying off!II feel the reason there are even still people that hate each other for seemingly no reason is because theyve never connected with others on a more personal level. Ive personally talked extensively with Russians Iranians Jordanians Iraqis Afghanis and others. I dont mean just a hello how are you type of conversation either. I mean over the course of weeks and months. After a while you ultimately build a friendship thats able to break straight through the rhetoric of those in power and see people for what they really are. Not warseekers but peaceseekers. Theres a part of me that truly believes the more we connect personally the less hostility well have against each other. Think about it... Take police for instance. You join the force as a stranger sotospeak. No friends unless you already know people there but well assume you dont just for the sake of argument. After a while you start to build friendships. Those friends will have your back and not give you tickets or rat you out for doing stupid shit. This is called The blue code. Other institutions are the exact same way. You build a brothersisterhood. This can either be beneficial or detrimental in the long run but as far as international relations are concerned this would be beneficial. Basically everybody should have everybodys backs.Ill just stop right here because I think Ive made my point pretty clear by now.,nottheonion,cv795d5,1,t5_2qnts

5161194,0,t1_cv81grt,gtBecause the label has gone from being a designation for people that sexually abuse children or consume child pornography to a scaremonger word that immediately removes anyone tagged with it of nearly any participation in society with or without actual conviction or evidence.Even that wasnt even the original meaning of the word! The original term was of Greek origin and literally meant lover of children. The modern clinical meaning of the word pedophile refers to adults who are sexually attracted to prepubescent children. You can be a pedophile without ever having lay a single finger on a child or consumed any child pornography whatsoever. Pedophilia is a state of mind that causes its sufferers to only experience sexual attraction to children.The term is very often confused with child molester which is never confused for anything other than what it actually means  a person who engages in sex acts with a child. Abhorrent and terrible behavior.You make an excellent point though. Too often people become engaged in an emotional battle rather than a logical one when dealing with issues of this nature. We can quite clearly see the result of this in the outcome of this prosecution  a backwards irrational and nonlogical decision where a person can simultaneously be counted as a child for evidence purposes but also counted as an adult for legal reasons. This happens because people see the world pedophile or child pornography and they shut down and process thinking and skip straight to prejudgement. Its a serious problem that is hindering the advancement of mental health awareness everywhere.,nottheonion,cv8469j,10,t5_2qnts

Mirror for ctrlfTOKYO Doctors are generally regarded more highly by society than the rest of us and rightly so they bring us into this world sometimes guide us out of it and all the while in between they do their best to keep us alive.But of course doctors are just people too and theyre prone to the same vices and character flaws that anyone might have. For example one MD at a hospital in Aomori Prefecture let his short temper show recently when he punched a patient in the gut during a late night visit.But was the doc just a hothead? Or was this particular patient just so obnoxious that the assault was warranted?Although the details have only recently come to light the incident is reported to have occurred one night in early August this year. At about midnight one evening a male patient entered Mutsu City General Hospital in Aomori complaining of a pain in his elbow. He was promptly examined by a doctor and sent home only to return at amthis time arriving by ambulancetelling the hospital staff he had another pain this time in his abdomen.Again the man was checked over and sent on his way but only two and a half hours later another ambulance drove up to the hospital with the same man sitting in the back.Clearly the sight of this frequent visitor was too much for one doctor to bear however upon noticing the patient sitting in yet another cubicle the doctor stepped in and suddenly struck a blow to the mans midsection. Luckily medical staff were on the scene in record time and quickly determined that there was no injury as a result of the blow.In a subsequent investigation it was found that this patient had been taken to this hospital by ambulance a total of  times since the beginning of . In many cases he was noticeably intoxicated and belligerent with staff. Little wonder the doctor was sick of the sight of him.Readers of the news were supportive of the avenging doctorThats forgivable.No problem! Innocent.Good for him!That doctor is innocent. They should have arrested the patient.It was just a really strong massage.I would have been better if they just went ahead and euthanized the patient.The hospital also sided with the doctor mainly because after the patient sobered up his assailant apologized and acknowledged the error of his ways. As punishment they only gave the doctor a strict talkingto. The hospital also said that staff will be provided with additional guidance to ensure that there should be no violence under any circumstances from here on out.Source Goo News,nottheonion,cvi9o5q,92,t5_2qnts

5267384,0,t1_cvkucsm,Im trans so I have a vested interest in all of this at least at a peripheral level.  I can sort of understand most of BIID sufferers complaints as there was an aspect of that in my gender dysphoria.  Certain parts always felt very alien and I had felt like they shouldnt be there since childhood.  Once I had the GRSGCS procedure I felt a level of bodily integrity that I never before experienced.  No phantom limb issues no regrets just a sense that things were much more right and I could move on with my life.  Its a bit harder to understand with someone wanting to remove a perfectly functioning limb or set of eyes but if it stems from a similar sort of brainbody neural mapping disorder I can see the logic in it.  Prior commenters are probably right in the sense that the ability to make these changes safely and still live out your life due to the modern world is the reason we are seeing such an increase in people with BIID and transgender related diagnosis.  In prior times there werent as many or any safe options for getting treatment to integrate the brainbody mapping.  Maybe someday well figure out how to fix the brains map of the body instead and the options will be available to suit everyone with these issues whether they want to modify brain body or both to match up.,nottheonion,cvkytoj,13,t5_2qnts

The sort of weird attempt to kill an animal before its slaughtered i.e. stun it is not something we apply to human execution why should it be more humane to apply it to animal execution? We kill with honesty and compassion animal rights activists advocate for killing with an act of deceit and trickery. Theres nothing outdated about compassion and honesty its the least you can do for an animal that is being forced to give up its life for you to eat to let it know that you respect it and will be killing it with its honour intact.What is applied to humane methods of both human and animal execution is the desire to end life with the least amount of suffering. This can be done by multiple bullets sedating the victim first before administering lethal drugs guillotine hanging using the long drop whatever.For animals currently one of the best solutions to avoid suffering is stunning them first see death by injection for a human analogue.In my opinion killing with compassion is best done by avoiding as much suffering as possible instead of using less foolproof outdated methods.gt..

So it snowballs. You burn less calories doing the same things since you have less muscle. Which makes you gain weight and want to diet again.The best course of action is just to exercise  hours a day. Even if its just walkinghiking. In fact thats probably the best type of exercise. Just walk everywhere you can. Need groceries? Walk to the store. Wanna see a movie? Walk to the theater.Exercise alone wont fix everything.

They have seen others use the law to get what they want but didnt quite understand how they did it so they focus on the superficial stuff and try to make their own magic.

5346501,0,t1_cvv2je9,Theres a difference between judges interpretation of the law and disregard for the letter of the law.  Youre talking about the former I was referring to the latter.To be clear I agree with that youre saying. Yes judges have a lot of leeway when it comes to language like reasonableness.  Im referring to a hypothetical situation along the lines of someone finding a clear loophole.To make an example up on the spot so please give me some leeway and work charitably with me here imagine the US Constitution said All laws federal and state must be physically signed by the governing executive ex. governorpresident and registered with the secretary or the law is void and unenforceable.  And the imagine a situation where someone commits murder they are charged in state courts and then they discover that  years ago when the state law was passed the governor didnt sign a copy.In that case should the judge be able to completely disregard the US constitution because it seems unfairunreasonable to let someone get away with murder?If not if you agree that unfortunate as it is the person cannot be charged with murder then what if someone found a legitimate loophole which meant the federal governments drug laws were unenforceable?  Is it okay to continue charging people with those crimes just because it would be unruly to suddenly have no federal drug laws on the books? What if someone found a loophole where the federal government legitimately did not not have taxation authority?  I agree that we wouldnt want all of societal structure to fall apart because an i or a t wasnt dotted correctly somewhere but on the other hand that same societal stability comes from following the law and not just disregarding it when it becomes inconvenient.,nottheonion,cvv2qmv,4,t5_2qnts

If someone wants to pull a gun out of their pants and shoot you with it theyre going to do it whether or not its legal. After all the act of shooting someone is already incredibly illegal. What open carry does is ensure that potential criminals automatically know who the  of legal carriers in the crowd are. Want to rob a store? No problem just shoot the guy thats open carrying in the head first!If a person is legally carrying there is no reason why you should need to know about it. Are you going to treat the person differently? I would hope not. If you regularly talk to people in a manner that may cause them to want to shoot you I would suggest changing that. Furthermore to get a license to carry concealed requires fingerprinting and background checks. So generally these are people not inclined to commit crimes. ,nottheonion,cvw4tll,2,t5_2qnts

Thats right its been up to people who may have high school or basic college level science courses to find the solution. Ill link you after this quotegtWhat many people dont realize however is that choosing the specific drugs and doses involves as much guesswork as expertise. In many cases the person responsible for selecting the drugs has no medical training. Sometimes that person is a lawyera state attorney general or an attorney for the prison. These officials base their confidence that a certain drug will work largely on the fact that it has seemed to work in the past. So naturally they prefer not to experiment with new drugs.

Your system basically hits a wall after a lot of thc consumption which can be minimized by not consuming thc. While it is pretty harmless in terms of not being able to overdose dependency can be an issue. Patients who require cannabis for medical purposes and heavy recreational users generally discover what dose provides steady maintenance of therapeutic benefits and tolerance to the side effects both depressant and stimulative. Keeping your consumption for example at  hits in critical times in the day can keep your tolerance plateaued with all the benefits of cannabis. ,nottheonion,cw190ou,15,t5_2qnts

Case in point how the show presents Hezbollah and AlQaeda the former is Shiite and the latter Sunni and they hate each other as much if not more than the WestIsrael. Theyre extremely different with different goals and ideologies and the only real overlaps are that theyre Muslim they operate out of the Middle East and theyre hostile to the West. But as these artists are implying the writers of Homeland seemed to decide that theyre both Muslim Arab militant groups therefore they must both hate the West and partner up whenever possible.

If you do finally manage to solve it then you will have gained basic understanding of the greenhouse effect.  A recent study has shown that the internet can give us the illusion of knowledge making us think we are smarter than we really are. Fortunately there may be a cure for our arroganceResearch in psychology has shown that people with least expertise in a subject tend to vastly overestimate their knowledge its also known as the DunningKruger effect. As my above question demonstrates youve failed to adequately assess your level of competence.

5496167,0,t1_cwe6ep1,Fuck dude. You dont understand what youre saying. The Supreme Court gets many applications to hear cases every year. They deny the vast majority of them. This is usually on procedural grounds or because there is no novel legal question. Some issues are immediately appealed to the Supreme Court and then granted or denied as a matter of course. It would be a massive waste of time to explain this in paper every time writ of cert. was denied. Or an application to vacate stay was denied. It would also be totally unnecessary since nothing is actually legally occurring i.e. changing from the lower court.But you arent even approaching a point where you can have this conversation because youre well dug into this stupid point youre trying to make. Its clear from the link you provided that you arent legally savvy enough to understand civil procedure or how courts work or Supreme Court jurisprudence. However to address specifically this dumbassery. While the Court may not write down and publish their reasoning for denying certain matters this decision is still justified with legal principles. Now please take a civics class or just continue this nonsense.

Like I said Obama was demonized by the GOP very early into his presidency. Republican lawmakers have been attacking Obama for pretty much everything hes done. Fox News was reporting on people calling him a Muslim or a Kenyan as if those questions were rooted in reality. gtThe responsibility is on the administration in power to get along.I disagree completely. It takes two to tango and there is no denying that the GOP had any intention to dance with Obama. To place all blame on the president totally absolves the Republicans who refused to cooperate on anything the government shutdown cost  Billion which I think we will agree is not the way to go about doing things. gtA wrong is a wrong and should be punished accordingly.But thats the thing. It wasnt considered a wrong when Bush did it and I dont consider it one now. Surely you cant deny that the vast majority of outrage over this is by Republicans and that most of them dont have a problem with the time it happened when they were in power.gtThe reality is that he pulled troops out based on his campaign promise for the  election cycleCome on man. You just said yourself that Bush signed the agreement for the troop withdrawal by the end of  and youre insinuating that Obama orchestrated it to get reelected? Thats a stretch. If anything Republicans have all but forgotten who put us in this position in the first place if Bush s recent spike in approval is any indicator. gtthe rise of ISIS and the power vacuum that occurred in the middle east all happened many years after Bush left office.This is pretty demonstrably false. The power vacuum happened almost immediately after the US deposed Saddam Hussein and the resulting leadership which essentially fired all the top military officials who were Sunni who then banded together into different factions against the state. This eventually led to the Iraqi Civil War. As terrible as Saddam was he ruled that country with an iron fist. None of this happened until after he was removed from office. Ever since that day the country has been dealing with an insurgency essentially what was happening in Syria in the beginning of this crisis and to suggest that it suddenly started when Obama took over is seriously dismissing most of the facts.Im responding to your second post in this one. Sorry if that makes it a pain in the ass to respond to lolgtforced to continue and increase spending on?Suddenly cutting programs that have been put in place is a bad idea. The best option is to slowly deal with them until they can be properly removed without affecting the populace in a major way. Obama has significantly slowed the spending that Bush and the GOP congress created. gt Budget and Accounting Act of I dont see what this has to do with lowering the budget deficit how you start reducing the national debt.gtThis isnt because of Bush. Looking at the total debt totally ignores how that debt is created. When you leave office with a . Trillion deficit the rate at which we borrow has been absurdly increased. Like I mentioned before the Obama administration has cut  Trillion out of that deficit and it gets lower every year. Spending under Obama has slowed pretty drastically and he is no where as big of a spender as you make him out to begtThe real hero of the economic turn around was Ben Bernanke and he does not get anywhere near the credit he deserves.Agreed. Bernanke was a great example of my ideal Republican was because he no longer considers himself a Republican.gtI see liberals constantly trying to change textbooks to fit the new progressive movement and to ignorerewrite the values and principles that we were raised with in the past.Like what? Other than pushing for adherence to the sciences no more teaching creationism as science and fighting the GOP trying to downplay our racist history and despicable treatment of the Native Americans minorities and Japanese during WWII I dont see them changing much else Id really like to see what you find because on the issue of education I have  almost always seen the GOP as being in the wrong even when I considered myself to be a Republican.gtnot trying to get into the global warming argument.Interestingly enough Im one of the small minority of Americans who has seen the effect of climate change first hand. My parents live on the water in South Florida and every year the tides get higher and higher. In recent months I have witnessed the tide getting high enough to flood my neighbors back yards and even into the street on an almost daily basis. This only ever would occur when there was a Hurricane Which we used to get annually and havent had one for a decade The sea is rising as a result of climate change and I have seen its effects within a  year span. You might not think climate change is a big deal and I probably wouldnt either if I didnt see it happening first hand but the Sea is starting to eat my city and doing nothing isnt going to change that.gtI think at this point we are just going to be arguing basic differences of opinions between liberals and conservatives thoughHaha agreed. Anyone looking for a summary of the two partys stances should read this thread. gtThe pandering to crazies will cease immediately when that happens.I sure hope sogtScary thing is that its started to seem like Trump may be that guy.

5711325,0,t3_3tarkd, years ago I took my son to Disney World and had a similar experience going through TSA in Orlandos airport.  He had a Pirates of the Caribbean gift set that included a toy gun that we forgot to pack in our checked luggage.  The TSA guard caught it in the scanner laughed and gave it back to him.Just saying not all TSA employees are complete dumb fucks.,nottheonion,cx51ndq,1,t5_2qnts
5711772,0,t1_cx4vvj4,Ive worked security in many different aspects some high risk eventsposts. I can tell you my professional opinion in regards to the TSAs epic failure to provide effective security. The Average salary for TSA agents is k. The fast food industry attracts more qualified applicants. Level of training can usually be measured by salary of position. This tells me TSA agents receive the bare minimum training the sort where if you dont understand part of the training you dont get a real answer to your question and still get the job. Part of all Security is Deterring Presence I imagine this is the primary emphasis of TSA training I.e. they are taught their uniform presence is the most important way to deter crime. Look at the people you see operating the terminal check points. They are almost all retirees elderly or carrying themselves with a superiority complex. The first  types have a high percentage of failingbelow average eyesighthearing. The third type is only paying attention to easy targets to exert their authority. None of them are properly motivated to provide effective security. The agents are posted and operate very similar to assembly line workers. This creates complacency and a bored just going through the motions work ethic. This goes directly against situational awareness attention to detail and maintaining a state of alertness which are key to security in any application.Combine all of the factors that Ive mentioned and you can see a clear picture of why weapons drugs and explosives can be brought on a plane easier than souvenirs or  hot sauce. Plus Im sure a good percentage of TSA employees fit the type that even if they did detect a threat they would let it through out of fear of confrontationtheir own incompetence or just not wanting to deal with the extra work.Hot sauceLast time I was on a plane I was departing Albuquerque NM. I was bringing an unopened bottle of Z Nothing Beyond hot sauce the hottest hot sauce from a store that sold nothing but hot sauce as a souvenir. I was stopped it was a liquid that was over the oz or whatever limit. I explained it was a souvenir and unopened still no go. I asked if I could put it in an approved container from one of the shops he said he didnt know I could try. So I go buy an airplane safe bottle of listerene mouthwash take it in the bathroom and begin the messy spicy burny process of filling the mint mouthwash bottle with this hot sauce. So now I have a bottle labeled mint mouthwash seal broken and refilled with a thick red liquid and I think to myself This looks like Im trying to smuggle some dangerous chemical theyll definitely ask about this. So I keep the bottle of hot sauce that still has a few ozs of liquid in it in order to explain. I make no effort to hide them putting them in a Ziploc in the basket with my keys and wallet mentally preparing to explain my innocent effort to bring a souvenir home. I go through a different scanner than the one where I was stopped for the unopened bottle. Not a word. I brought both the suspiciously refilled mouthwash bottle and the opened hot sauce bottle too large to be allowed on the plane without question.Edit Formatting,nottheonion,cx53nex,66,t5_2qnts

5712534,0,t3_3tax4s,I think everyone feels more racially sensitive than they have in the last  years. Everytime someone loots a store I know minorities are saying Please dont be a minority when they hear the news. I know when caucasians hear about hate crime they are thinking Please dont be white. Stereotypes are akward for everybody and nobody wants to be seen as insensitive to anybody else to the point where everybody is walking on eggshells. However I think the answer to the questions posed in that study would differ a lot depending on the age of the respondent. I think younger people are more likely to recognize the advances since the s and I think that baby boomers may be more likely to remember a non existent good old days without remembering the problems the s had. Here are a few things. . The red scare. Not having to worry about being thrown in jail or having your job or life ruined for seeming to be sympathetic to socialism that was a pretty bad thing in the s and we take it for granted that we dont have to worry about stuff like that anymore. . Minorities Women LGBT all had less rights in the s. Lets not forget that people were routinely jailed for drinking from the wrong water fountain sitting in the wrong spot on the bus associating with the wrong people loving the wrong people. The guy who helped win WW suffered chemical sterilization after the war for the crime of being gay...... . All was not peaceful. You had riots reigns of terror in the south and different parts of the country economic uncertainty political and social injustices the omnipresent threat of nuclear war and a fundamental lack of human rights compared to today. The good old days were not so good. In any case young people may not have these false memories of the golden age that never really existed outside of a hollywood pipe dream. Young people are more likely to see the progress made even in their short decades of life and see the progress made socially economically medically politically sexually and every other aspect of our lives. ,nottheonion,cx5724s,1,t5_2qnts

Specifically ethnic Korean gangs that have a reputation for more streetlevel and indiscriminate violence are usually unable to grow to any significant size despite the police ineffectiveness at controlling them. This is because the Yakuza dont appreciate their turf being encroached on most of them are rightwing xenophobes who hate Koreans and the Yakuza still fancy themselves as the heirs to samurai honor which they used to say included an obligation to defend the people. It also helps that Japanese people would generally rather deal with Japanese gangsters however bad they may be than gaijin or zainichi gangsters. Perhaps most significantly a large number of politicians in Japan are members of either a Yakuza group or a Yakuzafriendly rightwing organization. This gives them a lot of pull in politics without even having to threaten anyone. Arguably they are a large part of why Japanese government remains staunchly conservative in many ways. Ninja editDont let any of this fool you. For all the good public deeds the yakuza do they are harsh unforgiving and cruel organizations that have wreaked all kinds of havoc on the Japanese people and government as well as the people of Hawaii Brazil and even California over the last century.Another oneThere is one Yakuza family that was started by a Korean family decades ago and includes Japanese and Koreans in its ranks. Also a few other families have opened up to Koreans in recent years. The trend of large Yakuza groups quashing smaller gangs continues however and has never been limited to just Korean gangs. ,nottheonion,cxao2k9,279,t5_2qnts

I worked underthetable at a construction company when I was younger. Before I went to prison and worked with a few excons but mostly illegals. The work was shoddy at best pay was low and about  of the job was up to code.

It also deals with these issues Outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies shall be free for exploration and use by all States without discrimination of any kind on a basis of equality and in accordance with international law Outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty by means of use or occupation or by any other means States Parties to the Treaty shall carry on activities in the exploration and use of outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies in accordance with international law In the exploration and use of outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies States Parties to the Treaty shall be guided by the principle of cooperation and mutual assistance and shall conduct all their activities in outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies with due regard to the corresponding interests of all other States Parties to the Treaty.gtAs far as the oil fields that is semi appropriate as there are some oil rigs in international waters but the vast majority are in territorial waters up to but no more than  nautical miles from land.Why does that make it semiappropriate?

5899119,0,t1_cxsw17k,I wouldnt assume that just because it doesnt work doesnt mean it wasnt honed for a Western audience. Chinas government has a history of being really really bad at knowing what will play with a Western audience. Take for example this video they put up in Times Sqaure a few years ago as a soft power move. Its absolutely targeted at Western audiences but its a complete and utter failure. Or if youd like a more recent example heres one from just a few months ago this shitty fucking video aimed at getting foreigners excited about Chinas th five year plan. From an effective PR perspective its so bad that its hard to believe it even exists. But it does and given the animation quality and voice talent it probably wasnt cheap. All this is just to say that getting a negative response from foreigners doesnt mean the message isnt aimed at foreigners when it comes to Chinas government which is extremely tonedeaf when it comes to foreign PR. In this sort of context  a press event where foreign journalists are present  they almost certainly put some thought into the kind of messaging they want playing overseas. Thats not to say it isnt also targeted at China  internet management is just the Party line no matter who theyre talking to.

You have to intentionally pull the trigger some pistols triggers wont trigger the firing mechanism if youre not holding them properly. I dont know exactly what happened here but it wasnt a person fumbling around in a purse. The article states the child removed the pistol before firing.Youre clearly and woefully ignorant about guns. The woman in the article had to have had the safety off with a round in the chamber. On top of this she had to have not been paying attention to the kid while knowing her gun was there.

5966221,0,t1_cy1bl48,To be fair just because something is a right doesnt mean it cant be restricted it just means that any restriction on it must meet a very high level of scrutiny and be narrowly tailored to meet a legitimate government interest.For example you can require that people wear safety equipment even if it would violate their religious garb requirements if it is necessary to safely do a job. Likewise if you sign something with the government to give you government clearance you cant share classified information with the general public without permission. Both of these are restrictions on first amendment rights but are narrowly tailored to meet the needs.You could argue that gun safety classes before buying firearms would be a narrowly tailored purpose to meet a legitimate government purpose namely to prevent injury to themselves and others via improper firearm use. However the safety class would have to be something which wasnt onerous or designed to make it more difficult to acquire guns but simply something which was necessary to promote safety.Heck if that wasnt the case all of the abortion restrictions would be unconstitutional.,nottheonion,cy1pbf7,1,t5_2qnts

If you are a man you dont walk up to a bunch of people and say Now listen here you people need to see me and consider me to be competent and not have any biases or problems with me because of who I am. You dont plead for fairness because no thats not how it works. Fairness isnt a real thing if you are a man. Fairness only applies if you have the special treatment a vagina affords you. This is because women of the western world are the most Privileged group on the planet. If youre a woman youre never going to see how the world really is. Youll always be sheltered and protected by it through the special treatment and lower standards you receive. But of course the whole time you will be told that You are oppressed or Its because of men or whatever because obviously nobody wants to make you face the reality that you simply do not stack up to men.If you are a man you work every day with people who have bias against you. Who dislike you. The cards are stacked against you in every meeting you go into. The reason we come out ahead is because we dont let that fucking stop us. We dont beg for people to like us.

The US is important because you think it is special or unique. As shown it isnt the best at anything save a few negative examples. Adding the political commentary at the end was too much for you to comprehend. My bad. I can see how youd conflate the first paragraph and the second and not conclude that they were different.

6003371,0,t1_cy56h6z,Ok so you wanna live in the Wild Wild West where everyone carries a gun?? Well I lived in Brazil for half my life so heres what happens. A robber wont ask you for your wallet. Hell shoot you first before you even turn around and then hell take your wallet from your dead body and your gun. Hell come in numbers with two people behind you and one across the street. And when they come in numbers nobody else is stupid enough to try to save you even if they have their own gun because theyll be drawing attention and nobody wants bullets coming their way. Most of the time they get you at night when you stop at a red light. And when two armed people are upset about who saw a parking spot first or whose right of way it was before they wrecked or whether my kid pushed your kid on the soccer field intentionally or accidentally you get into a Cold War. Instead of just heated words you are now both looking at each others hands and expressions and if someone appears to reach for a gun when they were reaching for their cell you have bullets flying. You hear of stray bullets everyday. Every fucking day. And every once in a while they hit an artery. New Years Day you have people shooting into the air and what goes up must come down. Had a bad argument with a girlfriend or spouse? Those go well when either or both have a gun nearby. You need to realize by definition half the population of humans have an IQ under . That a large portion of people deployed are killed by friendly fire sometimes more than actual enemy fire. As is people drop their guns in public places and they go off. Imagine if everybody is carrying one. You have to realize that kids get their hands on guns and shoot themselves their parents and siblings. Oh so a child is not old enough to be responsible for their actions but you think they fully appreciate the dangers of a gun. So if a park is full of people having a beer and no guns and another park is full of people with guns and no beer Im taking my kids to the beer park and they are much more likely to be safe. If you say people cant drink responsibly what makes you think they can handle holster store and clean their guns responsibly???,nottheonion,cy6klm4,1,t5_2qnts

I could question everything and everyone every day but that would be tiresome and pointless.

Its the difference between the rotten apple and the bruised one.As long as its better than the alternative then it doesnt help the customer to ban it. And we arent discussing the right of net neutrality dont take away my choices and tell me its because I have more rights.If I have the right to not have a rotten apple that means I can choose whether to have it. Banning me from eating rotten apples isnt giving me a right. Maybe giving me good apples is giving me the right to have food but then theres no need to ban rotten apples as Ill just choose the good one.If the issue is that the apple isnt known to be rotten then the solution is more disclosure not banning it completely.

I should just run? And leave my car? Or...where do I run? In that case it should be legal and it is where I live to use my gun to protect myself.

Why?  on  arent my kind of odds and I dont carry to be a savior to the public. But the cops do so Id call them and get some smokes elsewhere. In my opinion there should be more checks in place to prevent unstable people from being armed. Everyone isnt a responsible gun owner. The benefit of the doubt must always go to the people trying to live their lives peacefully. The idea that someone could attempt to rob you at gunpoint and if you shoot him instead of running away youll be prosecuted...is absolute bullshit. I lived in inner city west side Chicago from . The GDs BDs and VLs had fucking guns on guns on guns. Shooting in front of the cops. Not giving a fuck at all.

6156678,0,t1_cypf37n,It is very weird. Thats why people talk about Quantum Mechanics being so weird also the rules themselves for the small scale are so weird e.g. small objects can be at two places at once they can interact instantaneously over any distance backwards causation can happen on the quantum scale. I am not sure of the prospects for reconciling the two sets of rules. Right now people would just be happy if they could reconcile relativity how gravity works a force that primarily acts on large objects with quantum mechanics how the other  forces work forces that primarily act on the small scale. This is what people mean when they talk about a grand unified theory of physics. Right now you have all sorts of contradictions between the two. That would be a step in the direction of reconciling the big and small scale I guess.Another major project is simply figuring out where the line is i.e. when does the wavefunction collapse. We still dont know at what size the rules change. I believe theyve gotten as big as an atom or two still maintaining quantum effects but how much bigger can a system get before it starts acting in accordance with the universes rules for big objects.There are two hypotheses I find promising Gravity is the force that imposes the big object rules. So as systems get bigger and gravity has more of an effect the quantum weirdness goes away or All bits of matter have an inherent probability at any time of acting in accordance with the big object rules rather than the small object rules. But as systems get bigger the probability of each part acting according to the big object rules amalgamate so as different bits of matter interact in a therein larger system the probability of all of the bits of matter in the system acting in accordance with big object rules goes up very quickly.,nottheonion,cypg7d8,7,t5_2qnts

6167755,0,t1_cyqk2ii,I disagree with pretty much all of your conclusions.Whether its called theft by deception or fraud or any of your other weird conclusions depends  on your applicable statutes or jurisdictions and you seem to frame it as an issue of nomenclature so Im not sure why youre correcting me without even specifying what jurisdiction in which Im apparently wrong. Either way though fraud has very different elements and thus is a different crime in most jurisdictions that have both as crimes. Theft by deception is usually simple theft with the element of deception added INSTEAD OF unlawful taking. An unlawful taking would be a taking without permission whereas if you come into commit theft by possessing an item by deceiving a person and receiving permission to take it that isnt necessarily fraud but theft by deception. Fraud has many more elements.You also make some weird leaps in logic. Identity theft doesnt necessarily involve any taking at all. And look up theft of mislaid property or whatever your jurisdiction calls it crimes youll notice theres a temporal disconnect between the initial possession of the item and when it becomes unlawful which is why there is no unlawful taking element there in fact its what specifically makes it a different crime where it is designated as such.,nottheonion,cyqpk98,1,t5_2qnts

6224256,0,t1_cyx4dhp,gt Would you agree that there are also things that increase biological age?That is irrelevant to my point.  gt I understand that statistical likelihood of mutation increases over time because more time has passed for it to occur in. That is different from arguing thatBut it isnt different.  It still has to do with randomness.  I understand you are likely not well versed in biology and I am doing my best here but mutations do often occur.  You likely have a replication error in your body right at this moment.  But we have protective mechanisms that repair this damage.  The randomness is still there for the mutation and there is still randomness that the protective mechanism wont work.  But as we age sometimes that protective mechanism cant repair that replication error.Thats likely one of the reasons why cancer incidence rates dramatically increase after the age of .  Extrinsic factors are unlikely to be involved as in order for them to cause cancer they must be still within the system.Smoking for example your odds of getting cancer decrease substantially when you stop smoking because there are no longer mutagens within your system from the smoking itself.  ,nottheonion,cyx4p7c,1,t5_2qnts

6301286,0,t1_cz5uqen,Its kind of a blurry area. I mean take a song like Rhythm Nation by Janet Jackson I figure Id reference something neutral that isnt a Kanye tune. Whether or not you like the song you have to admit she took the sample from Sly amp The Family Stone and really made it sound  totally different. So was it totally original? No it wasnt. Its literally impossible to say that song is  original. But that doesnt mean there wasnt great creativity in it by the artist who sampled it and it doesnt mean theres nothing original in it. But yeah if youre using someone elses song then you dont get to say its all original anymore. Thats just fact. Thats not a matter of opinion.One of the tricky things about this thread is that its arguing a lot of things that Kanye didnt say or lay claim to. As was pointed out elsewhere he didnt even say he was doing the Bowie tribute album nor did he say I never would do covers. So when I said Why wouldnt he? I was trying to dig deeper in the reasoning of the person who said Kanye wouldnt no way no how... because hes just too damn original. That specific argument doesnt make sense. Someone who says that he uses samples and he only creates completely original content is going too far down the fanboy road. Not everyone who likes Kanye is like that but anyone who wants to put those two things together is letting their love of the artist make them forget basic logic.,nottheonion,cz5vv8l,-1,t5_2qnts

A dog with no training or motivation ran a half marathon simply because it was there. She probably just scented the humans and decided to follow her nose.  No real effort on her part at all.  Humans have to work up to this sort of thing.  In the original story of Marathon the guy who ran it died from the effort.  That we have people who condition themselves to do this for entertainment today is incredible.  That somebody can cover a hindered miles on foot in a day is practically superhuman.

They are wanderers and when they catch a scent or decide to investigate something there isnt much stopping it. Sounds like the dog is given a lot of freedom to roam. Rural places are easy to do that with your dog if its polite and minds its manners. Hell some dogs are so well know around town that they can make their daily greeting rounds collecting biscuits and pats on the head.

Straw purchases like this are unacceptable. The straw purchaser can go to jail and the gun distributor if they knew about the straw purchase can both go to jail and lose their license to sell firearms.Not to say that some POS gun dealers dont break the law andor sell lots of guns to criminals while pretending not to know theyre doing it but it is definitely illegal and if you do get caught the consequences can be quite serious.,nottheonion,czd5mzb,1,t5_2qnts

6463201,0,t1_cznqb9z,The title doesnt imply that the lobsters were turned into food. It is possible that live lobsters were added to the mix and then removed still alive for later use. In fact the lobsters were boiled in the beer removed dead and consumed later. From the article its clear that none of the lobster aside from some of the flavor remains in the beer. The title of the post implied the first case to me anyways more strongly than the second. Moreover most animals do not die during the cooking process  they die far earlier.

It was not great. But now I am a avid cleaner! I love to clean. I dont feel weird saying it I am proud I like to be clean and keep things clean. It probably drives my boyfriend crazy lol.

People who argue for long prison terms fail to grasp the effects of being imprisoned on an individual. Those effects last longer than the punishment itself. The way its covered it really sounds like someone who committed a crime in a fit of jealousy. Its understandable why she wouldnt want to stay with him but to destroy someones life over a failed attempt at murder that they ultimately admitted to to the party in question without knowing that anyone was watching seems misguided.  If the person didnt die then its wrong to punish the party in question as if they had.

When I awoke  or  hours later my partner told me that I had woken a few hours in very agitated and confused and that she had a hard time calming me down. I marks on my arm from her fingernails as she had to restrain me. Luckily there wasnt any trouble but it was very frightening I was acting crazy and have only the vaguest recollection.

6571180,0,t1_czyzfx5,Theres rich and theres the establishment. Sorry if this comes across as patronising but I dont know whether youre British so Im just assuming for ease that you arent. Basically the Labour and Lib Dems are university educated middle class. Theyre from middle class and welloff families. Novi homines as it were. They contrast with the Tories. They are wealthy sure but they stretch from the normal levels of wealth of the lower middle classes right up to the billionaires. And more important than wealth is the old boys club culture and network one thats very insidious. Thats more the reason why people are focussing in the Tories here. They old boys club has always had those pederastic and paedophilic tendencies in rituals and clubs. Its well documented. Thats what makes them different from the Labourites and Lib Dems.Edit Not sure why you deleted your comment! Didnt want to waste my reply so here it isYeah. One example bear in mind that David Cameron the PM obviously George Osborne Chancellor of the Exchequer his second in command Boris Johnson London Mayor and probably third most important in the Tory party behind the former two Jo Johnson Minister of State for Universities and Science and Nick Hurd Parliamentary UnderSecretary for International Development were all members of an elite club called the Bullingdons club at Oxford University. This is a club which is based around the wealthiest and most influential students from the most prestigious dynasties getting together and throwing outrageous parties to network or going on safaries or playing cricket etc  king Edward VIII was famously only allowed to become a member provided he agreed never to go to a Bullingdon Blind one of their parties. The uniform incidentally is full dress tailcoats with a velvet collar and brass buttons handtailored and costing  last time it was checked. They famously used to go to restaurants trash the places and then just leave a bag of money to fix it.Its that boardingschool richkid egomaniac elitist culture that pervades the higherups of the Tories. Labour and Lib Dems are rich alright but you wont find a single Labour member of the Bullingdon I bet.Incidentally note that George Osbornes brother from the same sort of background has recently been outed as a pretty deplorable sex offender,nottheonion,czz0j7b,26,t5_2qnts

6601885,0,t1_d0262x9,gt Did this gentleman have an opportunity to argue before the court?um.... Just FYI people that are arrested and imprisoned often have a legal opportunity to argue before the court.To answer the question no. They have technically already had their day in court when the judgement was issued. They are being arrested for having been judged guilty of contempt of court.gtSo you are exaggerating by calling them unilateral terms.See above. They never appeared in court.gtAnd yes in this country failure to appear in court often results in unfavorable outcomes. Boo fucking hoo.Actually in most states it does not. Rather you are called to appear again. If you continue to not appear then a judgement is issued in your absence for instance allowing a debtcollector to garnish your wages. However such an outcome is almost unheard of with the exception of restitution child support or student loans. The only reason this can happen is due to being a federal loan and therefore the federal courts have jurisdiction. Since it is a federal loan the federal government allows forprofit companies to use the agents of the government to enforce a judgement for the forprofit company against the individual to be involuntarily imposed with the indefinite imprisonment.But I love how you falsely imply that you have compared THIS unfavorable outcome to that of all other reasonable methods both for the specific terms of payment forced on Mr. Aker as well as larger implications to society in order to objectively determine that it is justified as opposed to making some mindless assertion that ANY unfavorable outcome is justified as if the Holocaust would also be a perfectly acceptable unfavorable outcome for collecting on student debt.,nottheonion,d026tqw,1,t5_2qnts

And as you might expect there were a lot of children with their parents and of course some free running potbelly pigsthe one with the drooping belly they are such sweet creaturesi dont mean their meat D and of course a small pet area with German heath goat? race.My girlfriend loves animals and that is the reason we go to that wildlife park atleast! three times a year sometimes more ok now i get back to the story.We were in the pet area with the German heath and were minding our own businessmeaning petting these lovely sweet creatures that just had fresh babies some weeks ago ltEverywhere are signs that say Dont disturb the newborns with their mothers they need their precious time together dont touch dont feed dont make much noise only look more or lessWhen my girlfriend notices one of the motherfucking icandowhatiwantbecauseiamfuckingadorable kids some distance awaym dragging one of the baby heaths around shoving it to try to push it over and such things all while laughing as if this was the funniest thing he could do.And what does his motherfucking family do? They laugh they take pictures and whoop ... i was just short of exploding and wanted to go over to the kid and their parents to fucking put them in their place when i notice my girlfriend rushing up to the kid.The moment she gets there she forcefullybut without actually harming him unclenches the kids hands from the heaths fur and steps between them and loudly calls over their parents to put them in their place.After a short discussion when they still didnt want to see reason and still talked aboutbla bla this is a pet area bla bla let children play bla bla dont pretend youre better than us  bla bla My girlfriend got one of the park guardians to come over and talk to the family and why it was wrong to behave that way etc.Long story short the family wasnt allowed in the pet area for that day and the park guardian got some collegues over so they could better watch for such behaviour that is normally not that common even with that amount of children.I just cant understand why some people are this stupid as if they would like if i come over and pinch them dragg them around or shove them until they fall over.If you dont like it done to you why would anyone else like it any more done to him?Edit The funny thing my girlfriend is normally extremely shy and quiet but in this moment she was extremely confidant and stood up to someone else that couldnt protect itself i was more than proud of her in that moment.,nottheonion,d05617l,5,t5_2qnts

6637695,0,t1_d05v73o,You really think Netflix and iTunes got this popular without any pirates switching to their services because they made it dead easy to access highquality content?And its not always a oneclick deal. Youre discounting the amount of technical knowledge required to get to the point where pirating is a oneclick deal. Then not everything is on TPB  you often have to look at other trackers or even sign up for those private trackers. And even if youre exclusively using TPB you still have to search and weed through which torrent is the right one for you. Then theres the problem that if you want your pirated stuff available on more than one of your devices you have to setup and maintain your own content server. All of that is a lot of combined effort trialanderror and research which is stuff that SO MANY laypersons do not want to touch with a ten foot pole. Hence Netflix.,nottheonion,d05w7l1,9,t5_2qnts

6638317,0,t1_d05ukp8,Kanye doesnt exactly make popdance for kids. You miiight be able to argue that Graduation is kinda like that but only if your only familiarity with Kanye is Stronger.The dude got big off of chopped up soul samples Lucifer Heart Of The City Overnight Celebrity etc. His first few albums are far from popdance All Falls Down Roses We Dont Care. Really only Gold Digger is even remotely similar to popdance. And no songs have any EDM or EDMinspired elements.Graduation kind of sort of verges into EDM territory Stronger most notably but also has tracks like Everything I Am Good Morning and Homecoming. Which are far far from EDM. s his next album is again completely unlike everything youre talking about. Its much more influenced by early Cudi and BEP is an absurd comparison.MBDTF? Again nope. Maaaaybe All Of The Lights is vaguely similar to a really early BEP song. Thats it.Yeezus had some help from Daft Punk but its hilariously far from popdance.Seriously Kanyes made like two songs that could even kinda qualify as popdance. And rap exists beyond east and west coast  first off dude how can you neglect the south like that. Kanye was the first mainstream guy to talk about general middleclass stuff.

He used to be the national high school  mile record holder an all American in college and has run under  minutes per mile in a half marathon. They are highlighting the fact that he smokes as the reason for his failure when it wasnt the case. He wasnt prepared for what was going to happen. Running in the heat of LA for . miles without any prepared water stations almost no mileage for training and a calf injury are more prominent reasons for his dead last finish.The guys that got to qualify for this event are not joggers... they run fast for a long time.

Being a literal rapeslave in North Korea is clearly worse than being paid less because you arent taken seriously at work because of your gender.But I dont think its an eitheror type situation. I think the underlying goal of making people equal would be beneficial to both situations. Something like the wage gap is a lot easier to fix  certainly not easy or simple!  than trying to change a regime on the other side of the globe. And frankly it affects the people who can affect change.So it feels as if your criticism is that its not directly working on what you think the most pressing issue is therefore its a waste of time for morons.

Neither are inherently although there certainly are governments or corporations that are corrupt. The naivety is this that corporations or governments will look out for you or are to be trusted with power. So a corporation made terrible mistakes that must mean that giving government a large amount of power will solve that or likewise giving a corporation a large amount of power to solve issues of government.Any entity given uncontrolled power WILL abuse it it is up to us the people to separate power that is the heart of the issue. We cannot allow corporations or government to act without recourse or fear only then will true democracy work.

Just getting legal status to live in the US alone is hell and its greater hell for those who are coming from the middle East. Note Im not talking about the justification of this but the sheer racism bureaucratic hostility and redtaping that we experienced was definitely not just. No one ever talks about that side of the story. And sure we wanted to become naturalized citizens as soon as possible but it took us  years to go from a legal visa status to getting a US passport. And we were committed to building our lives in this country from the start.And you even pointed to the other part! Is it fair that someone willing to serve in the military should be granted special privileges or status however informal because of that? What if our family was ideologically against war and the military in general.

But just look at how they threw human rights treaties out the window because it doesnt benefit them financially. And even if the US threatened Mexico with sanctions and embargos and whatnot if Mexico can still trade with other countries they will. I dont think other nations would endanger their economies just to rally behind the US for the sake of a stupid wall. Dim it down a knotch your egotism.Also nothing gets done in Mexico. Best case scenario the press covers it till the Mexican president invites the US president to discuss this matter which would essentially just be a fancy dinner and an itinerary filled with trivial salutes marches and dances.

6770901,0,t1_d0jkyl2,In our state a seatbelt law passed... I want to say  or  years ago? It was originally passed with a bunch of legislators saying things like It will only be an addon ticket.  Much like your insurance being out of date theres no way for the police to know that unless youre already speeding or driving recklessly or anything else like that.  There wont be any way for the police to pull you over just for not having a seat belt on.The worry was that police could just pull someone over run their information and just say Well it looked like they didnt have their seat belt on! as another loophole around needing probable cause. It barely passed and a lot of that was because of the addon ticket rhetoric.Cut to a year later or so and the police in my hometown were setting up random seat belt check zones.  At areas where traffic slowed down stop lights sharp turns etc a group of cops would literally just sit by the side of the road looking through windshields and trying to catch people without a seat belt.If you got caught without one they direct you off to the side of the road take their time looking over your car broken lights expired tags etc.  If nothing else is wrong you get let go... with only a  ticket for not wearing your seat belt.

6773179,0,t1_d0jyeu8,Unless they are breaking another law then the justice system should treat them similarly. Its really that simple and claiming an entire race needs to take responsibility for vague undefined and wholly hypothetical actions while simultaneously excusing our justice system of any responsibility in performing its constitutionally defined role is indicative of someone who has a bone to pick with anything that doesnt conform to their childish and indefensible belief in a just world.Regardless of whatever nonsense you want to claim this outcome isnt acceptable for the role the justice system is supposed to fill in US society. Even if every single one of those disparate outcomes were ostensibly due to a black defendant wearing a tall t in court or having his good teeth in or whatever racist nonsense you wish to conjure up the justice system is not supposed to assign punishment via some arbitrary code of social norms. By flippantly excusing it here youre only allowing it to do so elsewhere and using some other arbitrary metric.

6870441,0,t1_d0v29vw,Twinkies and gummy bears also provide calories and some would argue are delicious.I dont think the metric for nutrition is deliciousness and amount of calories per serving.Consistently when populations of people who eat different diets are compared rates of hip fractures increase with increasing animal protein consumption including dairy products.  For example people from the USA Canada Norway Sweden Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of osteoporosis.gtThe primary biologic purpose of cows milk is to cause growthfrom a  pound calf to a  pound cow in less than  months. This miraclegrow fluid has several qualities that help accomplish this feat. Cows milk is  fat providing  growthsupporting calories per quart. Cows milk also has high concentrations of protein potassium sodium calcium and other nutrients to sustain rapid growth.  In comparison these nutrients are at a three to four times lower concentration in human milk than cows milk.When we as human beings consume another animals breast milk and breast milk products past infancy.. well were going to have a bad time. Remember.. from a  pound calf to a  pound cow in less than  months... gtDairy foods increase growth hormones  In addition to calories and nutrients to support growth cows milk increases hormones that directly stimulate the growth of the calf. The most powerful of these hormones is called insulinlike growth factor IGF.  When cows milk is fed to people IGF levels also increase.  Studies funded by the dairy industry show a  increase in IGF levels in adolescent girls from one pint daily and the same  increase for postmenopausal women from  servings per day of nonfat milk or  milk. This rise in IGF level is an important reason for the bonebuilding effects of cows milk.gtIGF promotes undesirable growth toolike cancer growth and accelerated aging. IGF is one of the most powerful promoters of cancer growth ever discovered for cancers of the breast prostate lung and colon. Overstimulation of growth by IGF leads to premature aging tooand reducing IGF levels is antiaging.gtDairy Foods Raise Estrogen The message that estrogen builds fractureresistant bones prevents osteoporosis has been hammered into womens minds over the past  decades by the pharmaceutical industry selling HRT formulas such as Premarin and Prempro. Food also raises estrogen levels in a persons bodyand dairy foods account for about  to  of the estrogen that comes from food.  The main source of this estrogen is the modern factory farming practice of continuously milking cows throughout pregnancy. As gestation progresses the estrogen content of milk increases from  pgml to  pgml.,nottheonion,d0v2qnz,1,t5_2qnts

It found that you need to reuse a paper bag a minimum of  times before it has as low of an environmental impact as a standard plastic bag which is only used once then trashed. Additionally you need to reuse a cotton bag  one times before you see an environmental gain. That said in my experience a cotton bag holds x as much as a plastic bag so I bet only  uses would be enough to offset your environmental impact. ,nottheonion,d0zuzhs,84,t5_2qnts

Now if five years down the line the same suspect is accused of rape three more times thats pretty significant contrary to what reddit often seems to think false rape accusations are fairly rare so a pattern like that in someones life is suspicious.

The existence of dinosaurs and the  million year gap between their extinction and the presence of mankind the transition between homosapien lifeforms in the fossil record without extinction events between them these things are strong enough proof of evolution for anyone whose ideals arent warped by a fairy tale written  years ago. It cant be argued against that species on Earth evolve. For the purpose of evolution as an explanation of mans origin that isnt as useful given that species adaptations arent known to break the genetic barriers of said species or reshape DNA structure which evolutionary scientists admit. However species evolution is something believed to take literally millions of years. We exist currently as does modern science in a very short window of cosmic time. It is ignorant and arrogant to pretend any humans do or have ever understood the origin of man but equally ignorant and arrogant to deny something for which great evidence exists solely on the basis that its alleged to occur over millions of years and we havent developed any hard evidence in the  years weve been looking for it. Weve gone backwards millions of years though and best we can tell the evidence is everywhere.,nottheonion,d17zxfe,10,t5_2qnts

As for why straight people dont have one one issues would you unite all straight people under? The lgbt movement was a success because minority groups were all suffering through the same experiences at the hands of majority straight societies.

I am not saying getting a ccw makes you instantly qualified security personnel in some states getting a ccw is a joke.  However some of us go beyond and take way more classes and have waaay more training than a cop does.   Cops have to qualify there weapon a couple times a year and for some of them thats the only time they actually shoot their gun.  Not all police depts have the greatest of budgets.  Then look at something like the recent Keenu Reeves gun example or Colion Noir a lawyer doing a course.  Anyone who does gun IPDA etc will out shoot a cop everytime. You wouldnt want that guy defending your kids?  Are you crazy?  Then you have some country bumpkin fudd ruin it for all of us by shooting himself in the leg.  The other millions of gun owners are like wtf?  Gun ownership is thru the roof and is there more crime sir?  Gun ownership has doubled since .  Has crime doubled?  oh wait it went down?By your argument if even security officers and police dont have enough training to defend my kids without innocents getting hurt then who does?  Lets just call Superman!  I guess we should just leave them defenseless and just let Columbine keep happening instead over and over and over and over again.  What is your solution good sir?  Keep the statusquo gun free zone and let this continue to happen?  So far youve proposed nothing that actually fixes the situation.  Having a trained individual there cop or not is infinitely preferable to me than jack shit.   Shit we use civilian contractors to fight wars overseas but civilians arent good enough to defend our kids?  Police were once civilians too we are all human we all make mistakes and we are not perfect.

The Brinks truck is meant to deter being attacked by being difficult to penetrate with the kinds of weapons that the average civilian bank robber could get their hands on.  The Brinks truck would not protect its occupants from heavier portable arms like rocket launchers let alone mechanized weapons let alone keep moving.  It does have a lot of room for cargo though.By contrast the M has room for its crew and some of their effects some surveillance equipment but thats about it.  No appreciable cargo space.  Its also can handle attacks from some heavier manportable weapons and even indirect strikes from mechanized weapons and can continue to function to an extent after taking damage.

He more or less said yes but still..  I then made the mistake of pointing out that hed just bought a brandnew Passat a car made by a company founded by the National Socialists a company that made vehicles for the Wehrmacht a company that used actual slave labor during the war.

With the way the justice system functions the harm spawned out of imprisoning an individual for such an action far outways the social positives. This man has the potential to be a functioning member of society when imprisoned it ruins prospects of a career and sends the man into a system of which reinforces crime. It is no secret those that enter the system often return with high recidivism especially for non violent offenders such as this due to the disadvantages it will place on him. Yes this is irresponsible but to treat him as a monster only will reinforce that outlook on society towards him he deserves a chance to change the human mind is a malleable thing if given proper guidance and rehab.

He refused  reliving every detail like that is no picnic made worse because he cant bear letting the V.A. jerk him around  so we took another route to reestablish his status.

The in my opinion best interpretation of the First Amendment suggests they shouldnt. This case is intended to demonstrate how discriminatory prison dress policies are. Religious people are given wide leeway in their mode of dress while the nonreligious are not. Why? Surely if the dress code is intended as part of the punishment and rehabilitation process religious exemptions are counterproductive. Even if they arent theyre certainly discriminatory.As to your slippery slope examples the Federal RFRA was passed at least in part to allow Native American tribes to continue to cultivate and smoke peyote as part of their religious traditions. This has already spawned the Church of Cannabis which the government also refuses to recognize. For the sex free religious exercise under the First Amendment has always been interpreted as applying only as far as all participants in any exercise are willing. Rape murder theft and other crimes against another cannot be justified under free religious exercise.,nottheonion,d23wask,1,t5_2qnts

Good management would look at what was going on and offer the union something like thisCurrent payouts  x  x.   x where x is the base wage.If the union can get employees to meet certain standards and avoid overtime per week then wages would go from x to say .x.  Now as a manager Im paying out more than I would for a straight x but less than x.

And even if this wasnt the case you dont fuck with someones children because of a city complaint. Generally the worst that can happen with a city complaint is someone coming out to bother you or a nastygram. CPS visits can go bad REAL fast.And I dont know where they are from but a broken fridge in the yard can be a big deal in the south. My grandparents grew up poor with the keep everything whatsoever mentality and had an old freezer in the yard for years. The first year it was found by yellow jackets. My father kept killing the nest for my grandparents but eventually it got big enough quick enough that it got away from him and we had to just stay away from it. Eventually it became a huge swarming nest that had the potential to kill anyone that came too close. One of my younger cousins came too close and had a bad time. He was really young so he didnt really know any better. After that in the true country way my father refused to call pest control and waited for a cold morning. He doused the freezer in  gallons of gas and oil mixed and burned it all. ,nottheonion,d2e8ifb,101,t5_2qnts

If that were acceptable everyone would do it.I do think this guy probably sees himself as a victim and he probably thinks that hes doing the right thing by going after the university for this. And maybe Im wrong and he is but based on the article I dont think hes being discriminated against  a professor telling him he couldnt have a laptop in class is an exception but its also possible that he hasnt applied for special permission to do so. We dont know the other side of the story but Im assuming that that professor was in the wrong. Im guessing that he did at least apply for permission to use it in exams because otherwise it certainly wouldnt be allowed.,nottheonion,d2h2zon,1,t5_2qnts

I just had this conversation rant with my boyfriend when we were driving through the mall parking lot to go to lunch. Group of  adult women and  kids maybe  years old. Old enough to look. They were crossing the parking lot diagonally across all the lanes ahead of us driving definitely should have stopped especially considering the children were ahead of them. NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THEM NOT EVEN THE GODDAMN ADULTS LOOKED MY WAY OR THE OTHER BEFORE CROSSING INTO LANE OF TRAFFIC.  If for some reason I had been looking over at my boyfriend or down at at the radio or just not paying attention like I should have been for whatever reason I would have hit them. They didnt even look. I went off on a huge rant about they didnt even look! Since when did parents atop teaching their kids to look both ways before crossing the street?

But i am arguing against the concept of government not on how it should work.gtglobal collapse because of feminismNever heard of it feminism as in sjw culture is there to grow government and erode rights like free speech and gun ownership it is a psychological operation divide and conquer but global collapse because of debt and inflation of federal reserve notes is likely,nottheonion,d3co31v,0,t5_2qnts

This is causing serious harm to a big portion of the global population. This is not something to take lightly because that will represent the economy which eventually represents food on your table when you are old. Can also add that the millennials are different from previous generations due to technological advancements. We are not able to measure the change that is about to come just yet but already we are seeing this massive increase in anxiety and depression in generation X and millennials. On the topic of becoming dumber yes we are becoming dumber in a rapid fashion studies have already shown that younger generations are not interested in politics economy and other important subjects. This will ofcourse have consequences in the longer run looking at U.S for example with the systematic destruction of their education system we can already see that  of the voting population seem to be emptyheaded probably more than just the trump voters. The intelligence of the American population is a laughing stock to people worldwide and U.S is considered a dysfunctional country with mass corruption and a broken system in every sector. It would not surprise me if U.S is a poor developing country in  years. With this said I clearly illustrate consequences that affects a population with intellectual limitations. If you are too naive and ignorant to realize that this is most likely going to affect your future children then too bad for you. Im not going to gamble that my kids becomes dummy whitetrash who thinks whoring for money and fame is a good thing. I will throw away the TV and encourage my children to improve and learn things like instruments and other skills and focus on their well being and also letting them be kids. If only all parents were as smart as me then we would see a golden age weve never seen. ,nottheonion,d3g4hb4,1,t5_2qnts

7734083,0,t1_d3l8p71,Firstly I want to apologize for any tone that made you think a nerve had been struck. Im often more critical of things I mostly agree with than things I oppose. If I see something that doesnt look completely solid it just looks like something for the opposition to focus on and ignore everything else. Again apologies my friend. Now on to your points. If women made less than men then it would make sense for a failing business to let go of more men than women. However it would also make sense that crashes effect different industries in different ways. If industries that are more predominantly male were effected more than those that were predominantly female it would follow that more unemployed would be male. Women and men are more plentiful in different industries. For instance women are more likely to go into lower education than STEM fields and you see more men in manufacturing and construction and the like. I think this is what we should be focusing on more. The pressures pushing women and men into these differing industries.As for abortion let me begin my saying that I completely support it and beleive it is the womans choice over her body. I also understand that there are people trying to make that choice less accessible and with a greater burden to those seeking it and that has tobe stopped. However the orginal argument was women having less constitutional rights than men and abortion while I fully support it doesnt really work well in this arguement. I mean you could say that men have more control of their bodies than women because of it but men arnt really trying to do the same things to their bodies. If I wanted to play devils advocate even more than O already am you could argue that abortion gives women more rights than a man. The decision as it should be is the mothers and the father has no say in it. Dont want to be a dad? Too bad eiher step up or say hello to child support for the next two decades. Again much more of a devils advocate thing but hey thats kind of the point of this whole thing.,nottheonion,d3lb6o5,1,t5_2qnts

7737348,0,t1_d3ljzif,Because in general the cultural position of men is traditionally of higher standing than women. It relates to privilege. To explain privilege Im just going to copypaste this comment by uuvox because that concept also seems to have some confusion around it.gtWhy does noone on Reddit seem to understand the concept of privilege? Its not a binary thing its not something that you either have or dont have. Everyone has some privilege in some context or another. But some people have privilege that they can exercise in more situations than other people can.A wealthy black man can have a lot of privilege in his usual surroundings for example. But there are also places where that wealthy black man would be unwise to show his face if he values his life. He has some privilege at some times in some places but not in others.But some people can exercise their privilege in many places. Im a middle aged straight welleducated heathly white man. I can get away with a lot. A lot. That doesnt mean that Im always able to do whatever I want in every time and place but I am safe to do most things I want to do in most situations without getting hassled about it.My parents used to manage but not own an apartment building. The owner straight up told them to not rent out suites to black people my parents ignored him but still.... When I was older a housemate of mine was looking for another place to live because our lease was almost up he was having a hard time. He was a PhD student from Ghana. He told me about potential landlords making cracks to his face about him being fresh off the boat ie. a recent immigrant. Gee I wonder if him being black and a recent immigrant had anything to do with his trouble finding housing? But it was still easier for him to find housing than it would be for a poor black recent immigrant with little education. He still had some prvilege in that situation compared to some people. But not as much as I did.I didnt have much of a problem finding another place to live. I didnt have to put up with the same shit he did in that situation. I had privilege that he did not have in that situation. I have privilege in many situations. Not all but a whole lot.A white Jewish woman has privilege in a lot of situations too. I have more privilege than she would in most situations generally speaking. I dont have to worry about antiSemitism. But she doesnt always face antiSemitism. Her brother may face antiSemitism but not sexism. Also is she mentally ill? Poor? Is she an immigrant? There are lots of factors that allow someone to have more or less privilege in various circumstances.,nottheonion,d3lohy5,1,t5_2qnts

7815189,0,t1_d3ug1q8,gt Not about feeling raped. Its harder to explain to a younger kid who looks up to their molester especially a kid with raging hormones with pressure to find affirmation from society. Ive done a lot of alcohol and drug recovery work with primarily men. In my experience many men dont feel raped when they are molested or raped by older women. Many dont register the event as abuse at all. Ive known multiple guys  years sober long time for an addict lifes totally changed by then who couldnt figure out why they still had all sorts of issues with intimacy and just coming to realize that while they never thought of it as rape the situation plays a part some or huge in what fucked up their ability to have a healthy relationship as an adult. Sometimes theyve never talked about it with others in recovery not out of shame but because they wrongly didnt think it mattered. This whole news story has a disgusting lack of boundaries by the adults that should be supporting this kid whos right in the middle of adolescences. That lack of boundries doesnt bode well for this guy as he grows up. His parents are really doing a number on his head. Yes the teacher is attractive and yes the middle schooler me would have been excited about this situation. But as an adult Im glad I dont carry this type of disfunction in my head and heart.,nottheonion,d3uhpd6,2,t5_2qnts

7867057,0,t1_d40bit0,Then we are now at the following conundrumBrock Turner was not born broken. He was not born a future rapist. He is not a troublemaker looking to fuck up someones life out of malice or revenge. He did not see the woman and rub his hands together like a comic book villain and think to himself I know Im going to ruin her life possibly forever!Then why would he rape someone? Why would that ever cross his mind? How could that ever be part of what to do when you find a woman unconscious on the street?I know rape is bad. I would never do it. You know rape is bad. You would never do it. Brock Turner knows rape is bad. He would never  but he did. Why?Rape culture says Because some part of the culture he was exposed to as he was growing up made him think somehow that sticking his dick in an unconscious woman was a better decision than not sticking his dick in an unconscious woman.Brock Turner did a monstrous thing but he is not a monster. We conclude then that somewhere somehow in his odd years of life he has managed to get so badly confused by society that he chose to do this monstrous act because he somehow did not realize the gravity of his actions.Either he did not realize what he was doing was rape or he did not believe that what he was doing was as bad as it is not a big deal so to speak.If he realized just how bad what he was doing was he would never have done it.Still following?Im reminded of a story I read on here about a guy who bit a baby duck to death when he was a child. What kind of fucked up kid bites a baby duck to death? An innocent one who didnt realize baby duck beaks were soft and full of blood vessels.

He could certainly compete against pro women and make millions which does not require you to be the greatest ever.  He would not have that opportunity in mens tennis.

7943781,0,t1_d48wry5,Im not saying you cant have guns for hunting etc.  Im saying it needs to be fucking reasonably regulated.  It should not be easier to obtain a license  purchase a lethal weapon than it is to obtain a license to drive a mode of transportation.  Thats undeniable logic.  Did you pass a background check? Has your mental health been evaluated? Have you demonstrated the ability to correctly usearmdisarm the firearm?  How many other firearms do you own?  Do you intend to hand these firearms down to other members of your family?  There are too many cracks and loopholes in the current legislation that are a contributing factor to the massacre.  If the man had been denied purchase of the weapon through stricter legislation formerly being on FBI watch list twice the massacre may have been prevented.  You cant say well he would have found a way to get it some other way. Bullshit. You dont know that.  You absolutely dont know that.The only civilized westernworld country that has mass shootings nearly every day is the United States. Its no coincidence that said other civilized countries have gun control laws that limit the supply of guns and have reasonable laws to restrict the sale to qualified individuals.

These collectibles arent considered circulated currency and generally will only be accepted by certain bank branches that can return the coin back to the Mint.  These coins are useless to use as everyday currency as no business can accept it since it isnt considered circulated currency.

7988022,0,t1_d4dwki6,Like I said given the circumstances I dont really care. I just wish it was more like  people died instead of  gay people died. Thats how I looked at it.  innocent people died. Even if I said they were all sinners  innocents just died. I dont support hate crimes I was very sad when I found out how bad it was and I think that the Christians who said things like they deserve to die are fakers especially since the point is to save people and you can do that if people are dead. And personally I dont like arguments for gay rights only because of societal changes that will force someone to eventually accept it or be outcast if they dont agree with it. There is literally no difference in views besides words. Haha. And the issue is actually still split fairly evenly. Equality for one side is not equality. Instead of shifting to middle ground we went from one side to the other which is not how to do it. So thats why I dont consider it supporting true equality. But just by saying these things people get upsetwhich is my point. I support the right to anyones speech no matter how bad because that is what America was founded on. Old times it was our country vs being part of yours. And people were killed for speaking out on one side or the other along with being treated differently. Is that not the same as today? Equality would be me being able to say I dont support their views but I am very sad that someone would do this. Without anyone looking at me any differently. The same for you possibly and them I dont support Christianity and I think its dumb but I am glad that Chic Fil A attempted to get people to donate blood. I apologize for bringing so many different issues into this it just riles me up and I am mad that it has become gay vs straight instead of just mourning or at least a conversation on gun violence and now Ive started talking about it. ,nottheonion,d4dxhmk,-9,t5_2qnts

Yet Islam is perceived as this hate filled religion because of the very very fucked up things some people do in its name. Christianity is associated with Santa Claus. So many feel a need to remind you that despite public perception in much of the Western World Islam is no more inherently evil than Christianity. Hell look at Christianity during the Crusades  technically if you chart the religions by age Islam is in its Crusaders period now.

8023356,0,t1_d4hm1ag,Thanks for mentioning the FBI study Id not heard ofread it yet. I have to say I have always suspected that the bigger is better and stopping power nonsense was a myth and that a mm was more than fine for basically every purpose other than like you said killing animals. The only argument Id ever heard against the mm that I thought was credible was the idea of overpenetration because of its high velocity relative to other rounds...but that only matters if youre shooting FMJ which I dont think most people who are carrying defensively are and Ive never heard of people having an overpenetration problem with expanding ammunition. But at the time of buying my SW SO MANY PEOPLE were doing the whole bigger is better nonsense that they managed to talk me into a larger caliber in the . which I regret. Im a fairly small person and honestly a . is just a lot of recoil for me so I split the difference between the mm and ..

8026806,0,t1_d4i6i4x,Thats because people are hopelessly stupid.They fire smaller caliber rounds than most pistols but they fire rounds which have much more power behind them  they have more propellant in them than mm and other larger caliber pistol rounds which is why theyre much longer than pistol rounds. Combined with the longer barrel of a rifle which gives the bullet more time to accelerate and rifles fire bullets at vastly higher velocities than pistols.Because the energy delivered is a factor of mv increasing the velocity of the round increases the power of the round by vastly more than the mass.Thus rifles are much more powerful than handguns despite the fact that they use smaller bullets.,nottheonion,d4iae0i,6,t5_2qnts

The American Bill of rights was modeled on a legal concept known at the time as The Fundamental Rights of Englishmen a concept that all men had certain fundamental rights some of which had been codified into the Magna Carta the English Bill of Rights and other legal documents over the preceding century.

Your edited question is whether at least some level of communistic economic theory would exist. This is not the same question at all whatsoever.

Join any and every cluborganizationchurch that will let you join at a distance and become active on their message boards.  Ask people lots of questions and endear them to you.b Simultaneously figure out what companies you want to work for and in which job capacities.  Find out who their HR Manager is read every press release they have launched in the past year read up what the internet thinks about them read their yelp reviews if applicable. Use your connections to build bridges to the companies you want to work for.  The degrees rule works incredibly well in the US.  If you desperately needed to get a message to the President there is some node path that goes from you to him in  moves or less unless youve burned every bridge youve ever walked.  In that vein you can easily get in touch with any company out there if you are willing to network. Set up informational interviews with your new connections at these companies.  Use these to demonstrate your total interest in the companies and subtly indicate why your skills are a good match for the needs of the company.  Make a good impression  this should be exactly like successful flirting on a first date. When a job opens up at one of these companies submit your resume and IMMEDIATELY reach out to the people with whom you conducted informational interviews and ask if theyd be willing to put in a good word for you to both HR and the Hiring Manager for the position.  At this point theres basically a  chance you will get invited to do a phone or inperson interview. Ace the interviews.  Negotiate your starting date.  You may need to start your move before the final interviews so ensure that you have  months worth of reserve cash to live on until youre hired  goes a long way in canned goods and dollar menu items if you need to sleep in your car find a nearby area owned by the BLMNPS that offers night parking,nottheonion,d4or70k,1,t5_2qnts

8092273,0,t1_d4pn2iv,gtI dont know where you have been all your lifeNot  years ago. I doubt you were around back then eh?From the linkgtHere Jesus identifies three classes of men who should not marry women. Taking his categories in reverse order first there are those who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven i.e. those who foreswear marriage to better serve God. Second he mentions those who have been made eunuchs by others an apparent reference to castrated males. But Jesus mentions a third category  eunuchs who were born that way. Some might argue that Jesus was referring to males born without testicles but this would be extremely rare. Moreover this interpretation ignores how the term born eunuchs was used in other literature of the time.gtIn the ancient world including ancient Jewish culture as reflected in the Talmud natural or born eunuchs were not associated with missing testicles.,nottheonion,d4pn7zb,2,t5_2qnts

The article says viewers have voiced their anger and shows screenshot of a tweet actual tweet from Sue Simmonds thoughts on the BBCs coverage. Sue Simmonds appears to be just some random person. There are only  other people quoted Anne McCarth Susan Mooney and Elle Gliftlands. Not that they were interviewed by the writer and there is no indication of to where these seemingly randomly people either posted to social media or made these quotes to anyone or any place else.Maybe these are famous or well known people I just havent heard of. Then again this article was posted in their TV amp Showbiz section and its not like they would have an article posted  minutes before in their Sports section with the headline Angry Viktor Troickis Wag Suncica Travica is sure to cheer up her boyfriend after umpire rage Im not sure what a Wag is but the tagline Serb ace lost his temper in spectacular meltdown  but busty model girlfriend will have him smiling again soon gives you an idea of the quality tennis article.Maybe I just dont understand tennis?,nottheonion,d4yu8i8,1,t5_2qnts

8246297,0,t1_d58bxn9,Yeah.. But I didnt say there arent corrupt cops. The vast majority of them arent corrupt at all. If youve worked in a union environment youve seen the thin blue line at work a thousand times. Protecting your own isnt exclusive to LEO. Theres no reason to shit on a group of thousands of people. Cops are by and large great people. This is a problem with unions in general and I am pro UnionIts just that the usual interactions people have with them have a negative connotation. Nobody wants to pay  bucks because they had an honest slip of mind.. But the cops job is to make sure they wont do it again. The anti police sentiment practiced by millennials and the Reddit hivemind is very sad for me to see.

Could you imagine if instead of food inspectors we had police officers doing health inspections and tearing restaurants inside out looking for drugs?

But it describes nothing and it is by design a word to put the other person on the defense of their patriotismThen you bring up disaffected black communities and then you work in a jab on liberals like the conservatives always seem to do.

So the bag of whatever is still going to be heated to death and have random hot and cold spots and be soggy. What is likely to improve is the choices available better menu planning and perhaps some customization etc. cant hope that chicken will be freshly grilled or the eggs cooked just right in a large industrial kitchen. ,nottheonion,d5gutpf,1,t5_2qnts

He told us tales of hunting pigeons every morning to sell to some restaurants in Chinatown stay away from Mott st casserole joints and other rambunctious things he would get into. We would see him setting up his sleeping area at that little handball park on Spring St and felt badly that he would refuse all offers of help.

8399753,0,t1_d5qwhhm,gtThe fact that the majority of Americans are monolingual is not something to be proud of. Its something to hide and be ashamed of.Im curious whether you would say the same about people in other countries. Canadians outside of Quebec Mexicans Hondurans Chileans etc to speak of the Western Hemisphere. In fact all across North and South America most people are monolingual. Probably has something to do with having one massive Englishspeaking region a massive Spanishspeaking region and a very large Portuguesespeaking region. gtI would argue that monolinguals arent quality teachers. Theyre probably monocultural have likely never lived extensively abroad.What exactly is your solution to provide education to the tens of millions of children in the U.S. on this criteria? Teaching already pays far too little  how does a teacher born into a working class or lower middle class family afford to be a world traveler that takes a couple years of his or her life to learn a second language? You seem like youre either from Europe and hence surrounded by a huge variety of languages and foreign countries which are relatively easy to travel to or youre arrogant about your experience that gave you three languages. Youre denigrating huge swaths of teachers who have no practical means or motivation to learn a foreign language or especially to live extensively abroad. ,nottheonion,d5rikld,1,t5_2qnts

With all the funds and grants charlatans are asking governments and tax payers and alumni for to be like their hero Darwin sailing around tropical islands screwing the local women and sipping tea coming up with unprovable nonsense and the extremely obvious.  But dont worry when your local museum holds its annual history of man exhibit for . a ticket you may see my point when you see mannequins dressed up as human ape abominations and round rocks somebody picked up at the creek claiming its mans early tools. Or a bunch of cave men throwing spears and grunting.  Or fake plaster molds of creatures that never existed like Lucy the ape woman and fantastical unprovable abominations and missing links.Its a joke those exhibits its science fiction and its big bucks.

If it was mentioned who the attacking country was I missed it since I dont recall any mention. Anyhow events take place mostly in the the four corners region of the US as the children of our hero are caught in the aftermath of the explosion cars wont run and know that if they can just get home to the ranch and Dad with a capital D everything will be OK.gtSince there are no cars running walking or bicycles seem to be the only way to get around. Those of you familiar with the high desert of the Four Corners region know what kind of a rugged landscape is and its winter and snowing to boot  but no worries these kids are H.E.A.L.T.H.Y. and can handle it all. Plus any dangerous peeps about and theyre loaded to the hilt with firearms just like Dad with a capital D taught them. Oh and since Dad with a capital D was wise and believed in an old prophecy by one of the Mormon gurus hes been stocking up on food for years and even stashing it in supersecret places all over all the back roads leading to the ranch for the kids to find it on their way through the dangerous high country. And they actually found those caches despite the heavy snow. For realz.gtSPOILERS AHEAD after the kids get to the ranch and everyones safe except Dads wife who didnt believe in carrying guns so the baddies knocked her off in the first chapter theres all kinds of kerfuffles in the community over them having lots of food stashed away and it should be shared with everyone else who wasnt smart enough to stash away. That all leads to a big stand off and our hero packs up his guns and thus ensues some big shootemup. Why he would fire on his neighbors and not negotiate? Dunno but even worse afterwards our hero is judge jury and executioner over a female government employee that he resented over the whole thing and gtgtgtgtreal spoilergtgtgthe strung her up on his rope and hung her.gtEND SPOILERS.gtIsnt he special? Not. Now to the writing itself Ill quote some text and make comments so you can decide for yourself. Sarcasm font is on folks.gt...like L.A. civil unrest was starting to break out there as well. To avoid that I had chosen to take I and circle around through Flagstaff. From there I would go north staying on Highway  which passed through Page crossing the Colorado River at the Glen Canyon Dam. From Page the ranch was less than an hour and a half away.gtFirst person narrative  as taught by EL James and thats not a compliment. And theres even a footnote somewhere to tell the ignorant reader that most places in the book really exist. Like the Grand Canyon. Good to know thats a real place sarcasm font is on folks.gtBeneath my camo jacket I had on my tactical vest. The right side of the vest had six round magazines for my AR. The left side had my  Sig Saur auto with two extra magazines above it. Along with my  auto I still had my  Colt revolver strapped to my hip. I had been unable to part with it and the weight of it resting on my thigh was comforting.gtTMI. Oh and did I mention that anytime any new weapon is introduced to the story theres a footnote giving the reader for more unnecessary detail on said weapon? And theres a whole bunch of weapons in this short book. Oh and did I mention a lot of other footnotes stating facts  with no backup documentation  just the authors word that those are facts. And then there was a footnote to tell we stupid readers what loaded for bear means.gtNow a sample of the ohsoheavyhanded rhetoric that litters the pages.gtWhat fools in Washington thought that by unilaterally disarming ourselves it would make the rest of the world like us more? There were actual fools in Washington but there were also traitors. Traitors that knew this would happen. They would not be the ones caught by surprise.gtI used to take pride in the Eagle Badge I had earned. Now I wouldnt want anyone to know that I had been a Scout. The Boy Scout organization had violated their own Scout oath their oath to be morally straight.gtThe ideal of Americanism had been twisted so as to become a mirror opposite.gtI have lots more but thats enough I think to get the point across what to expect in this book. Lastly back to current event in Oregon I couldnt resist highlighting a few sentences that I would call potmeetkettle. You be the judge.gtLiving and breathing was just another way of saying Words mean whatever we want them to mean.gtIt was a hard and fast line in his world. If you did not earn it if you did not pay for it if it was not given to you it wasnt yours.gtWe should be free to make stupid choices if we want and then be allowed to experience the full weight of those choices.gtAmen to that people who make a dumb choice should pay the consequences of their heedless actions. ,nottheonion,d5uvn6i,27,t5_2qnts

8435497,0,t1_d5vwo0m,The BBC recently linked a bit of research concerned the gender pay gap in the UK. To give a very brief summary theres a . gender pay gap using median hourly wage excluding overtime for fulltime workers. Already the way its measured accounts for hours worked men working more overtime maternitypaternity leave and women working parttime more. Of course its not concerned with people working identical jobs. I dont think anyone seriously complaining about the pay gap from an educated perspective believes that a bunch of malicious cackling businessmen in shady rooms are conspiring to pay women less than men though  its about how society is implicitly set up to pressure women and men into different things a part of that scary patriarchy word where women are subtly coerced into lowerpaying work and men into longer hours in higher positions along with more dangerous work why men account for  of workplace deaths. This isnt even accounting for subtle discrimination like men feeling threatened by female bosses seen here that accounts for women ending up in less wellpaid work. This doesnt just account for women choosing different jobs though  imagine youre managing a team of lawyers for a client. They all do separate bits of work you dont really get involved in and then you split up the pay depending on how much everyone does. If youve got a bunch of stereotypically in control and louder men along with stereotypically quieter women less likely to talk over people and act aggressively as the sexes are generally socialised to be youre probably going to pay the more outspoken guys more regardless of who did more work just because on the surface they appear to have done more by virtue of their behaviour. Some payment schemes disadvantage women based on how theyre socialised when being raised and various social pressures for speaking out etc. The research mentions that theres a negative gender pay gap for parttime work where men are paid less than women and this just goes to show how the whole patriarchy thing is hurting men and women in this area in particular. Men are expected by society to provide for the family and take on the long hours and dangerous or highpaying jobs and so dont seem to have access to as many wellpaid parttime jobs as women because theyre seen by society as womens jobs.,nottheonion,d5vz63j,38,t5_2qnts

Your friends were wrong your stepdaughter is wrong with all her liberal arts bullshit you were right all along about the blacks and hispanics and now the potential ruler of the USA agrees with you. Trump is super validating for bigots thats really all it boils down to. Ive lived with these people and thats it. They dont care about the bankruptcies or hypocrisy or the things Trump said they just recount all the times theyve been shunned and told they were wrong for saying racist bullshit that they think is a mundane fact of life and other people over react about it cause of PC culture or something.

8443282,0,t1_d5wy2rl, That is a copy of an email sent by the Bernie Sanders campaign. AKA they are sending the text of what the Bernie camp is saying about them. They are the ones accusing the DNC of laundering money.  Were money laundering in the public statements we file with the FEC is a pretty absurd statement. At the point in time this was written the downballet races hadnt started yet. Hell some primaries still arent over. You fundraise and you fundraise but youre not going to know where youre actually going to need it until much closer to September. What if for instance an incumbent Republican who youd need to spend lots of money to try unseating gets primaried by a crazy Tea Partier? You can probably spend less there. What they are doing is putting all the money in one place so that it can be sent out to the downticket races as needed later on. Hillary Victory Fund is a fund for all democratic races not just the presidential race. Its not money laundering its a smart allocation plan for resources. Its also legal.

I bought a picture pack years before and more than likely Getty acquired the company I bought it from and said I now owe Getty.

8487038,0,t3_4vubih,Ill play devils advocate for a bit because no one has asked the question what if Getty contracts photographers to provide images and one of those photographers falsely claimed to own her images?

8489026,0,t1_d62krlk,It looks like a twohour PG actioncomedy about a ragtag group of outcasts misfits and criminals who have to come together against all odds to go on a highstakes mission to save the world. They have a small amount of support from the government and are mostly men with one weird animalguything. The cast is a few huge Alist stars and a number of relative noname actors. The franchise is based off of a comic storyline that very few people had ever heard of and the film has been paired with a soundtrack of some of the biggest classic rockpop songs of all time.

Judging by the trailer Letos looks like he tried to copy Hamill but then got distracted watching reruns of sons of anarchy. His particular Joker isnt really a good candidate for method and so far the end product looks forgettable and somewhat cringey.I think it would be hilarious to see him dressed up in full weeping pagliachi makeup and all of his minions are dressed in tacky suits wearing giant mascot heads.

So youre telling me some Muslims in London offering the Quran in English to nonMuslims to spread Islam are in fact giving away books that dont make sense!?Languages are codewords which give out a message and intention. When we translate languages we dont just change the words we create a new sentence which holds the same meaning message and intention of the original sentence.Do you hear yourself speak? The Quran a holy book doesnt make sense when translated to English? Why? Oh Im sorry is it because the Quran is too good for English? Rude.So if I speak English whats the point of learning Arabic? Its like what they say if you cant explain it simply you dont know it well enough. Meaning if Muslims cant translate the Quran to the point where it is understandable and makes sense then do they really know it well?What language is this?

I was offered more than double my salary along with a promotion that amounted to  rungs higher up on the hierarchy ladder to go out there on a  year contract. When I told the headhunter that I couldnt possibly function in that elevated role because I lack the necessary experience his answer was trust me nobody gives a shit. If you have a degree then theyll let you make up your own title out there. You want triple your salary instead of double? Theyd be willing to give it to you. Literally tell me what you need and I can get it approved for you. This tells me that all the horrible safety stories you are hearing about the world cup are absolutely true.

So I just get worried about labeling testimonials as evidence.This is what I think the problem truly is.  Society doesnt give a shit about exculpatory evidence and no court can change that. If theres an accusation made then everyone assumes its true.  Even if theres evidence otherwise later people still think its true. Look at the Duke lacrosse case. Some people still think those lacrosse players avoided penalty because they were rich white jocks.  I just dont that means we should eliminate accusations altogether.  Especially in the context of child molestation as were discussing here.  My hunch is that most of the time a child claiming her father raped her probably isnt lying.  And there almost never will be any physical evidence that couldnt be explained through innocuous ways.,nottheonion,d6j4dc4,0,t5_2qnts

The one I was referring to was the Kanin  study which in my opinion is very well done.gtIn  Eugene J. Kanin of Purdue University investigated the incidences of false rape allegations made to the police in one small urban community in the Midwest United States population  between  and . He states that unlike in many larger jurisdictions this police department had the resources to seriously record and pursue to closure all rape complaints regardless of their merits. He further states each investigation always involves a serious offer to polygraph the complainants and the suspects and the complainant must admit that no rape had occurred. She is the sole agent who can say that the rape charge is false.gtThe number of false rape allegations in the studied period was  this was  of the  total complaints filed in this period. The researchers verified whenever possible for all of the complainants who recanted their allegations that their new account of the events matched the accuseds version of events.gtAfter reviewing the police files Kanin categorized the false accusations into three broad motivations alibis revenge and attentionseeking. These motivations were assigned prevalence of roughly   and  respectively. This categorization was supported by the details of complainant recantations and other documentation of their cases.gtKanin also investigated the combined police records of two large Midwestern universities over a threeyear period  and found that  of the reported forcible rapes were determined to be false accusations  of the total . No polygraphs were utilized the investigations were the sole responsibility of a ranking female officer and a rape charge was only counted as false under complainant recantation. In this sample the motivations mentioned above were roughly evenly split between alibi and revenge with only one case characterized as attentionseeking.,nottheonion,d6j7pks,1,t5_2qnts

The teacher called the social services or whoever and it turns out that the person she was accusing was  years old... He didnt even know what sex was. If he had been any older she could have ruined this kids life.For the record my half sister is batshit crazy. My mother got into contact with her a couple years ago She lost custody after a nasty divorce from her abusive husband she wasnt allowed to see three of her children for  years due to some fucked up circumstances and they ultimately lost touch. My mother is a victim of rape and my half sister found this out not sure how she then proceeded to spin a tale of how an older family friend brutally raped her multiple times in vivid detail and it honestly fucked my mom up. After some digging she  found out that this person was dead and during the time the abuse had supposedly been going on he had been incapable of taking care of himself due to medical reasons as well as the fact that he was almost  years old . There were already holes in her story so things were Shady to begin with. Long story short she did a lot of shit like this and eventually my mother cut her off. Something Im very glad for.

8630925,0,t1_d6kakyb,The house was dead silent as Dick trudged up the cobbled bath through the garden peering from underneath the shade of his hand as the bright midday sun beat down upon his milky skin. The door was ajar the lock broken and streaks of blood were visible on the glass pane so naturally Dick thought it was only polite to knock. The gentle rapping of his knuckles against the partially shattered door echoed through the hallway beyond so he took the time to hammer out the eighties hit Tainted Love admiring the acoustic properties before stepping inside. Great song he thought to himself hanging up his hat and taking off his shoes by instinct. Apparently this house was too similar to his which would have unnerved him were he not as equally dim as the room he was standing in. He set off down the hallway broken glass shards threatening to pierce his feet with every step. Dick silently thanked himself for wearing two layers of socks despite the heat of the day and continued forward. Strange faces leered at him from the picture frames though he concluded that they were all too small for a ScoobyDooesque peephole he studied them closely anyway.Must be a real Socialite Dick mused as he viewed numerous pictures of unknown friends family and pets. His personal preference was to leave the stock photos in any frames he purchased. Their smiles brought muchneeded happiness into his life which lacked any real family outside of Uncle Eric and the thought of putting him on the wall made Dick uneasy. He put it down to his own steadily growing and increasingly crippling fear of peepholes.As he rounded the corner into the kitchen a rich stench of spoiled food filled his nostrils or at least one he was having one of those bad sinus days. An obscenely large pile of unwashed dishes rose before him like an enormous postrepast Taj Mahal rising high above the countertop and threatening to drop to the floor like a single girl in her early twenties. Dick experienced a hint of admiration for the atypical artwork that stood before him before gagging and turning away. He figured that nothing good was going to come from investigating that particular ingestion section and pressed onward through the other rooms of the house.,nottheonion,d6kgzct,2,t5_2qnts

Theyve also been watered down and bred for more tame temperaments longer than the pitbull terrier but are still more terrifying to me. At least with a pitbull you have a fighting chance. Eventually the pitbull will go the way of the English bulldog once a fierce fighting dog now a sweet mutant.Pitbulls are the product of bulldogs being crossed to now extinct English terriers.

Even more so when you consider that streets have stop lights stop signs crosswalks those lights that tell you when to walk sidewalks etc. In other words we do a damn lot to keep people safe on streets.Im largely against zoos in the first place. Even if research is done at them their goals are profit not research. They have a conflict of interests. They could pen the gorillas off more make it so people cant even get that close but they wont.

Nor did I stop to think about the normal workers like teachers etc. I guess the solution is to diversify the economy away from tourism but thats easier said than done.I wonder if the islands with municipal governments will be able to manage their own visa requirements or will it be decided by the central government in Madrid.E.g Fuerteventura might decide they dont want to risk inviting British louts but Tenerife might have the resources to deal with those problems.,nottheonion,d6uo3ok,2,t5_2qnts

Also I love betta fish theyre such great fish.Edit punctuationIts not a joke though I understand how absurd it sounds. Its mostly minor things like treating a wound they get from bumping into something too hard or scraped off scales. I just hold them and apply ointment or add treatment to the water. I also have an Oranda that needs trimming sometimes. I think a better question is why would I let one of my pets suffer when I could do something simple to help?

Thats average death at  with four of the said ten are missing over  year of working and paying taxes to the government. Even though average lung cancer diagnose is usually at higher age I believe you get my point. nonsmokers are more likely to not die during their working age and therefore pay more taxes.

If a symbol is coopted by a particular crowd and used in a series of highprofile ways over a period of time that symbol is going to absorb and become associated with the connotations that that crowd brings with it at least as far as the wider cultural psyche is concerned. It has nothing to do with any kind of conscious decision or instruction you cant just be told that X  y and be expected to accept that. But every time somebody posts a picture on Facebook or Twitter or whatever of Pepe in some kind of horrible context he comes closer  in the eyes of the general public at least  to becoming a symbol of hate. And even if Im wrong about there being more negative examples of Pepe memes than there are positive which do you think the layperson is going to remember thereby colouring their perception of the meme in a wider context? I feel like people on here forget that theres a whole world out there  and this isnt necessarily a generational thing  of people who find the concept of Pepe and other memes to be incredibly bizarre regardless of whatever connotations they might have on redditchanwhatever.,nottheonion,d853ehv,0,t5_2qnts

9117841,0,t1_d87skjn,I posted this above link below but the gist is that regardless of the impression this gives us Redditors the facts dont add up to a charge of obstruction of justice.  Hillary Clinton did not actively try to commit any crimes nor did she try to actively hide her actions as SoS.  She was just lazy when it came to dealing with her email server.  For whatever reason they decided to just set it up on a Mac in her house.  But just keep in mind every email she sent or received that related to government was sent or received by a government server and that stuff is available.  If Hillary wanted to do something secret she could have a secret gmail account or something else completely unrelated to this server.gtComey FBI looked hard for obstruction of justice in Clinton email probegtJohnson said the failure to prosecute anyone in the case created the appearance of a twotiered system of justice but Comey insisted that was not the case and that other cases where there was a prosecution involved aggravating factors not present in the Clinton probe.I think had we recommended prosecution it would have been a twotiered system of justice Comey declared.,nottheonion,d87texs,1,t5_2qnts

9121435,0,t1_d881dcj,Nope. Even many binary trans people read trans people who are transitioning from male to female or female to male dont expect their pronouns to be respected and in many cases their expectation is met. I doubt anyone who does use pronouns outside of heshethey feels entitled to those pronouns ignoring case  that I talked about. Theyre likely asking politely in the hopes that people who respect them will take it seriously and use the pronouns that make them comfortable.and as uhamiltonicity said theres plenty of people who will have preferences for nicknames or use their middle name instead of their first. There are people who will really dislike certain adjectives or being called certain things ex for a while I fucken hated being called cute. Product of dysphoria but there you go. Everyone has preferences on things and in the end one person with unusual pronouns if you ever even meet one I know like  or  trans people on my campus and none of them use anything beyond heshethey wont ruin your life or even make it particularly difficult.,nottheonion,d888x5v,3,t5_2qnts

The AI in the simulation doesnt question its simulation because it cant yet. It doesnt have the capacity to synthesize ideas itself that arent coded into variables yet.What happens when AI reaches a point where it can synthesize ideas based on gathered evidence and not variable data. We will have a simulated person who for all intents and purposes simulates life but exists inside a simulation.If we can do that in our imperfect little world. Which is not a stretch how can we be sure we cant be part of a grandeur simulation ourselves.Also nitpicking one misplaced word in his premise is petty and encourages fighting rather then argument discussion and debate.If we as humans can create a realistic simulation of our life then you cant logically conclude we cant be a simulation because logically if we can create one so could another set of beings on another level.Now if you truly believe this conversation is a waste of time.

9202779,0,t1_d8ihrv6,Not sure since Im not a woman I cant pretend to know what is a wolf.  but I can tell you with certainty an athlete yelling at a referee isnt. Its all a show that even the players probably dont take seriously and Id be surprised if the ref wanted any extra attention towards this situation. If you demand respect for this ref because shes a woman you then have to follow those same rules for the male refs or it becomes an actual sexist response to something originally was an insult meant to attack the ref using a sexist stereotype. If you make it so male players now cant insult the refs anymore it would seem to be a fair solution except for the fact that already should have been in place if you cared about the verbal abuse the refs take. By making a change now it just highlights it didnt matter to the league  but they have to make a public display to seem fair to the justice warriors that really cant dont or wont see how silly this situation is. Personally  if they would have fined the players for taking to twitter and making it a larger issue and donated that money to a womans charityshelter in the area it would have been a better way to show an effort to fix a mistake out of anger than just make a show out of it for people it doesnt affect without doing any real help to anyone. ,nottheonion,d8iiqcf,1,t5_2qnts

Yesterday we were talking about Syria and he said we need to remove Assad since he bombed schools and hospitals. I had to remind him they are in a war we did the same in Iraq and war is not supposed to be an invasion of guys in white rebuilding and making everything nice to the people being invaded it is people going in with camo and guns blowing and shooting people.

9350797,0,t1_d915d1f,As what most people would consider a democrat as well Im in complete agreement with you. There is something inside democrats that consider themselves to be on the moral high ground however more of these stories go around about them because I feel they think Republicans are worse. Republicans on the other hand know they arent the moral high ground and dont care that they arent or what other people think in general. I think it absolutely has to do with the perception of one side against the other and also how they enjoy being seen.I feels Democrats generally look at people on the right as immoral and angry so they justify doing dumb ass shit like this to them while saying well theyre MORE immoral than me because X Y and Z. Almost as if they deserve it.I feel Republicans generally look at people on the left as entitled and lazy and kind of just want to be left alone. To go out of their way would go against their ideals of small government and to keep what is theres guns taxes women. They want people out of their way not in their way.

9351217,0,t1_d908l3j,I found that the long wheelbase box truck is very controllable when sideways. Averaged about MPH down a mountain on a single lane gravel road trying to keep up with my buddy who races v touring cars who was driving a minivan. I lost but I did manage to scare some other drivers as a box truck came sliding around a turn sideways. I accidentally jumped one on a back road shuttling with about  people in the back with bikes. I was in the back with about  others and our bikes rocking out with our portable amp in lawn chairs when we got about  feet of air according to the passenger up front who was cackling like a hyena. Most of us broke the chairs upon landing. Those are probably the better ones though the deer at MPH was quite exciting especially from the minivan behind it. Instantly tenderized and cubed. Then the numerous minivan burnouts and drifting Kia traction control will kick in if disabled at around a  degree slide. I jumped a few minivans was in a few that were jumped and got to laugh at the poor souls in the one that was multiple feet off the ground in Moab UT which is also where I jumped an Expedition. Well more of chassis slapped it into the air. Every other weeend or so some poor van or box truck was abused. The box trucks drift better than cargo vans and minivans but minivans do better burnouts and feel less like a dance with death over MPH. ,nottheonion,d91c1tx,2,t5_2qnts

And also that economists making predictions about this thing is a dicey thing for them to do because there isnt much of any relevant precedent for something like this. I think economists who predict a short to medium term downturn might be right. Change is always hard. However I also think most people who voted leave did so because of looooong term considerations  years rather than the  years that economists are talking about.

9624340,0,t1_d9zcauz,Okay lets forget about the legitimacy of the crimes lets say everyone who got a prison sentence did something bad. The problem then is longer prison sentences actually increase recidivism reoffending rather than reduce it even when you control for prior sentences and psych evals of risk of reoffending. So longer sentences mandatory sentences mandatory minimums increase crime rather than reduce it but with prisoners making products for next to nothing anyone who gains from that has reason to desire that effect be ignored and for prison populations to be increased anyway. Fifty studies dating from  involving  offenders produced  correlations between recidivism and a length of time in prison and recidivism or b serving a prison sentence vs. receiving a communitybased sanction. The data was analysed using quantitative methods i.e. metaanalysis to determine whether prison reduced criminal behaviour or recidivism. The results were as follows under both of the above conditions prison produced slight increases in recidivism,nottheonion,d9zecs7,1,t5_2qnts

The most powerful vote would be this occasional nonvoter vote.  So there is this likelihood and impact scale.

Then he could pull you out of your car and make you take a sobriety test. Since hes pissed hell make clues out of nonclues  it doesnt matter if theyre accurate or not and  sober people fail sobriety tests when the officer isnt trying to fail them. Thats the courts job sometime in the next twothree months. Hell make you take a breathalyzer. Youll pass. Hell insist youre intoxicated and take you to the hospital for a blood test. Now that blood test takes a few weeks to get back. Which means now youre under arrest for suspected DUI and youre completely sober.And an hour or two later youre in the county jail in one of two bad situations  It happened Tuesday night tomorrow is Wednesday. This is good because youll get an arraignment sometime that day. This is bad because the people in jail on Tuesday night are actual fucking criminals.  It happened Friday night tomorrow is Saturday. This is good because the other people in jail on friday night are drunks and idiots. This is bad because the judge might not be in until Monday. Which means you get to spend the next  hours in jail. Even though youve done nothing wrong.Then you get to pay to bail yourself out. And you get to pay to get your car out of impound. So now youre out somewhere between  possibly spent the weekend in jail and will probably get to go to court  times which youll have to miss work for before the state drops your case because the blood results show you were Sober. And thats assuming that the DA is an actual human being. He could possibly try to convict you anyway for being in a poor condition to drive e.g. too tired too emotional...whatever. And since you failed the field sobriety test theyll have evidence of this and all they have to do is be willing to waste the time to sell it to a jury. And at that point you could be out another k to get a lawyer to defend you from the ludicrous bullshit. Because if you have a public defender and theyre still trying to prosecute you even though the blood results show you were sober  youre fucked if you dont. And even then theres the legitimate chance that you could lose! The officer and the DA just have to make you look bad in front of the jury. And if you got a bad panel out of jury selection youre fucked. Your dashcam will not save you from a vindictive officer. ,nottheonion,da4qe8r,1,t5_2qnts

So its actually the private sector doing the work. The DoE issues requirements etc... They also manage nuclear weapons stockpiles.For decades the DoE always has atleast one supercomputer in the top  for most powerful supercomputers in the world. Its primary purpose is to simulate nuclear reactors for the navy and nuclear weapons for the for the rest of the DoD. Since we have treaties that ban us from detonating nukes we use supercomputers to simulate as tests to make sure they will still go off. We also need the simulators to make sure we dont give the  year olds who work on the reactors for the Navy cancer. Other  I think is research. Some at labs but alot if not most is grants. The shale boom came from grants by the DoE. Lithium Ion battery research funded by DoE. If you eliminate it they would at best be able to cut a small percentage. They would roll the molitary stuff under DoD... As if they dont have enough to do.... I dont hear any military generals going we need to do this too.

What experience does Rick Perry have with nuclear technology that qualifies him to run the DOE the Human Genome Project and National Labs e.g. Los Alamos? For the record Obamas SOE is Ernest Moniz who holds a PhD in nuclear physics from Stanford and was a chair professor at MIT. His predecessor was Steven Chu PhD in nuclear physics from Berkeley former director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Nobel Laureate Physics . Youre going to replace these guys with someone who has a BS in Animal Science from Texas AampM and has spent the last  years of his life in politics? WTF? I know were living in Idiocracy is a really cliche saying on Reddit... But were talking about nominating a guy whose entire understanding of physics comes from the required freshman physics class he took  years ago to head the fucking Department of Energy? Youre going to take a position that was historically staffed by the brightest physicists of our day and say yeah a layman could probably do this? A position as important as director of the agency that deals with nuclear bombs? Any schmo can do that?In that case why not make Sarah Palin the director of the CDC she watched a few episodes of General Hospital once... And lets make Stephen Baldwin the Attorney General too he was in Crimetime back in the s.  Then we can get the guy from Duck Dynasty to take over the CIA why not?    Sidenote They wanted to eliminate the Department of Energy? The guys who oversee the nuclear reactors and fuel refining?

9720417,0,t1_dab8drx,I hope this doesnt doublepost. Im using Relay for Reddit and it crashed the first time I typed this out. Anyway way before we get to theoretical concentrations of a single molecule in a substance we need to talk about limits of detection. Thats the lowest concentration of a specie that a given instrument can detect. What I was responding to and maybe I didnt make it clear again Relay doesnt let me see my original as Im typing and Im too far in to typing this to throw it away was concentrations obtained by diluting a pure substance  or  times. The resulting concentrations are absolutely detectable and quantifiable with common lab instruments like high pressure liquid carriers HPLC and liquid chromatography. Theoretical concentrations those that cant be measured like youre talking about when a molecule may or may not be present may not even be possible to reach if you care at all about maintaining a reasonable margin of error. There is at some point more likely to be more of a substance due to outside factors than the manufacturing process added. For example there is probably at some point more cesium and uranium in the substance due to atomic bomb testing than something that underwent a dilution of  times.,nottheonion,dab947j,1,t5_2qnts

Research and development is already at . billion for the first two years a number that is already budgeted and approved and the Government Accountability Office warned last year that the cost would be approximately . billion.

The other part of that model is basically the human centipede. There are real journalists who go sit through government meetings reporting and asking questions. Its not sexy but its required. Once in a while that effort results in a really interesting story or matter of public interest. Thats when sites like HuffPo swoop in. They then take all the information a journalist gathered rewrite it in a way designed to troll readership and it is of course super sharable on Facebook and reddit.

They can try and teach you a little but you are showing up with a lifetime of golf habits and you are there for  hours. They cant make miracles but they can give you good insight as an observer and also know the course better than you unless thats your home course. I didnt golf that much myself but being an observer of hundreds of golf rounds you really learn a lot about mechanics and personalities. You see so many swings strategies and ability level. . Dont get cute. Until you are good dont get cute. Take the bogey to avoid the triple bogey unless you need to beat someone for money on that hole. Over time only the scratch golfers where the only ones who said fuck it Im gonna for it and usually benefited from it. Golf routinely brutalizes people that try and take risks above their skill level. if you are by yourself or wont hold anyone up... drop a practice fuck it ball you are prepared to lose in those tough shots. Over time you learn your limits and get smarter. dont hold up your own or other groups though keep moving. If you want to stay the same skill level and are happy with it dont change anything. Screwing with you habits can fuck you over and make you even worse. Take literally no advice on mechanics or swings. . If you want to improve you have to be ready to break your bad habits and actually stay dedicated to fixing them. To many people get stuck in this awkward middle ground of  and . . Some people are just beyond help and improving after a certain point. Focus being fun to play with then. The absolute worst to caddy for is a shitty golfer with a shitty attitude. People will tolerate a lot for a fun partner. Golf is probably one of the most frustrating sports to take seriously. Think about it.  You are mashing this little white ball hundreds of yards next to woods. Shit will go wrong and lady luck will spit in your face if you let it bother you. . Dont be the jackass with like  gadgets and weird clubs from the golf channel with a heavy ass bag. Many good people can golf with  or  clubs for a reason. driver  wood  iron favorite pitching wedgehigh iron and putter over time you actually learn how to hit the ball different ways rather than sitting there trying to pull some things out out of your ass that you readordered in golf magazine.

Melbourne competes with Sydney Sydney is utterly oblivious to it which infuriates the Melburnians even more. Hell Sydney is pretty much oblivious to the rest of Oz bar a couple of good beaches near Byron to go to if funds are a bit tight to go overseas.It infuriates Melbourne even more when you double down with the above quote and point out that Sydney is as oblivious to them as an yr old is to his yr old brothers attempts to compete.Edit PS have an upvote to balance it,nottheonion,dbzix00,2,t5_2qnts

They show an overwhelming onesidedness to the male sex for perpetrating rape even among male victims. Women rape far less often in comparison and while it is obviously still an issue if we could only have as many female to male rapes as we did male to female then wed see a dramatic decrease in the overall amount and thatd be a huge improvement. Trying to make it about the male victim and pushing that narrative is far from some sense of altruism its thinly veiled selfserving bullshit. If you cared about the offense which you obviously should you wouldnt detract from the greater issue by pushing your personal politics. Can I appropriate the term virtue signalling here? Cause if its appropriate anywhere its in shit like this. Youre downplaying one by trying to shift the focus and further doubling down on it by insinuating the common and correct narrative that women are more often the victim of rape is inaccurate. ,nottheonion,dc584fe,4,t5_2qnts
10245011,0,t1_dc4r16j,The only thing you can study for fake accusations is the blatantly obvious ones. The ones where a college girl accused a man of assaulting her and going down on her on her way back from a party in public then someone published video of the event which clearly showed he even asked if he should stop and she told him to keep going. Or the one where the taxi driver was accused of raping girls where really he told them they couldnt smoke in his cab because it was against the law  and they didnt realize his cab had video survaillence built into it. Or the girl who said she was gang raped by frat guys at a frat party as a frat initiation ritual but her story was carefully constructed to take place at a time when there was no party there were no frat initations that semester the house was different than she described and the friend she said she met up with later said he met up with her but she told him a totally different story...  The problem is that actual rape victims often dont report their story to the cops because theyre afraid traumatized and dont want to relive the events if they think the guy wont be convicted anyways. But girls making the story up have no such reservations retelling a made up story is more entertaining than it is traumatic.

Anarchisms aim is to dismantle social economic and political hierarchies. Capitalism is by its nature a hierarchical system and therefore any political theory that incorporates capitalism cannot by the original definition be anarchist. Similarly the term libertarian was originally used in the political sense by anarchists after France banned anarchist organizations in the s. The right appropriated these terms for themselves but the political theories that they call anarchist or libertarian are best called proprietarianism or corporate feudalism. Your assertion that right wing theories are inherently more libertarian than left is based on an incomplete understanding of the variety of left wing politics. Not all leftwing theories embrace a centralized government. Theories that tend toward anarchism i.e. mutualism anarchosyndicalism communalism aim to localize power within democratically controlled municipalities and workplaces. This is meant to give the individual the absolute most amount of power over those affairs that influence him the most. Thats liberty.Right wing libertarian or anarchist theories however retain the social and economic hierarchies that end up exploiting the mass of people. The freedom to profit at anothers expense is no more libertarian than giving people the freedom to steal from people. All capitalist systems strip all autonomy from the individual by ignoring the social aspect of human relationships. The commodification of life itself is not liberatory it is slavery.If you want to learn more about anarchism study up on the Paris Commune the Spanish Revolution of  and what is currently happening in Rojava,nottheonion,dcqt00x,1,t5_2qnts

Hell the average democrat right now will gladly take Pence over Trump and Pence is far to the right of Romney who they dont like.As a Christian you surely must recognise how far Trump is from any Christian role model  he displays many characteristics that are the complete opposite of good Multiple marriages and affairs and playboy lifestyle even appearing in several soft porn videos The deadly sin of Lust adultery coveting thy neighbours wife breaking the th and th commandment Constant and obvious lying Bearing false witness th commandment The love of money to ridiculous levels and ostentatiousness Violent and angry tirades including raping but apparently not in a legal manner his wife His mistake of saying Two Corinthians rather than Second Corinthians demonstrates a grievous lack of knowledge and experience with the Bible. Repeatedly not paying his workers contractors and business partners That is stealing  th commandmentAnd he does not apologise or appear to try to better himself here  the only betterment he works on is for money and power.TLDRgt Liberals and Democrats criticise each other and dont shittalk other normal Republicans like you are claiming. Trump is different  he is a unChristian nasty man who has demonstrated for decades he will not honour his promises pay his bills or act in anyone elses interests. That is why Liberals are talking and acting like they are,nottheonion,dcr0ldj,12,t5_2qnts

Other politicians lie about things that may be somewhat subjective or that goes on behind closed doors which to be clear Im not saying is a good thing and when they get caught in their lies they admit they lied.  Trump will make up almost anything and when presented with overwhelming factual evidence will still deny the truth.  Hell its how his political career started.  He made up a story about how Obama not being born in the United States that had no factual basis.

I mean if they fuck up something so basic and only correct it after someone else points out the error then Im not sure that blindly trusting them makes much sense.gtThe date has nothing to do with your original point which is that Spicer was using different metrics. He was either comparing two different metrics or misrepresenting the numbers for Obamas inauguration by comparing them to a number that he appears to have entirely made up.What claim did I make that this refutes?  Yeah Spicer might be full of shit.  This doesnt mean that the Metro tweet was any less inaccurate or that the CNN evaluation was any less flawed.Thats what I dont understand about you.  Im of the belief that all of these people are untrustworthy.  The fact that Splicer is untrustworthy doesnt mean that we shouldnt hold CNN to a higher standard or that we should blindly believe the DC Metro twitter when we dont know who is running it and we know that at the very least they dont have much quality control on what they tweet out.Again the fact that Spicer isnt someone we should trust doesnt change this.gtBut yeah lets get upset about an incorrect date in a tweet.Is this real?  I didnt bring up the tweet you did.You bring up a tweet that was factually inaccurate as evidence I point out the evidence is wrong everyone shits on me and tells me that Im crazy because I dont blindly believe the evidence that I know to be factually incorrect.Think about that shit for a second.  People are verbally attacking me to try to bully me into believing something that we all know is factually inaccurate. You see all this and you conclusion is that Im the one with a problem because I have the nerve to keep pointing out how bullshit this is.Our country is fucked.gtTheres not really any evidence that you factchecked anything in this thread.

From now on if he wants to post something profound like I know you are but what am I? So sad hes going to have to send it through staffWrong  Hes still using his own twitter.gtThey took away his phone and computer today and it wouldnt have mattered if hed thrown himself to the ground and threw a screaming tantrum...thats since been replaced by a special presidential smart phone that does almost nothing. Obama has said of his he cant even play Angry Birds on it it would be a security violation.Wrong.  Hes tweeting on his own phone with his own Twitter account at AM in the morning.  The NYT just put up another article about his unsecured Android.  Even if it turns out it isnt an unsecured phone and the presidential phone has been upgraded to access Twitter hes still tweeting with his own Twitter account at AM which is precisely what you claimed couldnt possibly happen with absolute selfproclaimed authority at the beginning of this comment chain.    I never once said I wanted it to happen in fact I didnt want it to happen I simply said it could very well happen if he insisted on it.

Females best reproductive years are from  to   the time most are in school military or building a career the military realized this and offered a plan to women to freeze their eggs  I would google it for you but Im lazy.    female fertility drops but kids are still easily doable for most.

By the time you hit  you have less than a  chance of pregnancy  less than  remember people before you start giving examples of friends that got pregnant at  Im talking about standard deviations here not outliers.So if you wait you take yourself out of the workforce when age discrimination starts to be a thing and you can miss your biological opportunity only to have to rely on medical solutions that get expensive and you have a kid at an age that increases the risks of Down Syndrome or other genetic issues.Dont wait is just a costbenefit analysis of what I said above with the added stresses of daycare more than a mortgage with multiple kids in many states family medical plans sick days vehicles do you have a coupemotorcycle say goodbye to that.,nottheonion,dd3yv61,2,t5_2qnts

10553247,0,t1_dd41ynf,Of course CAFE doesnt apply but other expensive to develope mandated systems HAVE impeded progress not to mention the dealership requirements the big manufacturers have lobbied so hard for. Such requirements have kept anyone who doesnt have massive financial backing from making a niche market low production volume car to provide income to fund development costs. Tesla is so impressive because they managed to overcome this which wouldnt have been possible without someone like Elon and his financial standing. EVEN then he bought an existing chassis to test the initial powertrain and that chassis didnt meet the mandates for the time.

And lastly they want a declaration in TMGs favor that TMG complied with all fiduciary obligations under the law and that Depp is responsible for his own financial waste.Basically if what they are claiming is true Depp slammed them despite the fact that they claim to have proof of his financial irresponsibility and that TMG disclosed of this throughout their professional relationship. TLDR Depp is claiming that he did not know he was in financial ruin and that he stopped working with TMG because of this.

10699632,0,t1_ddj7kld,I went to American public schools and kids were stratified by aptitude starting around rd grade... they didnt call it tracking of course but it was common knowledge that the Red class was advanced the Green class was average and the Blue class was a bit behind.  Middle and high schools had placement exams so it was almost as if three separate schools operated in one building.  I had almost zero interaction with kids in the other levels even in elective courses because scheduling limitations created de facto gifted electives that werent really open to anyone else.  Im not sure if it was a great idea though... in practice behavior played a bigger role in stratification than aptitude did.  It was fairly easy for kids with subpar scores but good behavioral records to get bumped up to a higher level so the lowest level became a chaotic dumping ground for kids who were completely out of control.  Unless schools have a way of dealing with behavior issues most of which are rooted in poverty and longstanding racial segregation then you end up with a tiered system where the kids at the bottom are screwed no matter what.,nottheonion,ddjl5st,2,t5_2qnts

10750167,0,t1_ddodmtr,gt Explain to me how it is a Muslim ban.He promised a muslim ban for an entire year.He drafted this order by asking how to make his muslim ban illegal.It is literally targeted at specifically muslim countries just because it isnt targeted at all muslim countries doesnt mean it isnt targeted at muslims.He has tried to give religious waivers to Christians and other nonmuslims because the ban isnt exposed to be focused on them.His stated justification for this ban is also utter nonsense and illogical meaning there is some other reason he did it. He claims this is to stop terrorism but no terrorists have ever come from those countries.And lastlygtHe wanted to do a Muslim ban but then he learned it was illegalThat also makes no sense as this order is illegal from beginning to end. Him giving special exceptions to Christians and Catholics is illegal. The ban being based on nationality is also illegal as per the  immigration law that explicitly outlaws such a ban And before you pull a trump and cite an older immigration law the  supersedes that particular law. Him applying it to green card and current Visa holders is also strictly illegal. So was his detaining of green card and Visa holders without allowing them access to their lawyers. And lastly we know the entire purpose of this ban is to be a Muslim ban and his last year of rhetoric and the admittance from Giuliani is being used as legal flak against it because a ban of any religious group is also illegal as per the constitution.This entire thing is illegal in a rather large number of ways.

Everyone knows before having sex that there is a possibility of creating a life. You shouldnt just be able to kill that life and take away its chance of living because you just had to have sex even though you arent capable of raising a child.You do realize those  things are not the same AT ALL right?Also the baby inside a womans body ISNT HER BODY!! Its not my body my choice when its involving another body.If a man doesnt want to help raise the baby after the woman decides to keep it hes a dead beat amp gets arrested for not paying child support even if he doesnt want the baby. But he has no say about whether the baby gets killed or not?I dont think the legislation would work but it is fair that the man gets a say in whether the baby he helped create has a chance to live or not. ,nottheonion,ddqu6yq,-37,t5_2qnts

10771601,0,t3_5u1uq8,Lets take this one step further. Eggs have one purpose biologically. That means every time a woman ovulates and does not become pregnant a potential child dies. Just to be clear a womans egg cell has everything that is required to develop into a free and independent genetic clone of her mother. Sperm is required for biological diversity.Where do you draw the line if thats the way youre going with this? Are women to be forced to turn over unwanted egg cells to be grown into children in a surrogate womb? Are women required to be continuously pregnant?To say nothing of men unlike women who have a set stockpile of eggs apologies for choice of words there we replenish our sperm. Thousands of potential children die every time we get bored  and for that matter when creating a child since yknow. Only one makes it. Theres even a suicide sperm the first one to reach the egg rarely gets all the way through but expends its last gasps of energy in penetrating the cell for whoevers next. Are men required to impregnate women constLOL just kidding. Male reproduction is never restricted in the same fashion according to what would be logical thought in a world where the restrictions placed on women made any sense. The only argument frequently offered to the contrary is some bitterass extreme MRA bullshit where they try to advocate for control of a womans uterus because of all the other advantages women have in our society.

The fact that the Clinton foundation is basically a huge money laundering organization where foreign goverments contribute to win favor again see podesta emails is a bigger scandal than this however i bet no one knows anything about it because the media didnt care.

10893216,0,t1_de3i2lg, operator here. This is true. It can seem like a game of  questions but its for a reason and doesnt really delay help that much. A person shot call whether accidental or intentional gets a police and EMS response. We use something called EMD emergency medical dispatch to determine a priority. It has questions like Is the patient alert? Where were they shot?. Stuff like that. As soon as I determine a priority  which is almost always priority  with gunshots I package the call for dispatch and off they go. If youre hysterical and unable to answer my questions thats a priority . We have strategies to control these callers though. Theyre surprisingly effective.Right before the units start rolling I always make sure to ask scene safety questions. Wheres the gun? Wheres the aggressor if it was intentional? A gunshot is a serious call and Ill usually stay on the line until I hear the officers in the background. EMS will generally stage at the end of the block until PD secures the scene.The reason we ask for these questions is twofold. First its for officer safety. Is the shooter tall and wearing a black shirt headed towards main street? That helps the officers locate the suspect much easier. Secondly theres a good chance it will end up in court. We take all the documentation we can get in case that happens the average case takes  years to actually end up in a courtroom.TLDR I ask a lot of questions but most of them are asked when helps already on the way. Its not delaying anything.,nottheonion,de3k3hz,102,t5_2qnts

And if we can agree that we intend this study to be helpful all of the twins could actually be IVF clones. And we could take it out another step further and clone the adoptive parents while forcing them to live in nearly identical environments.gtBlack does not mean inferior and that intepretation is invalid. Please provide the studies that contradict the studies that show stereotyping by ethnic labels.gtIf it were the only reasonable solution would be never to mention anything about black culture in the first place for fear of reminding black people that they are inferior.And I thought you were opposed to black and white thinking! The better alternative to the only reasonable solution is to limit the use of ethnic labels in negative connotations while promoting their use in positive connotations.gt This effectively means that you get offended whenever you see the word black which would be horrible if true. I hope that is not the case.I get offended when the usage has no constructive purpose especially when there are obvious and equally simple alternatives especially by the media with clear opportunities to foster inclusion.

11024881,0,t1_dehi2h4,You seem to have no idea what we are talking about. Violence is the basis of all power but modern society cannot exist if it is used to solve political disagreements. Your comment about povertyviolence is idiotic beyond belief and shows you have never experienced anything resembling violence in your life.There is a time and place to refresh the tree of liberty with the blood of patriots and tyrants but that time is once the government becomes powerful enough to remove the nonviolent systems our government uses to resolves conflict. Ranting about how poor people need to start a war because the rich people are evil is how you go from being poor by American standards aka pretty well off compared to places outside the first world to being actually impoverished or dead. This isnt noble its moronic and shows how little you understand what real violence is and how aweful society is when that is your go to method.Do you honestly think progressive ideals and the people who ascribe to them will be willing to commit violence on the same level as your average American conservative? Republicans and their base isnt murdering liberal professors lawmakers activists etc but once you open that can of worms your bleating about your murders being righteous and holy will be irrelevant since the people killed will still be dead.Im done with this conversation now.

Its odd that most conservatives support the illusion of competition but not actual competition. Many companies and conglomerates sweep entire market niches cornering smaller competition into either bankruptcy or selling off. The reality is very few companies own most of the marketplace and conservatives support that. The big companies really dont give a shit about their employees or the populations as long as they have a group to sell their products to and test dangerous chemicals on without government interference the conservative stance also what the Nazis did. Our rights have been getting limited more and more every year. The uneducated masses idol is now a self stylized dictator fashioning himself to be the only mode of truth in a world where everyone not just our news media but global news media is out to get him where he sides with mass murderers blocks incoming refugees from political crises and furthers trade relations and negotiations with some of the worst terrorists in the world.

Do you think that all murderers and rapists who committed the atrocities should be arrested injected this syringe and allowed to walk free that very day?

11380997,0,t1_dfls1g9,On top of that you know what fucking irks me beyond belief is the attacks made on this website from some of the most biased democratic individuals I have ever spoken with. Obama is viewed as a saint on this website. I would like to hear from some Chicago residents on this forum I live in BridgeportThis is from two days ago. I have truly already seen a more courageous effort to stop some of the problems facing Chicago from Trump than I had seen from Obama in  years. Coming from someone who foolishly voted for Obama after he made such profound promises to work with city officials to analyze and solve some of the citifies violence plaqued neighborhoods  I know he isnt president of Chicago but this is his HOME for god sake!Obviously he did great things under presidency but he was largely responsible for some extremely immoral and flat out terrible policy choice as well I watched as Obama LITERALLY turned his back on Chicago and his people the millions that live here and call this city home after frantically rallying around him and his quest for senate seat and presidency Obama simply never even came back to the city outside of several campaign speeches and fundraisers for democratic house and senate leaders. How the fuck would this make it guys feel? I lost one of my best friends to gun violence as he got shot in the head  times execution style. Every day I worry about my little cousins walking to school I worry about my mom our city is in shambles. Chicago lost population last year the only major city to do so other than St Louis. I have supported all my life but I have begun to see the writing on the wall. After  years of extremely corrupt democratic city leaders Raum and the Daleys all of our alderman this has been the result. Go look at the facts and I mean truly on the ground level not just some stupid media spun stories you read on the Internet. Im talking about the people their stories their memories. I lost my respect not only for Obama after this all transpired but also a large segment of the democratic population who feel they have all the answers and fail to hear a point of view that doesnt fit their spectrum. Obamas promises to this city were not only never met they were simply used as bait to help the man get elected so he can move his ass to DC. He literally played us...How would this make you feel?,nottheonion,dfm0m96,-9,t5_2qnts

11571544,0,t1_dg7lged,Indeed  I was just about to raise the same point on our different definitions of wealthy Now onto a computer. Just for simplicities sake I will refer to your guys as middle class. I can see your point in that the middle class whom cannot easily afford private school education can take advantage of the grammer school system. This problem will still persist in the comprehensive system tho  they will just move to where the best school is at. This problem will not go away with any system!As to your point on social mobility. Does it help the poorest class? No probably not  unless you are born lucky enough to live in a area of a good grammar school. However does it help the not so poor or lower middle class? I believe so. You have to bear in mind social mobility is not in relation to the poorest class but to all classes moving up the ladder.I would argue that the comprehensive system would be a worse system in terms of social mobility. Why? Because with grammer schools at least you are helping the lower middle class move up the ladder. With comprehensives you will get a even wider gap between the top  who can afford a private education and the rest who cannot.Yes it is a system with many flaws but is there anything we can replace it to help social mobility? I personally dont think so.,nottheonion,dg7n2gu,1,t5_2qnts

I dont get the analogy...I know you are not saying women are the enemy but you are kind of strengthening my point with that analogy we pass laws that hurt our enemies without their input thats the intent so by that logic passing laws that affect women without their input means we are treating them the same as we treat ISIS LOLTo me abortion is not a moral issue its a healthcare and social issue.  My wife and I would never get an abortion unless her health is at risk but thats our decision I dont judge a woman who does get one because either she doesnt want the financial burden or responsibility of a child or was raped or whatever.  I dont understand the point of forcing a woman to pop out a kid she or anyone else wants...Anyway I have a hard time finding an analogy for this too I guess you can somewhat equate it to white people passing laws that only affect black people for instance but thats not quite right either.I believe in gender equality Im not a militant feminist Im not even saying you need these laws to be drafted solely by women I wouldnt oppose that but its not what Im pushing however I dont understand how anyone can think its OK that bills that affect women either solely or in larger part than men are drafted voted on and signed into law without a single womans input in the matter...,nottheonion,dg8704d,1,t5_2qnts

I know a guy that will hire any special operator period. He owns a financial management firm that does very well. His thinking is that anyone with the mental fortitude required for special operations can thrive in hostile territory with no support as part of a  man ODA while organizing training and motivating a huge contingent of local militia all with their own internal feuds and culture clashes while overcoming language barriers and under constant threat of death all while trying to accomplish the most valuable long term strategic foreign policy goals of the most powerful country on earth. These folks wont have trouble organizing an all American team in an air conditioned office with catered lunch.If something needs to get done theyll work round the clock until its done. If they need to learn something theyll become an expert in short time. Their thinking is more objective oriented and they dont need to be supervised or checked to stay on task. When you give these guys a mission they will move mountains to accomplish it.Even when their specific qualifications dont mesh with civilian jobs the attitudes and mental strength of special operators means they will always be highly valued,nottheonion,dg98ekf,11,t5_2qnts

Im a white guy white male privilege exists.

Everybody loves when Jennifer Lawrence says something funny. No hate for Kristen Schaal Betty White Carol Burnett or Lucille Ball. Kristen Wiig? Ellen Mindy Kaling? Joan Rivers is pretty divisive but not usually ragged on constantly. I see a lot of Brooklyn NineNine jokesgifs but nobody goes on a crusade about Chelsea Peretti.Female comedians Ive seen widespread hate for on RedditImgur Amy Schumer Sarah Silverman Samantha Bee which seems either recent or very specific to politics because I dont really remember seeing a lot of this kind of talk until Trump.Male comedians Ive seen a lot of hate for on RedditImgurCarrot Top Adam Sandler Kevin James Dane Cook Martin Shkreli Jeff Dunham Larry the Cable Guy Sinbad. I dont see a lot of people saying Louis C.K. isnt funny but I have seen a lot of accusations that hes a rapist.I dont doubt that there are people that dont want females in the comedy community. I dont doubt that there are people who are so bigoted that they dont find women funny at all. I dont doubt that there are people that havent found a female comedian they liked yet and are too stupid to express that in any other way than to be sexist. But dont go around treating Reddit like its one big hive mind that picks on women for trying to be entertaining. We hate men too. And I wouldnt even say that because even though the men I listed are generally unfavourably viewed I would bet that they have an audience somewhere. I dont really mind Larry the Cable Guy as long as I go in telling myself this is lowest common denominator comedy.Its also important to note that were both speaking from our collective memory of everything WE see on Reddit.

Im not exactly arguing with you I just dont think it will harm his career is as open and shut evidence as it seems. Its entirely possible Jones and Trump came to the same conclusion  they could literally shoot a dude in times square and get away with it. I mean for example the DNC used well duh we were going to rig the primary election as an excuse in court and that hasnt damaged the DNC. No one even talks about it and people still act like saying they rigged the primary is ridiculous. People forget the arguments in court cases they just care who won.

11635903,0,t1_dgex3i4,I have no empathy? Youve somehow diagnosed me as a sociopath from an internet comment you have a real talent ever thought of becoming a psychotherapist? Your already attributing motive to my comment which shows you dont have an argument which is hypocritical coming from someone who says weakest fucking argument ever. And your also using speculation that Im a teenager which is an argument that only a schoolchild would use again hypocritical and slightly worrying for someone to be that confident in identifying teens enough to use it as an argument. Im slightly worried that if I reply to you Ill be put on some list frankly.                                                     And FYI its not normal to be smirking after a sudden and tragic event didnt see any family or friends of  victims smirking and smiling only to be sad as they realize a camera is on them. And you round it off by alluding to me being unaware of the true spectrum of emotions as if emotions are unlocked when you reach a certain age or reach certain life milestones. Its hilarious that you think your some sort of emotion guru who is so in touch with human emotion but its also a sign of cynicism and sociopathy to feel like certain human emotions apply to chosen people like you but not me.

11697769,0,t1_dglughx,gtGoing off the gold standard and losing purchasing power may not be a bad thing. Or it might. Point is its not obvious and it is debated.It is very obvious and not a subject of debate at all by actual economists. The gold standard is shit. We know it is shit. A steady expected rate of inflation is far far better than inflation rates that go all over the place. If I know my dollar is going to be worth  less next year I can plan for that and ask for a raise. If I have no fucking clue what my money will be worth next year as it was under the gold standard then theres no way I can plan for the future because I cant reasonably form any expectations. ,nottheonion,dglylb6,6,t5_2qnts

I have had a few patients who had CPR preformed immediately after collapse and in those people who survived it made all the difference in neurologic outcomes.I also had a lady who was in PEA and when we did CPR she started looking around and looked as though she understood what was going on. When we stopped to check her pulse her eyes rolled back in her head and she was out. We continued this cycle for  minutes until her husband called it. High quality CPR absolutely has the power to perfuse someones brain temporarily thats the point.Source Cardiovascular Intensive Care RN,nottheonion,dgxlwso,1,t5_2qnts

A high percentage of engineering graduates go into fields where professional licensure is useless including mine. If you are not selling engineering services TO THE PUBLIC then its not relevant you be licensed. The helicopters I help design are regulated federally FAA not at the state level and EVERYONE with an engineering degree that does what I do is called an engineer. If I tried to call myself something else Avionics design technologist? everyone would be confused.The generic term engineer by itself has become so generalized that trying to fine people for using it in ways which are not explicitly fraudulent or dangerous to the public is stupid counterproductive and results in outrage like you see here.
