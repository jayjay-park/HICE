Ive caught a few good size fun fighting bowfin. Some good cats and Ive seen guys pull out what was either big white bass or carp. When it rains the water rises to the top of the  dam which is about  feet above what it normally is. Best spot for crappie is right where the dam is open for the water to flow throw.
