4580047,0,t1_ct7hr4y,France can attest to the effectiveness and utility of drones for its operations in Mali. The countrys intervention strategy has been based of off a focus on maneuverability on the ability to assign multiuse tools for specific purposes on information and cooperation with locals.As a part of this strategy drones are used a tool integrated with more conventional forces. Drones can fly effectively for much longer than manned aircraft and can also be quickly assigned to different missions. They are also very versatile instruments with surveillance drones for example able to perform battlefield observation or lowprofile surveillance of specific targets depending on the mission profile. As mentioned previously they are a means of gathering information to a precise level about actions on the ground providing more information for soldiers and commanders to work with in their operations. However they cannot build a rapport with locals meaning that drones still need to be a tool used alongside soldiers on the ground.Still for the aforementioned reasons France believes that military drones fulfill an important role in counterterrorism. Drones also can offer a lower cost alternative to similar measures allowing for a more costeffective and austere force that even exists within the cost range of developing countries.,UNGeneralAssembly,ct7x3n8,2,t5_38z1a
