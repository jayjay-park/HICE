2841554,0,t1_cnr1tfu,Not sure exactly how to say this but Ill give it a go. I wouldnt say JMUs music minor sucks its just that its not exactly tailored to the performing musician. Its structured so that performing AND nonperforming musicians can complete it. So youll be forced to take classes in music history fundaments stuff like that much of which is not tailored to musician at the major level. That being said as a music minor you can take theory ear training etc. which all are very important to your development as a musician. Now that being said you can learn music theory on your own as well. As for guitarvocal offerings those in the major are assigned a private teacher. For guitar its strictly focused on classical performance. So if thats your thing have at it. This isnt Berklee where you can take performance classes based around Rock Blues Metal Funk etc. The closest you can get to that through courses at JMU is the Jazz Studies minor. Myself I started as music industry as a major dropped it down a minor and then dropped it entirely. There are very real constraints on the classes you can take at JMU mainly semester credit limitations overlaps in schedules etc. Youre typically better off not completing a minor or a major in music unless you plan on becoming a high school music teacher. That being said the theory and ear training classes are awesome and guitar ensemble wasnt too shabby. If you really want to do those declare the minor pick up some funinteresting classes then when youve taken what you want to take drop the minor and dedicate the rest of your time to more useful courses like the CS and Stats courses. Theyll actually land you a real job.,jmu,cnr2yz7,1,t5_2sf1w

4707054,0,t3_3fd2jc,The short answer is maybe. If you plan on being on campus a lot and will be eating DE hall everyday  meals a day then you probably want to snag a meal plan. If you plan on not being on campus all the time and thus eating on campus only once or twice a week then it is probably cheaper to just pay out of pocket or with dining dollars gold. It is important to note that the food to price ratio is only really decent at DE hall though. Im not saying dont go to festival or dukes or anywhere else just know you will mostly be getting ripped off with out of pocket prices there. I know people who buy meal plans and live off campus because they dont want to bother making a meal or two a day and I think in some situations it makes sense. If you have classes spread throughout the day MWF and cant run back home until later in the evening then it makes sense to get the meal plan if you only have  class MWF and then are on campus from  TueThur it will likely be cheaper to skip the meal plan.As for how to survive lunch and dinner I mostly will either have a snack for lunch although you could easily make some food and throw it in a backpack and then just make something for dinner. A slow cookercrock pot is awesome as it allows you to prep a meal in the morning and then it cooks all day for a dinner with littleno work when you get home. Otherwise its as easy as removing meat from the freezer in the morning if necessary and cooking it. tldr Do the math for the monetary side and know yourself. ,jmu,ctnv1fz,2,t5_2sf1w

5093584,0,t3_3ka442,I am currently in a business fraternity and deciding to rush was one of the best decisions I made at JMU. Having a good group of friends within your major is extremely helpful and having the alumni connection can also help you land internships and jobs later down the road. A couple of my good friends within the fraternity were transfer students and rushing certainly helped them feel welcomed at JMU. Go to the info nights of a few different fraternities and decide which one feels like the best fit for you. I cant recommend it enough. ,jmu,cuzyunt,1,t5_2sf1w

6637298,0,t3_465pjh,Totally doable. I was a Finance and Criminal Justice double major weird combo I know. How hard is it? Thats tough to answer. Some people cant handle one major let alone two. So without knowing your skills and your timemanagement skills assessing how hard it would be for you is basically impossible.Is it worth it? Management and marketing majors in my experience have a lot more trouble finding jobs coming out of college than majors who have more technical skills like finance accounting CIS etc. Lets take a second to think about why its hard for management majors coming out of school. Youve got some fancy degree saying you know how to manage people companies etc. Yet youve never actually been in a position to do that and you wont get in a position to use those skills for years postgraduation. And a lot of those skills will e picked up on the job and dont really require the degree to pick up. Those staff positions will get filled by people who have technical skills because theyre more valuable to the company at that point in time. So if youre going to doubledip have your Marketing or Management major as the area you enjoy and then add the second major in something that will make you more hirable.,jmu,d05uqdo,1,t5_2sf1w

The apartments are really nice and the amenities that come with it are on par as well. I dont know whats included but its a nice area were you can get to campus by the bus and also have access to Rt.  where the mall is and other places to eat. Its far enough from campus to not have to deal with the noise of being close and dealing with the congestion of traffic coming down Reservoir Street which can be a hassle. I hope this helps!

7293262,0,t3_4f7ta3,I know I know.  Im late to the party.  JMU is going to primarily teach you Java if you ever dip into ISAT courses as well youll use Python but once you understand Java Python is a cake walk.  If you DO want to get started beforehand which isnt a bad idea Freshman year is a whole new experience and a lot of things happen and falling behind can REALLY BLOW especially in ! heres some useful links.    This is a nice link that lets you practice your java skills.  It gives you some basic prompts and you just get to put in your answer and itll tell you if youre right or wrong and give you some output based on what you did.    Code academy is AWESOME in general but this link here will teach you some fundamentals in a wonderfully guided stepbystep process.  Then you can take some of that knowledge to coding bat and try it on your own.And finally like everyone else already said you dont really need a familiarity with it.   will take you at a good steady pace as its made really for people who havent programmed before.  I came into this school with selftaught java knowledge and not from any of these fancy sites above but from fucking like Hack up your own private server for an MMO the dirty way.  So I would just mull through code and figure out what it meant so I assumed a lot of wrong things and formed a lot of bad habbits but I ended up gliding through these courses no problem.Have no fear friend.,jmu,d2770ze,1,t5_2sf1w
