4506257,0,t3_3csddh,If he really brings in the  system and it works out it will be great. He is going for  DMs as I understand because in most of the games Josef was playing more of a defensive role in the midfield and we have Topal. Which automatically means that he is going for wingplay via wingbacks and wingers which is perfect. When the wingback goes up the winger automatically runs up to be the third striker thus meaning we will have many crosses long or short. Now we definitely need at least  more midfielderbackup DM as we only have  wingerbackup but depending on Stochs performance and strikerstarter and we are complete                                   Sow Fernandao    Stoch  Nani???

4630253,0,t3_3eatr7,Wouldnt mind cashing in on him while we can. This is something we have been quite poor at for a while now he is  and his value will only decrease as he gets older realistically well keep him until he starts to play shit and then sell him for peanuts. If we want to be a force in europe we need to start to operate as a business even clubs like chelsea who in the past werent considered selling clubs are now beginning to sell players at a good level. We need a good scouting network to go along with this as well.,FenerbahceSK,cte7pw1,2,t5_2u0id

4971694,0,t1_cul78m4,Yes it was. I think its still a little odd that wasnt questioned harder..... Last year Legia Warsaw I think were administratively withdrawn from Europe after their game with Celtic because they had an unregistered player. Id say playing with a player who has been accused of doping by FIFA is much worse. I wont complain too hard however since we were completely terrible in the second game and our team hadnt gelled yet. ,FenerbahceSK,cul7w83,1,t5_2u0id

6284580,0,t3_41olo8,Comparing to  Caner the  Caners performance has declined. I think he was at his peak in last  years and with the way Hasan Ali is playing i dont see him getting that much play time. If a very decent price tag comes up he should go. He would do so good in La Liga where they adore Complete Wing Backs like himself. Sadly I believe Russians will get a hold of him and knowing his style he will choose money over his career. And in Russia he will decline even more which is bad for the National Team and the quality of Turks abroad. But whatever floats his boat. Maybe Bilic will get a boner and sign him to WestHam tho he declared some interest in the past.  P.S. Next up I propose Bruno Alves.,FenerbahceSK,cz3zi6g,2,t5_2u0id
6287950,0,t1_cz4b1si,Prices are for the start of the season and performances are for the end of the season. With that in mind it doesnt look too out of place. Maybe the only interesting one is when transitioning from  to . But we can just say that he had some credit to spend and we can see that as poor form continues his value started to decline.,FenerbahceSK,cz4damw,2,t5_2u0id

6651150,1,t3_46rc25,Yes even Kartal was better then him and Kartal had a much worse squad. Seriously Pereira can shove Fernandao up his ass I have never seen such a bad striker at Fener. I knew the moment Fener showed interest in him that he will have a bad impact on this team.The whole season we had  good games and those mostly because the other teams were pure shit. Fernandao behaves like he is fucking Pele seriously fuck off fernandao I hope Aziz sells you the next window to a anadolu team fucking prick. He keeps Nani on for  minutes even though he plays like shit since last month because nani saved his sorry ass a dozen times and he hopes he does it again. We are speaking of the same person who benched JAMES FUCKING RODRIGUEZ at Porto. This guys has no idea of football or how to treat players like van persie. Either Pereira is going to get fired or Fener will achieve nothing the next  years. He is the worst fucking coach we had in the last  years. Yanal would destroy the fucking league with this team but no guys let us give pereira more time  the team just needs more time guys its not like we are  into the fucking season already and had  good matches and most likely lost van persies trust noooo.,FenerbahceSK,d07abit,0,t5_2u0id
6653166,0,t1_d07eral,Its a normal reaction to hate a coachplayer after a bad result. Most of us would like to see a coach stay for multiple seasons.Man to be honest.. I just want to see Robin van Persie play  He is the biggest signing in our history. I want to see him score goals for us. I want to see him winning games for us and bring glory to our club. But to achieve that Pereira needs to play him more.,FenerbahceSK,d07htuz,3,t5_2u0id
6953393,0,t1_d14ggn6,Yes it would be totally different. Bebek fucked up in  maybe  MAIN positions. After the second goal of Fener Braga would need  more goals and it would demorolize them  times more which would be their downfall. And if we were up  and received that penalty we wouldnt have been so broken up about it.,FenerbahceSK,d14hzl4,1,t5_2u0id
7501871,0,t3_4i47dz,Hehe I bought him the day he got released. His special card I mean. Also got the Van Persie InForm card that was released  days ago thanks to his  goals  assist on his th game. In fact this is my current Sper Lig team on FUT.For those that dont know Gold cards are standard cards released at the start of every year. Black ones are released weekly and are called in forms. Players can receive them after a good performance. Orange one is man of the match mostly given for Champions and Europa league performances. Blue ones are Team Of The Season released at the end of the year. Given for overall great season performance.,FenerbahceSK,d2ux9dl,2,t5_2u0id
