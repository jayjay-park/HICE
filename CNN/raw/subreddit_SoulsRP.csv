9397553,0,t1_d96wg21,Cornell sneaks away from the knight but is soon in the presence of the beast. A large wicked creature with long black fingernail sharp teeth and no eyes. The creature is covered in black fur and is talllanky. The creature looks to ooze a black liquid from an open wound from the abdomen. The creature does not notice Cornell. The creature walks towards the direction of the knight. Cornell follows the creature in fear. Cornell does know whether to help the knight warn the knight or stay away.,SoulsRP,d977f6e,3,t5_3gv21
9402421,0,t1_d97snoe,Cornell rose an eyebrow as well with a slight amusement to the old bearded warrior. Cornell was suspicious of the man as well but did not let that cloud his judgement. Cornell giggled to himself as he did see the coffin.Whoever buried should have done open casket and shouldnt have bothered dumping dirt. Must took hours to climb and dig out Cornell joked.This incident is very unique for Cornell as he rarely ever lets people see him. The Lothric assassins were always hunting him and following he everywhere he went. This could be a part of the Lothric army but Cornell was tired of hiding. Cornell has not joked around in a very long time and this Sunlight Warrior also looks as though he has not laughed or joked.I am looking through this forest to look for the one known as Aldrich. You must know of him. I must find him for personal reasons.,SoulsRP,d97tnl8,1,t5_3gv21
10656912,0,t1_ddf6cvg,I understand. Aston said. Philips longsword now rested at Astons hip. It had been a long time now since he had wished to switch swords. and if that snake. appeared again Aston would hurt him with such righteous anger that he would never come back. he would break the mans spine and hang him in a tree without the possibility of release. And if he brought more company  that was fine.it just meant more victims for Aston in the end.,SoulsRP,ddf6g0w,1,t5_3gv21
10670043,0,t1_ddgidqc,The knight charged onwards some of the attacks he managed to block with his shield some bounced off his armor others went right through though non stopped him. He closed in and attempted to bash the Sage as hard as he could with his shield in order to sway all of his attention away from Aston.,SoulsRP,ddgj8kd,1,t5_3gv21
11300656,0,t1_dfc7k0s,Hmmm that mustve hurt. Couldve just used momentum instead of taking it all on himself  but hey he aint called general for nothing I guess. Stas criticized casually as he sat in a safe distance from the battle next to Kenneth taking a bite through his opened visor from a probably not in a healthy state apple he found in his satchel.So... Howve you been? Said the knight as he turned his head slightly towards the mute throwing the apple behind his back.,SoulsRP,dfcwv5h,1,t5_3gv21
