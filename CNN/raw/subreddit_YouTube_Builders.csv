6860086,0,t3_40bxuu,Most of the gantries I have seen around the intertubes appear to be commercially built. I have yet to see a DIYer attempt the feat. I have seen SV Seeker using a fairly large gantry for his ship build and I know Wide Vision Metal Fab has one in his shop. Most of the time it seems like its just a single Ibeam set on heavy duty castors rolling along some kind of track usually built out of potentially larger Ibeams.I have almost no experience in metal fabricobbling but I imagine once you find out what material you want to use for the overhead rail the rest boils down to making a frame around it. With or without wheels.,YouTube_Builders,d0twem0,1,t5_38rac
