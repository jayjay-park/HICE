Only bits and pieces of M were on the disc so its not in TSLRCM. You have to get it yourself. The game is a little incomplete without it. If you never play the game or only played a little without TSLRCM you would never notice what it adds. Its seamless but I cant believe how much usefulinteresting content was cut so its a must. M however being mostly fanmade is noticably different from the vanilla game. But still a great idea to pick it up.Dont go crazy with mods though.

1451661,0,t3_2arfi5,Due to the nature of the games it was easier for Obsidian to create more fulfilling and believable scenarios for a dark side player. The first game is about a person going on a mission with a rag tag group of people to save the entire galaxy very Biowareesque. The game doesnt really care about the PC until the Revan reveal. Its not introspective. By its nature it is operating on a grand scale. Nearly all your actions reflect that. The ending is save the galaxy or became a tyrant. And because the decision to be evil is made so late in the game you spend most of the game doing as you said evil actions just for the sake of being evil. Obsidian somewhat managed to avoid that by having the second game focus on the character rather than the galaxy which seems to be Obsidians MO. So your actions reflect something you would see yourself doing. Going out for revenge because you believe the masters wronged you or finding the masters and trying to stop the Sith from hunting and killing you. They also allowed the character to choose being evil at various points in the game I believe. Which means that the game doesnt entirely become choose dialogue  for light side option or dialogue  for dark side option.Its difficult to compare KOTOR to TSL in this regard because the developers set out to do different things. One is an epic story about good vs evil and the other is a more personal story. Apples to oranges. ,kotor,ciy8ovb,3,t5_2ssrb

Im not exactly sure why they list it as incompatible maybe it was in the past or maybe it is if its not installed after TSLRCM etc. Either way all I know is that it is functionally fully compatible in these builds in spite of what the TSLRCM team says.And youre likewise correct that Improved AI is designed to work with HLFP but theres also a version of Improved AI without HLFP and thats the version Ive used and tested. In fact come to think of it the version for use with HLFP might actually be the incompatible version since its the regular version of HLFP.

I dont want the final boss to be the final boss because hes bad Malak wasnt a great antagonist because he was a Dark lord of the Sith there were lots of other motivations behind there and lets not even talk about the fact that he annihilated Tariss surface looking for Bastila. The Emperor is just evil for Evils sake but unlike masterminds like Sauron Sargeras and other generally Evil characters I dont think hes actually done anything to deserve his finalboss status.I would like to point out that Im not downvoting your comment and I think the people doing so need to stop this is just a discussion and youre obviously invested in your creation here and I dont think downvoting just because this is more of a SWTOR fanproject than a KOTOR fanproject. KotOR comes from a certain point in time when BioWare were looking for a challenge to take on after the Baldurs Gate series and I think they made on of the best story telling video game in history and I dont hate SWTOR but they failed to live up to the hype just like Dragon Age II failed to live up to Origins hype.,kotor,cpgtd6h,1,t5_2ssrb

And for Kreia that went further she argued that the Jedi were systemically corrupt and unable to hold their code because the code itself was flawed. It allowed the Jedi to ignore suffering and made them reactionary and incapable of change and was thus not a true philosophy. It was not organic and ultimately not attainable in its purist statethink true communism for a reallife comparison.Indeed Kreia brings you to the Dantooine academy at the end of the game to try to prove to the Masters that her view was right and that the Code was flawedbut they disregard both her and you and this leads to her execution of them.,kotor,cphy45f,7,t5_2ssrb

A few of the sets remind me too closely of the underclothes worn by the Jedi during the Clone Wars era I know its a bad picture but think this look and that was what I meant. The rest of my problem with them comes from the new robes similarities to those in the original KOTOR. K had a very distinct robe design which was much more loose than robes in the first game.

No matter if its only for the sake of keeping the mod alive. You do not have the right to uploading the mod elsewhere period. I havent been around on the modding scene for a long time but I sure do know the rules. Insidious pointed them out clearly to me on Deadlystream and he knows what hes doing and saying. As well as Sithspecter Sith Holocron and everyone else who agrees with them. You are in the Wrong there Ill just say that right now. The mod authors made the Read mes for a reason! So what you dont want to go by the ancient Read mes. You have to go by them as thats their content and they get the say who uploads their mods elsewhere. Stick to private messaging or emailing when you deliver other peoples mods. As Fair Strides said the LF thread for old mods is still alive and well. Milestails has done an amazing job of giving people mods through PMs and hes helped out tremendously. It just shows that people are willing to be patient for mods. Theyre mods not some food item or gold necklace that people cant wait an eternity for. If they go away its not the end of the world. Oh well some mods come and go as well as mod authors. Its their decisions alone. Also Gamefront which actually hosts the mods is still alive and running perfectly well! So dont even bother aaying that the mods still arent availabke. Look around and youll easily find them. There are still plenty of modding websites up Deadlystream Lucasforums Nexus Gamefront Gamebananaz or whatever its called etc... So I would say Insidious could speak for all of the respectable Kotor modding community and you should learn to respect it all as well! Anyways I just wanted to say my part in all of is...You  In the wrong sorry its true.Steam Workshop  Horrible thing for Kotor modding in general. ,kotor,cti80rt,-3,t5_2ssrb

6078968,0,t3_3yk1pb,So heres what I do. Note that Nar Shaddaa is usually my second planet so Im basing this off that experience.Hit the Landing Pad first obviously you can generally explore and take care of everything pretty well. If you dont have HK or Visas yet get them now since HK has an influence opportunity on the Pad. Do NOT trigger the merchant war.Next head to the docks briefly just to get the cutscene about Voggas stash. Return south.Then go to the Pazaak Den but I usually do so just for the droid. After that go to the Cantina and get the juma juice then agreeing to dance.Dancing takes you to the docks. You can put the kath hounds to sleep and grab the stash then take care of everything in the docks and JJT.After that hit the Refugee Sector. You can clean everything up in one trip especially if you have Atton in your party whom you can train immediately after the cutscene with the Twileks assuming youve hit the other prereqs theres even a unique version if hes in the party.You can use the speeder to resolve the Adana sidequest if you want or you can leave it until after Goto. Either way returning to the Landing Pad should trigger the Red Eclipse.After you finish the Red Eclipse take care of anything else you need to on the Hawk because after you exit you get the call. Obviously you want to take care of that.Once you finish that and have spoken to Zez youre in the flophouse which allows you to finish any hanging quests from the Refugee Sector. Return to the Hawk.Now postZez you can talk to Mira and max her out. Take her to the Landing Pad area and train her then handle the merchant war sidequest which now has no consequences. So thats how I handle Nar Shaddaa in an efficient manner with minimal pain.,kotor,cygfpmm,1,t5_2ssrb

It was probably a while later I came back to it and discovered what a good game it was and played it from start to finish. I then went out and got the second game soon after  must have been shortly after it came out as it still has the  pricetag on it.

6158131,0,t3_3zsabs,Massive spoilers obviously.gtWhat was it about the Exile that made himher unique?She was unusually sensitive and receptive to the Force as a connection between all living things. She also easily formed Force bonds that were unusually strong. Her bond to Kreia is used as a plot device early on and highlighted many times during the story. At Malachor V not only she experienced unprecedented levels of carnage amplified by the insidious darkness of the place she was integral in creating it as a General both following orders and making her own decisions. It all passed through her so to speak.This unique combination of circumstances led her to lose her connection to the Force and become something more than a mere nonforce sensitive human. She actively although subconsciously denied the Force which was what made her so important for Kreia.The fact that the exile was not aware of exactly what had happened she projected her problem to the Jedi Council which was far from faultless in itself reveals the extent of her trauma. This is a parallel to reallife mental traumas I am fineEveryone else is wrong. I am still not completely sold on the it was your choice part. That is what the Jedi Masters kept saying to the Exile but the Masters themselves are shown to be evasive insincere closeminded and ultimately wrong with their decisions. My understanding is that they believe the Exile cut herself off by choice because they are defensive towards her. They fear her not just because she chose to follow Revan or the massacre she was a part of but because of what she had become  a hole in the Force. Instead of helping the Exile through her trauma the pinnacles of the Light side chose to cast her off this is another disturbing parallel with real life mental trauma. On the surface the Jedi Masters were concerned that the Exile could fall to the Dark side if she still had the Force. But really their confrontation with the Exile was the turning point of the fall for them  Atris first and foremost. The echo of Malachor V affected everyone.If this matters I played Dark side but I dont suppose all the dialogue at every interaction with the Masters and the trial records are different. If they are then KOTOR  is a much greater game than I ever thought and I will go start a Light side playthough right now. I was planning to anyway!,kotor,cypm6do,1,t5_2ssrb

Being on this planet actually killed my interest during a playthrough so I stopped playing the game because you were stuck there. When I learned it was cut content I am not the least bit shocked with this it was obviously not that great of an idea and just feels like a chore.If I had improvements it would be stop making me run around so much make it fit with the game better give it something more worthwhile because honestly I was content with the Jedi Master just being found dead on Korriban in comparison to this.,kotor,d07zw9w,13,t5_2ssrb

6669019,0,t3_46ub2i,Playing the mod for the first time now and I just got up to the planet.First thing I noticed was the landing cutscene. Its aspect ratio is  whereas all the other cutscenes in the game are widescreen so its kind of jarring going from one to the other. Also if possible a skybox would be good or just something in the background to make it not look like Heres a bunch of buildings in the middle of a void.  And on a similar note the skybox when the radiation cloud is there makes it look like theres missing textures or something. It took me a bit to work out that wasnt the situation.Also as Ive been running around getting the side quests it gets a bit much having so many on the quest log and having to sort through them. Perhaps the Bonus Mission subfix that is used on some of the base games ones would help?And regarding the quest logs not being helpful the only point Ive noticed so far is when trying to find the droids memory core. The log says you need to find  it and then theres nothing helping you find it until you do find it.The comments about too much running are sort of  with me. On one hand pretty much everything Ive done so far is go from one place to another constantly. But on the other hand the escort droids placed around have been useful in making it not as much of a chore to get everywhere.Also not all the voice acting is bad. There are some instances where it could definitely be improved upon recording of Sith trooper shooting at CS comes to mind but I just spoke to two IS droids  was one of them who had good dialogue.When testing out the Sith droids firing at the holograms when the camera cut to them taking the shot it was looking at the ground. Not sure if thats an issue with something else I have or the mod.When talking to the Black Market droid I bought three things from him and got up to the cost of the next one being  credits but when I ended the conversation he asked me for  the next time I spoke to him.Okay end of that it was alright. There were some frustrating parts namely when I couldnt find where something was but other than that it was still playable. ,kotor,d094u03,2,t5_2ssrb

If Bastila followed more of Jolees pseudo neutrality with a I help people but fuck the council attitude I could have seen it coming.

6804640,0,t1_d0nkyqf,Huh I never would have guessed. I used to be pretty big into Halo myself it was the reason I got into console gaming when I was younger.You know I actually didnt mind Reach  I do remember how contentious the game was among the community back then. I still enjoyed the Forge aspect and vast amount of custom options. I guess some of that might come with hindsight and rosetinted glasses though because I certainly didnt expect  to double down on every bad design decision and churn out something barely resembling a Halo game. I cant remember the last time Ive been so baffled by design decisions in an FPS as I was with Halo . I was also just as baffled by the amount of acclaim the story was getting  it really was not that goodI foolishly bought Halo  after some friends convinced me to do so for the multiplayer and while I do actually think they made some good changes on that end the campaign was utter garbage.

6853226,0,t1_d0t28wi,Well that makes it more difficult.As I see it mechanically the holocrons would give powers to both the player and if trained as a Jedi the Disciple. That seems pretty easy.As to the holocrons themselves though that gets tougher. Should the Sith Holocrons be available to the player even if theyre a Jedi and viceversa? Additionally if Im hearing this dialogue right and there is a holocron which was essentially meant to be for Disciple alone what should it do for him? And what should the players own holocron do and when should it be activated considering its seriously implied its only meant to become available once the Enclaves restored?There are definitely a lot of difficult questions here. In terms of locations at least for the two main Jedi and Sith holocrons I would place one Jedi holocron on Dxun since many Jedi died there and one in the locked maintenance room in the Dantooine sublevel since you have to destroy the terminal to get to it it would make sense with the Disciples claim that he hadnt found anything. For the two Sith holocrons it seems especially evident that one should be on Korriban and one in Freedon Nadds tomb.,kotor,d0t4dsv,4,t5_2ssrb

Im like OP and come to a mental block because I honestly cant see anyone in the game taking Kreias place and giving the same impact.

Its always the threelegged ones that this works well against and the shorter fourlegged ones and Im not sure why lightsabers do such little damage and miss so often. Regular humanoid looking droids are easily destroyed by lightsabers but not the other droids. Although if you are already at Manaan then you should have already experienced similar tough droids on the Dantooine ruins. Ones that dont seem to be hurt by anything other than vibroblades ... so maybe its not the problem for you.

10699525,0,t1_ddj0m4h,I agree with you I think theres not enough loose ends and freerange content to base a game off of. but lets roll with it see what happens! protagonists. What are some characters in the story arc you would be interested in? theres the Jedi masters of course. any given Jedi living in the turmoil of the time period between games would be interesting. possibly the Disciple?what about a Mandalorian? previously a war hero for the Mandalorian war effort now a mercenary for hire traveling the galaxy looking for work. possibly Canderous and his reorganization of the Clans but I feel his story would best be told as a prequel during his time serving on the front lines of the Mandalorian Wars. those basilisk war droids would be AMAZING.or maybe youre a gang member on Nar Shaddaa doing jobs and stuff for one of the gangs vying for dominance. perhaps even Visquis? or GT? Mira would be a nice fit seeing her grow from a Mandalorian slave to the best damned bounty hunter on Nar Shaddaa would be cool plus a really neat narrative revolving around Hanharr would be sweetor maybe youre a member of the Jedi who survived Dantooine. you work with the settlers to found Khoonda and perhaps meet Master Vrook and help secure a future for his study into the true nature of the new Sith threat. or perhaps you could be a member of Citadel Station Security almost said CSec from Mass Effect whoops who works tirelessly to maintain order as Telos desperately attempts to restore itself and you could bare witness to the big political entities there like the Exchange Czerka and the Ithorians. Im sure theres a few other noteworthy possibilities here but I think if a KotOR . were going to be created it would be best if it sort of filled in the gaps between games and connected the specific character storylines that lead up to the events of KotOR II. KotOR I should remain largely untouched because lets be honest here not much would need to be changed altered or modified there. but I think if . served as a sort of Rogue One for the KotOR franchise it would adhese itself into the arc very seemlessly.,kotor,ddjkrhe,3,t5_2ssrb

That alone should be frightening but combine that with the absolute absence of any mention of KOTOR  whatsoeverno commentary at all about future plans or anythingand I think theres quite sufficient reason to be worried. If all they care about is the original KOTORand all signs point to them only taking it into account at least at this stageand radical changes are on the table might KOTOR  not simply be cut? Might it be bastardized Kreia bastardized just to fit into the new lore even if it is included?And those are just the biggest problems. If KOTOR s hypothetical remake were to be retained by BioWare Avellone isnt going to work on it with them based on everything hes stated recently. He hates corporate oversight and BioWare Austin is about as atrocious a situation for that as you can get subservient to Edmonton EA and Disney in this hypothetical case simultaneously. How many other things would be lost in translation?I was never of the opinion that remakesreboots shouldnt be attempted. Indeed even as my faith in the industry and their ability to pull it off waned I maintainedand to a certain extent even now still maintainthat the attempt must at least be hoped for because a failed try is better than nothing.
