1656553,0,t3_2chyve,Oh if angst is what youre after Im your woman  The following fics are my favorites in this genre. Its hard to find good depressionselfharmsuicide fics that arent maudlin and whiny. These are all excellent pieces of work that IMO get John and Sherlock just right.  the Quiet Man  its a long one but in my top three favorite fics of all time. The first part deals exclusively with his depression post Sherlocks death. Also a lot of really really good trippy dreamhallucination sequences the Moonlight and the Frost  excellent WIP that is regularly updated. Its a Season  fixit. John doesnt cope with Marys betrayal so well. Wont spoil what happens but it fits your criteria read it up to chapter  at least We Go Anywhere But To The Ground  postReichenbach fic following Johns depression and eventual suicide attempt Be Here Now  another postReichenbach depressionsuicide attempt. This time Irene Adler is involved.Enjoy the angst!!,Sherlock_Fanfiction,cjnyzpw,3,t5_2vfs5
