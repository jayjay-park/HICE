1362,0,t1_ce814wp,gt Im invested enough in characters like Carrie and Saul That was my problem with Dexter.  After four great seasons I had nothing but high expectations for the series.  When the fifth season was such a clunker I mean it wasnt appalling but it really wasnt great I already had years invested.  I have loved Homeland for about a season and a half.  However following the second half of Season  and the majority of Season  and the writers smug opinion of their abilities despite rapidly faltering reception from fan and critic alike Im probably going to cut my loses and consider the fourth season only if it ends up with widespread praise.Showtime has already taken advantage of me getting me invested in its characters  Im not interested in falling for the same shit twice you know?,homeland,ceeldhf,3,t5_2smlq

525164,0,t3_202elp,gt Why didnt the Iranian bad guy Javadi ever kill Carrie? He is a bloodthirsty monster. He loses nothing by killing Carrie but gains huge revenge on both Saul and the woman who bested him. Its not like the CIA is going to compromise the entire mission just because he has  woman killed. He could have easily ordered Carrie killed while she was in Iran and faced zero repercussions for it. Made no sense to me seeing as how he brazenly killed other people like that guy at the end of episode  which was never mentioned again....because the CIA had him in their pocket.He would kill Carrie why exactly? Because he wants to? Ok he kills her. Shes dead now.... and an hour later the IRGC receives all the info on all the money Javadi has embezzled from them. And that night Javadi is in a noose.Javidi is evil ruthless and even sadistic. But he is also calculated cautious and smart.,homeland,cfzytmo,4,t5_2smlq

Its a riveting thriller about political backstabbing between the American embassy and Pakistani intelligence. Its great. We should have gotten stories like this every year and seeing how the CIA deals with all the bullshit. Instead we got  years of Brodys angst. It was great in Season  but like I said it should have ended there. Season  should have been the fallout to his suicide bombing with the CIA on high alert and hunting down Abu Nazir. Imagine this season as Season  but Aayan is Abu Nazirs nephew instead. It would have been a perfect followup to Season . ,homeland,cleiqir,3,t5_2smlq

A lot of supporters for terrorists or new recruits for them get involved because of motivation for revenge. Its obviously not why their leaders or commanders are in it for at least not all of them but for the most part the rank and file are usually people whose anger and misery they can exploit. Every time we kill a terrorist with a drone strike more terrorists are created from the relatives of people who are caught in the crossfire. Those people are motivated by revenge not religion. Religion is used by the people who exploit them to give them an outlet for their answer.Its not as if terrorists have routinely been mentioning revenge as their motivation for every terrorist attack right?Every terrorist ever The reason Im doing this attack is some very specific motive for revengeNingrim No! Its because you hate mah freeeeedoms! My country is the best on Earth obviously all your motives are filthy lies against us! whats this? how could terrorist attacks be rising after  when the war on terror started in ?

Her choice of Jonas Happich as a stepfather for Franny is a fully conscious deliberate choice made in the same way that Carrie Mathison the CIA field agent would acquire an asset. Her decision to go above and beyond to ensure Jonas safety when he travels to Lebanon is not a measure of her devotion to him but rather of her devotion to Franny. She wants her daughter growing up believing that Jonas is her biological father and more importantly she wants others to instantly believe it as well without question hence the choice of a man with red hair. She also wants someone who is removed from Langley or any other intelligence work who is a good man and worthy of her daughter hence the choice of a man who works for an NGO. Id bet anything that Carrie vetted Jonas long before she ever met him in person. ,homeland,cvtnr7u,12,t5_2smlq

5947445,0,t1_cxz7qxp,All the weird shit was just an extension of the analogy i was making with the bathroom door. You said you need a bathroom door because you want to hide when you take a shit. Fine but the same principle holds in general. Privacy isnt a privilege granted to us by our overlords if they think we are being good. That is turning the logic of the consititution on its head. If there is reason to suspect that an individual is committing a crime the government has to go to a judge and show evidence. At that point the judge grants them the right to invade that individuals privacy. Thats the law. As it is now everyones data is collected and stored every minute of every day. FISA courts are rubber stamping fig leaf agencies. The scariest thing is realizing that sketchy shit is a subjective concept which changes over time. Without the rule of law limiting these people they can and do abuse this power. Look no further than the Obama administration using the IRS to specifically target conservative groups for audit and scrutiny. Not supposed to do that as its fucking corrupt as hell. Or Operation Chokepoint in which the Obama DOJ bullied banks into closing the accounts andor freezing the funds of individuals and businesses the govt didnt like. Like firearm and ammo dealers. Or porn stars. Or payday loan companies. Rather than using the rule of law to prosecute individuals the government suspected of committing a crime they did an end around the constitution and used their massive surveillance powers to just terrorize people. Just keep on trusting your masters though. ,homeland,cxz8nr9,2,t5_2smlq

11080980,0,t3_5xzn2f,Was  super exited about this season thus far but that revelation left a bad taste on my mouth and in a sence ruined Dar Adals character. Ill never understand why writers take the easy way out at labeling a character as evil. Dar Adal was an excellently written character with an amazing actor that was  believable and quite clearly evil butin his minddoing what is necessary for his country underage sex should never have been part of his background.

Shes comfortable in her own skin and has a certain confidence in her physicality which isnt the same as narcissism or arrogance its just she knows how to present herself and project herself in a way thats attractive.But what do I know about what guys find sexy Im a heterosexual woman. But that kind of sultriness and sexiness without being sleazy is something I kind of aspire to. Also that Mossad guy was pretty hot. I mean hes no Quinn but I get it.

11341127,0,t1_df7ekyz,Quinn did improvise but he wasnt surprised that the police showed up he most likely called them so that theyd immediately discover the body rather than it sitting up there unnoticed and rotting until it was stumbled upon in the summer at which point the body would be hard to identify. How do we know hes the one that called the cops? Astrid says she stayed because all of his neighbors apparently flew away for the winter yet the cops said they had reports of shots fired. Yet when they arrive Astrid is placed on the couch as a sign of respect but also to avoid animals scavenging the body if it were left outside hes fully changed with a go bag and didnt appear to be caught off guard or alarmed in any way and in fact looks like he was waiting for them and stayed with her as long as possible again showing his affection for her by refusing to leave her body unattended.

I knew something like this was coming the writers are so fucking great at making us chase down the red herrings all season long but never once did I think to myself Holy shit what if Keane actually is compromised?I made the assumption like everyone else that they were going for the obvious Clinton parallel and when Trump won they had to change things up like a lot of other TV shows but Christ I never would have thought theyd sow the seeds of doubt about Keane herself potentially being compromised.This is why I keep coming back to this show. Sure its had its weaker subplots but it is so fucking good at playing off the tropes were all so used to that they can actually trick us into being blindsided.

That is absolutely shitting on Quinn for no reason. We didnt even get a scene at Quinns memorial just skipped it completely. Come on you cannot say they handled his death well.
