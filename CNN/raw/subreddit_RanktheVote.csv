9634393,0,t1_d9zxclr,gt I dont understand that page at this pointExplained here and I explained it heregt and I dont understand why it or anything else makes score voting not follow your first couple sentences.It lists the voting systems that produce the ideal result and Score is not one of them though it is very similar or usually comes close.  For instance if the centroid of voter opinion falls exactly on top of purple Score selects green instead   It also shows that it doesnt work well with cloning If voter opinion is the same as the red candidate Score selects cyan instead gt No system can require honest voters we have to go with a system that does well in the widest range of cases including strategic voters. Yes and Score gets significantly worse in that case illustrates the severe hit that we take when the voters become strategic.gt Approval voting is just a variant of score. Its all cardinal  and that is the class of voting systems we need the details within that are more minor.Yeah I said all that stuff and got downvoted for it and had to wait  minutes between each subsequent comment.    Seems better now.,RanktheVote,da0myff,1,t5_38wpz
9974252,0,t1_db71a0q,I think you could use a system similar to reddit and take the lower confidence interval of the mean instead of the mean.All this does is if you dont rank one candidate his N goes down and thus his spread away from the mean goes up.,RanktheVote,db7o7p3,2,t5_38wpz
