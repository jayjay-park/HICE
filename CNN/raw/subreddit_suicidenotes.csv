9546176,0,t1_d9pffgn,What can be better than the sweet release? Its not like anyone would even care if i was gone to begin with. Its all a facade to meit seems like all of my piers were gifted with the ability to be normal. Why cant i have that too? Why must i be the weird one with no friends AND be freaking stupid all rolled into one? I feel like im being selfish but how can i not feel this way when theres no one to tell me any different. Every conversation i have with either my mom or dad seems forced. As if they would rather not be talking to me to begin with. My mom didnt even want me man....she said she wished she had never even met my dad and told me kids were overrated. I wanted to curl up and die. My dad tries to show affection through just sending me money. It never helps. Its just enabling me but im powerless to stop my own desire to spend it though. Its there i mean why not use it right? Am i just being a piece of shit and making it worse for myself? I dont knowand i hate not knowing things. It makes me ignorant and ignorance isnt blissits torture. On top of the whole money thing he tries to convince me that there actually is a god by saying all this trivial bullshit like god will save us all once we pass on. God works in mysterious ways. Ill pray for you while you live there. God this god thati just want to be dead so that he wont have to TRY and be a father any longer. Same with my momid rather her be happy devoid of me and my father. Im the only connection between the two for obvious reasons. So im fully convinced that life would be x better without me here. ,suicidenotes,d9prhpc,1,t5_2s55z
