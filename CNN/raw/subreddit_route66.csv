6836641,0,t1_d0r7qfc,There is a shield in the parking lot of Mr Dz Diner in Kingman.  Its not quite the same but its something.  I was also told there was one in Ash Fork a little east of Seligman but I havent been able to confirm that.,route66,d0r8hpn,2,t5_2umn5
9156953,0,t3_55krt0,I havent been on that particular part of Old  in Arizona but Ive driven through Zion twice and I havent had an issue with it. The speed limit is pretty slow and theres generally a lot of people stopping to look at the scenery anyway. If you havent been to Zion then I recommend making some time to go there and explore. You wont regret it. Back to the road however I dont recall worrying about it. There are parts where you are along canyons but I never felt like I was going fast enough to be concerned and the roads arent so narrow that you feel like youre going to fall off. There may be some more personal accounts if you Google it which Id recommend just in case since my opinion may differ from yours or others.,route66,d8cpkx5,1,t5_2umn5
