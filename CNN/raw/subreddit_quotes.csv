Petty insults and failing to put forth your opposing view doesnt bring us very far.You assume I want men to shut up? Quite the contrary Im a man myself and everybody should have an equal say in this conversation regardless how bad I would perceive it. Sunlight is the best disinfectant let your opposing view be heard for what it is say whats on your little heart dont keep it inside dont mince words.But if your grounding is based on anecdotal evidence your perception of feminism based on tumbler or vice articles if you convey the same narrow public perception or adopt the rationally void hear say that tends to be spouted around by the prevailing balance of power and institutions well most gladly call you out if we think its bullshit.So go ahead Im genuinely and in good faith waiting to understand the opposing view lets hear it.

845077,0,t1_ch08xij,Maybe it is frivolous. This is a pretty opinion based argument so dont take it too seriously.Take war for example. We are all just biological creatures born through a vagina and on to this planet Earth. At birth very very little separates us but we can be grown to become part of a society. We become trained to think of ourselves as part of a collective in say our country. You feel a sense of responsibility to the point where youll begrudgingly go and sacrifice your only chance at existence because of what some politicians nothing to do with you decided. We fight creatures we know to be almost identical to us except were told they are the enemy. That scares me and war is only one example of the strange outcomes of our collective thought.Every stage and minor detail of those wars was thought through by someone just as you read this on your computer. We could not even fathom living through that many lifetimes. It scares me that all those thoughts are just lost in time never to be reclaimed.I cannot imagine how big the number  billion is. Neither can you. Our brains just cant picture a number that big IIRC the biggest number is in the  range and you say it doesnt disturb you that a number that big have thought about growing up meeting a partner eating shitting sex and all aspects of human life that you have thought about. Chances are someone has thought it before.But not only that they are all doing it RIGHT NOW!

2161737,0,t1_clel916,gtFirst off you can quit. Secondly none of the other options have magically disappeared. Accepting a offer also means that you value that offer more than the alternative. When you accept a job it means you value what the employer offers more than whatever else the fuck you could be spending that time on including any other offer.None of what you said makes actual sense but they sound valid to you. For example your first assertion is you can quit. Well yes technically you can. Like someone can quit smoking or whoring or any other thing that may not be the best course of action but which once youve started is more difficult to stop. Just because you are capable of doing something doesnt mean its a realistic option. Youre treating the action quit the job as equivalent in effort mental weight or value to do not accept the job in the first place. We know for a fact that this isnt how decisions are actually weighed. There are things like loss aversion to account for. Once you have the job it is more effortful to leave it than it would have been to make another choice in the first place. On the other hand saying none of the other options have magically disappeared suffers from a crippling lack of understanding regarding energy allocation. Yes again technically none of the the options have disappeared but youve changed the way you relate to these options. You have a finite number of hours in the day yes youre probably fairly clear on that. What youre not at all clear on the other limitations of your resources. Once you have a job and youve devoted a  typically  hour chunk of your time to it thats  hours of ego depletion youll be going through. I dont know you and I cannot attest to whether youve ever started your own business let alone whether youve ever attempt to run one on the side while youre working a job but these arent light endeavors. You put yourself into a situation that is like working two jobs but with different incentives I dont know if youve ever worked two jobs either. So one job you have to work less diligently the  for guaranteed pay with a minimum of uncertainty as to the steps you need to take or the tasks that require completion. Its of low but sustained cognitive effort and its mandatory. For the other job you have to work more diligently with great uncertainty about what steps to take to reach your goal not which steps are available but which will yield success which requires acute spikes of intense cognitive effort and is not mandatory. Which one do you think youre going to screw around and not engage with as much effort as you intend to? Furthermore value is not a static proposition. Maybe at the precise moment you accepted the job having guaranteed cash which lest you forget means food in your mouth clothes on your back a roof over your head essentials was more important. Maybe once you have your immediate needs taken care of the priorities change. I know this is rquotes but things are rarely oneliner simple in real life.

2759592,0,t1_cnhqa8l,about the first drawingAs a French ill try to explain the picture. The context of the drawing is the controversial movie about muhammed. The reference is a french movie from Godard called Le Mpris with Brigitte Bardot naked saying And my ass do you like my ass ? The cartoon has been interpreted in  different ways First as a sarcastic way to describe the hype surrounding islam and muhammad and its growing in popularity comparing it to Brigitte Bardot with all the curiosity and fanaticism around it untill you want to know everything about it to the point hes on all  showing you his ass.The second interpretation is a denunciation of the medias attention around the movie. The fact that something bad said about muhammad in a movie shouldnt attract that much attention therefore comparing him to a growing star.The third one the best imo is that Charlie Hebdo drawers wanted to make a point with a pure provocation saying that yes it might not be funny yes it might not be in good taste but no matter how sensitive you are and what your kind of humor is their freedom of speech allows them to do that and they will never be refrained by religious bias.Edit  Cabu one of the killed cartoonist also worked in a satirical journal called Le Canard Enchain whos slogan is The freedom of the press only gets damaged when you do not use it. Charlie Hebdo was exactly in the same vein.,quotes,cnhr6rq,-4,t5_2qhdx

2993274,0,t3_2ufq1z,indeed. a REALLY advanced technology is likely to be invisible to us for various reasons.  one examplegtMale turkeys presented with a lifelike model of a female turkey will happily try to mate with it as eagerly as they would with the real thing. This observation intrigued Martin Schein and Edgar Hale of the University of Pennsylvania and made them curious about what the minimal stimulus was that would excite a turkey. They embarked on a series of experiments to find out. This involved removing parts from a turkey model one by one to determine when the male turkey would eventually lose interest.gtThey removed the tail feet and wings from the model but still the bird waddled up to it let out an amorous gobble and tried to do his thing. Finally only a head on a stick remained. And to the researchers surprise the male turkey still showed great interest. In fact it preferred a head on a stick over a headless body.gtSchein and Hale subsequently investigated how minimal they could make the head itself before it failed to elicit a response. They discovered that freshly severed female heads impaled on sticks worked best but if the male turkey had nothing else it would settle for a plain balsa wood head. if  there is an alien civilisation much more advanced than ours  it is reasonable to assume that they would be able to hoodwink us as easily as we can trick turkeys into mating with heads on  a stick.  we may be interacting with dozens of alien civilisations and we have no way of knowing. so magic its invisible!i got this idea from one of the  cracked podcasts they are pretty good.,quotes,co891j3,4,t5_2qhdx

If their car broke down and I was  hours away and it was  in the morning I probably wouldnt miss work to help them. If one of the people in my close group of friends called me and was  hours away Id do everything I could and say fuck work. You cant really put everyone under that same umbrella and have it still be meaningful. Its the same problem I have with people who say love you to everyone. To me thats special.

I dont really see this coming out of someones mouth on accident. People have a way of saying profound things when they dont mean to but this quote doesnt really hit that accidentally profound mark for me. I would think its intentionally worded to make you think about what its really getting at. Lol I like youre wife drunk on cider example. But are you saying you dont think your wife has a strong mind and personality? Because Im sure she does. You wouldnt marry her unless you saw both of those things in her.

5309137,0,t3_3nq11m,Context is everything. Upon closer inspection history proves the exact opposite of what the quote seems to advocate.Robespierre rose to power during one of the bloodiest periods in France The Reign of Terror through some of the most underhanded means possible.This line was spoken in reference to the passing of the titular law of Terror which removed all due process from trials to hasten the execution of what Robespierre perceived to be enemies of his newly established order after a failed assassination attempt.This law was enacted during a time of great civil upheaval after the violent overthrow of the governing monarchy led by King Louis XVI. It allowed for suspected counterrevolutionaries to be brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal for crimes including slandering patriotism seeking to inspire discouragement spreading false news and depraving morals corrupting the public conscience and impairing the purity and energy of the revolutionary government.Those suspected were brought before the Tribunal based only public rumor were not allowed legal counsel were not allowed to call witnesses and were only allowed two sentences death or acquittal.The Tribunal oversaw more than one thousand executions in the less than two months before Robespierre was dethroned himself and executed by guillotine for charges of dictatorship and tyranny.It should go without saying that Robespierre had more than a bit of conflict of interest in asserting this claim. The line itself was likely addressing the National Convention as the law newly permitted the summary arrest and execution of any of its members by this Tribunal which was previously only allowed by official vote.Needless to say Robespierre exploited the Tribunal to execute any political opponents he so chose and he chose many as his fear and paranoia escalated towards his downfall. Any one who was fearful at the time was fully justified.,quotes,cvqay59,3,t5_2qhdx

I had a stable relationship of eleven years at the tie and I owned a house and very expensive high performance car. Basically I was very comfortable. The problem was that my job was killing my spirit day after day. I hated it with a passion. The only time I was truly happy truly alive was when i engaged in my hobby which was acting.Some years ago I had a serious motorbike accident where a drunk driver knocked me off my bike nad put me in a bad way. I realised at that point that happiness was more important so once I could walk again I gave up my job to follow my dream of becoming a fulltime actor. Last January I moved from the UK to Los Angeles to follow my dream and I couldnt be happier.I gave up my job my car my house my friends and moved to a foreign country to follow this dream which is now a reality and it was the hardest decision I have ever made. Daily I feel like I am out of my comfort zone but daily I feel like I am growing as a person and growing as an actor.I dont feel cowardly as I wasnt running from anything except misery and it not cowardly to give up negativity and focus on the positives in your life.,quotes,czrtdrz,3,t5_2qhdx

9030481,0,t3_53voue,I think that the quote is just meant to point out that chance and uncontrollable forces are going to determine a lot about a human being and their station in life. What does equality mean for someone who is born blind mentally handicapped disfigured without the use of their limbs or with any other of the myriad health issues afflicting humankind? Equality does not appear to be part of the worlds plan. Even two brothers can be vastly unequal in their mental capabilities desires physical appearance creativity etc. Inequality is not evil. Again its the tendency of mankind to take advantage of one another that is the cause of the ills in society. This is what leads to the equality of opportunity idea this is the right idea though it is limited since not everyone can have absolutely the same life situation when they are born. A lot of that depends on ones parents. As Thomas Sowell says Human beings are not random events. In some way or another we all carry on the legacy of our parents and the world in which they lived whether we want to or not. ,quotes,d7xbkkd,2,t5_2qhdx

10616617,0,t3_5rtba8,More full quote source Snopes The President is merely the most important among a large number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal able and disinterested service to the Nation as a whole. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts and this means that it is exactly necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President or that we are to stand by the President right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the American public.

Trump took those same  countries and expanded it to banning all refugees visa holders and green card holders. Thats a massive jump to the point that the first restriction fails to be an adequate explanation for the current ban. Therefore scapegoat. Unless you can come up with a logical argument otherwise?And you moved the goalposts. First you said Obama attacked the police now youre saying Obama took the side of BLM.
