1554226,0,t3_2bz4yu,The bikers have their own brand of justice? You mean getting sent to biker jail a room on top of the hill where they put you if you are too fucked updumb or are you talking about how they took substances off of dumb dealers who get caught? I mean they might have beat a person or two up but that only happened when the people were being violent in the first place.A buddy of mine took too much acid and was climbing a fence for HOURS before getting sent to biker jail. His hands were all cut up from the fence but otherwise he was fine.There was this other guy who we called the dancing king because he was dancing and dancing all night long in his tent alone. He got taken to the medical tent the next morning by the medical staff looking like a zombie. That dude was all danced out.The only real horror story that happened was that chick who got into an accident and got brain damaged when either she was driving while sleepdeprived or someone who was sleep deprived hit her.,bisco,cjb3gia,2,t5_2tila

6169940,0,t1_cyqye05,yeah jauz was cool but i really wish they coulda put something a little more psychedelic in ther during him. idk the whole vibe was psychedelic that night then jauz just felt totally outta place to mei liked his set dont get me wrong im just being picky as fuck. just not a huge fan of house but he did play some sick trapi dont even really like the biscuits but they played a really introductory biscuits set to gain more fans since were allmready for nectar next and it was pretty sick. like they didnt noodle so much and kept it kinda mainstream. then nectar wnd tipper both totally slayed. great nighti wanted to check out brightside after but was waaayyyyy too tired,bisco,cyqyic3,0,t5_2tila

6287753,0,t3_3zbngr,So in my opinion...Both EF and Bisco are completely different!Ive been to both and both equally hold a special place in my heart. EF is magical  touch I know but it really is. The lights the forest the vibes everything about it is amazing. Ive still never experienced anything like it. Bisco was the VERY FIRST festival Ive ever been to when it was in NY and it blew me away. It was definitely a different crowd from EF but still imo just as friendly. Keep in mind when I went to EF  it wasnt as publicized as it is now  I notice now its so much more mainstream and every  yr old and their bff is going which changes the vibes a lot.Bisco  was a SHIT SHOW mainly getting into the festival but Im gladly doing it all over again this year because its definitely worth it! the water park added a whole new element going hard at am listen to jauz while sitting in a wave pool is not something everyone can say haha. back to the crowd everyone I met was super chill and friendly but I definitely saw sketchy people so you just have to watch yourself and your belongings  something about Bisco will always bring me back it just has a solid fan base that no other festival has. No matter how shitty things can end up I always want to go back. If you have never been I really do highly recommend it! you wont see pretty lights everywhere you look or art installations like you do at the forest but I promise you youll see all the beauty that is Bisco,bisco,cz4chla,1,t5_2tila
6332164,0,t1_cydq4vx,Not sure why youre being downvoted  its pretty true. For the budget Bisco really put the money where it counted the sound and the artists.
