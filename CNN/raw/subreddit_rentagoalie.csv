826162,0,t1_cgy66a4,Sadly were a ways off from there. While there are more ice rinks than before theyre still wildly expensive.  Ive gotten into the groove of playing pickupattending clinics on ice and playing in inline leagues.  Hopefully at some point Ill be able to play on ice full time but for the time being the money is just not there.,rentagoalie,cgy6plv,1,t5_30x5l
