2394422,0,t1_cm7j5w9,Kadochnikovs Systema was developed along side Spiridonovs SAMBO.  There are practitioners and instructors in Russian service.Id posted a video where the Russian cop uses elements of Systema to stop the attacker.  Ive also posted videos where your combat of oneonone ground and pound gets wrecked in the real world.  Sure people get hurt in MMA people also get hurt in football and figure skating.  It doesnt make it combat.  Protective gear medical professionals on standby and ref to make sure your head doesnt get kicked in once youve been knocked out still make it sport.  It is still not combat no matter how hard you try to deny it.The effective techniques are apparently borrowed from other art forms which leaves the effectiveness of the unique Systema elements in question.With that philosophy everything is a bastardized version of boxing and wrestling.  Which to a degree is true but largely ignorant of the methodology and approach.The cop in the video I posted used neutral stance during beginning of the conflict something often seen in Systema brought a low guard when the altercation intensified again Systema  then the cop meets the strike of the shovel in a vector parallel to the strike allowing it to pass while simultaneously striking.  These are all elements of Systema.,systema,cm7npgy,1,t5_2t3i2
3287407,0,t1_cp2xz2d,Thanks for your comment.  You might be the only one that will be willing to discuss the soft training. I would like to hear what you know.  I got ideas of why they do but for sure at some point you gotta take those concepts and use then in sparring. The ones that dont work are what I would have concerns with then.so I look forward to hearing anything you could tell me about the training you have received. Thanks and take care. ,systema,cp2zo3g,2,t5_2t3i2

4350211,0,t3_3askec,tldr at the bottom.As Osaya pointed out the plus and minus of Systema is its versatility and broadness. Most new people come off either loving it hating it or confused. Rarely do i find some one who ends up indifferent on their experience.For example my group and I lean more onto the self defense side of Systema where another group enjoys the more...internal side of things and it shows in the class structure and exercises. St Louis Systema I dont live there though is right up my alley when it comes to Systema goals but then again i am a bit of a Sonny guy.Some people totally dig us some wish we spent more time on breathing and internal tension some people think we should spend more time fighting and that we are too nice and some down right dislike us. It all depends on the person.gtI read the Systema Manual over the weekend and the class I attended wasnt like what the book described. The Manual which is one of my favorite Systema books is more of a explanation on how Konstantine K. prefers to run his classes it is basically his Ideal Course Structure. He even states that if it was up to him everyone would spend their first year or two on the ground with no standing work inorder to get a ground acrobatic and mobility base. As much as i agree with that i could easily see my group cutting to half if i followed his guidelines to the T. But then again those who stayed would be some top notch practitioners.gtWith systema or other MA do noobs pair up with other noobs a lot? How much instruction is there? I think we went an hour stabbing at each other wo any actual instruction.Systema I find has one long learning curve to it. Most of the higher end skill levels have a good amount of previous martial art experience. There is even the inside bet going on that there would never be a high caliber Systema practitioner who has only done Systema. The Zettler twins has since proven that wrong since they are both so highly skilled but they are currently the exception to the rule. Martin Wheeler Kwan lee Sonny P Max even Vlad and Ryabko had a base art before they made Systema their own. People with a base art can take to the Systema ground running while others are quickly lost. People like Konstantine and Valentine have been placing lots of effort into fixing this Systema issue these last few years but it of course it takes time. With this along with the fact that any martial art takes a lot of time and dedication if someone makes it a year in any art is pretty amazing thats a lot of dedication and work of course leads into a lot of noob leading noob blind leading the blind. And its difficult for one instructor to spend a equal and fair amount of time with every student. A easy fix of course is to dumb down and structure the curriculum but then you would have something ridged like TKD instead of a flowing Systema. My group has been playing with this by having rotations breaking the group into smaller groups have one doing physical exercises one group working on mobility one working on a basic topic drill and one working with the instructor on the actual class topic drill. The jury is still out on that one.gt  I think we went an hour stabbing at each other wo any actual instruction. I think I expected more instruction that part certainly felt pretty pointless.People either love or hate this aspect to Systema. And the experience relies mainly on you and your partner. My favorite sections is when me and a partner gel and it becomes a bit of a dance of slashes and punches. I hate nothing more then getting stuck with a frustrating partner. Which is why partner switches are so frequent. It also allows you to work with different people sizes strengths skills and mentality. The best way I can explain it is think of Systema more like weight lifting. I go to the gym with a goal. To get stronger to get faster to work on bigger arms and to not forget leg day. But i have a goal. If i just go in and goof around then i wont grow or get better instead i just leave tired. A good instructor will help you specialize and prioritize your goal but he cant give you a goal. A good instructor is there to show you how to do the exercises correctly and safety. But its up to you to pick your intensity too low and its dull and boring too high and its risky and dangerous. You want to feel your Systema burn. It sounds like you are more interested in the internal breathing and tension aspects of Systema. And you can easily turn your end of the drills to focus on that if you know how just like people can make those internal aspects defense focus. This allows many people with many goals to be able to train together.gt AFAIK I was the only firsttimer in the class and the instructor didnt say anything to me.Im guilty of this as a instructor. I at least try and greet the new people get their name ask them how they are doing fill out these forms. But after that to me they are part of the group. I hate trying to sell a class to someone and i hate having to single someone out or prioritize one person just so they will give me money which is why im glad teaching doesnt pay my bills. But then again my favorite instructors treated me the same as anyone else from the start as if i was always there always part of the group. I know some people prefer more personal attention so once again to each their own.tldr St Louis Systema is known as one of the better self defense oriented Systema Schools. If Self Defense is not your main goal then i would check out other Systema schools in the area until you find one that aligns with you. If there are no other Systema schools and you still want to learn Systema then there are ways of making the drills and exercises fit into your goals. First way is of course to inform your Instructor on what your goal are he has  people to look over and teach its your job to make sure your needs are known and that they are known often. He should help you by giving you tips on how to to modify the drills for your needs. If not then you might be better off with a different internal art or at the very least a different Systema instructor.,systema,csg01po,2,t5_2t3i2
4539158,0,t1_ct2scab,It was a meetup run by an instructor with a random group of practitioners but in my opinion there was no gradual progression the instructor just hit me full force again and again until i hardly could hold the punches he was teaching me about how to hit i never did systema before but i think it went a bit overboard. The accidental punch to the face and stomach was unnecessary i think.,systema,ct2sgxd,1,t5_2t3i2
10666498,0,t1_ddg5d2v,gt Sure maybe that is mostly for SEO reasons one mention in a sea of MMA. If i was to show you that video with no context i highly doubt you would be like yep that is SystemaThats a fair point,systema,ddg62gb,1,t5_2t3i2
