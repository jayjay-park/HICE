2018005,0,t3_2hufcr,Why not yell out GOVERNOR RUN!! RUN AWAY! RUN RUN!!!Why not SHOOT THE FUCKER!!ANYTHING but running towards them both and not saying a word or doing anything.  Its so CONTRIVED.And thats the bottom line problem with this show. Its contrived. Why is it contrived? Because it has shit writing. Why does it have shit writing? Because it has shit show runners. Why shit show runners? Shit producers.Shit creator. Nick Santora. He produced Beauty and the Geek. Brilliant. ANd then this show has like  executive producers. Nick st episode writer and David Foster nd episode writer have actually penned some good eps of Prison Break good but dumb and House mostly good but obviously they are shit on this show. Its just pure shit. They seem way out of their depth with discussing computer shit. Its just really bad. The cast itself. Awful. Just awful. First its very bland. I know most of you dont think about this but the racial and gender make up of this show suck. Its majority white males with  females one of which is a single mom who brings the warmth to the show and pretty much nothing else. Seriously. The fucking soccer mom with orange slices. Thats basically McPhees character. The other is an asian woman good for minority standard but an AWFUL actress annoying voice and easily the worst actor on the set.But the others arent much better. The fat guy zzzzz cmon with the cliche bullshit.And the guy who fucked stiflers mom as the gambler type who can notice peoples tics is a rip off lie to me which is funny since nick santora worked on that show too. Sigh. But agian with them all virtually being white males it kills the fun of diversity casting. Its so bland. The only black guy I saw on episode  was a fucking security guard. Yes a GUARD. Thats how they see black guys. Not as intelligent enough to be a part of the main cast but as a got damn security guard. For that reason ALONE fuck this show.Sadly tho its not just the bland casting. Its the bad writing the crappy directing and the forced structure that makes this an obvious cancellation.Dont get used to this show it wont make  episodes.  ,scorpion,ckwd6um,2,t5_2w5gn
