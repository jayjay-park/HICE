26577,0,t3_1uf5xz,I dont have much information on shell changing or food so hopefully someone else comments but I can tell you some things that have been working with my own hermits. One of my crabs changes his shell every month or so it seems. My other crab hasnt changed in maybe three months which is worrisome. I heard you can encourage shellchanging in crabs by offering various shell shapes and sizes keeping the shells clean and rubbing a little olive oil on the entrance to the shell.As for food you just kind of have to experiment what they like and dont like. I like to keep freeze dried shrimp dried mangos and eggshell in my tank. A couple times a week I throw in either some peas peppers tuna cuttlebone coconut shavings bloodworms grapes banana pieces oatmeal or Cheerios. Sometimes I put in honey or peanut butter as a treat. Mine dont like kiwi but some people say their hermits like it. I once put in some of my goldfishs flakes and they seemed to enjoy it but I dont give that to them often.,hermitcrabs,cehgi67,2,t5_2teq8

1565918,0,t1_cjcjjid,OK honestly you really should have let her be.  Hermies molt for weeks or sometimes months  especially when they are young and going under for two days in not uncommon... going down for two weeks is not uncommon.  The best thing to do is just LEAVE THEM ALONE.  Honestly now she IS stressed because she may have been mid molt and shes been moved.  They bury themselves and dont move because they are using their energy to molt. Also moving her away from her molting area was a bad bad idea because they release chemicals to help them molt and they eat their old shells to get nutrients.Shes not shy... shes a hermit crab!  This is what they do.  Some hermies are more social some are not.  You can get hermies to not be scared of you  or people or noises or shadows but it takes MONTHS if not years.  Im going to be honest with you...if your hermie dies it is likely because you messed with her.  Sorry its the truth.  If you have a proper tank with enough substrate then there was nothing to worry about to begin with and no reason to remove her from the environment... she would have molted just fine without your help.  If shes been hanging on top of the food dish lately its because she was feeding to get ready to molt.  Im very sorry if your hermie passes and I really strongly encourage you to do a lot more reading because I fear you have not done enough research on how to have Hermies.  Please make sure the read up so that you dont lose an more.,hermitcrabs,cjck7n0,2,t5_2teq8
1620765,0,t3_2cvecr,Thanks for that! The big one had a buddy but he died. We took this guy out of the salt water from the beach it was nasty and put him in with the little guy and hes been super active and is parked on the food dish. ,hermitcrabs,cjjgoge,1,t5_2teq8
2486836,0,t3_2nm8ff,Hells yea. We also give ours a chicken wing bone with a little meat on it every now and then. They love it. Just make sure no spices or anything on the meat.,hermitcrabs,cmj61tx,1,t5_2teq8
2604703,0,t3_2pmb31,That rapid dissipation of dead crab smell suggests you hypothesized that someone died and then got eaten.  Theres not really anything you can do.  Why do you think it couldnt have been the new crabs digging down eating the dead crab and then climbing back to the surface afterwards?  If the others are melting theirs probably busy so I would suspect the mobile crabs before I suspect the other molters.As for your stressed crab isolation may be sufficient to help him but he may just have been too stressed by the process of being picked up in the wild thrown in a box packed onto a plane flown to a pet store and then kept in poor conditions until you got him.  Some crabs dont recover and theres not really anything you can do for them.Have you posted a picture of your crabitat?  Seeing that can sometimes help us suggest ways to improve the situation.,hermitcrabs,cmyklnr,1,t5_2teq8

4339129,0,t3_3ao9eb,So the . inches that Halloween crabs can grow is just shell size doesnt include legs.  When fully grown yeah they look big as hell.,hermitcrabs,cseqzy5,2,t5_2teq8
4390183,0,t3_3baiux,Ill first say what a lot of people are going to say. Check out  hermitcrabassociation.comThey have tons of great material to make you a crab expert in no time. The crabs should have about  inches or at least double their size thick of substrate. Bedding Which should be a  mixture of coconut fiber bedding which is sold loose and in compressed bricks at your local pet store and sand. A lot of people recommend a  mix of sand to coconut fiber but I went down to about  and my crabs seem to be doing fine. Just remember to keep the tank nice and moist and any mixture of the two should be fine. ,hermitcrabs,cskicy1,3,t5_2teq8

7891077,0,t1_d42tjyh,Good job on the setup! Id recommend   appropriately sized shells per crab. Just add more as you get then or have funds for. Welcome to the group! Please check out our Google Docs. A link is in the sidebar. There is a good rule in there titled something like getting started. check that one out first. Tons of great information for new crab owners. ,hermitcrabs,d4313pk,2,t5_2teq8
8359010,0,t3_4u0lka,Dont worry yourself. Hes probably just digging for the hell of it. Crabs like to dig even if they arent molting. My crab Thriller makes a huge mess of my tank every time I clean it. He loves to dig. I know when hes molting because I dont see him digging around and the tank isnt as disturbed. If youre worried just put the wAter dish back and let him do his thing.  ,hermitcrabs,d5mffh0,1,t5_2teq8

8866012,0,t3_51jbeh,I am currently using Inkbird PID controllers I bought on Amazon to regulate my heat mats. Theyre meant to be used in with HVAC or boiler type applications but work great for terrariums because they minimize temperature swings mine stay within . degrees Celsius of setpoint.Humidity should stay pretty well onpoint after the tank is established as long as you have a solid top and have the tank fairly well sealed up. Air stones in the water tubs  dishes will help keep it steady as well to help compensate for the normal evaporation.,hermitcrabs,d7dkjdx,3,t5_2teq8

10546406,0,t1_dd2xv60,No stupid questions here  believe me it took way long for me to figure it out. The UTH under the tank heaters have a sticky side  usually covered by a white paper that you peel off and then stick. Its pretty damn strong and the heat keeps it tacky. Makes for a clean look! ,hermitcrabs,dd3jx0b,1,t5_2teq8
