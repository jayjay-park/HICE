606217,0,t1_cg966pi,Mixed bag with the tail. He was a nightmare as a puppy in terms of knocked over glasses on the coffee table. But now that hes months hes very aware of his tail length especially around tables and other objects. Hell now jump off the couch and while we all cringe expecting the worst he instantly moves his tail to the side away from the glasses. I think there is some feeling in it too as when he wags standing next to a door and hits the door he slows the wag down or makes smaller wags to avoid the door all together. Hes basically just developed a better awareness of how much space he takes up. That said if the material is soft and it doesnt hurt him  like your legs  that is annoying. Hell whack your legs but instantly stops if you say oy!! Ive also seen other people on Weim forums talk about how their long tailed Weims split the end of their tails. So maybe Im just lucky with mine. I think the original purpose of docking probably was because of the tail splitting and getting infected.,weimaraner,cg96hol,2,t5_2risf

1050618,0,t3_264bc4,Finding a food can be tricky. It might take you a few tries to find something that works for your little guy. It might even change over time. I have two dogs currently a weim and a mix. I feed both Diamond dog food. It is a feed and seed store find around where I live. Both dogs do great on it. We have tried Everything from Blue Buffalo to Raw. Some faired better than others. Loki my weim was on Blue Buffalo as a puppy and did not do well on the adult food. Charlie cant eat Blue Buffalo. You will find that different dogs will take to different foods. The only thing I try to do is keep fillers to a minimum.As for treats we dont give any. I know that might sound mean we just dont. Love is all you need! It truly is all they want. Loki would rather have a rub down than get a treat that he eats so fast he cant taste it.,weimaraner,chnpkl0,2,t5_2risf

4231391,0,t3_39do13,A couple things to note. A dog wont be a running partner until after the puppy stage. Puppies cant run a lot but they do kiss a lot.. No dog or cat is hypoallergenic. If youre allergic to dog dander you will be allergic to weims. That being said I couldnt recommend this breed more. My opinion is jaded because I have the best girl ever but the breed is a smart and easily trained dog. ,weimaraner,cs2kaya,2,t5_2risf

7101507,0,t1_d1l5bbl,Yes it takes effort and time. It takes MONTHS to undo YEARS of being a poorly trained dog owner. As dog owners and especially big breeds like Weims we need to own our mistakes and correct them in the most humane and responsible way possible.So you would rather your clients use something that causes discomfort or will even hurt a dog to get results because they are lazy? Jesus man. Would they use a cattle prod to stop their children running around in a shopping mall?Shortcuts by negative reinforcement is the laziest way possible that can lead to some very unpredictable results if a professional isnt doing the training. You might as well beat the dog every time it pulls. It will also stop pulling then and very quickly. See my comment regarding the incorrect use of an shockcollar and the results it can yield by poor use lets not use the nice warm fluffy term ecollar to hide what it really is. As you said your clients are lazy so do you think they will not be lazy when it comes to using prong collars and shockcollar to speed up results?,weimaraner,d1lbthn,2,t5_2risf

7416305,0,t3_4gv6ux,Ive had my weim for almost  years now. He was not the first pup I had raised but man was he the toughest. Let me tell you I made a ton of mistakes and now I can say he is the calmestsweetest best friend Ive ever had.The thing with weims is no matter what you read their energy level is unbelievable its beyond comprehension at least from my experience. These dogs were bread to be outside hunting all day and spending time with their owners at night. Let me give you an example of my holy ht this is what it takes to tire him out moment. He was  years old. By this time hed chewed up dozens of shoes caps pillows bed sheets you name it. I would walk him take him to dog park but when Id leave him alone at home there would always be something destroyed. I just thought he had separation anxiety. One week I took him up to my buddys lake. The first day the dog ran swam chased frisbees from ampm. I dont even recall him taking breaks. He was breathing heavily but just wouldnt stop! We were all worried he would just collapse at some point. Nope he passed out after eating and did the same thing the next day.Of course all weims are different for mine. Walking on a leash  hour a day was not enough its still not enough even at  years old. The dog needs to run. So rather than give up my dog which so many people do to poor weims I had to change my life style. I started running with the dog getting him and myself into a routine that would allow me to not worry when I left him alone. Ever since its been great like unbelievably great.My weim gets along with other pups my parents have a cat and they both just dont care for each other. All this to say if you and your kids like the outdoors and hiking and frisbeeing then absolutely go for it. Theyre really special breeds and I find myself so fortunate to have him in my life.,weimaraner,d2l6p7n,4,t5_2risf
7417974,0,t3_4gv6ux,If you have other dogs in the house she will need considerably less stimulation than a weim with no siblings. If the weim you are adopting is a puppy she will likely take to the other dog well and even learn some of the house rules through observation. Teaching her tricks will also cut down on the amount of physical exercise she needs. We RARELY run with our weim but we take him in the car and roll the window down even if its just a short errand and he never gets out of the car. we choose reataurants with outdoorpet friendly patios and take him with us when we get lunch or drinks. And the best energy burner  we have taught him to find it or locate a toy or human on the house based on smell. These activities keep our dog calm enough that he naps several times daily and he is approx  years old.The downside your pup will grow tall enough to get into trouble reach the dinner table before she is old enough to understand manners. She will be fast leggy smart and mischievous and you will be overwhelmed from months . I made tons of mistakes training ours but I dont see any negative impact of my learning curve  just think of your pup as a sensitive child be firm and direct but know that she will get the message quickly so make your point and move on.As a side note in upstate ny she will need a sweaterjacketvest for winter! Mine loves the snow but he is usually shivering after  minutes. ,weimaraner,d2ldjf1,2,t5_2risf
7848101,0,t1_d3urf10,Right??!  I love this pic because it shows the size difference so well.  He carried that thing around for months before he moved on to another tiny toy.,weimaraner,d3y72gs,1,t5_2risf

10477121,0,t3_5q1h1k,Our  year old girl has always wanted to jump up on people it seems that weims believe that theyre greeting you and showing their love. As with most things weim an immediate NO NO NO and then SIT SIT SIT with a small treat reward for sitting has worked well for us. Patience and repetition and reward over and over and over. But when meeting strangers Im always keeping her on a short leash because weims are the original ADD dogs and their memory sometimes just whooshes away.,weimaraner,dcvov0f,2,t5_2risf

10858190,0,t1_ddzxhxh,By  months that sleepy stuff will pass. The best I can tell anyone new to weims is exercise exercise and when youre tired of exercise get some more time in for exercise. We take our girl everywhere never caged her but shes never alone. Were retired more or less and in a dog friendly community so even when shes wired to the max people are very tolerant. Our idea of exercise is mostly on the beach where she can run wo a leash. She does a lot of frisbee and gets exhausted. A tired wiem is a good weim. GOOD Girrrrl.,weimaraner,ddzy22r,2,t5_2risf
11555262,0,t1_dg5sf7a,Sad to say she passed in November.  She was  years old.  And I actually picked her out of the litter bc she was the most playful  she only ever stayed  lbs until we had to use Prednisone to treat cancer.  But this elephant did her ears like this only for her Dad and he caught it on camera several times.  Miss this girl lt,weimaraner,dg5sjuo,2,t5_2risf
