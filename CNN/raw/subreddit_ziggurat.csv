2790719,0,t1_cnl57c4,I wont spoil how to find it  what is in it for you just in case you want to discover it for yourself but if you want to figure it out it is readily available on the internet ,ziggurat,cnlambl,1,t5_333hp
3491546,0,t1_cpq7pif,Good points. Id also argue that theres little point in having the minions in obelisk rooms drop anything at all  so much is already given from breaking the obelisks. Plus that would nullify the problem with having the amulet I described.,ziggurat,cpq9ewv,1,t5_333hp

5572814,0,t1_cwnu8l9,I got it with the Templar. The mana economy early game makes hard mode much for forgiving in how you choose perks. The class that start with a staff the name escapes me at the moment is also pretty solid I got pretty close on that and I would restart until I got Power of Heart. I got to floor  with that and died to a rough champion room on that one.,ziggurat,cwnuxw4,2,t5_333hp
