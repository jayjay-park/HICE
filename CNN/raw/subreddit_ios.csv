2597187,0,t3_2pkpev,Really clever concept! Some ideas for improvement  The challenges could have started easier. I got the first quickly but was stumped on  for awhile. Best to pull people in with at least a minute or so of success to get them investedhooked.  Im a design nerd so this may not have equal weight for everyone but I usually delete an app if the interface isnt aesthetically looking and so wasnt a big fan of the visual style of the game. I misspelled something and wanted to delete the letters Id placed so I clicked the trash can icon to the right which is actually the cheat to delete unnecessary letters for a fee. This is a cool feature but the icon is unclear and its perhaps available too early in the game I only pay for inapp featuresbonuses once Im seriously hooked.  The Facebook icon after the letters looks like another letter. Obviously its not but the placement is confusing and upon clicking it theres no indication of what you get from connecting to FB. Hope that helps! Thanks for sharing!,ios,cmxl80f,2,t5_2ru5b

2850305,0,t1_cnrzg74,To be honest it was two fold. One I started using it a long time ago way before I even knew about wunderlist and some of those competitors. And it wasnt lacking for me. For instance I rarely set times for my actions aside from dates which Things handles and if I do I just use Siri with apple reminders since I dont care what app its in because I just want a popup to happen at a specific time and dont care what app it comes from. Two I think a lot of it had to do with how much money I had invested in the iPhone amp Mac app. I know its irrational and if there were a better option out there I should use it. But I think I spend  combined and wanted to get my moneys worth. But at the end of the day it looks great does  of what I want very well and the  I dont care about syncs well and is easy to use especially with the new notification widget Also the icon doesnt bug me which can not be said about some of things competitors. ,ios,cns2v0m,1,t5_2ru5b

4566922,0,t1_ct5bjns,IDLE is a push mechanism bro. ActiveSync or even Apple Push works in the more or less same way  keeping a TCP HTTPS connection open pinging every several minutes to keep the connection alive and waiting for the incoming packets from the server. Thats said ActiveSync managed to coalesce folders other services and device management together in a single connection with its protocol design and this gives it an edge over IMAP IDLE.By the way Microsoft is doing exactly what you said with its Outlook for iOS since everyone knows it has a cloud component. Outlooks cloud accesses mailboxes via IMAP IDLE or fetching if IDLE isnt available perhaps Gmail API and ActiveSync and new messages and inbox count is pushed through Apple Push to your phone by Outlooks cloud.,ios,ct69vst,1,t5_2ru5b

7879550,0,t3_4ldfgx,I just bought an iPhone again after about three years.  After about three days of use I can say that Siri is dumb as shit now.  If I ask her to call someone from contacts she will say she doesnt know who it is if I ask for directions she gives a fuckin web search or sends me to a different continent.  She used to be ok and would give me mostly what I wanted without issue.  Personally I prefer Cortana on Windows phone the best.  That robo bitch knows how to get shit done.  You know a program is really good when you get in your car and your phone turns on by itself sets your gps for you based on a location in your calendar notification tells you how long it will take you to get there and if there is traffic or not.

8979785,0,t1_d7r41n2,That statement basically tells me that you are not interested in the discussion or dont understand it. A HDMI cable is digital without a fallback for a given display mode resolution framerate D bits per pixel etc and therefor either delivers a perfect signal or none at all. But this isnt even about arguing that a  Dollar audio extension cable results in a noticeable worse audio quality than a  Dollar cable which could be true in theory unlike HDMI but is most likely BS. Different quality DAC matter instead very much. I had a Nexus   once that had a rather bad IMO DAC that sounded very noticeable worse than my Galaxy S and S phones when using with my Sure SE  which arent close to the most high end headphones around. The author of the report claims that the difference is noticeable already with headphones costing  Euro or more especially when comparing high quality sources instead of more compressed ones which is a range that many iPhone and flagship smartphone users in general are part of. Subsequently they changed the rating of the headphone jack from B for the S  iPad Air to only C for the iPhone  with the adapter. Of course people who are happy with the included ear buds need not to worry although those have no reason to use the Lightning adapter anyway for others a different adapter might be required to get a familiar performance out of their gear.gt The results are clear On iPhone S the dynamics deteriorated by . dB A when playing off a bit music file via the adapter instead of the internal socket. On iPad Air the signal deteriorated by . dB A. Even with bit music files the losses are clearly noticeable although not quite as drastic Here the dynamics deteriorated by . dB A at the iPhone and by . dB A at the iPad.BTW it should be noted that the last two iPhones already were not as good as other flagship phones when it comes to the headphone out but they still were quite good ,ios,d7r8en4,7,t5_2ru5b

I also miss Pushbullet on Android.On IOs love smoothness battery life on SE speed when opening storieslinks.  Like on Fox News or most of the news apps when you click the story it loads almost instantly.  Not as fast on Android.Most of the GoogleAndroid apps are on IOs and work great. I love iMessage and the new things you can do with iOs . Notifications on  are much improved. The dictation is faster and more accurate.

If you want to really help battery life turn off unused location system services in Privacy and turn off Background App Refresh for apps that you dont want refreshing in the background.

I still kill it by the end of the day on off days where Im able to use my phone all day long but on normal days I get to the charger usually with at least  remaining. On some normal days Ill kill it before the end of the day but not often.With my iPhone  it was a constant search without fail for a charger at the end of the day. Usually I would come home with . Now I come home with . Sometimes  or more.Like look at this. I didnt charge my phone last night.Granted I listened to  hours of podcasts yesterday. Also probably  hours of FaceTime audio. So most of the usage time was screenoff. But still. I started the day today with . I still have  left in the screenshot as well.A typical day is about  and a half hours of use at  but ALL of that is screen on time.

10464880,1,t3_5pw3y2,Heres my perspective Im an older guy with lots of tech experience because of job as scientist. I didnt see the point of having  access to the internet via a phone since nor did I want to carry around some giant thing everywhere. So for the past few years Ive used an old school slide phone despite the giggles from the kids. Alas the battery was dying. So it was time to upgrade.   My  year old dad got an iPhone  and really seemed to like it. So I took a half hearted plunge and bought an unopened really iphone s just a couple of weeks ago. Getting an SE would be hard to justify financially scientist salary and not sure if I would even use it. Sure a larger screen would be better for fading vision but the trade of is that it is less portable. Im quite happy with the form factor of the s and will likely move up to something similar like the SE or its descendant. TLDR  I hope Apple maintains a small screen phone.,ios,dcuatvm,1,t5_2ru5b
10469718,0,t3_5pw3y2,No one really knows what Apple is going to do.  I think its unlikely cause they are trying to move in the direction of the  sized phones.  I think the point of he SE was that it was cheaper than the  not that it had a smaller screen.  They might release more budget models but I wouldnt count on them having the smaller screen.  The c was a budget model with the thencurrent screen size rather than the previous generation screen size.,ios,dcuulqt,1,t5_2ru5b

10655022,0,t3_5sg14d,Normal for me. I think jailbreaking just shows the android vs iOS argument. Its the same as Xbox vs PS Nikon vs canon etc. Its all preference. Neither is better its just what you like. I moved to android to get more experience of the OS mobile app designer. I hated the messaging app so asked coworkers. An argument started about the best messaging app. Repeat for email camera etc. Apple lock down the OS and pour a shit ton of effort into design. They have to as the users cannot modify large parts of it. So it has to be good for the masses intuitive etc. Android also pour a shit ton of effort into design too but in a way that makes so much customisable. Its difficult to give a user such a massive toolkit for customisation and at the same time make it simple and intuitive. Also try delivering delta OS updates to phones that have been massively customised by both users and manufacturers. Hence their massive OS fragmentation. Its why theres a market for both Adobe after effects and windows movie maker. Or DSLR cameras and point and shoots. Its about context of use but mostly user preference. These are not metaphors for each OS!So the iOS is stupid or android is shit arguments are both invalid. Back on topic for jailbreakers maybe they should just go android. But maybe they like the iOS device and core iOS itself but want that extra layer of customisation on top. Each to their own!,ios,ddezf4j,4,t5_2ru5b
