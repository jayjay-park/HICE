5155917,0,t1_cv7egeh,gt So tempting to buy gems and draw him out TTId forgotten how good the drop rates for x are you could get a bunch of other SSRs too while aiming for him. I wish I wasnt broke at the moment gt.lt,StardustShooters,cv7hatz,1,t5_33j2u

6489566,0,t1_czqfp4s,Thanks a lot mate I saw the advice to just pull on those situations you first mentioned but I did saw the current gacha and didnt look like a regular one so thats why I asked. And since Im struggling already with my team whenever I dont have really strong guests I wasnt sure if it was a good idea to pull already or not. But Ill try to wait for the x one like you suggested and just pull once now just for the rush xDThanks once again!!,StardustShooters,czqkili,3,t5_33j2u

9481590,0,t3_5ahbf3,At first I also thought this would be a tough mission collect points only from the timespecific quest but it turned out to be the easiest one. The hearts one gets you  kills per quest mostly  so that means you can get  points where the final reward is in around  games. The quest is very easy for a heart one especially if you have Shigegy. To give an image My Shigegy Atk k without any cutin ability could overkill all enemies except boss who I needed to be a bit close to him when doing the smash to kill him in one shot If you do not have Shigegy its still easy but might take a bit longer time. Finally I got that  kills in . hours yesterday and that ended my campaign this time!!So if you are considering whether it worth to wake up at night I hope this give you an idea. Good luck ,StardustShooters,d9ht6xl,2,t5_33j2u
9510748,0,t3_5b3dun,Well Ive used his special a couple of times but nothing happens. I select  enemy and Kira throws a coin at him. But thats all nothing happens after that. Did I do something wrong?,StardustShooters,d9legv0,1,t5_33j2u
