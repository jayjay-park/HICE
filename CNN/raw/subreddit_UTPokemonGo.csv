8533788,0,t3_4wma3u,I am just using one ive built myself using the updated API. The API was used for most the trackers was broken for  days and literally was just cracked by some devs again a few hours ago. Until the owners of the public live trackers become aware of this and update their backends to deal with the new authentication you will have to use your own solution. Likely by now though people might have some of the popular repos updated so check out the pokemongodev subreddit.,UTPokemonGo,d68aenc,2,t5_3fd9i
