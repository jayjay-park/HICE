3030488,0,t3_2uvsb5,Maybe. Please check if that harddisk had an actual sata connector. I have a few WD My Passport gb usb disks floating around and surpisingly those disks are equipped with a native usb. interface on their PCB instead of sata. If your disks has a sata port you should be OK. ,banana_pi,coc3w0z,3,t5_31gbh
