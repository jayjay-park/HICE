6715963,0,t1_d0dymix,Hmmmm... Not sure if thats true. First of all tournaments give you only  tickets depending on what VIP level you are. So if you only have  tix available from the moment you start the race the ticket is accounted for whether you win or lose. Therefore  fuel definitely beats  tickets in my book any day.Second no tournament race is long enough and has combined factors or barricades ramps and draft opportunities as the UG on Ch . In other words no possible way of making    per race.  Third the later races in chapters   etc CAN give you around kk a pop as a random prize but you dont get those cards all the time. Its a cycle of VP Part nd Part or BP and then Cash. And what else? Each one costs you  fuel.... So yeah... Not willing to waste fuel on stupid VP points...Like I said this is a just an alternative for those who did not know.

8674867,0,t1_d6pv6zs,Trying to reach max speed in that battery race has a major variable that a player have no control over. Nitro zones spawn differently in every race. Sometimes they may spawn right infront of those civilian carstraffic and then you loose speed either by missing the zone or crashing into CV. That is why I suggested a different track that has a clear stretch and you can reliably test top speed.Also ingame stats doesnt show anything regarding what the actual speed or acceleration value is. Its just a  digit number that increases with materials slotting and parts installation. To test the actual speed in Kmh you have to try different cars in same track to have a sort of controlled environment for accurate results with little variationmargin of error.,nfsnolimits,d6pzbt6,1,t5_3aph9

Perfect nitro execution  perfect turn with minimal loss of speed and a good straight.   I agree with your acceleration thingy. But if you dont make mistakes and drive well  ccx is the better choice in  of the racesdue to rampshalf a second jump gives me  nitroexcept for races like snake pass dry gulch cornerstone north.  Even in dry gulch.  The guycheckout grdlows blackridgerumble thread with star max laf is just . faster than me he probably has the fastest time.   star laf has much muchh better accelerationmore than my ccx.but yet only half a second faster inspite of  tricky turns where a mistake can send your car in the opposite direction. Another thing I observed Higher the top speed the more often you attain   of the  that top speed  and with less effort.  s and laf might not attain the kmh as easily and often as ccx does. Even if i am at  for  mere seconds i have great great lead  which gives little room for minor errors.  also  of brr races are nitro rushes.

And you have nerve to say that its costly to make games ??? Real games that are made for PC and consoles will cost for morrons  plus DLCs that mainly go for  euro per dlc in day one. Morrons are the  people who buy the games from steamoriginsuplay and so on. I buy from allkeyshop or the like sites where I get games with every DLC and I dont even pay over  for them in day one or preorder. These games are now days GB in size and over. Like the Call of duty latest game is GB or Forza horizon  that you can play on xbox and PC crossplatform and these games dont have these retarded things like buy gold for a  so you can buy few of these crates that may give you something you need but mostly will get things that go for scraps only. And what do you get ? Few fuel that let you play  more minutes of the game. Its a freaking money crab and this needs to end. Its not a freaking AAA title and these will never be AAA titles cause they are APPS for a android or ios. Full games will always be for console and PC that will be AAA titles.
