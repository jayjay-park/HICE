6024555,0,t1_cws61di,Wow man thanks for the reply! sorry it took so long to get back to you. I actually came across this during my search and its more or less what we ended up doing. Perceived value is definitely an aspect that bears a good amount of weight when negotiating these kinds of things. Thanks again! ,renting,cy9capl,1,t5_2sg0x

If its held by a deposit scheme then itll automatically be given back to you once the tenancy is terminated and any arrears are accounted for.,renting,darnfmc,1,t5_2sg0x
10230044,0,t1_dc0ugu5,I live in Missouri.He called me back today and he is definitely doing this as retaliation for me asking for my second pet deposit back. He said he had five years to pursue charges. He told me I should have waited for more than a month for him to get back to me I did actually. I first asked him at the beginning of November several times after and sent the demand letter at the end of December. I moved out at the end of September and he left my pet deposit out when he gave me a security deposit refund then originally told me pet deposits were nonrefundable when I asked. I had to get out my lease to prove it. He also told me that I needed to learn that when someone doesnt return my calls then they are probably dealing with something. He was very defensive and flustered and hung up on me when he said his piece.He never gave me an itemized list of damages when I moved out of the first apartment either the one he is claiming damages outside of what my security deposit covered. ,renting,dc3msdr,1,t5_2sg0x
10797740,0,t3_5u6zg3,I guess its reasonable but even if you charged them  of the rent theyd still be getting a pretty sweet deal.  to rent a twobedroom apartment that they only have to share with one person?Personally Id be a little annoyed if they thought that was too much. After all youre doing them both a favor by taking them into a home you intended to live in by yourself. And they want to haggle over  bucks a month?,renting,ddtpk5z,1,t5_2sg0x
11149697,0,t1_devex1n,Luckily her lawyer has said that it should be off her record in two years so it shouldnt be that long. But until then were between a rock and a hard place. Our plan is to skirt their occupancy policy which is as follows an occupant is defined as someone spending more than  consecutive days or  days per month quarter.Shell have to stay elsewhere two nights a week but she can mostly stay with me and we can stay in the clear technically. In that time Ill sign a  month lease and well look for a private renter or find a loophole if we can.I appreciate your reply.,renting,devt14x,1,t5_2sg0x
11182753,0,t1_deyjxo0,If youre planning on keeping it then I dont see why theyd try and put it back on the market especially if youre still living there currently. I could be wrong but we didnt worry about that type of thing since we just did the income thing and everything was ok. Best of luck to you. ,renting,dezjw4r,2,t5_2sg0x
11483295,0,t1_dfw7ziy,This is the correct answer. The lease should lay out exactly what happens and what the landlord will charge when rent is late. It does not matter what is or is not justified  landlord and tenant are bound in a legal contract that specifies exactly what happens when you pay your rent late.Dont pay your rent late.,renting,dfxmo9b,1,t5_2sg0x
11529077,0,t1_dg2ibq1,He paid it to the land lord moved out and never received it from the land lord. Then my new room mate at the time eventually paid me the total of the deposit in small somes over a  month period which I was holding in the hopes he would clean his garbage mountain.It does not seem just that he could receive his full deposit back for the hours of cleaning and year  process it took me to eventually remove all of his garbage is it implied that any room mate could do this as an ultimate screw you to their old room mate when moving out?,renting,dg2tmsw,2,t5_2sg0x
