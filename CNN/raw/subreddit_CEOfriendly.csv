10237973,0,t1_dc4j0if,Good to hear! Remember we are CEWL now. We are no longer COOL. They are a different crew and community. You can be in both tho. Just use the right tags whenever joining. ,CEOfriendly,dc4j50e,3,t5_3gnyt
10271988,0,t3_5n36z0,Totally agree. Every kill is assumed as an accident first. Unless the incident keeps repeating then you must report them. Take screenshot of the notifications log and who were in the lobby.You handled this exceptionally. This is how all members should handle these situations. I would really appreciate if someone could make a spanish version of our rules and screenshots.This post is also a reminder to everyone to share the rules screenshot on the sidebar of our sub.,CEOfriendly,dc8dwp7,3,t5_3gnyt

10424828,0,t3_5pafoh,Good idea. Ive done a ticket and jumped through a ton of hoops to get compensated for IE missing cars. That mightve helped.A few things Ive learned about tickets. If you think youll send a ticket on something grab a video right away. Hitting the controller share button and picking the save video option will save the previous  minutes. Also be sure to open your interaction menu at least once. Your PSN is displayed at the top of tge menu and R needs to see your PSN to verify your didnt just download the video from someone else on YouTube. When they send a message that they are going to close a ticket because they think it has been solved and the ticket is in pending status but you dont think its done send another message. I had to do this to get resolution for my one ticket I actually received compensation for.,CEOfriendly,dcpq1lr,1,t5_3gnyt

10475932,0,t3_5pzf22,Hey man is she in yet? I think one of the mods has already accepted her. Sorry about the delay. Mods check if applicants are members of griefer crews and if they have read the rules so it takes awhile. she should be in now. If not lemme know.,CEOfriendly,dcvk0bx,1,t5_3gnyt
10482635,0,t1_dcwb603,Will do.

10491613,0,t3_5q4x4u,I dont think we should be trading anything I believe theres enough decent members here to give you a Pac Standard without being bought. Just my opinion though. I hope you get your Pac Standards though and maybe see you in the FH beta ,CEOfriendly,dcxc20i,1,t5_3gnyt

10549547,0,t1_dd3vkg2,You mean that one time you got the bus caught on the rocks a whole  feet from the destination? And James makes a good point This isnt just a community where you an play with people who have the same goals as you chances are you may actually make some friends. They may eventually engage in friendly ribbing but probably no worse than youd run into with your own friends. If you ever do have an issue  either with random crew members or the people youve been playing with for a while  talk to them and let them know you dont appreciate it. If that still doesnt work make a report and the mods will take a look. Chances are if this happens in game chat in a crew lobby the moderators will probably step in anyway.,CEOfriendly,dd3wqxh,2,t5_3gnyt

11188544,0,t1_df05gxw,Not stupid at all. Ill disagree with someones idea I wont criticize though everyone should feel free to throw ideas out there for discussion.My experience is that griefers love a fight you might get rid of a genuine low level but not a seasoned griefer its just feeding the troll.One thing they absolutely hate is being followed with no chance of killing you. Following a griefer in a hydra in passive drives them up the wall. Youll get non stop textmic abuse as they get more and more frustrated.,CEOfriendly,df07iat,10,t5_3gnyt

11523889,0,t1_dg24ykh,As for appearing offline what Ive heardread is that rockstar uses your online status for matchmaking purposes. I havent done enough testing to see if this is actually true. I can say that when several of our crew kept getting overrun we did see a decrease after everyone set to appear offline which could have just been a coincidence. If someone needed to join one of us would set status to online long enough for them to get in the session and change their status back. ,CEOfriendly,dg28gmn,1,t5_3gnyt
