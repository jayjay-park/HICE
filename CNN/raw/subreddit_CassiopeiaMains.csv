6834660,0,t3_48ffgb,I love cass how she is but if they can take away some of the reliance on hitting your q or w thatd be fantastic. From what Ive seen they are going to focus more on poison stacking and increase what you can do with the more stacks on an enemy that you have. ,CassiopeiaMains,d0r0dn0,1,t5_37itl

7636471,0,t1_d39qn5l,No clue. I havent played her enough since she was changed to know where she stands aside from her being garbage on .. Since the mage update Ive been playing mostly Aurelion Sol. I liked Stashus rework of Cassio a lot actually. I think it really carved out a good niche for her. It gave her a lot of the tools she needed to perform as a late game scaling mage that she lacked before. I dont care for thematic stuff so I honestly didnt give a shit that she didnt feel like a poison mage. ,CassiopeiaMains,d3a82q4,2,t5_37itl

8204171,0,t3_4ricg1,I think it allows for a less onedimensional playstyle for cass. If ws poison lingered it would pretty much negate the need for her q. Yeah her q does a bit more poison damage but its intent is to setup damage for her e. If you give w more damage over time itll bring it back to the original problem with prerework cass which was that her q and w served the same purpose. ,CassiopeiaMains,d532qm4,4,t5_37itl
8868841,0,t3_51pxyb,Better link  hereAnyway the scaling of heal is now Champion level. So at level  instead of healing  flat . AP it now heals  flat .AP. I guess they want to take away some of her self healing before they start tinkering with her damage since her constant DPS and QE combo is more iconic and core to her and ultimately in a good spot IMO. In saying that I wont be too surprised if she does get more nerfs later in this PBE cycle.,CassiopeiaMains,d7dwrww,2,t5_37itl
9383137,0,t3_58nq9z,You can climb with anything. Its harder with cassio cause she needs some skill in dodging and hitting skillshots. Climbed with her from silver IV to plat V this season. She is perfect for lower elos cause those games normally dont end pre  min and after that mark and  items cassio is a monster if played correctly.,CassiopeiaMains,d95dn7d,1,t5_37itl
9611672,0,t1_d9xtyao,I will work hard on it no doubt! Since I had the honour to be wrecked by Blue Cobra himself he was unranked in Euw and was doing placements for his account and I was like Silver  I couldnt believe there was a champ cool and gracefully deadly as Cass in the right hands of course. ,CassiopeiaMains,d9xu30o,1,t5_37itl
9763113,0,t3_5ezpoz,It can work in lower elos but not really worth.Just pick a proper support who can protect the carries since Cass really cannot ... or simply dodge. No reason to tilt your ADC and your team.,CassiopeiaMains,dagirku,1,t5_37itl

9962221,0,t3_5i2t8p,Theres a lot of different things I noticed in the video but one big issue stood out Positioning. Its critical for surviving ganks with Cass because she is one of the most immobile mages in the game.During the laning phase controlling the wave reduces the chance of being ganked and allows the opportunity to farm safely. Controlling the wave is especially important against dangerous junglers ZacNocturneVi and snowballing mid laners FizzZedAhri. When playing aggressive having proper vision is critical to surviving ganks. The best way to survive is recognizing the approaching champion and position accordingly. Although most of the time the safest option is to simply return to the tower.   Comments on the Video Cass extends without proper vision on that side of the river. Doing that is very risky on a mage with low mobility. However if she had vision of the Ahri she could have stunned her and maybe escape with a kill or  depending on how much damage she put outKayle Ult amp Vi coming in late. Cass failed to respect Vis capabilities and was punished for overextending. However If Ahri was not there and she hit her Qs she might have been able to kite Vi under tower and live.  Need to respect Ahris damage output and mobility. Cass might have been able to stun Ahri if she ulted as soon as Ahri dashed back in but I think Ahris combo still would have hit her. However in this case its more of a good play by Ahri rather than Cass messing up.  The flash all in by Ahri was brutal but Cass still didnt respect Ahris damage in the first place. She should not have walked up like that minions were pushing towards her and she could have farmed at a distance under tower. Any champion that has a lot of burstmobility ahrizedect. needs to be respected. If she followed Zac they might have won a v depending on how they played it but not a v once Kayle got there. Also the flash and the ult were panicked and unnecessary If she kept those up the might have been able to FlashUlt under tower and escape at the bare minimum. However with both on cool down and the chain CC she was dead the second Vi clicked the lantern.  No reason for her to go up like that. Same problem with the death at . Good pick by Ahri. If Cass was going after thresh she should have went through base gate.  Games over but I respect the effort. Just one of those last ditch v attempts to save the base. ,CassiopeiaMains,db63qba,3,t5_37itl
10018794,0,t3_5j4mkp,I dont really think the Liandrys burn was the deciding factor in that well done quadra though the flat penetration may have helped.  I was definitely surprised at the kill on Caitlyn too though. Im not sure I see Liandrys being more useful than an Abyssal or just a Void Staff.,CassiopeiaMains,dbdh6su,2,t5_37itl
10055589,0,t3_5jq6yk,Im not the person to give you this information cause i got only  games on her but it seems like most cass mains HATE syndra i played that lane  times and got destroyed  times she outranges you and outdamages you in the laning phase leblanc is pretty hard  Edit there is a matchup topic somewhere on this subreddit.,CassiopeiaMains,dbi9na2,1,t5_37itl
10116745,0,t3_5jq6yk,When playing cass top irelia can be a pretty miserable matchup. Other than that you can go even or have an advantage on a lot of top laners.,CassiopeiaMains,dbq7x4n,1,t5_37itl

11021326,0,t3_5wy4uw,Cassiopeia has been one of my favorite champs since season  but she had a slightly better kit now since the mid season mage update. In my opinion one of her most gamechanging ability is WMiasma. It is especially strong during a team fight as it denies any type of gapclosers like flash dashes jumps. When you fight against mobile champs midlane whether melee Zed Yasuo Ekko etc or range Ahri LB etc it is important that you know how to utilize miasma. Practice on anticipating  when the enemy is going to jump on you. Keeping your distance from the enemy is the most important thing for Cass. Her Q also gives movement speed which should help you in kiting the enemy.  During team fights always stay in the back and lay down the miasma  so you can watch the enemy team struggle to get without gapclosers.  In lane its best to just farm up on cass since it is so easy to farm with E. DO NOT spend all your mana harrassing the enemy because she will run out of mana quickly its important to learn to budget your mana on cass.,CassiopeiaMains,deh8jiv,1,t5_37itl
