346646,0,t3_1xyu5c,I went out of the server mostly because of turning of factions into bandits with names zero organization. I know i settled up in a war zone though ive never seen any true town or village just bunkers splattered like dots on the map and that tells me there is no real intentions for common wealth just individualist accumulation of goods and wares or kills the last one also seems to be something people is proud to gather on its character even if you dont earn points for that. ExampleBut im confident that the server is going to improve in time just starting and needs to go through this to realise it has to decide what is going to become.Im proud my achievements though i got all i had without killing a single soul.Edit Other thing Ive noticed the so called raids in this server mysteriously happen when the enemies have one or none online the wars ive seen are just a bunch of backstabs while the other is disconnected no real field fight. example I anyone has in its plans to establish a REAL colony let me know ill be pretty interested on that.,rustfactions,cfgp5nq,3,t5_2zzxj

From your original message you state that the JL member killed was apparently hostile  he was not. Knocking on doors is not hostile especially the door of your neighbor. The incident where you were shot yesterday was indeed during an airdrop within our territory and we were taking gunshots from you or your area. We exercised our right to self defense and shot back.

4558843,0,t3_3dh7jb,I believe that attempting to stay on the moral high ground and staying completely neutral is both counterintuitive irresponsible and could also be argued as selfish. Is it morally correct if you stand by while neutral peaceful nations are taken over by warmongers? The only moral high ground to take is to assist in the destruction of these aggressors. Think of this from our perspective. TEO attacks and destroys CA and attacks SS to cause terror. We take up arms and form alliances to become powerful enough to counter the threat. We decide to attack the stronger threat first TEO instead of OCH and are immensely successful. We believe that there will be a peace but BOR attacks er quickly apologizes and holds a summit then turns around and attacks FS WITH the help of TEO who didnt declare war. If that isnt warmongering I dont know what is. Finally OCH breaks their treaty and attacks SKG with TEO but fail. In these times being neutral like the US in the beginnings of WW is definitely not the right thing to do. If you want to be on the moral high ground its obvious that the best path to take is to assist in destroying those who keep invading others purely for territorial conquest.,rustfactions,ct59dt1,1,t5_2zzxj

4849905,0,t3_3ha9co,MFD have at least two people Ive seen them in chat.  House Bolton has had extensive experience with their shenanigans.  When I and a few others met in the Teamspeak and founded House Bolton a few days ago MFD showed up on our doorstep seconds after we had fashioned our first code locks.  They proceeded to tell us that they claimed the whole map and were at war with everyone and then engaged in a series of trolling griefing and manipulative behaviors.  They killed our people over and over and tried to incite our members to open doors in exchange for questionable promises.  Later they told faction members that our claim had not been recognized and that MFD had been awarded our claimas new players on the server some of our members didnt know if they were for real.  They nearly made it impossible for our faction to get established and defend our claim.  But we persevered and survived.Whether or not what they do is consistent with the rules they are making the server less enjoyable.  Their focus on trolling newcomers makes the server less reasonable and less new playerfriendly.  People who play on RP servers arent expecting or desirous of the usual trolly Rust experience and MFD bring everyone down to their level.If they show no interest in changing their stripes the server would benefit from banning them.,rustfactions,cu5v70s,4,t5_2zzxj

My brother  my friend even liked the server enough to donate when they were talking about getting a dedicated server.  I dont blame you guys for getting offended of our friend Joseph Smiths Magic Fuckfrogs name but he had nothing in our house nor did he live in our house... he had his own shack deal out away from us and didnt take the RP  server as seriously as we did.  Just hope you guys realize next time someone pisses you off not to just go level the house you think belongs to the person who offends you.

The freikorps did not murder all over Germany.You are completely confusing the armed militant wings of political parties and the freikorps. They are freikorps for a reason they were free from political party affiliation. They were defensive militias and took stands against extremists and bullies.    As the National Socialist Party did gain popularity some freikorps disbanded and joined either the SA or SS but many more remained independent and were punished in the Night of Long Knives.
