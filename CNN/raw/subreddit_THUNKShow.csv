2005750,0,t3_2eqm2l,I love how right out of the gate you designed and built a signature background setpiece for your show. Say no to blank white walls!And this has quickly become my favourite channel of all time. I didnt realize how badly I wanted a video series like this until now.,THUNKShow,ckuw372,1,t5_32825
3268469,0,t1_coym4du,Im so glad to hear you enjoy the show! Ill certainly be watching for comments in the future  this is great stuff!  It seems youre asserting a flavor of if the machines are doing it for us we will forget how to do it ourselves.  First Im probably more of an  instrumentalist than you. I dont have any preference for models built on human intuition vs. models generated by black boxes so long as they accurately predict phenomena  I dont think the principles which govern the universe are inherently mathematical they just happen to be described well by math.  As such Im not apprehensive about using statistical vs. intuitive techniques for determining The Truth. Human intuition gets amazing results on the lowhanging fruit of principles we might expect but in a  time of relativity amp quantum mechanicslike seemingly bonkers laws of nature we need all the help our little monkey brains can get.  Nonhypothesis driven techniques are certainly in their infancy and I have no idea what will happen in the future as their use expands. However given your premise that they are better funded because they get better practical results than human research if that trend continues I have no problem with it.  If we ended up with a black box that accurately predicts how the entire universe will behave would I sacrifice all scientific endeavor? Thats a harder question for me to answer but Id certainly consider it.  Great points! Thank you again!,THUNKShow,cp0tywc,2,t5_32825
