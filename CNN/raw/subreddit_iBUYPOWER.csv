170640,0,t3_1w1qnu,. We will use whatever fans come with the case and CPU cooler. So that usually means you get  fans from the stock on the case. The only way to change the fans on the case is to order the sound reduction packages but its not a good deal if you just want more fans since we will remove some of the fans and replace them. There is no affect on your warranty by adding fans to the case yourself so that option is always available to you. . We use the stock intelamd coolers or liquid cooling. We found that the larger tower coolers tended to have a lot of issues during shipping so we stopped using them. Again though you are free to add your own cooler after the fact. . Right now our  TB drives are Western Digital blue drives but that could change month to month. We use all the major brands depending on pricing and what is available. WD Hitachi Seagate most commonly for desktop Toshiba and Hitachi for laptops. ,iBUYPOWER,cexva68,1,t5_2v1i3

3743263,0,t1_cqiy55n,Ok probably a CZ maybe a CZ. Does the laptop respond any differently if you try powering it on without the battery or with the battery but without the AC adapter plugged in?How comfortable are you with small tools and working around inside electronics? Not sure how much work the shop did but there are a few small things you can do to verify if its actually the motherboard that needs replacing. Replacing the board may end up being prohibitively expensive for you parts alone is in the  range. So lets exhaust the other troubleshooting methods first. ,iBUYPOWER,cqiygd2,1,t5_2v1i3
3880130,0,t3_34vooh,Can you let me know your RMA number?

5358581,0,t1_cvvo2yo,Ok heres the basic instructions. . Get into BIOS hit delete when the PC is starting then use F to go into advanced mode. First thing is to scroll over to tool and select asus overclocking profile. Sometimes the QC guys will save an overclocking profile here. If you find anything assigned here that should be it. select it and F reset check to see if the settings stuck. . If theres no profile set go to the AI Tweaker tab and look for AI Overclock Tuner and set that to XMP. F save and reset and go straight back into BIOS to see if the memory speed has been adjusted appropriately. This will get your memory at the correct speed. . For your CPU overclock assuming the overclocking profile wasnt saved. Let me know what CPU you have and the level of OC service you purchased. ,iBUYPOWER,cvwmavd,1,t5_2v1i3

6039672,0,t3_3y7eac,Well your brother might have his monitor cord plugged into the wrong port. My iBUYPOWER PC came with  video card ports for  monitors and at first I plugged it into the one that didnt have a video card in it so make sure your brother tries that. And as for the windows  thing I also had that issue but once I turned my PC off and on again it worked so if youve already done that I cant help you there.,iBUYPOWER,cybb98t,2,t5_2v1i3

6453000,0,t1_czmosyq,Did you lie the computer on the floor? Possible on carpet? Blocking ventilation? Random shutdowns are most definitely a sure sign of overheating. Are there fans inside the case? Were the unplugged during shipping? Theres so many random things that could be causing this and you seem more interested in pointing a finger than actually determining the issue.EDIT What kind of shut down is it? Does you get a blue screen or the pc just turns off altogether. ,iBUYPOWER,czms5t7,1,t5_2v1i3

7036736,0,t1_d1dyudy,Yes it need to be plugged in and switched on. more on that hereTheres not a lot of risk doing this while the PC is off just dont stab the board with the screwdriver. Even if you bridge the wrong pins nothing will happen the system will just remain off. ,iBUYPOWER,d1dyy5v,1,t5_2v1i3

8186001,0,t3_4remcc,trying to get a clearer picture of the situation so I can give more accurate info. We have something like a weeks worth of assembly backed up somewhere in the parts gathering phases. After the PC is assembled there is no more delay in testing and shipping so that is only another day after assembly is completed. ,iBUYPOWER,d50suh4,2,t5_2v1i3

10186246,0,t1_dbyknkt,They are about to lose another  sale. Ordered my PC on Dec th. Asked the sales rep the same day what the lead time was since I understood things were busy during the holidays. He said  days which seemed like a long time but again I was expecting some delays. Its now  days later my PC hasnt even entered the parts collecting phase they suddenly cant quote me ANY lead time and they only thing they can offer to do for me is to cancel my order ...after Ive already waited almost a month. Im pretty disgusted with the service Ive received from them and will make sure I review their service in as many places possible so that hopefully someone doesnt make the same mistake I did. ,iBUYPOWER,dbyo15i,3,t5_2v1i3

10852058,0,t3_5v4oxb,Depending on your motherboard you should be able to snap that piece back on. Its the latch that holds the graphics card into the pcie slot on the motherboard. Your board should have an unused one lower down for reference on how it should look. If you are unfamiliar with how to remove the graphics card contact our tech support and they can walk you through it.  chance it should just be able to snap back on rather than it being permanently broken. ,iBUYPOWER,ddzb9xn,1,t5_2v1i3
