2923782,0,t1_co09p5k,I checked the video its definitely Giana Sisters.  The music is different and that should be a giveaway.At  the turtles shell cant be kicked like a Koopas.  Theres no flagpole at the end of aboveground levels.  At  the boss at the end of level  isnt Bowser isnt on a bridge and when the player jumps over him to end the level theres no Toad it just goes to world  where the player immediately does two things you cant do in SMB he hits a brick and it turns into a boulder instead of breaking and then he accesses a coin room by falling into a pit.If you played more Commodore than Nintendo back in the day you might not notice these details.  Not just the game but the overall motif of Great Giana Sisters was very close to Super Mario Bros hence the idea to hack the ROM in the first place.  The games were already so similar that Nintendo was able to stop stores from selling Great Giana Sisters.,c64,co0fypn,1,t5_2qin7
2924656,0,t1_co0bz56,Rockn Wrestle huh? Ive never had the chance to check that one out but I have the vague understanding that it had to do with the connection between MTV and WWF back in the s if I remember correctly!Ill definitely check it out! ,c64,co0jjou,1,t5_2qin7

4941302,0,t1_cuhbwnq,Oh thats interesting! Makes sense too. I remember seeing quite a few German guys at the X party in Utrecht so there certainly was  a lot of interaction there. There probably still is. ,c64,cuhe272,1,t5_2qin7

5079292,0,t3_3kjr7k,Have you tried copying the disk images to a real floppy and using them in the ? Ive found many games like to use their own fast loader and will try to upload their own  routines into the .

6843326,0,t1_d0r3sof,Complex Interface Adapter Often if something stops working and its controlled by one or both of the CIAs then swapping them will fix the problem and cause something else to not work. If so then you know one is bad.,c64,d0rzvyv,2,t5_2qin7
7065539,0,t3_4ccbkq,Dont use DefleMask. Tunes made with it use way too much memory and rastertime.I cant speak for the other systems it emulates but this is certainly true for c.,c64,d1h8ope,1,t5_2qin7

7211758,0,t1_d1xw9aj,Kind of sad really.  An old man died.  He was a hoarder and his kids just wanted to get rid of all of it.  A lot of this was purchased from a local school district.  I suspect it was sometime in the s so theyve probably been in there since then.  On top of one of the monitors it says  must take all in permanent marker.,c64,d1xx5lw,2,t5_2qin7

9146020,0,t1_d89peu3,But if you can complete the game in less than  hours then you would perhaps feel like you havent gotten your moneys worth! So you see there is a good reason for forcing you to replay that level  times to learn that hard jump  to give you value for money!,c64,d8bbo3n,1,t5_2qin7
9355630,0,t3_58nq8h,This would involve accepting the input as a string then using VAL to find if there is a numerical element in it.   VAL looks at a string and finds a numerical value.I leave it up to you to work out the ifthens for that but something like this works    input a    let qvalaNow you can test if q is greater than  or less than .  Note that if you enter a string into there the VAL is going to be .  What this means for you is you will have to test the string  if  aBefore you val it.  because otherwise text will simply be evaluated as being equal to .,c64,d91w6fr,2,t5_2qin7
