5151310,0,t3_3ljyn2,Ive been trying to figure this out too. People seem to be mildly upset with bl and I cant seem to see why. Bl was much better than the presequel. I did listen to all of their old podcasts recently and I could see where he could get some flak. He CAN be a bit over the top when he judges something like he wants every showmovie to be more of a hangout showmovie rather than anything else and would emphasize on that REALLY frequently. I dont disagree that seeing characters interact in a personal setting is good but not every single piece of media needs it to be good. p. But not many people have listened to every episode so they wouldnt know this side of him too much. He really is a regular guy who makes amazing videos and wrote a great game so I dont actually see where all the spite for bl comes from. ,HAWP,cv6xc96,4,t5_2slh8
8712899,0,t1_d6unuii,Im not debating removing the pledge your decision. But sponsorship as in advertisment is getting paid to promote something. Ashly Burch was paid for voice work done for the game and the employment ended after that. Now over a year after the games release HAWP released a video together with the developer i assume of the game as a parody about doing voice work.  Again remove your pledge dont remove it its all the same to me. However I would argue that since no money changed hands for the making of this video and there is no mention of how great the game is or that you should buy it a disclaimer is not needed to comply with the FTC guidelines.  edit FTC instead of FCC too many three letter acronyms,HAWP,d6uqzfh,3,t5_2slh8
