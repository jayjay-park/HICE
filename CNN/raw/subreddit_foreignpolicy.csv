Good luck with that.Ok Steve thats fine but this isnt the cold war. America is NOT important because our system of government is . Theres a reason  of governments that become democracies do not adopt the american system its really really flawed. I mean a farmer in Idaho has something like x more representation in the senate than some poor dude in the Bronx. Also the winner takes all system disallows coalitions with minority parties.What this quote suggest that I hate so much is that Americans should somehow be working to spread our form of government and our way of life. What an outdated approach and something that I would  sadly expect from a career diplomat think tank troll or a writer for FoPo. editgodawful grammer,foreignpolicy,d9qnm6d,3,t5_2qmlq

11513429,0,t1_dfygom4,gt But lets be clear about what happens next. We were not under direct attack and our decision to engage in unilateral military action means that we are far more likely to engage in further escalation in the Syrian Civil War.Sorry but both is wrong. The UNSCR   the regulation along which stockpiles of chemical weapons of the AssadRegime should have been destroyed or at least removed from Syria  is crystal clear in regards of what the members of the UN can or cannot do. With other words this was no unilateral military action but something Assad and Putin agreed the USA have the right to do. Its just so that until  April nobody cared to apply the regulation in question. Of course why exactly Trump did so is a different question. ,foreignpolicy,dg11rpt,1,t5_2qmlq

For instance Foreign Affairs is absolutely brilliant with every issue but its not as scholarlyacademic as say the American Journal of Political Science. ,foreignpolicy,dgj37zf,1,t5_2qmlq
