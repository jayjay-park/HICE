150858,0,t3_1vsrzg,gt One of these lines of argument has to do with the status of chemistry and chemists. Ive found during years of correspondence and debate with chemists that they usually regard themselves as scientists whose authority on all chemistryrelated issues is or at least should be final. They regard alchemists homeopaths drug dealers and others whose concern with chemistry is unsupported by formal chemical training as uninstructed laymen who are meddling in technical matters they should leave to the professionally qualified. Since it is impossible to have a genuine debate of fruitful exchange of ideas with someone who regards himself as an expert instucting an amateur I found it necessary to attack chemists prestensions to being scientists and to argue that chemistry not only is not but cannot be a science. That argument is largely confined to an appendix in deference to readers for whom it is a side issue.gt ,badlinguistics,cevm3uu,45,t5_2ul7s

1938165,0,t1_ckmqg0u,And my point was that active can get boring and can lead to a feeling of disconnection as well.And fair enough. I mean when youre writing sentences should almost never be incidentally active or passive. They should be active or passive for a purpose or because thats what best fits with how the writing is shaping itself. When people write bad passive its because theyre using passive for the same purpose as someone would use active for. They might say instead of gt I stand triumphant my enemy cowering at my feet. I imposed my might upon him and victory was mine as it was always meant to be!gt I stand triumphant my enemy cowering at my feet. He got my might imposed upon him by me and victory was mine as it was always meant to be!That sentence really doesnt work in passive. Its meant to show the narrator as triumphant and in control and active is great for that but instead passive just slows it down and turns it into a wordy mouthful. Passive just doesnt fit and it sounds terrible. So you shouldnt be making things passive for the sake of making them passive but at the same time in my example of the terrorist attack it wouldve been hindered if I made it all in active so you really shouldnt be making things active for the sake of making them active.,badlinguistics,ckmqp3g,8,t5_2ul7s

That it doesnt convey emotion information or basically anything that magically happens when people start speaking for instance english instead. Which is simply.. Silly. When I say that danish people speak danish poorly I say that because they dont use the language or its vocabulary to its full potential. Or to use some silly kind of analogy..

Postvocalic  is present in many British dialects and although a few less than  years ago in which its use did die out Im pretty sure its showing no signs of dying out in other dialects as it did in many Northern dialects. At least to no greater degree than dialects are becoming more merged in the British Isles overall. Furthermore postvocalic  was replaced by vowel modulation so its just replacing one sound for a host of other ones potentially you could argue that having a whole host of vowel modulations  gt   gt  and so on is more complex than using a single phoneme although personally I think arguing about the comparative complexity of dialects is stupid. Furthermore British English and American English are same regarding   except some American speakers use the interdental versions whilst more British speakers use the dental versions. There is no loss of phonemes its just two different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme or allophones if you will. To say it died out is just wrong Im not sure if English originally used interdental or dental versions but it doesnt really matter all that happened was a slight change in the pronunciation of the phonemes either way.

All I remember about  hangeul for sure is that it was promulgated by Sejong the Great and that it was not appreciated by the wealthy because it was simple enough for poor people to write. This gave rise to pejorative names as writing you can learn in a morning womens script and childrens script. I also know that hangeul includes the circle shape which is not found in kanjihanzihamza. But aside from that many letters are similar in shape to hanzi radicals. It may not have been derived directly from hanzi but there is definitely a similarity between  and   and   and .

And based on the fact that I know how to pronounce a ton more vocabulary than I know how to read I can occasionally guess the word.  But Id say Im successful maybe  of the time.

Perhaps the person knows the correct form and the mistake is made in a part of the brain that receives the output phonetically and translates that to keystrokes this happens to me occasionally with theirtheretheyre but can we call this a spelling mistake if they are spelling the wrong word correctly?

And while were at it give me the underlying deictic meanings of ALL custom pronouns because up until now I have only really been talking about one of them. Im pretty sure I have once seen someone say their pronoun was por please give me the deictic meaning of plor and tell me how it is just as general as the meaning of he or just as general as a pronoun in a language with nine noun classes and not at all simply synonymous with this one person choosing this person. Tell me how who qualifies as xe is not as arbitrary as who qualifies as John.Again as I have said within smaller speech communites this system may catch on to a degree but unless if there is come clear intuition behind who is a xe and who is a bor Im afraid its not gonna catch on no matter the Zeitgeist.,badlinguistics,ct55a62,1,t5_2ul7s

I simply spell it like that because I find it inconsistent to converse some of ltoegtltaegt in Latin to ltegt but not all. Lets face it the current spelling of Latinate words in English is highly artificial and in a lot of cases revised backwards towards its Latinate roots. You might as well do it consistently if youre going to do that. I mean come on a lot of these words were loaned via french and then later the spelling was latified again you might as well acknowledge its completely artificial and do it properly.Has nothing to do with telling people to not use who as an object though. I dont care if they spell it whom or whoom or hwum. My problem is that it confuses my brain and takes me extra effort to parse a sentence thats all.For your own choice choosing to spell with a degree of consistency and telling people to speak in a certain way so your brain doesnt get confused are surely too completely different things?

4712791,0,t1_ctocc2l,Depends on how you define conjugations. There are different endings for past present and future. It uses an auxiliary verb for perfect and progressive tenses. Its just like English in this regard except that there are no differences for st nd rd person or plurals. There are also only a handful of irregular verbs and even then they follow the same rules amongst themselves.They do use lots of postfixes for other things  but to from and etc  that would be standalone words in English but its no harder to learn them than the prepositions in EnglishThe big challenge is the politeness endings and those again are easy enough to learn but difficult to know when to use even for native speakers. Some endings honor the speaker some the listener some the object being referred to. Because some service workers dont want to offend they have a habit of using the highest forms all the time earning derision for referring to everything with phrases that would translate as most honored. Where is the bathroom? Most honored customer the most honored toilet is down the most honored hall.

4817014,0,t1_cu1mmgv,Unfortunately I dont have hard data on this and dont know of any. Ive long thought its what I would study if I were to do my BA again now.Subjectively my experience suggests these terms form part of a slangspeech styledialect common to young nonwhite Canadians who grew up in the Toronto area particularly inner suburbs. It is not limited to children of Caribbean parents by any means  they probably constitute a large minority but still a minority of the group using the words in question. The dialect occupies roughly the space that AAVE does in the U.S. is basically Canadian by accent though I think theres a specific prosody and references AAVE and South Asian English as well as Caribbean English.To give a real life example a local friend texted me while I was on a recent trip you know me love de Turkish mandems this sort of double plural strikes me as permissible in Toronto but Im not a native speaker. Shes half black raised in the Toronto area but not Caribbean at all and this is characteristic of some of her informal speech. Otherwise most of my other friends who would casually employ these terms are young local South Asian or Persian women who I know from university. A close friend who works at a high school with various large Middle Eastern and South Asian minorities in Parkdale says its basically the informal speech throughout his students.Theres a recent threat on rtoronto about local terms and slang which discussed a lot of these including ones which arent characteristic of my friends speech but do appear in the link ahlie most notably.

Additional info Pedants might argue that the correct intensifying form would be something like me myself but we can look at the example of a language in which this usage was standard Latin where ipse ipsa ipsum are the intensifying pronouns and may be used in any instance where the speaker finds them appropriate. In The Gallic Wars Caesar frequently omits the firstperson pronouns in favor of forms of ipse to refer to himself.

7245487,0,t1_d21i9km,I saw this from the Latin subreddit and generally I agree with you but youre undermining your credibility with this particular feud over the use of the word colloquial. Whatever you may think the word colloquial is used in professional contexts by sociolinguists. Both Ronald Wardhaugh and Allan Bell use the term colloquial in their textbooks to talk about language varieties and particularly in talking about situations characterized by diglossia. From Bellgt Across the Arab world varieties of colloquial Arabic are spoken alongside Classical Arabic. Colloquial Arabic is not itself a single variety but differs greatly from place to place e.g. between Jordan and Morocco. Classical Arabic is the language of the Koran and is constant. Despite the differences among varieties of Colloquial Arabic Colloquial and Classical Arabic stand everywhere in constant relation to each other.Now maybe you think Bell is an idiot for using that language but if the editor of the Journal of Sociolinguistics uses a term maybe you should lighten up about random people on the internet using it. They dont reveal themselves as idiots who dont know what theyre talking about because of their use of one word.The real issue seems to be that people are using language that parallels the way that sociolinguists talk about Classical Arabic and mistakenly thinking that it is similar to the early situation of Latin. On that I agree with you but in the same way that your interlocutors are revealing that they dont know much about the use of Latin youre showing that you lack a basic familiarity with modern practices of sociolinguistics and its making people discount your knowledge about Latin philology which is unfortunate.,badlinguistics,d21rdda,7,t5_2ul7s

8378632,0,t1_d5otub6,Eh I could see it as an advantage for nonnative speakers.  There are loads of instances where standard language usage is taught to advanced learners but native speakers are expected to simply figure it out by codeswitching which usually works but doesnt always.  For English I could imagine a nonnative speaker being better than a native for say distinguishing adverb from adjective use which people would teach to learners and people care about in formal contexts but very few native speakers actually speak the way the standard language is for that case.I know its true in Hebrew where nonnative learners often learn correct rules that native speakers dont really bother with except sometimes in very formal contexts.  In those formal contexts a native speaker wouldve learned the standard rules but a native speaker would be expected to figure them out even though they might not have a good native feel for them theyd probably see standard language as normal and grammatical they just would have trouble with figuring out how to use it themselves.  Though there are cases where the standard language would be extremely unusual and marked.  Here is a joke article about that.Of course the situations where more technically correct standard speech is really required are relatively few and it can be a disadvantage to use standard speech in contexts where more native speech is required.  But I think there is an argument to be made that in some limited contexts a nonnative speaker can have an easier time with using standard language where it differs from the normal vernacular.,badlinguistics,d5ovm3p,6,t5_2ul7s

I feel like its a reasonable first start for measuring sophistication.For the generalization. You are absolutely right that even if we accept the assumption about within a language it doesnt necessarily translate to another language. A literate but taciturn people might not be more sophisticated that a gabby gossipy rhythmnrhyming illiterate people. But without adding this additional cultural consideration I dont see why what applies to an average person shouldnt apply to a group of people since you know average being a statistic about a population and all. You do make a good point about nonindependent factors but I dont see them softening the argument that some languages are more or less sophisticated than others.

10656769,0,t1_dde7qmt,gt One language cant objectively be any more or less efficient than another.Well there are some reasonable measures of language efficiency such as amount of semantic information per second. I dont know how semantic information is quantified but in any case it does end up that languages are basically all just as efficient as each other.,badlinguistics,ddf5wuq,10,t5_2ul7s

11080281,0,t1_denl1hv,I have a PhD and work in academia and once I wrote the sentence Heres some of his jokes in a blog post when I was in my thirties.A friend said that my sentence contained an error and I honestly didnt know what he was talking about at first.Only after thinking about it for several seconds did I realize Oh he must mean that I should say Here are some of his jokes rather than Heres some of his jokes.I was an academic in my thirties and the sentence Heres some of his jokes honestly felt  natural and correct to me. Im now aware that some people find that construction unnatural but not everyone does.To me heres can introduce pretty much anything it can be either singular or plural. Its a bit like John is a gentleman and a scholar or Its windy and raining. I wouldnt say John are a gentleman and a scholar or They are windy and raining.I didnt really think of the is as an essential part of the Heres. I just thought of Heres as something like Introducing or The subject matter is.Probably nobody thinks anything is wrong with The subject is some of his jokes or The topic is some of his jokes.,badlinguistics,denxui6,13,t5_2ul7s

Ikigai kaizen etc are often used as either motivational terms or as the symbol of some dubious ideology like how companies have adopted kaizen to represent their new age corporate philosophy.Words like kawaii and otaku on the other hand are mostly used by Japanobsessed anime fans on the internet. Its still annoying just in a different way.  ,badlinguistics,dfugakk,46,t5_2ul7s
