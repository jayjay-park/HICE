It is a story to help get to the root of the persons real story. Psychoanalysis as a practice isnt really about short term therapy but long term helping you to understand your psychology and self so you can get a grip on your life. Different tools for different mental health goals. Not to mention that psychoanalysis is used a lot for studying cultural texts like books movies etc. Maybe more so than it is as a psychological pratice. I say this noting that psychoanalysis is much more popular in Continental Europe and Latin America than it is in the Anglosphere.There is definitely a period in most little boys lives where they say they want to marry Mommy when they grow up and when they are asked What about Daddy? It seems kind of ok if Daddy would go away. But no one believes that there is actually a moment where the child sees his mothers pussy and goes Hark! Father will castrate me if he knows I desire to copulate with mother!What is important to add to OPs post is that while Freud talks about sexuality in children for him this is before sexuality is graphed onto our genitals so it is more about pleasure and a kind of drive and energy.This is not to defend Freud but kind of to help contextualize it a bit more so you can maybe understand where this is coming from because it does seem like pretty whacky shit if you dont understand the context. But like I said Im not trying to defend Freud so you might still think its fucking retarded haha.,Freud,dgwlny1,1,t5_33nce
