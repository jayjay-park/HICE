5880015,0,t3_3vsr00,Is it confirmed if . will be ported to PC? I have a PS as well but if the game is going to lookrun better Id rather wait for it to be released on PC.,EDF,cxqehvs,1,t5_2sm2c
6554264,0,t3_45er8e,Wow like did they price that correctly?    Terrible news for the community as it is in no way an impulse buy at that price.    Mission pack     Mission pack       Both . ,EDF,czx9iv3,1,t5_2sm2c

8475432,0,t3_4vindh,gtits as if the game thinks the controller and the keyboard are the same device.  It may. Thats part of how the Steam controller can let you use it on games that dont support controllers it binds buttons to keyboard keys instead of the game recognizing the button itself.  Try booting the game up and using the Steam controller immediately to see if it detects it as the keyboard or controller based on whatever control message it gives you,EDF,d60yyax,3,t5_2sm2c

8798539,0,t1_d74u7qu,Dynamo Blade M was like the first level  weapon I ever got. Its worth equipping a pair of them and launching onetwo combos as sniper attacks if theyre your only highdamage ranged weapon.,EDF,d75gq1f,2,t5_2sm2c
8916028,0,t3_4z85uc,The Ranger is fine being lackluster because he can do just about anything. all I ask is for some quality of life stuff.A sprint would be ok if it were designed well. Maybe make it so that he cant reload while sprinting. I feel like he should be able run in any direction and shoot over his shoulder but that might make things too easy.As for grenades if you want one equip one. Yeah theyre awkward as all hell but the strongest grenades put huge dents in swarms and robots. Having a grenade slot is kinda pointless if people dont use grenades now why would they when they can equip a rifle and a launcher?Ah I forgot about the rolling invincibility. Sure why not? Monster Hunter and Dark Souls treat rolls as if you were intangible as long as you arent touching the ground. Same could apply for EDF.,EDF,d7jkqpd,1,t5_2sm2c
9009166,0,t1_d7uqivv,Ive never seen a random use them just doesnt happen no matter how good the benefits are.The levelling idea needs work. I get that you have to exchange loads of armour for a level up but if youre going to have a system like that it has to work for everything in game even with the improved weapon balancing in this Improved EDF thats asking a huge amount. Its better just to add versions of those guns higher up the levelling in place of the guns that nobody uses since theyre bad. Say have the gun youre talking about have something like  variations through the playtime between Normal and Inferno instead of giving us junk that fills up the weapon list but never gets used outside of the original test mission.Thats a simpler solution to it rather than having people farm thousands of armour so they can buff a gun they had in early game. Just have the weapon progression better and include those characteristics in weapons periodically as you play the game.,EDF,d7urefy,1,t5_2sm2c
