That way use something like this and be happy to have your monster easy.Roll is just a platform. You dont need to use it. If you want to share free content or community content than share it for example here at reddit. But if roll want to make money which they need to to keep the server up they better not put everything for free on their own side. In addition to that some creators just want money for what they did and that at least for me is completly fine.And just saying there is free content. Open a game and click on the picture item to get tokens maps and so on search for what you need and...  Look at that there is a part called From the Web which is free.It might not be the best but i did a complete campaign just with that without any problems.It is not that roll is forbidding custom content. And if you want to share it where did you get it? If you uploaded it yourself why not just send that to the person you want to share it too directly?And under Premium Assets are even free ones now.From your example the stores would need to prevent people from selling in their own shop which is just how life is. ,Roll20,d7ej6rz,0,t5_2u0bb
