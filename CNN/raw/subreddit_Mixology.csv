1591968,0,t1_cjf3hlh,Ive just seen this on my facebook news feed about a popup bar in nottingham. It might be worth getting in touch with them to get more info on licensing. ,Mixology,cjfu6q1,2,t5_2rb79
2914004,0,t3_2tg0ei,The best margaritas Ive had have been very traditional. .oz of tequila oz of fresh lime juice and .oz of agave nectar. I discovered them when working at a fine dining mexican spot. Strong sour and sweet at the same time. Only way to go as far as I am concerned. Tequila is my favorite spirit. edit oz,Mixology,cnzbvxs,2,t5_2rb79

3585041,0,t3_30v5a5,Going over your list I think you could shave it down to a barspoon a jigger and a cobbler shaker like this oneA pint glass can easily double as a mixing glass and with a cobbler shaker you dont need a separate strainer. Of course if you want a specialty mixing glass then go for it.OXO has some good stuff if not the flashiest. I have their double sided jigger and their muddler The jigger is nice since it has multiple fill amounts marked on the inside. I havent had a chance to use the muddler yet unfortunately.If youre near a Target I recommend checking them out. Usually the ones near colleges have a good selection of barware near their kitchen supplies.Also pick up a good cocktail book if youre into literary puns I recommend Tequila Mockingbird.,Mixology,cq0x8ho,1,t5_2rb79

3788730,0,t1_cqo55m5,Yes. So is reposada and anejo. The difference is the time its been aged. Silver the least less than two months Reposada aged  months to a year and Anejo aged from  years also extra anejo aged min of  years. Usually the more its aged the smoother it is. ,Mixology,cqo58qg,1,t5_2rb79

4630868,0,t1_cte4us5,gtI noticed he is a bit opinionated. Rightly so? When it comes to mixed drinks I think hes largely justified. Its when he talks linguistics and matters of culture that I think he betrays his ignorance. But he is a nice guy Ive corresponded with him a few times and the work he does is topnotch so hes earned some leeway.gt I am all for rallying the troops handing out pitchforks and torches and setting newly created mob loose on Wikipedia. Cool.gt We could use the rmixology wiki as a prestaging area before youwesomeone makes official edits over on Wikipedia. In general Wikipedia doesnt like that sort of thing as we can use Wiki space to do that which allows for any other editor to get involved and it feels too much like were trying to manipulate Wikipedia from the outside.That said working out some general ideas and strategies I think is fine. Any content we write though should be done in their sandboxes.gt This is probably not a weekend project.Which is why I havent done anything.An example of what I think is pretty good article is the one for the Aviation Its simple accurate captures the history of the drink and significant variations. And it doesnt have any useless crap in it.,Mixology,cteai20,1,t5_2rb79

6871066,0,t3_49sbcp,I just finished Jeffrey Morgenthalers book The Bar Book and immediately recommended it to all the younger bartenders on my staff. He focuses on techniques and methods which will go a long way to helping you make a great cocktail. Its a light read and is well written.When I am training new bartenders I always tell them to follow these steps which is the way that I learned Try as many classics as you canchoose a favourite and get really good at making it. expand out from that cocktail to cocktails that use similar ingredients but are different enough that you can taste the variation.So say you start with a Negroni you could then move on to a Boulevardier then to a Manhattan then to an Old Fashioned. Hope this helps Good luck! ,Mixology,d0v5app,2,t5_2rb79

9669245,0,t1_da4nj1h,Hey so im not sure what Lychee liqeuer you are using or what effect you are looking for but I can say that the drink described looks to be for one person. I would multiply it by however many people you are looking to serve. Since I get the feeling that this is more about the situation this drink will be served rather than the quality of the drink I wouldnt worry to much about exact measurements a little more or a little less ginger beer wont hurt anything. Does this help?,Mixology,da4xqn7,1,t5_2rb79
