349964,0,t1_cffi6y4,Just tried it looks like steeringthrottle locks still dont work outside of RT connection if thats what youre asking.,Kos,cfh1i5h,1,t5_2u4el
424743,0,t1_cffi6y4,Correct.  They work pretty well together now and integrate in a logical manner.  By that I mean control or no control based on connection states.  IE You cant use the immediate mode terminal without a connection or you cant access the Archive volume as KSC if you dont have a connection to KSC.Programs loaded on the local craft volume can continue running even in the loss of signal.  Also anything running when the signal is lost will remain in a queue and try to continue after reacquiring the signal.The only thing I think I still need to get working is the steeringthrottle control basically flight controls when you have no RT connection.  I currently have this disabled because those functions inside RT itself have a bug which can cause your craft to lose parts.  IE it isnt a bug in kOS but in RT.  Cilph is aware of it an hopefully can provide a fix soon.,Kos,cfosfq9,2,t5_2u4el

3006354,0,t1_co9lq44,You are indeed correct. The initial orient vector code was given to me by one of the programmers for the KSPtoMars project and I made some modifications to it to speed it up. I also added another seperate script to handle roll control so I can get the best of both worlds.Cheers!,Kos,co9ludo,2,t5_2u4el
3070829,0,t1_cog108g,Yeah I sortof figured the throttle was set to whatever it was before the script started but as you say that sorta sucks if you forget to zero it before launch. Ill just have to keep that in mind I guess.Thanks for the formulae  not too late at all this script has been on the backburner for a while now I keep getting sidetracked.

3128313,0,t1_col6sht,Very nice dude! You are on your way to becoming a master haha.What do you mean by PID like controller? Since the throttle can be calculated and set I dont think it needs a controller to adjust it. Unless I am not clear on how you will be controlling the throttle... Here is an example code to automatically set the TWR to be less than .      g is the gravitational acceleration on the surface . ms     lock weight to gmass.     lock TWRmax to .     lock TWRmaxthrust to TWRmaxweight.     until                        if maxthrust lt TWRmaxthrust                               lock throttle to .                         if maxthrust gt TWRmaxthrust                lock throttle to weightTWRmaxmaxthrust.                         If you want also you can have your ship follow some sort of TWR profile over time but that can be a bit more complicated. ,Kos,com8xc7,2,t5_2u4el

3664482,0,t1_cq9yszo,Yeah according to some videos I have watched the Saturn V was like one giant safety machine. Everything was like over engineered to the max haha. Now you always hear of ships throttling down to avoid high dynamic pressures but thats because of the path they follow and how the rocket is designed. The Saturn V didnt need to do that its launch profile probably never dipped into dangerous dynamic pressure ranges. I think you are able to do things like that only if you can throttle down otherwise it would be too dangerouscostly to try and maneuver the whole rocket to avoid those high dynamic pressures. ,Kos,cq9z4we,1,t5_2u4el

4206954,0,t1_crx3l91,gt I suppose you could make a vector point from SOI to ANDN by getting the vector crossproduct from ship orbits normal and target orbits normal. Using vang to figure out the anomaly of that position and some fancy math to figure out how long that will take to reach.The math isnt that fancy.Mean anomaly is related to the area swept out by the object in orbit. One of the crucial facts about Keplerian orbits is that the area swept out per unit time is constant so if you know the mean anomaly at any point in the past and the mean anomaly now then you can compute the time until you reach any given future mean anomaly.MtMMMtt,Kos,crzs4q7,1,t5_2u4el
4228698,0,t1_cs25zpm,Although I always agree simpler is better I find it much easier to tune something that is modeled. BUT thats because I think the math speaks louder to me than the logic. This is not the case for everyone so this is a good alternative to those who dont enjoy the math or dont find it necessary The other thing is that typically IRL if you can model something you should. At least its how its done in control theory. You can calculate exactly what the gains need to be with a modeled system giving you  precise control on the reaction to the system. I think its a good skill to pick up if you like this sort of stuff.,Kos,cs290ys,1,t5_2u4el

5113356,0,t1_cv29b7d,That might not be a bad idea  to treat some of the operations like they were slow IO and thus force an interrupt on them.  I dont think that totally fixes it though because even with a normal computers nonIO operations some instructions are slower than others  they dont run in constant time but kOS currently pretends they do.  In the real world you have some instructions that take  cycle some that take  some that take  etc.  In kOS we dont know the weight of an instruction so even when not doing the super slow ones we still have problems as to which fast ones are faster than which other fast ones and the fact that not all instructions with the same name are really the same instruction under the hood.  For example  calling any builtin function is the same instruction OpcodeCall and yet one builtin function might consist of  line of C code while another might consist of  while another consists of  etc.  Dividing those into just fast and slow enough to be IO is still a bit too coarsegrain to work.It is a problem I want to eventually solve though because it would be nice to have lowtech CPUs that are slow and hightech CPUs up the tech tree that are faster i.e. make CONFIGIPU vary per part rather than be global.,Kos,cv2cmr6,2,t5_2u4el

Just in case of peak you need find local maxima.Thats right that normal vector is related to slope in this point and we can find it by taking near points at least  to find it.

6157348,0,t1_cypelp5,Actually part of the problem making it take a while is that we are trying to think of how to solve the problem of sending messages to unloaded vessels and that will require some infrastructure work.  Thats why its not going to be in the next release yet.The basic idea is that we hold a queue of whats been sent to which vessel stored somewhere globally in the game save file so it survives scene changes.  Even though its conceptually part of the vessel we keep it global for saving purposes.  Then when you cause a vessel to be loaded i.e. switch the scene to it if there are messages pending in the global queue for it they get copied to the vessels local queue on loading it.  Thus you do have to switch to a vessel for it to respond to a message but you dont have to switch to it right away as soon as the message arrives.  If you wait longer than the signal delay and then switch to it the old message will have been queued up and be available when you do the switch.  Thus thematically its as if the vessel did get the message and had just enough software running to queue it when it arrived but was in a low power mode and and didnt do anything more to process it until it woke up later.One of the few things that can be read about a vessel thats on rails is how much electric charge it has so it should be possible to detect when the target vessel is so dead it cant even queue the message as described above in the first place.None of this is set in stone.  This is all still pieinthesky stuff as we have bigger problems to tackle first but its on our minds.,Kos,cypiyec,1,t5_2u4el

7072258,0,t3_4cflcg,Personally I use the ships vertical speed for my initial pitch program    set tar to max     shipverticalspeed  .     lock steering to heading  tar.The max function is an optional goodie if you start tracking progradesrfprograde before about  km I cant ever imagine it making a difference.My reasoning is this since your vertical acceleration will go down with pitching maneuvers its going to deviate less between launcher configurations than just raw surface speed. By just reading surface velocity the script will detect you picking up lots of horizontal speed and assume that means it should pitch over even more.The tweak factor would be the divisor a higher value will mean a more careful pitch maneuver.  works fine in k I imagine  to be the sweet spot for RSS.,Kos,d1i054p,2,t5_2u4el
