This could get large over time especially if you have used iPhones over the years.  If youre the kind of person who doesnt delete texts these can take up a lot of space unknowingly.  This is because all of the pictures and video sent in your conversation history are saved on your device.  So delete old texts.  Another big culprit in taking up space though not in other is photo stream.  Your photo stream of your uploaded camera roll saves to your device doubling the amount of space they take. If you still have problems the other could be due to data corruption.  Plug your phone into your computer do a full back up of your device by connecting it to the computer you can do a backup regardless of how much space you have available and restore the software.  From there resync your device.  ,iphone,cfmyp3y,3,t5_2qh2b

I listen to BBC Music live during the day at work through the BBCs iPlayer. They show title of track as they play it and have an icon for Playlister. If I like a track I click Playlister and that gets imported into my spotify playlists. I use universal scrobbler with the auto scrobbler bookmarklet to list all the tracks I hear during the day automatically too. Where spotify comes in as a winner is that I not only have access to all their catalogue and hundreds of my own playlists but I also get radio lists generated from whatever track I want plus their discover list based upon my habits plus all the apps that I can add in including the last fm recommendations based upon my scrobbles Guardian album review lists mood lists tune wiki live lyrics the artist biogs and discogs.I can dock my iphone in my car and on my phone I have certain playlists set to automatically offline download in high bitrate so I dont need a data connection to listen. By hitting Playlister on the BBC player it dumps that track onto my phone to listen to offline.

The worst case scenario is when someone uses their phone after drying it and not cleaning the board leading to shorted out components that are microscopic. They are replaceable but only someone extremely skilled in micro soldering can do that Ive never tried myself. That said I have had customers come in with red water damage indicators and no visible corrosion after using rice only. You may be ok without the intensive care,iphone,citvkqn,1,t5_2qh2b

Does iOS have good Outlook and OneDrive support?Yep.. should be fine. gt Piggybacking on the question above can I easily import my Outlook cloud contacts to iOS?I would discourage you from saving any Contacts locally on the phone itself. You should keep anyall Contacts up in the cloudservice of your choice Outlook iCloud Google Contacts whatever. Manage your Contacts from the Cloud and let it sync down to your device. gt For PC users is the integration with your iPhone good?

Its not as great as doing it from a Mac.. but its workable. gt For developers I can spin up a VM with Mavericks installed. Can I use this to develop apps or does it have to be on Apple hardware?I dont think you necessarily NEED to be on native Apple hardware.. but youd be better off on native Apple hardware. Im not sure how Mavericks or forthcoming Yosemite will behave with things like BluetoothAirDropContinuityetc while its running in a VM.

So if Apple makes the  version as undesirable as possible people who actually care about technology will buy the next model up and the people who have no clue what theyre buying wont be turned off by the price tag of the  model.This is also why there are no SD slots. Not only do these add thickness and more people will be excited by a thin iPhone than one with expandable storage yes its true but also not having an SD slot allows Apple to charge a premium on storage every year.

1917281,0,t1_ckk3q31,Its Non sequitur to you because you are thinking in widgets. The logical flaw is in your outlook.Big data has the ability to change how people do things. Not just what they do things with. Something as simple as maps is a ridiculously huge dataset that provides the where for everything we do.Getting a project like that out to the masses when there was no immediate ROI was a huge thing. Companies are generally too concerned with short term gain to do such things. To busy worrying about the margins on disposable gadgets in a fiscal year.Then you have projects like Googles automated cars. This continues on from the huge project of mapping the world. Cant be done unless your system has a way of knowing how to get from A to B in our huge world. No immediate ROI on this either. Release a fully automated car tomorrow and it will still take decades before mainstream adoption.But theres the Achilles heal. Big data enables lots of things and not all entities are so concerned with making the future. Many are concerned with their own power right now and arent bound to things like market adoption.Entities like the NSA can abuse this data. The same data that may guide an automated car could be subverted to guide a missile. The same data that may tell you where the most frequented coffee spot is can be used to show you where people of interest are likely to gather.Data in itself has no intent. But those with intent can subvert it to the point where it becomes dangerous just to collect the data which undoes the benefits.As for the gadgets that excite you so much. Meh. They get thrown out on a regular basis. As soon as they are released they become a snapshot of the past.,iphone,ckk7wmw,0,t5_2qh2b

2040312,0,t1_ckz60h8,I have no idea mate Im a machinist but have no idea whats inside these things to harden them up. Im assuming they may have some titanium or magnesium chassis internally to give them some strength without sacrificing weight but thats purely a guess. If thats the case then it doesnt mean they will spring back it just means theyll be more resistant in the first place. But plastic casing  alloy chassis  perfect for handling bend tests. Having said that plastic phones fall apart at the seams. Edit To add again what I mean by the plastic case comment is although plastic might be initially aesthetically durable in the long run it will be its own worst enemy. The memory springy nature of plastic wont give the device any give. Any distortion and she will fall apart. An Aluminium phone might bend dent scratch but it will literally mould itself to the treatment. Holding true. Am I making sense or is the beer taking effect?,iphone,ckz636p,3,t5_2qh2b

2196487,0,t3_2k8sfg,Theres still a lag on android apps vs iphone. the transitions arent smooth which adds to that. I use android daily along with iPhone for work and see it all the time. The apps look and feel better. a lot of android apps are stretched out which makes things look ugly imo. Even with my  most big apps have updated to make the sizes look like theyre designed for the screen. A lot of niche apps that I like are ios only as well and ios first. I have never come across needing flash so thats not a concern. Im pretty sure you have to install something to support flash and androids browsers convert flash to mp like iphone. They look better on the outside and come with great warranty.Apple pay is absolutely amazing in the experience and android hasnt nailed that yet. Also touchID makes buying apps and unlocking the phone a breeze  this is unmatched on android.Almost all my friends are on iMessage and I can text them from iMessages on mac pretty easily so i dont need to pull out my phone most of the time that I have my computer near me. Its a ton of small things that keep me on iPhone. But there isnt really a reason to go to android for me as I like iOS and im not missing anything.,iphone,clj109r,5,t5_2qh2b

2208944,0,t3_2kejqq,They both have their strengths however I prefer the default Gmail app. Whenever I use Inbox I feel as if I am using half of what Gmail has to offer. Unless youre heavy in the Google eco you wont be using a lot of its features.Inbox is nice and quick and fast. It feels more like a ToDo list than an email client. That being said my only problem is that its missing features that I need I know that its still in development in its current state its missing things like Filters Download all Attachments and other small things that arent really needed but are nice to have. The things that I like about it is that its quick and looks very nice. Its better if you just use email as a chatting service. Where you email back and forth it lets you write emails and replay to emails very quickly. However if you use it for anything more than that then youll quickly find that it wont really hold up against the default email client.I dont really like the bundling feature its very cool how it works and it works very well too but personally I dont need my emails bundled because I use the default Gmail apps bundling feature and filters pretty heavily. Inbox is also very good at clearing out your emails inbox. If you have a lot of emails you can quickly go through and just all of your old emails are done and pin the ones you want to keep so that you can always refer to them. Marking your emails as done basically just archives them.TL DR Inbox just feels like a striped down version of the Gmail app which can be a good thing or a bad thing. If you like Googles stuff youll like the app.EDIT I dont have any invites if I get some Ill post.,iphone,clklzyj,1,t5_2qh2b

Could that have something to do with it? Im not suggesting that would make it okay but it might possibly explain how this crept by otterboxs QA team.Either way my experience is proof that this is not a global issue and only specific to some people.Also worth mentioning is how any case that holds a cell phone securely will have friction with the screen over time I cant imagine this issue is purely related to the otterbox.,iphone,clnknhc,2,t5_2qh2b

2257013,0,t1_clqjpgz,Hey man Im a major Apple fanboy and I totally agree with you! Compromising structural integrity just to be able to say ohhhh look how thin it is! Is a huge downer from Apple. One of the reasons Ive loved Apple over the years is because I felt they had good taste and could make smart decisions about consumer products and balancing pros and cons to make a completely product. Im typing this on an iPad Air  and my opinion about it is strange. I love it...but I also didnt ask Apple to make the iPad Air even thinner. It seems totally pointless. They made it thinner and in making it thinner put a smaller battery in and Im noticing a definite decrease in battery life over my last iPad Air. Why? Why sacrifice something as important as battery just for the sake of being thin?And my iPad is even thinner than my iPhone  now. Should I worry about it bending too? Im not gonna try. But I also shouldnt have to baby my products. I dont know. I like Apple a lot but it will be interesting to see where they end up in  or even  years. Will they continue their success with hit after hit? Or will they be one of those big companies that ends up slowly changing for the worse and going under?

2369058,0,t1_cm4esvs,Nope.  If you put it in Recovery Mode or DFU and then plug into iTunes they can wipe the phone but they will be asked for the password for the AppleID used on the phone if they try to activate the phone.   They will give you a hint of the AppleID email e.g. arg.com and ask for the password.   This info is store on the Apple servers so trying to activate on a different computer wont help.Another reason I rely on Find My iPhone is that my kids are always misplacing their iPhones in the house.  It will get lost in a couch cushion or left in a jacket pocket.  I can send a ping to their phones so we can audibly locate it.  The ping will sound even if the phone is on mute or the volume is turned down all the way.  Also Find My iPhone will send its last location to your iCloud account just before the battery dies.The celebrity hack thing wasnt due to iCloud being not secure.  The Apple servers didnt get hacked.  Individual accounts got their passwords hacked.  If you got a hold of my banking account password you didnt really hack my banks system.  You just stole my password and got into my account.Keep in mind that some insurances do not replace stolen iPhones.  I know Applecare and Squaretrade does not.  ATampT insurance does but their insurance is very expensive.  I think its .mo.  A claim in the first  months is a  deductible.  It then lowers every six months after that.,iphone,cm4ivid,1,t5_2qh2b

EDIT Theres also all those new APIs that developers have just started using perhaps resulting in lack of full understanding of the API causing crashes on apps that ARE updated...basically theres just nothing that crittercism could possibly have to make this kind of conclusion. All they know is that apps using their SDK crash more frequently than on previous versions...but that doesnt mean those crashes are due to the OS being buggy and in fact with the problem being this severe the first thing Id look at is the Crittercism SDK itself...does it have a bug with iOS that is causing all of these problems?,iphone,cm6cyu2,8,t5_2qh2b

The problem is that every step in this direction increases the difficulty of stoping it and the more intrenched it becomes the more likely violence might result. Look at how close the recent vote was.  votes made the difference in at least some form of change. That said neither party will allow it to be dismantled and it is unlikely to happen any time soon. The biggest most impactful thing you can do is to make others understand. If you can help with that you will do more to stop it than any amount of protest or violence could ever achieve. ,iphone,cm7iqla,2,t5_2qh2b

2406523,0,t3_2n07q8,When iOS  came out I decided to purchase and try Minuum as some of the features looked pretty interesting. I used it for an afternoon and havent used it since. I found it annoying and poorly developed. It constantly tries to insertcorrect words you arent trying to use not suggesting but just inserts them. Also it doesnt like to switch between its features. It constantly stays in that minimized not sure of the term they use but the mode where all the keys are bunched together. I know you can slowly train it for the word corrections but Im not really interested in struggling with an app to just type and send a message.

OmG you just have to see it to like it forever.Ok to begin with the case is a  layer case. the first being a bumper like plastic which only acts as a support for the other layer. when put together the case feels so sturdy and smooth. it almost has the same feeling as the back of a naked iphone. So now you should be wondering whats so good about it? You know that this case is sturdy right? I say this case is that good that it can whitstand . meter drops please add a glass screen   It covers all the ports and even has a port cover for the charging port! ok yes it does protect the stupid camera lens bulk and also screen face downs.All of that and the case is still SliM!! AND the best part of this case is that it offers enough space in the bottom that it adds tiny holes for the speaker so that the sound that normally goes nor up or down goes UP this will add a feeling of a frontfacing speaker like style. and you no longer need to put your hands in a very uncomfortable way anymore! listening to music is even better and sound is improved because of added echo in that small space. because it adds as if a hand is already holding into it! I am really in love with this case!come on its cheap and offers tons of features WHO doesnt want it edit corrected link ,iphone,cn7z216,1,t5_2qh2b

Jakemg is partially right but unfortunately whether or not we can replace it for free depends on the status of your warranty whether or not it was accidental damage. Since its a  I assume youve had it longer than a year which would mean the limited warranty is expired unless you bought AppleCare. Make a Genius Bar appointment at your local Apple Store and theyll be able to a check the status of your warranty b see if the issue is solvable without swapping the phone and c swap the phone if necessary. One more thing to consider is whether youre upgrade eligible.

2912716,0,t1_cnyqnso,I get about  hours from my  with screen on time. As mentioned cell signal strength has a big effect. Also what youre doing with the phone. Games and rd party messaging apps can also have a big impact. Normal usage like web browsing emails texts general app usage ect with good cell coverage youll do fine with the . I tried a  and its not a one handed phone. For me one handed use beats the higher PPI screen and better camera. As a long time iPhone user the iPad like screen rotation also was hard to get used to. The iPhone has different PPT Excel and Word apps now which is better than whats on Windows Phone. WP wont get individual apps until WP  is released later this year. And they are pretty good apps. Much better than the old all in one Office app that iOS used to have and WP is still stuck with. ,iphone,cnz6md8,1,t5_2qh2b

2955522,0,t1_co4102z,It really depends on the way you use your phone. If youre into tweaking and customization torrents and piracy you should stay with android. I dont like standard iOS design and lack of some android stuff like wifiG switchers in Notification Center but since Ice got jailbrake I can add needed options by myself.In my personal experience iOS is quite limited and I wont use iPhone without jailbreak because of all that tweaks. I buy music apps tweaks so its not about piracy its about comfortable usage some customization.For example Ive got activator action which I set for fast connection to my Bluetooth speaker as soon as it connects Ive got a pop up with my music application so I can chose which one I need. Or swipe across the keyboard to move cursor left and right. And I can go on and on. Like most people in rjailbreak. Here is a screenshot. I like it more than default theme.,iphone,co422n7,0,t5_2qh2b

It stays in memory and can be relaunched immediately if needed.

All that looks for is an existing criminal record. If youve never been caught you wont have one despite any thefts you may have committed. Its designed to make you sweat during an interview you blush and that shows the employer youre nervous. I run a business I know this shit. I never actually run background checks it tells me enough about a person if they get nervous when I say it. Might means fuck all. We cant place judgement on her based on what she MIGHT be doing. Is there any proof what so ever that shes been stealing from her employment? No... Without factual evidence its all hearsay.

3827609,0,t3_346rs2,Around  I made a circular pong game. It looked pretty much identical to yours. You stole my game!But actually you didnt. In the same way that these  guys stole your game. You dont hold copyrights over game ideas. You dont hold copyright over generic simplistic styling. Basically you have zero legal recourse against these guys. You are beat and the sooner you accept it the better off you will be.Yes morally its pretty much grey area but this blogpost is the same kind of sob story Ive read hundreds of times on amateur game development forums. I had this idea that was going to make me money so I sent this ideaprototype without NDA to a development firm they said they werent interested and a few months later they published MY game and now they are going to earn millions that were supposed to be for me! Not fair!.But its your own damn fault. In game and in general software development its not who has the best idea its who can execute and market an idea better. And you lost. Instead of publishing your own app and looking for a reputable way to market it you decided to find some crappusher and in good faith sent them your game. But for companies like this there is no moral ground so they dont give a fuck and you lost.But its not fair! you say. I should be protected from clones!Well if you hold this opinion fuck you. One of the only reasons we have iterative game design the building of better games influenced by other games is because there is an exception for IDEAS in patent and copyright law. Its impossible to copyright thought.Because innovative game design would just be dead if it was possible. Imagine what would happen if only ID software could make first person perspective D games? How many RTS games would we have if only Technosoft would be legally be able to make them?Game development would become a litigious minefield like mobile hardware development now is.So it would be in your best interest to just forget this happened find a cool idea or improve on someone elses idea make a game and PUBLISH IT. Dont fall in the not fairi deserve to be compensated trap that thousands of developers before you have fallen. Let this be a lesson to dont act in good faith and have people sign NDAs. ,iphone,cqskvff,8,t5_2qh2b

4067041,0,t3_372im1,So there are a couple things I would recommend. If you go into Settings gt General gt Usage gt Manage Storage the phone will give you an itemized list of what is taking up space on your phone. Its a handy tool when you are looking for ways to free up space. You can delete anything just by tapping on it and selecting the delete option. Secondly if you take a bunch of photos use iCloud Photo Library with the Optimize Phone Storage setting turned on. What this does it uploads All of your photos to iCloud not just the ones in photo stream. The optimize storage option is handy because what it does is after the photos are uploaded to iCloud it downs scales the resolution of the photos that are kept on the phone to minimize the amount of space they occupy. The nice thing is that whenever you want to edit or view a photo in full Res the phone will automatically download the full res copy for you to use. ,iphone,crjvdhj,1,t5_2qh2b

Unfortunately iTunes doesnt tell you when the restore is complete and there will be a time when the iPhone will appear to be functional but really isnt.  iTunes may still be restoring stuff to the iPhone and disconnecting it early will mean that not everything will be restored.  To be safe wait for the top iTunes status window to become blankempty for at least a minute or two.

4390772,0,t3_3bag4r,Do you own a Mac? If so download Coconut Battery Run the program and then plug in your iPhone. See the screenshot at the bottom of that link for reference on how to check you battery. It should let you know max capacity. My iPhone  Plus with around  cycles has  left. My sons iPhone  with  cycles was around  so I replaced his battery using iFixit. Night and day difference. If youre phone is charged to  and Coconut is showing a lower than max capacity you probably need a battery replacement. Id suggest what the other poster said and buy from iFixit.com. Batteries for iPhone with tools typically go for around  and the site has excellent guides. Next step would be to try Reset All Settings. Go to Setting gt General gt Reset gt Reset All Settings. You wont lose any content contacts emails pictures apps songs etc. but itll be similar to resetting to a new phone. Give that a shot for a day or two and see if it helps. Next step if that doesnt work make sure youre using iCloud to backup your phone. Preferably plug in your iPhone to your computer and choose Restore iPhone. We really dont want to restore from a backup but you want it to be reloaded with the current version of iOS. Once its done youll be given two options. Set up as new or Restore from backup. You want to choose Set Up as New. If you used iCloud to backup you photos contacts calendars reminders Safari and notes then you should get all of those items back once you sign back into iCloud. You will however lose messages and youll have to redownload all of your apps. This really should give you a fresh phone without any issues being carried over from a backup. Finally if all of that fails youll want to look at replacing your phone. Its unfortunate but you may have a legitimate hardware issue. tldr  Check your battery health. If that fails try Reset All Settings. If that fails try setting up as a new phone. Finally if that fails replace the phone. ,iphone,cskkqsx,2,t5_2qh2b

4726249,0,t3_3fnpcb,It used to be that phone carriers would subsidize the cost of the phone and then youd pay it back via your monthly phone plan and an ETF if you cancelled before the two years were up. And once the two years were up youd still pay the same amount monthly even though you had also fully paid back the carrier for the phone.Now most carriers have device financing where the price of the device and the price of monthly service is independent. You pay for monthly service and a monthly payment towards the full retail cost of your phone. Once youve paid off the phone all you have to do is pay for service. At least thats how it should work. I cant definitely say whether or not ATampT and Verizon do it that way but they probably do.Anyway having been in this situation myself Next is the better option. You get a discount versus signing another contract and your bill will go down after the phone is paid off. Since Next is an interest free loan basically youre better off paying for the phone in installments instead of in full upfront since you pay the same anyway.,iphone,ctqa8ak,5,t5_2qh2b

By carefully building a brand with a reputation for Superior design Superior quality Superior reliability Superior customer serviceSo. If Apple wants to keep making as much money as possible assuming they do then they need to uphold their brand standards.If keyword if this story fully pans out then that means that Apples flagship product has a  variance in one of its key features battery life.

5522081,0,t3_3qqkwr,Thats a very interesting idea although it would be difficult to have a perfect trigger for that. I make barometer apps for both Android and iPhone for weather forecasting purposes see Sunshine and so I have a lot of experience with the barometer and altitude.I will say that its not as straightforward as it sounds since the pressure drop as an airplane climbs altitude will be very similar to an elevator ride. Youd have to be sure that airplane mode doesnt get triggered when you take an elevator. However other than that I think this is very achievable. Edit I have logged about  airplane flights with barometer readings at minute intervals and there is a very clear pattern steady pressure on the ground linear decrease during altitude gain until about mb for commercial flights then steady pressure in the air and then a linear increase as the plane descends for landing.Edit  I think this is a really fantastic idea and I might make this app if someone hasnt already,iphone,cwhhumq,8,t5_2qh2b

5612218,0,t3_3rytog,Here are some apps that I would buy first thing if for some reason I had toAlien Blue   people like to shit on it these days but its still my favorite most trusted and feature rich reddit client. Lately its been getting updates at a regular rate too. Its free but has a Pro inapp purchase.Camera   lovely camera app. Has its own editing space called Lightroom meaning you can take a bunch of pics and only edit the ones you want for your camera roll. Also pretty good for naughty pics for the same reason. Has manual controls for pretty much everything ISO shutter speed white balance. Gets regular updates and the update notes are witty and funny development team is great.ProCam    this is like Camera on crack. Either get this or the other. Has everything Camera offers and then some. Even video editing. However Camera has everything I need and I prefer its UI and design elements.Enlight   mind bogglingly amazing picture editing app. The UI and user experience are out of this world. When you feel you need to open up Photoshop for something because CameraProCam  doesnt have what you need Enlight more than likely has your back. Perspective correction heal spot tool tilt shift transformable decals brushes and everything youd find in the camera apps only better and easier to use. Heres a quick example of an edit I made with the app  gotta love food pictures.ProTube   amazing Youtube client. Has everything you need and its fast. If youre playing a music video and lock your phone the audio will continue playing in the background so you can even use it as a music player by creating a list and adding music videos to it. My only gripe is with the interface and how it lists videos it looks a bit cluttered and unlike iOS. The functionality is all there however which is what matters most to me.Sleep Cycle   this is a fun and useful app. Analyzes your sleep and tries to wake you up during your lightest sleep phase. I cant exactly say how much its helped me wake up revitalized and full of life I mean lets be real but it definitely has helped me get my sleeping habits into check and its very fun watching the various graphs it provides. I love graphs.Stacks   currency converter app. Useful if you often buy outside your local currency. Has an amazing notification center widget and a Safari extension that lets you automatically convert all prices on a page from one currency to another.Other noteworthy apps Wordbook   fast and precise dictionary with audio pronunciations WikiLinks    awesome Wikipedia client Wolfram Alpha  intelligent computational engine great for engineering students and MoviePro   great video editor maybe a bit unneeded if you have ProCam . As for gamesAltos Adventure   without a doubt the best game Ive played on iOS. It is beautiful and I mean BEAUTIFUL. So much fun too. Its an endless runner type of game which I absolutely adore on mobile devices since theyre easy to pick up and play a few rounds and itll keep you entertained even after youve completed all the objectives and bought all the upgrades. The characters you play with are charming as well. Just an allround top notch game.Super Hexagon   challenging and engaging game with great trippy visuals and music. Incredibly well balanced difficulty curve as you get better and progress through the game. Sometimes I put my headphones on crank up the volume and play this game at some point you kind of zone out and enter a weird meditative state where your fingers are moving on their own albeit with a higher risk of seizures. Lovely game but may not be for everyone. I suggest you try playing The Missile Game D Albino Black Sheep nostalgia trip amirite. If you like that game youll love Super Hexagon.Other noteworthy games Monument Valley   beautiful and engaging experience Doodle Jump   fun and cute Anodia   the brick breaker game you always wanted to play and the Kingdom Rush games  witty entertaining and incredibly difficult if you want them to be.,iphone,cwsqzxy,12,t5_2qh2b

5652512,0,t1_cwxfkng,No Im not arguing for the sake of arguing and Im not going on tangents. Im considering how the underlying technology actually does work and saying that NFC doesnt make sense here. The NFC communication of Apple Pay isnt the part that authenticates anything. You can say you authenticate when you use Touch ID or you could say the transaction is authenticated when the bank verifies that the correct security code is sent. But if youre just sending a payment to another person theres no reason to send them your payment information as you do with a merchant. You just need to choose who the user is and NFC is not a particularly good way of doing that in this scenario. ,iphone,cwxqzjr,1,t5_2qh2b

5831514,0,t1_cxk0raf,I actually love the design. you are right and it definitely doesnt act similar to other phones vibrate modes. But I think its the first to get vibrate mode right. I only put my phone on vibrate when a normal ringtone or text tone would be disruptive. On all my old phones it was still disruptive. You could hear the vibration even in my pocket and especially if left on a table. In situations that call for silence thats not ideal. If I want to hear something I just leave my notification sounds on and lower the volume to the appropriate level for how far away I am from my phone. Works great.,iphone,cxk1dns,1,t5_2qh2b

5843471,0,t1_cxllm7b,Sadly that is enough. I want the best of both worlds and it looks like that doesnt exist. I rely on a lot of smaller quality apps on iOS that dont have android versions.

5844713,0,t3_3v9m9s,I recently bought my first iPhone. Ive been using Android for years but just got tired of it.  I got tired of waiting months to get new versions of android after the carriers decide theyve put enough BS in the rom and its ready for users. I got tired of low quality apps most apps I use work better in iOS and often have more and better features and are updated faster. I got tired of buying a very expensive phone for it to drop value like crazy Android phones are worth nothing after a year. I got tired of googles ADHD with their operating systems they release one trow in a couple of updates and forget about it and move on to the next onelike many of their products making them feel unfinished and buggy at times.  IMO many android users defend Android because they can modify everything and while thats cool I dont justify buying a very expensive device to then have to change everything on it to make it work like it should out of the box. I also got tired of the trillion android phones being made seriously just focus on quality and not quantity! most of these phones arent even amazing and just makes it harder for google to release future OS versions because they have to fight with a trillion different hardware configurations. It may sound like Im a apple fanboy but trust me Im not.  This new iPhone just provides what I want right now in a phone like great battery life camera feel and software. I wont say Ill never go back but for now this works so much better for my needs.,iphone,cxlroin,1,t5_2qh2b

6060512,0,t3_3yjgcc,Okay. Few things right off the bat.I like the design and its fluid.I can see potential.But I rather have functionality over looks.Here is few things that I suggest. Right off the bat i cant seem to find Subreddits under Subscribed Subreddit as well as Default Subreddit. lt Im sure thats an easy fix. Easy switch between frontpage to other subreddits. As of today the set up I see is from the frontpage go back a page enter into a subscribed subreddit page then look for the subreddit page. You can have a drop down list from where the frontpage is and have all the subreddits there so users dont have to go through the hassle of going back and forth.

6120766,0,t3_3zacmv,Dear PaxterBaxterI have not played your game. And honestly for . I wont. Ever. There are a few things that turn me off of a game and one of em is not being able to play it. You are asking me to spend a whole dollar of my money to take another chance at another puzzle game that might let me down like all the others. I NEED a lite version. I need to play  levels.every puzzle game I love has been free in the beginning. Do that. Make the first section free and make us pay . for the rest. Then it seems like a deal. Oh this is good only a buck for the rest of these levels? fantastic!Second again I havent played it please do not use time or star based systems. In a world of multitasking and no time to do it in I want a puzzle game I can play while I watch my favorite tv show or listening to a podcast or while watching Youtube. The last thing I want is to be constantly timed in my effort or graded on my performance. I want solid puzzles that take a string of logic to fix. Do not bar your game behind a system only multimilliondollar companies can succeed with. Give me a solid level and as a human with a brain I will want to figure it out. I will figure it out and let me progress to the next level. Hiding your levels behind time scors energy or stars will only discourage me from playing anymore of your game. This has turned me off of many incredible games. I want to finish them but sudoku turns out to be the best option in the end. No one is twisting my arm in the end.Finally the art style. I get it. A mouse and cheese and a puzzle. Classic. But it looks cheesy mind the pun If you cannot create a cohesive character then go simple. Simple lines and shapes in the end I will only notice shapes as I try to sole the puzzle. Make objects obvious Make the controls intuitive. The less I have to think about what things are and how they work the quicker I can play. The sooner I can easily show my friends how to play. I could test your game for you if you are interested in more commentary but it seems you already have quite the number of responses. Let me know. Finally if you want people to know about your game then MARKET MARKET MARKET. Post it EVERYWHERE. Out of sight out of mind. If I see it everywhere then I am likely to give it a shot.GoodluckGF,iphone,cyld8wo,0,t5_2qh2b

It feels way better in the hand to hold thanks to the egde on the back.Also they have listened to everone ever that has used a smartphone in the last few years and made the phone a little bit thicker so it can have a larger battery. Reports are that the battery life is amazing. Camera seems to be a step up even if the MegaPixel count has been slightly lowered. In fact this is the best Android phone except UI arguably there is right now.More than enough reasons to like the S  Being on an iPhone sub though I can see how it doesnt appeal to you.

The S bootleg became obvious very quickly when i took off the back to remove the battery and noticed there were a bunch of accessible screws back there. If youve worked with the S thats a dead giveaway because unlike most android phones you get inside from the front and not the back.    Are you also in the phone repair game?

If a bunch of detailed things are listed in the change log Apple is going to test all of those new things and potentially come back with problems that need resolving.But if they just put updates and bug fixes then Apple doesnt know what to look for and they are not going to go through the whole process of trying to figure out what changed.If this is true it seems a bit sketchy and alone should be the reason Apple insists on detailed change logs. ,iphone,d54hvnv,0,t5_2qh2b

That should hold you over unil you can take it to someone who can remove the buttons and give them a proper cleaning.  Your home button passes through a hole made of glass over plastic substrate. The hole does not deform. In other words your home button is not pinched from dropping the phone.  If the volume buttons are indeed pinched by a bent frame and not gunked up take it to someone who knows what they are doing. Remove the screen remove the battery remove the button carrier and thoroughly clean it. Check fit. If the buttons still stick use rounded tools to carefully reshape the holes. Check fit. If buttons still stick your button carrier is bent or the buttons themselves are damaged or out of alignment. At this point if the volume buttons are still fucked up bring it to a phone repair shop.

If you cant get the password best bet is to do an iCloud backup so it saves as much data as it can and do a full restore through iTunes and use the iCloud backup.gtI dont remember encrypting the backup when it was madeIf you set backups to encrypt all future backups will be encrypted without having you type in a password.

8370546,0,t3_4u8ngx,S Edge user here. There is a big difference in battery life between the international version which uses Samsungs proprietary Exynos chip and the US version which uses the latest Snapdragon chip. On the S subreddit people with the Exynos chip have posted battery stats that blow the U.S. version away. I have the U.S. version and my battery life is OK but Id never dream of getting more than a day. And sometimes with heavy use I am hitting the charger before the day is over. The good news is it charges much faster than an iPhone if youre using a fast charger. Wireless charging is cool but its slower unless you have a wireless fast charger  and those dont come cheap. Overall no matter how big the battery is in an Android phone you wont get as much out of that battery because of the way the Android system sucks so much juice. Im sure there are a lot of reasons for this but it seems a big reason is that Qualcomms chips are powerhungry.I also find that Samsung phones get laggy pretty quickly. The camera phone and messaging apps always have a bit of a hitch when you go to open them and the fingerprint reader doesnt seem as fast as iPhone. Also OS updates are slow coming. The Nexus P is superior in these respects if you want to go with Android. Pure Android feels faster and updates come immediately just like with Apple.When it comes to performance dont get fooled by specs on Android phones. More RAM bigger battery capacity faster processor none of that seems to matter when you compare the actual performance. iPhones just tend to be smoother snappier and more reliable. This is coming from a guy whos been on Android since leaving my iPhone . Ive used the Nexus  Moto X  LG V LG Optimus S Edge Plus Note  S Edge and Nexus p. I will be buying a s Plus when the price drops later this year. As much as I didnt want to give Apple my money anymore they just make a better damn phone. One big reason Im switching is that Android doesnt have anything that touches imessage. Its integration with SMS its handling of group messaging and its reliability are top notch. If all your friends use iPhones imessage is almost a must have. The photo quality is neck and neck. Maybe the S is just a little better especially in low light. The S Edge screen is the bestlooking screen on any smartphone hands down. However the responsiveness of the touch screen is probably a little worse than the iPhone. TouchWiz the OS skin that Samsung puts over Android sucks but you can ditch that and use your own custom launcher without root. Thats the cool thing about Android. You have a lot more control over your phone generally speaking.Another big reason to choose iPhone is the availability and quality of apps. Apps come to iPhone first and they almost always work better on iPhone. Snapchat is exhibit A.Overall the iPhone is just a smoother more refined experience even if its a bit limiting for those who like to tinker. But Im through tinkering I just want a phone that works.,iphone,d5nv9pn,1,t5_2qh2b

8877265,0,t1_d7eujfl,Ive only used cheaper sets but the range and interference is my problem with them.  I grabbed a new iPod nano because it is one of the few BT enabled small MP players out there but stopped using it almost immediately because even with it in my pocket the audio skipped every couple minutes and it would occasionally lose sync completely.  I got the setup specifically for working out and doing active things hoping getting rid of the wire would be useful but Id rather get a cheap set of wired ear buds that work  of the time than get an expensive set of BT ones that will work most of the time AND may be more susceptible to sweatwear and tear than a cheap set.When Apple changed to the lightening port that was reasonable.  The old connector was dated and they had done a great job of keeping it universal throughout their products.  Hell Android phones are on the cusp of the same dilemma as they move to USB type C.  But BT is not a straight upgrade to the .mm port and not an effective replacement yet.  Maybe Apples proprietary bullshit in the air buds will be smoother and have less drops but it shouldnt be  of the cost of the phone just to find out.  A move like this they should have found a way to include them in the box even if it meant waiting a generation to reduce costs or upping the original cost of the phone.,iphone,d7ex7g5,4,t5_2qh2b

8907478,0,t1_d7ii3qj,Its not the data collection Which by the way Apples is among the best implementation and TOS wise. Its the interface and overall general stability. On the phone side WM effed up my Windows Phone Even the stable previews removed a majority of the software features I used and overall bastardized the UI and Cortana was heavily crippled. On the desktop my devices worked fine with Windows . and were actually enjoyable to use halfbaked UI aside. Windows  came around and I and pretty much a large number of my familys computers started experiencing identical issues and for me its touch functionality was crippled and desktop Cortana was not all that good. I eventually got fed up after numerous driver issues WinSocks failures and the awful usability on my touch PC. And Edge is a joke seriously IE was actually usable and even better with the Edge engine. Then they had to remove the internal setting to use EdgeHTML which stuck around well after the UI option was removedgt Removing a part that at least  of users use and cost less than a fraction of a penny to implement just to replace it with much more expensive technology shows just how little they care about the user experienceYou keep forgetting they give you the adapter for free. Not to mention CDs were cheaper than flash drives. So were floppies cheaper than CDs. And its not like Apple gave away a free CD drive or . floppy reader when they omitted them. At least this time around backwards compatibility is included standard in the box.Newer better technologies are always going to be more costly initially. Its not till they are widely adopted that prices go down. And when one of the largest consumer electronics manufacturers adopt those technologies as the only way of doing things it pushes the market to follow.It might not always play out but it generally makes sense in our current world. If no one adopts new technology that replaces something old as the only way to go then manufacturers will always treat it like an extra or a luxury. Its only when that technology becomes the only way of doing something that it becomes the standard.,iphone,d7ijsq2,1,t5_2qh2b

Was going to go back to the Plus model this year until TMobile and their shitty CSRs made it incredibly difficult to put an order in in a timely fashion. So I went to the TMobile store yesterday and grabbed the last  in stock. I figure Ill use it until the  Plus is back in stock and then decide which I ultimately want. I like the . screen and ability to do more things one handed with the standard size models. The only thing I really miss about the Plus is the battery. But then with the new speakers maybe the Plus would be significantly better for videos. But no no regrets switching to the smaller size phone.

9016447,0,t3_53rhn8,Some of the biggest advantages with the iPhone  regardless of which one you get  is that iOS is so finetuned. It is incredibly fluid and runs very smoothly rarely will you ever have any slowdown or glitchiness. Youll find that apps including those made by third parties are often designed better than they are on Android  they run faster have more features and are updated more frequently. That also rings true for iOS itself  Apple releases software updates to all their devices at once and youll always get it  no need to worry if your carrier doesnt push it to your smartphone etc. Some of the best features on the iPhone include iMessage for which there really isnt an equivalent on Android in addition to great integration with both Apple and Google services you could even say that Googles apps are better on iOS than they are on Android. And if you have any other Apple devices the iPhone syncs with all of them in some great ways that ties everything together. Overall the iPhone experience is a good one if you want a device that just works well. That isnt to say it is perfect  and undoubtedly you will experience a glitch or something at some point down the line  but at the end of the day with your iPhone youll get shit done without much hassle to make it happen.Regarding the S itself I havent held one in hand yet but it is the same size as a S which I have used myself. It is quite large not much larger than your LG G but youll certainly see a difference. It is pocketable unless you wear tight jeans or something and when using it youll usually use two hands. Its great for consuming content  its basically a minitablet in fact it runs many apps as if it was an iPad and movies and videos look and sound great on it. The S also has that excellent camera with the optical zoom feature so if you take photos youll definitely benefit from that.Your best bet is to try it out in person. Head to an Apple Store or a carrier store and pick it up and get a feel for it. Its totally going to be personal preference for you but overall Ive found most people have enjoyed it.,iphone,d7vmxgy,1,t5_2qh2b

9024043,0,t1_d7wfkf3,To expand a bit its shortening the focal length of the shot. Typically with an SLRDSLR this is accomplished by using a lens that has a wider aperture and thus can get down to a lower Fnumber with the same amount of light. I doubt the phone is actually doing this  more likely Im guessing its achieving the effect through digital manipulation. Also not to nitpick but it doesnt get better focus on the actual subject the focus is the same...it just highlights it or makes it pop because the rest of the photo that which is at a different distance is out of focus. ,iphone,d7wjrfh,4,t5_2qh2b

Apple Music I think if youre using it after work leave it open. Since Ive started leaving apps open I have seen no Ill effect from it. I dont have the FB app and Instagram I close because of battery drain but everything else is dependant on background app refresh I think. Again I think its fine to just leave a bunch of apps open in the Background because when you go and open up that app it takes less to start it because it is just suspended.     Id say just try for a week to not close any apps. Might be hard if youre the OCD type that does it right away when you finish with an app but just try. You might not notice much difference. If you dont then it might just be enough to no worry about closing apps all the time.,iphone,d8335cx,1,t5_2qh2b

I have a  Plus thats  years old now and that is still going strong.Also could easily be a cell signal or WiFi issue when you have weak cell signal or WiFi signals the iPhone battery can drain massively quickly.  I notice this when Im in the office as cell signal is  bar at best so keep switching in and out of signal and drains the battery much faster.Ultimately if youre sure the battery is faulty book a Genius Bar appointment at an Apple Store and they can test the battery for you.

Which sucks imo because then it makes the micdictation part of the pebble useless.  No quick replies either.  Oh also sometimes it disconnects. I think it had something to do with it being closed in the background after a While if you not opening the app.  That part was annoying.  To randomly stop getting notifications.

It seems like its a factory defect as the glass was either not made properly so was susceptible to scratches or passed QC even though they werent that great.

9345310,0,t3_58hp0l,Didnt we know this to be true? Even when the initial suckjob reviews came out didnt we understand them to be pure hype? Of course the iPhones outperform the Pixel. The iPhone uses an A Fusion processor that easily bests the SD. Hell the A chip from last year is faster than the SD. The iPhone uses NVMe while Google went with UFS.The Pixel has an extra gig of RAM compared to my  but Android is much less efficient in terms of RAM usage. Google seems to have  made strides in optimizing the OS but can they really compete with nearly a decade of vertical integration experience that Apple has with the iPhone? Not yet. If and when Google starts designing their own SOCs then maybe.I dont think anybody expected the Pixel to keep up with the iPhone this year. I am somewhat impressed with what Google has accomplished with their first attempt and I hope they continue to narrow the performance gap. More competition is always good. In the meantime however this years choice was easy for me. The Pixel is a first generation product and Im not paying a premium price for that.

Left a LG V for photography purposes myself after being an Android user for close to  years from a Blackberry.The user experience is on another level on iOS . This thing is smooth and snappy. It seems like your just thinking of the action and it just happens  E.g oh let me check my Instagram real quick! Hive your finger to press and than BAM! it just opens. Really like magic. I swear. Coming from Android its a different experience and the more I get used to it the more I appreciate the kerning curve.Bottom line is that iPhones do most if not all the smartphone fundamentals close to perfect. Make the switch you wont regret it.

Shes super bad at recognizing words I enunciate clearly when dealing with her and have a light Midwest accent and doesnt seem intuitive to use. Google NowNow on Tap was far better. The default keyboard also sucks and thirdparty keyboard support is just not fully there. When typing you cant touch the middle of a word to place the cursor there. You can use D Touch to move the cursor but its sort of slow getting the right pressure can be tricky at first. The keyboard autocorrects your last word after youve sent it meaning when I want to say Boi as a simple message it ends up as Boo which of course has a totally different meaning. Also getting to punctuation simple stuff like the comma wtf requires another tapswipe to access. Notifications that are received when the device is unlocked usually dont show on the lock screen after you lock the device. It can be the same with notifications that are received when the device is lockedfor whatever reason Ive found them gone when I unlock my phone.Notification icons dont show on the status bar. This is annoying because you cant see if you have any notifications unless you actually swipe down to access them. Also notifications on iOS  are awful. Theyre not grouped at all and its painful and messy. I miss the universal back button. Swipetogoback isnt implemented everywhere and its annoying to have to hit the very top of the screen all the time.Those are probably the biggest issues Ive had. Smaller things are the slowness of the App Store average battery life the inability to use an app when its updating the inability to update over cellular data that one makes me really mad because my home internet is total shit poor controls for cellular connectivity halfassed do not disturb quick toggles are poorly implemented poor battery diagnostics and some other small things. Is it worth it to me? Is it better? Im having a hard time saying yes to both of those. Your mileage may vary however so dont simply take my word for it. ,iphone,da71pc9,2,t5_2qh2b

9954886,0,t3_5i1b7x,The only caveat that youll run into is that you need a SIM card installed to activate anytime you restore the device.  It doesnt need to be an active SIM but I believe does have to be from a compatible carrierif the phone is carrier locked.  The SIM can be removed after the activation is done so can always use the SIM from another device for the less than a minute it is required.  Almost everything will work fine including things like iMessage and GPS but not things like SMS or mobile data that would require cellular service.,iphone,db55aj7,1,t5_2qh2b

Apple has of yet to identify the actual cause. This is not hardware related. Nor is it fixed with a restore. Ive tried both restoring with an iCloud backup as well as setting up as a fresh phone with . and logging back in and manually recrafting my profile. Neither solves the problem. I spent an hour in the Apple Store with their diagnostic apps saying there is nothing wrong with my phones hardware nor software.  The genius convinced me that I had to wipe it clean and start with a new setup on .and that the problem would definitely be fixed. Not only did it not fix my problem but all of my notes were lost in the process which were ostensibly part of my iCloud data.  While my phone didnt die suddenly today it did go from  to  instantaneously and held there until I plugged it in... which immediately brought it back to .

If you have access to his Apple ID and password you can check iCloud.com and click on settings and devices to see if his phone has a backup. If it does you could erase it and restore from that backup. The backup doesnt bring the password back. It might also be possible if you have access to his computer if he had an iTunes backup you can do the same thing with the iTunes backup. Apple can help you remove activation lock which makes the phone usable after erasing it but they cant help you unlock the phone or access the data. ,iphone,dbcl0m2,6,t5_2qh2b

10053072,0,t3_5jp4zd,When a new photo is taken it goes into your phones physical memory. It doesnt go directly into your cloud storage. Hence you might want to try looking at the available storage you have on your phone locally and see if you can clear any apps thats taking too much space.Under the iCloud photo library turn on optimise iPhone storage. Your phone will then automatically upload more photos into your iCloud freeing up space for new photos.Hope this helps. ,iphone,dbhxv2v,1,t5_2qh2b

10225347,0,t3_5me6ne,I used Android since Cupcake and was really adamant about Android being better than iOS up until about the end of life of Kit Kat. At the time iOS just seemed like a poor choice and I never understood why anyone chose it over Android. The lack of control of your own device is what killed me. I still feel the same about early iOS but ever since iOS  there hasnt been the same level of disconnect and difference between Android and iOS. In fact I find it nearly seamless aside from app purchases which I have a healthy library of apps on both platforms to switch between the two these days.The first iPhone I got was the S Plus which I loved and used for several months. I switched back to Android for the Galaxy S and the Note  Which I loved and would probably still have today but the whole battery issue made it impossible to. When the Note  went south my options were the LG V or the iPhone . I wasnt quite ready to head back to iOS just yet so I chose the V. It was fine for a couple of months but I ended up having a lot of issues with the phone that made it so I needed to switch again anyway so I got the iPhone  Plus. So far Im absolutely in love with it. iOS  barring a few annoyances The notification center and not being able to group by app anymore being the biggest complaint is really well put together. So ultimately I switch back and forth when Im bored at this point. Android has taken some weird turns lately and I dont really agree with some of them so I jumped over to the other side to see how they live. So far because of how I use my phone Im happy with the switch. ,iphone,dc33me3,0,t5_2qh2b

10451020,0,t3_5poa4h,I recently switched from a Nexus p to an iPhone . I have no real regrets just a few lingering annoyances. In my case the features make up for the annoyances. I personally like battery life retina display granular but centralized permissions controls Android has only gotten this recently software updates Home is easy to use and wellintegrated iMessage syncing to my iPad with no extra apps needed.Personal dislikes mostly all customization related filedownload management difficulties downloading audio directly from the Web browser on the phone widget implementation is not as good or convenient as Android cant customize Control Center cant turn off text notifications during a phone call. Youre probably already aware of a lot because youve had an iPhone before. Id say that for the average user Android vs iOS doesnt make a huge difference. Very similar feature set at this point in the game. Its up to your personal preference and usage.

Has TouchID security syncs over iCloud and some apps even have a Password button for logins. Of course apps like PayPal or some banking apps will make use of TouchID for obvious security reasons.  A lot of apps tend to use iCloud for storing information but Ive seen less with TouchID. An example would be AirMail an email client or Fantastical  calendar.  Im curious to watch this post for other suggestions though. ,iphone,dduvl3h,3,t5_2qh2b

I was livid and pissed considering it was my first iphone and my wifes iphones had always taken really great photos.   Every one of her iphones was a noticeable upgrade up until she went from the  to the S.  That was the first time we noticed and realized that her previous phone actually had been taking sharper pictures for whatever reason.  The  that I had for a few days took even worse indoor shots than her S.  Compared them side by side same exact lighting same exact subject.  My photos all came out looking like the OPs.

11550972,0,t1_dg568mh,Okay let me interject here because while all the other comments in this post are helpful I will tell you that they are all incorrect. I have seen many many posts regarding this exact same issue in multiple subreddits. So what is it... a corporate email security requirement? Is it a hacker trying to break in to your phone? Is it a new Apple passcode requirement?People throw out this shit every time this gets posted. And guess what? Theyre all wrong. The truth is nobody knows what causes this. If you do a search online or on Reddit youll find this exact same thing all over the Web. No one knows what the deal is with it and Apple as usual does a shitty job at providing documentation so you wont get any answers out of them even if you called them.It happens with or without an email or Exchange account. It happens with or without VPNs or profiles installed. It happens all the time and no one knows why. It may even be a bug in iOS.My guess is some engineer in Cupertino knows what it is but he gets paid  a year and doesnt pay attention to little bugs like this so itll be around forever.So the cause is unknown. The way to fix it is to just change your passcode and then change it back to whatever you want it to be.,iphone,dg5b0sh,6,t5_2qh2b

11684971,0,t3_66q9sm,Is there a certain feature you want the iPhone to have or is it all about the new screen on the S?Before you decide to go with Samsung it might be worth taking a look at some of the longterm reviews for their devices. Heres a longterm review of the S Edge from last year written by Android Police A relevant piece from the article which seems to hold true for everything Samsung releasesgt Performance on the other hand had always been subpar. Out of all of the  flagships Id owned the S edge was easily the least impressive in this regard. It was the slowest to open apps often dropped frames and sometimes became legitimately unusable. Its also worth mentioning that Samsung devices always slow down tremendously while apps are updating in the background. Considering the S edges topnotch Snapdragon  chipset and a morethanadequate GB of RAM this should not have been happening. I was tempted more than once to sell the phone purely because of this issue.,iphone,dgkibtu,1,t5_2qh2b

11702896,0,t1_dgl9z72,Important to keep in mind Apple are making an SoC which only needs to be produced and used in iPhone. Qualcomm need to design and make a CPU which is used in potentially lots of different phones and because theyre only producing the SoC and not the entire phone they need to try to make the SoC itself as profitable as they can.What does this mean? Apple can afford to spend more money on research and development of their CPUs than Qualcomm can. Only Samsung or other manufacturers who design chips for their own devices truly have a fair chance of competing.,iphone,dgmjiwn,0,t5_2qh2b
