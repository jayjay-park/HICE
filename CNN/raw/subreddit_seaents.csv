1058256,0,t3_266xkv,Yeah supply is scarce on this side relatively speaking.  Theres a dispensary in Issaquah on Gilman but they dont deliver and are more expensive than the ones in Seattle.  They even admit that they charge less at their Seattle store because over here they have practically zero competition.,seaents,choktpc,1,t5_2t3nc

2721287,0,t1_cnddogs,Yeah I think that  or more a gram is nuts but Im willing to pay . a gram with a good chunk going to taxes and showing the country that cannabis is a good investment in the community rather than something to be made illegal.And I admittedly havent tried the black  I picked up but so far Monkey Grass Farms seems to know what theyre doing horticulturally if their other products are any indicator. I saw a few growers were supplying Grass Seattle with that strain maybe it was a disappointing and overpriced batch from one of the others.,seaents,cndeczl,1,t5_2t3nc
3096359,0,t1_cogowws,Thank you! I usually just smoke wax now so I think thats why Ive stuck with them. Either that or edibles is all I do,seaents,coixqkc,1,t5_2t3nc
3225954,0,t3_2x2o0v,Yes you can. Pick up a copy of The Stranger weekly newspaper anywhere and check the back pages. Delivery is not actually legal but seems to be tolerated. You can of course visit a legal store too. ,seaents,cowdhkn,2,t5_2t3nc

4752987,0,t3_3fp9ez,I live in SF a few years back amp the extracts scene was just getting off the ground. I dont know how it is these days but in Seattle the COextracted oils are really quite amazing amp worth a try. In particular CO rather than BHO which is powerful but not a clean amp tasty experience.,seaents,cttnqsh,1,t5_2t3nc
