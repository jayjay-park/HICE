11681902,0,t3_66oj2j,I had similar issue OC ing my Ryzen  after failing to OC my ram to . Initially I was able to OC it to .Ghz. What finally worked for me is I did a hard CMOS reset by removing the battery and shorting the jumper. And then I was able to OC at BiOS. Not sure if this will help with R and F bios I was on F. But hopefully this method worth a try for you.,GAAB350,dgk5s7u,2,t5_3jgz5
