707418,0,t3_228va9,You know Im not sure if I like George and Lemon as a final pairing but I like that they hooked up again. Keeps things interesting now that their characters have evolved so much.,hartofdixie,cgkoqgs,4,t5_2tn56
2586471,0,t1_cmw6p3m,Me too but I think were going to be pissed. Maybe it will help the confused people trying to refind the show. Who knows. Me not having a recorder and having to rely on a faulty memory will have to remember to tune in on that day. Hopefully I do. ,hartofdixie,cmw6u4g,2,t5_2tn56

3213504,0,t1_couaawn,Im scared that with everything wrapped up all neat and tidy this season another will just bring them splitting it up and ruining our lovely simple happy ending for everyone.Maybe if they do they can bring it back to the first couple episodesseason when Zoe was like a very odd version of House. We didnt get much more of that where she was actually right about the crazy diagnosis she had found. It just went to be all about the relationships! Ill probably watch anyways though. Whatever they do. ,hartofdixie,cov2x25,3,t5_2tn56

11440821,0,t3_5tcktc,Nothing wrong with Joel. He was actually a nice guy. Zoe may have needed to learn that  a nice New Yorker wasnt what she really wanted. That being said. I used to think that Season  should have been spent exploring a ZoeGeorge relationship. But in the end Zoe and Wade got to be the only characters that didnt sleep with any other main characters.  Still kind of wanted to see ZoeGeorge get a shot though. ,hartofdixie,dfst1ld,1,t5_2tn56
