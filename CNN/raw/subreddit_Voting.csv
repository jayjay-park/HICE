Depending on your state this information is available to outside parties for contacting potential voters to get out the vote.  If you wish to remove your contact information from the data files that you send out you will need to contact your countys registrar search county name elections office and ask about removing that information from their database.  It would be hard to prove that they pulled the information from your voter registration card directly and not partnered with an outside organization to legally obtain your information.  What you can do is talk to the Elections Office staff and explain your suspicions to them so that they can potentially investigate the issue.  They may not wish to take it up right now because of the upcoming election but if you keep asking about it they should do their best to provide you some answers.Source I work for a county elections office in California.,Voting,clmxb76,2,t5_2qlfg

There are many improvements I would make to this if I were to try to take the time to finish this. But its a hobby... This will basically produce a csv with  cases for six parties with pseudorealistic vote proportions. You can drop it into excel or any other program to fiddle with various thresholds and other decision rules. ,Voting,dgx849s,1,t5_2qlfg
