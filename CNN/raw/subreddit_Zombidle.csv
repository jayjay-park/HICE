10264195,0,t1_dc754wq,Theyre not going to solve that.  With any progressive game like this whether it be idle clicker tower defense role playing or whatever the progression is always exponentially increased and always increases at a rate greater than the income of currency skulls coins xp.  That is what gives the challenge and keeps progression from being too easy.People say the game is broken and that the developers just keep throwing in haphazard fixes so that you end up slowly grinding up to a ceiling and then suddenly you can shoot forward a bunch of levels before grinding again.I dont see it that way.  Take any role playing game for instance.  You start off fighting slimes and you go from level  to  in an hour.  Then level  takes  minutes level  takes .  The solution?  Go fight a scorpion and suddenly youre shooting up another  levels in an hour until you start to grind.  So you start fighting ghosts.  Its the same thing with this game.  Each update they do is unlocking the next area in the RPG and letting you run levels for a while before you slow down again.,Zombidle,dc7i3i4,1,t5_3agp2
