Ive watched it so much I start giggling way before the funny lines are actually said.My favorite serious episode is the much forgotten Anne. I love it because Buffy tries so hard not to be the Slayer but she finally gives in to the fact that its her destiny to help people. I also like it because she is completely on her own without any interference or help from the others. She is so bad ass. Its one of the best fight scenes second only to the one with Caleb when she retrieves the Scythe where she is again completely alone and completely bad ass. ,buffy,ceub3i5,3,t5_2sd68

444284,0,t1_cfqr49z,I dont know. I feel like I could make the same argument in relation to Buffy and Spike. All passion and lust like a young relationship. Without the reality of personality clashing that comes after the honeymoon phase. An ignorant kind of love. One that doesnt work in reality. The kind that burns out. Whereas given Buffy and Angels personalities I could actually imagine them growing old together and enduring a real life kind of love of appreciation and sharing. But then I remember theyre both vampires and maybe if they both really love her Itd be better to just let her find someone else and be happy.Edit Wait. Was that the point? Was the BuffySpike relationship supposed to represent the trope of a teenage girl falling for the bad boy who is no good for her? Then turning it into a twist where the bad guy turned into a good guy. I guess I just never contextualized it story writing wise being  at the time. I dont think that changes my point though. ,buffy,cfqtck9,0,t5_2sd68

Theyve faced angels demons Lucifer himself and all kinds of other nasties. Could be a good fight. Both are deus ex machina heavy shows though. I see it as an even fight altogether.

1130980,0,t3_272fyd,I think she was right in this instance and if anything wrong about Willow. Of course at the end of season  she was ready to kill Willow so while Willow definitely got special leeway for a time I dont think it was inexcusable as you say. And as far as Spike is concerned it wouldve been wrong according to her own standards to kill Spike when he wasnt even in control of his own actions. But you are right that it does seem that Spike and Willow get treated differently than Anya and maybe that shows that Buffy is fallible but I think all leaders are. Thats certainly not inexcusable. And I think that most leaders probably wouldve landed the same way in terms of all three if they shared Buffys feelings and experiences. The Watchers Council certainly would have come to different conclusions but from what we have seen of them they are certainly no better or more just than Buffy and gang. ,buffy,chwufen,10,t5_2sd68

1493703,0,t3_2bavuf,I dont have time to make a full post but I personally didnt really care for him. When he was on the show I just felt meh towards him. When he left I was glad. Does it not bug anyone the way that his and Willows relationship was? Its been a while since I watched the first three seasons and Ive never rewatched the third so excuse me if Im wrong about anything but it seemed like Oz made pretty much all of the big decisions when it came to their relationship. He chose when they first kissed he felt she was still in love with Xander when they started dating when they broke up when they got back together when they had sex for the first time and then when they broke up the second time it was totally him saying they couldnt work things out and that he needed to leave. No room for Willow to add her two cents. It was like Willow never had a say in anything. He believed he was right about everything and treated Willow like a child through a lot of it. I admit he was right about certain things not being over Xander her cheating but he still never listened to her when it came to the other problems.Dont have time to finish this but maybe when I get back.

To the credit of the show however Buffy was a midseason replacement thrown together at the last minute on a fledgeling network with a next to nothing budget. The fact that it ever made it on TV after the flop movie is nothing short of miraculous so to harp on chintzy special effects doesnt really do anything to promote how unique the show was.

2739571,0,t3_2rdt7q,I thought the ending was okay. Where viewers of the show tend to lose focus of the finale is the constant distraction from the potentials for good or bad. What I found remarkable about the finale is how Buffy stood up not only to The First but also to the Watchers Council and totally changed the paradigm of the slayer lineage. I thought that was totally genius and a powerful statement by Buffy.

2947968,0,t3_2tx1x7,gt but I still felt they never really explained why nobody ever uses guns.Aside from Buffys plot armor the WB probably would have frowned on guns having a larger presence than they did. They were pretty restrictive with what they let Joss do.They were not too happy about Spike being topless in Harsh Light of Day. Joss had to ask for special permission.,buffy,co3754n,1,t5_2sd68
2950679,0,t3_2tx1x7,OK this is an interesting topic.  I would like to comment first that I also was deeply incredulous that Buffy would ever have been in the position of having to get a job in the fast food industry when clearly the Watchers Council should have put her on a salary for doing the most important job in the world.  That was ridiculous.The idea that Buffys dad simply abandoned the family is not as implausible as you suggest since this does happen to a great many families.  Marriages often fail and husbands often leave.  I do like the explanation given by GinaZaneburritos for the general lack of guns being used by vampires.  They prefer to use their teeth.Other than that I have a few of my own.  One that really annoyed me was that Glory had ceremonial clothing for Dawn to wear when she was ritually bled to open the dimensional gateway yet for most of the season Glory did not even know that the Key was in the form of a person.  The fact that there was a particular ceremonial garb for the Key to wear should have been a clue.In season  when Spike is kidnapped by the First he is at one point being tortured by having his head held underwater so he couldnt breathe.  But we have already established that he doesnt breathe.  To drive home the point in the Angel series we see that Angel is held underwater for months and doesnt drown.  Why would a few minutes underwater matter to Spike?  And this is something that the First Evil would have had to know.For that matter as a vampire who does not breathe Spike also should not smoke cigarettes.  If you cant breathe you cant inhale smoke.We see that when Buffy is dead and buried and then brought back to life it is really difficult for her to fight her way out of the coffin and back to the surface.  However vampires are routinely buried in coffins after they are first transformed into vampires and yet they then seem to just sprout out of the ground like tulips in April.  Surely they too would have a hard time as Buffy did unless they were specially buried with no coffin in a shallow grave which does not seem to be the usual practice after all the people who are burying them have no idea that these dead people are going to rise again and even if they did know that they were burying vampirestobe they would generally not want to assist in that process.In the very early episode Teachers Pet when a giant praying mantis wishes to mate with Xander surely a female giant praying mantis would rather mate with a male giant praying mantis and would experience greater fertility if she did.  Biologically it makes no sense.  Just because she is able to disguise herself as a human does not make her a human or endow her with the ability to interbreed with humans I would think admittedly things do get weird on the Hellmouth.,buffy,co3i85h,8,t5_2sd68

3092480,0,t1_cohhhqm,Theres somewhat of a gap between big ho and mildly flirting.  but youre right the more I think of it Buffy probably would be a bit more hurt if she had really understood the AngelSpikeDrusilla dynamic. Buffy has her jealous moments after all. Shes very hurt seeing Angel and Faith together shes jealous of Riley seeing a vampire in season  shes hurt seeing Spike and Anya in season . She doesnt seem jealous here or in Becoming and while part of that is that there were more important things going on can you imagine  I knew he turned into a psycho killer but I didnt think hed cheat on me! its more likely that she just isnt taking it too seriously.The thing about this scene is that its one of the first hints of AngelSpike banter at least when Angel has a soul. Its not something thats fully developed yet. We dont see it at all in School Hard or Surprise ... we do see it a little in Whats My Line? but although Angel is deliberately provoking Spike in that scene theres a suggestion that its solely to prevent Spike from restoring Drusilla. I always took understood it to mean that he knew what to say to hurt Spike ... but I never thought he was pushing his buttons just for the purpose of being cruel.I could be wrong but I think the banter between Spike and Angel really gets going once Spike decidesrealizes hes in love with Buffy. Then the writers have fun fleshing out their relationship. ,buffy,coij8oj,2,t5_2sd68
3135242,0,t3_2ox9zx,Im very late to this thread but I just wanted to say that I think the score of Buffy adds so much to the show and Im so glad that Im not the only one who loves it!The music in the first season is so unremarkable that I barely even feel like Im watching Buffy. Season  however has so many incredible themes  Remembering Jenny Close Your Eyes plus a lot of other music that Ive never seen a name for that I find beautiful and moving. Season  has great music as well especially in The Zeppo and Graduation Day while Rileys theme and the entirety of Hush are masterpieces from season . Youve already mentioned many of the season  highlights and season  is welldone too. And its different but I really love the epic sound of season  Did anyone else find it a little strange that Angel uses some of the same music as Buffy? In particular music from Becoming is used towards the end of ATS season . When I close my eyes I see Buffy and Angel swordfighting but thats not whats going on onscreen. I know Christophe Beck worked on both shows but it was a little distracting.Additionally I think one reason I dont much care about many of the relationships in Angel is because unless I somehow missed it they dont have music associated with them. Passion The Gift Hush Becoming Chosen  I dont even know what these would be without the music. With a few exceptions I dont think Angel has those moments where the music really elevates the emotional intensity of the episode or at least the emotional intensity of a relationship between characters.Anyway yes Buffy has a beautiful score ,buffy,comyqpv,2,t5_2sd68

3161040,0,t1_cop32qm,Oh also I completely agree that Angelus would have been just as dangerous with a chip as without but hes a completely different person from Spike.  Spike had established before even losing his chip that he was more hedonistic and interested in things like fighting fucking and feeding.  He likes violence sex and food.  He doesnt care so much about some big cause and isnt super passionate about inflicting the best or most perfect pain on his victims.  He just likes being content and living in the moment.  Thats why its so easy for him to side with the Scoobies once he has the chip.  Its easily in his best interest and there arent really any moral scruples preventing him from doing so.  Angelus would probably chose to starve over working for the Slayer.  ,buffy,copn1x9,1,t5_2sd68

4611058,0,t3_3e5dvt,Posted this over at rAngel as well here it is for anyone here to look at. I like BtVS better anyway Thematically and philosophically both shows are existentialistabsurdist. They are about equally deep. I would say that AtS tends to explore the more nihilistic undercurrents of existentialism and BtVS the affirming ones you will see this more clearly when you reach Reprise Epiphany Home and Shells and can compare them to the big thematic episodes of Buffy like Lie to Me Amends The Gift ampampamp Chosen. This difference Id say is neither good nor bad since both shows have fascinating things to say. A good deal of people would say that Angel is darker. I dont agree I think BtVS and AtS are both quite dark shows along the path but AtS tends to find darker and more nihilistic solutions to lifes problems while BtVS gets very dark along the journey especially in seasons   ampampamp  but finds more affirming and hopeful solutions. I prefer Buffy in this regard simply because of preference and because of the boardflipping philosophical genius of Chosen.Angel tends to place more focus on its plot than Buffy but the bestplotted seasons of Buffy probably  ampampamp  are just as wellplotted as the bestplotted seasons of Angel  ampampamp . Parts of seasons  ampampamp  of AtS can get extremely plotheavy this can be a good or bad thing depending on your estimation of the antagonistthe themes of the season at hand.Without spoiling anything Angel gets some characters brilliantly right and hangs others completely out to dry. BtVS gives you the choice of reading nearly all the characters as metaphors usually for parts of Buffy like Dru as her id in season  or Giles as her mind throughout the series or as distinct characters this choice is notably lacking in AtS. I found myself missing the extra layers that BtVS has in this regard when rewatching AtS but YMMV.IMO AtS at its peaks seasons  ampampamp  is comparable to BtVS at its peaks   ampampamp  for me but BtVS has more good seasons and episodes.,buffy,ctbt16l,5,t5_2sd68

I had missed most of the first two seasons but I fell head over heels anyway and this show definitely changed my life. I like to call it the show that got it right because its the nearest to perfect as Ive ever seen. ,buffy,cuj6ddu,2,t5_2sd68
4962632,1,t1_cuk2kgz,. Yeah that was actually Osiris or at the very least an aspect of the actual god because based on dialogue he spoke as though it was a personal offense that Willow would demand Tara be brought back to life.. She did harm Glory however based on Glorys powers and the powers of certain other demons and even Illyria from Angel Glory did not seem THAT powerful comparatively. Sure she was fast and strong and had that brainsucky thing but ultimately there was no real intelligence behind any of it. She was a big dumb brute that given adequate preparation BUFFY was capable of handling in a one on one fight. . The Egyptian gods are if not gods then still extremely powerful supernatural entities capable of warping reality and having domain over certain aspects of the real world. Which does essentially make them gods anyways.,buffy,cuk2ubc,0,t5_2sd68
4965802,0,t3_3ius3o,I love Buffy and Spike together and I am firmly in the camp that the almost rape scene was due to a very understandable misunderstanding. When their relationship started beating the crap out of each other was what led to sex. I know Im going to get a lot of hate in my mailbox again. I dont care thats my opinion and Im sticking to it.    But I digress.   Recently I have come to see Spike in Season  as the personification of Buffys inner turmoil. He IS her depression. And we depressed people that is have a lovehate relationship with our depression. Spike is everything that Buffy loathes and something that is really really not good for her but she seeks him out and cant stay away. In Season  that changes and he is the most fully human and the most wellrounded character he will ever be. Until then he is a plot device  a different plot device every season. But in Season  he is the walking talking manifestation of Buffys mental state. ,buffy,cukh7p9,11,t5_2sd68

5170733,0,t3_3lrwyg,Most of your examples arent resurrections. In fact the shows only show  true resurrections... Buffys and Darlas. Joyces was a mindless Zombie the body can move but the brain and soul is gone. They have no freewill and will do whatever the person who invoked them want. This is also the case of the police officers in The Thin Dead Line The Zeppo guys were a different kind of Zombies. They also have animated bodies but still have their own minds and freewill. We also have the Frankensteins Monster type... Using science to bring people back. Used in Some Assembly Required and by the Initiative to create Adam. And Angel was never dead besides being a vampire of course. He was send to a hell dimension. And presumably the PowersThatBe brought him back.Buffys resurrection is different. Buffy wasnt suppose to die at that moment. Buffy gave her life so Dawn wouldnt need to. Basically thats the reason they can bring her back. Same goes to Darla. She wasnt suppose to die at that moment Well... she kinda was but her natural death was interrupted. And when she came back her clock started back from the moment the Master killed her. Same disease same death sentence. This kind of mystical resurrection only works with people who died before their time so they are allowed to come back to serve the rest of their time. Tara in the other hand did had a natural death. That was her time so nothing could be done.The Wolfram amp Hart case is also a little different. When employees die their souls still belongs to the company and they go to a Wolfram amp Hart hell dimension. But since WampH is so powerful they can open portals to allow the souls of their employees to came back to Earth. The souls however are bound to WampH and the seniors partners.,buffy,cv99i4b,2,t5_2sd68

5800279,0,t1_cxg0rqf,The narrative films have been inspired by the conversations with the interviewees. Each interviewee has used the metaphor of vampirism to explore the human condition in different ways. For instance Joss said he was exploring high school as a nightmare for Buffy. With Anne Rice she wrote Interview with the Vampire just after her daughter had died. She created a child character who had the potential to live forever. Annes daughter had died of leukemia which is a blood disease. She said Interview with the Vampire is all about loss and grieving. Kevin Grebioux created Underworld from his experiences with interracial dating so he created two species one of them being vampires who dont get along. Charlaine Harris who wrote the books True Blood is based on said she was exploring discrimination against homosexuality. Tim Burton said that Dark Shadows was all about the dysfunctional family. Each of the narratives will explore one of these metaphors. Dev and I have coproduced and codirected two documentaries. One was called Dream Out Loud and featured interviews with Guillermo del Toro Joseph Gordon Levitt and Rian Johnson. The other was called Take Flight and was about Gary Oldmans creative process. We like to make things that are more like a tapestry rather than strictly talking heads. With the subject matter of A Place Among the Undead it affords the narrative sections to be quite epic.,buffy,cxg2vqj,10,t5_2sd68

I always assumed that the expenses were city and county property taxes which can add up especially in a high cost of living state like CA.

Who the hell would grab someone on the shoulder like that in the middle of combat?!On my last rewatch I noticed that Buffy figures out hes a human a second before Faith stabs him. She yells out Faith no! right before Faith stakes the guy. Related I remember a moment in Dopplegangland. Buffy and Vamp Willow are fighting Willow screams out Buffy no! when Buffy is about midstake. She stops in time and doesnt kill Vamp Willow.Why is Buffy faster at stopping midstake? Willow tells Buffy Nice reflexes and Buffy says something along the lines of I work out. But I cant help wondering if Buffys trust in her friends and loved ones enabled her to listen and stop in time. Faiths I only trust in myself attitude have led to her ignoring Buffys plea to Stop! Whereas Buffy trusts Willow completely so when Willow screams at her to stop she does.Just a thought.Of course It could be that Buffy is just a stronger more superior slayer and does in fact have better reflexes.

It sure makes him look suspicious In universe the best explanation I can come up with is that Wood knew Jonathan was killed by mystical forces and he needed to avoid having the body found and the ensuing panic. However this does not acknowledge the realworld aspects of Jonathans death. he had a family. They would have reported him missing. The grave may have been found There would have been an investigation. or maybe not. Sunnydale is used to weird things happening all the time.   From an outside perspective I think that scene was written and filmed before the writers decided what they were going to do with Principal Wood. Maybe they were still thinking they might use him as an agent of The First and had not yet decided that he was the son of a slayer. Perhaps they were thinking he might fill the role eventually filled by Caleb. ,buffy,d0aomwn,1,t5_2sd68

Buffys actions were the people revolting and casting aside the chains of a broken society. Using a hammer and a sickle the symbols of the Soviet Union to destroy a supernatural force who share similar behavior patterns seems as on the nose as you can get.

7549277,0,t3_4ipk8r,Joss Whedon originally planned to bring Tara back from the dead in an episode where Buffy was granted just one wish. Apparently the episodes story went something like this...Buffy is granted a single wish not sure how this comes about that she must use it withinby a certain time. Throughout the episode she asks her friends what the wish should be. At the end Willow asks her what her wish was and Buffy says there were these shoes I really wanted but couldnt afford so I just wished for them. Willow is shocked that Buffy wasted her wish on shoes and starts snapping when Buffy stops her and says of course I didnt. Willow looks confused before Buffy nods at the doorway. Willow turns around to see Tara stood there. End of episode.Ultimately they decided against this because they had already brought a number of characters back from the dead across BuffyAngel Buffy Angel Darla and later Spike and didnt want fans to start feeling that people can just be plucked back from the dead whenever necessary.,buffy,d30bem8,40,t5_2sd68

I actually think its when Riley and Xander are talking that they bring up Buffy going out there to settle the Faith businessto which Xander gives Riley the more complicated details. Overall both crossing arcs are made in a way to effectively cut ties for the viewers. Joss really wanted Angel to grow into itself have its own world. Which they managed to do quite well.People who were watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer on tv at the time were also most likely watching Angel the series as well. So you would see the promos for Angel showing Buffy making an appearance and you kinda put it together yourself.

And none of these were chosen for their hotness theyre actors theyre usually hot by default. Hemsworth was chosen because he can portray the mysterious edge but add that goofywhileattempting mysterious element which is what made Angel a great character. If he remained that mysterious broody character he was in the first season he wouldve been a cartoon. Which is why they made him interesting by turning him evil then run out of stories for him again when they brought him back thus giving him a series and making him a well meaning goofball. Olivia Wilde is chosen not because shes hot but because I feel she could encapsulate the tragic but quirky madness of dru. I said Spike was uncastable without James but I still tried unlike you. You know for fun. Olivia Cooke plays optimistic shyness better than anyone and is hardly classically hot. I agree that the characters were made by their actors and are irreplacable.

The episode doesnt accomplish anything it doesnt move the major plot arch along or any character archs and so doesnt really add anything to the season. I also dont know about anyone else but it makes me feel super awkward when I watch it because the sex scene is so drawn out and intimate. Buffy and Angel was sweet and very short. Buffy and Spike were funny and also short. Buffy and Riley... long and drawn out. I think people dont find Riley sexy in the traditional sense.

Just think about the comedy in the season Beer Bad Pangs Something Blue a favorite A New Man and Superstar. I agree that the stakes arent quite the same as the previous seasons. The Big Bad isnt nearly as compelling as Angelus or the Mayor. But you get episodes like Hush a top  episode for everyone The Yoko Factor and of course Restless.

8106730,0,t3_4q9ey8,gtWould Angelus then be released in the vampire body? This is unlikely based on what we know from the season five episode where a necromancer was attempting to remove Angel from his body and put Spike in his place. There is no hint that there are multiple beings inhabiting Angels body.  The plot mess of season four is really the only point in AtS that suggests they are separate and even in the episodes that seem to suggest this there are points where they also suggest the opposite.     Buffy season seven that was on at the same time as Angel season four suffers from similar canon inconsistencies. These inconsistencies about Angel being a separate being from Angelus were not present in Angel season five.The overwhelming evidence in the show and interviews is that Angelus is not an actual separate being but more a state of mind.gtDavid Greenwalt Im very happy with the show though. I think highly of the actress episode Eternity and that feels like a particularly LA type show I want to be eternal so I can be young and beautiful so I can continue to be famous forever and Angel shoving a bunch of blood down her throat. It just felt like great images that were really Angel images and Angel specific.gtInterviewer DAVID BOREANAZ SWITCHING GEARS LIKE THAT AND BECOMING ANGELUS AGAIN  ITS JUST WONDERFUL TO WATCH.gtDavid Greenwalt And having so damned much fun at it. I really felt he was Travoltaesque in his attitude of Im just having a good old time.gtAnd what has made ANGEL a great experience for the writer are the themes that the show  and the character of Angel himself  try to explore. What I like about the whole idea of ANGEL is the concept of redemption Minear offers. And this idea of recovery as well. You look at the show on its face and wonder how anyone can relate to it. Its sort of about twentysomethings but the lead character is  and change. The truth is heres a guy whos choosing to be good. Hes got stuff in his past that hes got to make up for. I keep saying this but one of my favorite experiences was writing the episode where he eats his family. To me thats so interesting. You dont see that on television every day. The lead character has not only got a past but hes got a huge past and its horrible. So the darkness appealed to me.gtSeason  Comic SpoilersgtLink Contains Comic SpoilersgtSee the way vampires work in the Whedonverse is this when a vampire sires a human they die  their soul leaves their body  and is replaced by part of the essence of a demon from a Hell dimension.

People often point out her ambition and need for control but deep now Willow deepest motivation for everything she did was her self loathing her speeches in Two to go and Doppelgngland!. Shes in constant need for validation she wants to feel useful and loved. Look how crushed she was when Buffy starts to neglect her for Faith in s or for Rileys friends in s. Oz loved her when she was still old plain Willow and when she cheated on her with Veruca the sexy mysterious shewerewolf Willow even compares Veruca to Faith her selfconfidence probably went downhill. Its not a surprise that she thought Tara loved her only for her power magic its what made them bond in the first place. Another big problem its her incapacity to deal with emotional pain she always resorts to alcohol something blue magic drugs wrecked vengeance though love villains Wild at heat or in order to feel better and get rid of her sense of guilt she needs to make everything immediately right  the wish with Oz but also tabula rasa and Buffys resurrection.

I know this will get downvoted a lot and I dont care. I could relate to Buffy Willow Faith Dawn Tara Joyce Fred even Harmony and Drusilla at times. Not once could I relate to Cordelia.

8883112,0,t3_51xaqk,Ill try to answer one of them the female Slayers one since Im on my phone.As far as I know I dont think it is ever explicitly stated as to why women are chosen apart from the obvious meta reason Joss Whedons preference for badass women.I think the best inuniverse explanation is likely to be very sexist and I tried to think about it from the Shadow Mens perspective. The Shadow Men chose to imbue Sineya a woman with the demon because she would be easier to control. From their POV after giving this person an amazing power youd want to make sure that the person wouldnt go rogue and she would obey her calling. They were from a very old age so the patriarchy would likely have been prominent then e.g. the belief that the male gender is superior to the female gender.Obviously this is a very outdated perspective and we have seen many times how both Buffy and Faith rebelled successfully against this notion.,buffy,d7fmhed,45,t5_2sd68

Its treated as a joke when it was such a cruel death. There is no follow up to it nothing happens to the group that murdered him. I know they were possessed but still. People are a little too what else is new? with characters dying all the time.

The Dawn scenes were brilliantly scary but too much in a way. Among other things the shows seldom have the female characters except Cordy a nd Faith barefoot but of course Dawn was and with all that broken glass around. And some of what Joyce would say made her sound not like The first but that could be doublespeak. Buffy wont choose you. HMmmmmmmmm....... Hello vampire evil creature of the night no heartbeat. What kind of oath could I possibly . . . Harmony began then when she saw Anya holding out her left hand palm outward fingers spread she ended with Oh.Cordelia burst out You have got to be kidding!Harmony touched the fingertips of her right hand to Anyas left and said.

And I can only conclude its because shes a teenager which is admittedly unfair. But my dislike for her is not about her character its about the developmental stage her character is in. Teenagers are whiny and think the world revolves around them. Everything in their lives is the most important thing in the universe. Its just how it is at that age. I remember this being true for myself. And Micheles acting is brilliant. She perfectly depicts teenagedom.And admittedly Dawn goes through some genuinely heartbreaking things  Joyce an unstable home life for a while even Willow and Taras break up was hard on her. Not to mention feeling like shes in Buffys shadow. But because Im firmly on the bench of not sure if I want kids for myself Dawn can get under my skin.

When the show starts we are told the version the Council tells young slayers. We are told what they believe to be true or what they prefer people think. And as the show progresses we see that things are not that black and white that there are shades of grey inbetween we also see that Council members are very much weary of getting close enough to any vampire to get to know him and see the differences for themselves. Except Giles noone wants to get close to Angel and when they interview Spike its at crossbow point despite the fact that they MUST know about the chip.

And if its just too scarring to go near you can spoil the big twist for yourself by reading a plot summary for the episode Inside Out and then watching through like normal. It was a shitty twist.

10543331,0,t1_dd2ibrf,So you kind of did defend Parkers actions beyond The Harsh Light of Day heregt I dont think Parker is a douche bag or even bad for the most part. Here me out before the rebuttals come in. I think we can agree that just because someone wants to have sex with you and not pursue a relationship doesnt make them a bad persondouche bag. What makes a guy or a girl a not credible douche bag is selling a person clearly interested in a relationship the dream of being in a relationship only as a means to get their guard down to sleep with them. Theres a level of dishonesty thats manipulative and awful. But I dont think Parker is that.gt If you actually pay attention to Parkers actions he is actually not selling Buffy on that very idea of their interactions being more than what they are. He is just a guy who knows how to be sensitive and uses that to get women to be attracted to him. On top of that what did Buffy From Parkers Perspective which is a key thing to keep in mind in this devils advocate defense of him do other than be sexually attractive to warrant Parkers interest? From what we see in their interactions Parker has to do all the work creating the interesting points of conversation. In the review you state that Parker does all the talking sounds like he is having to create the entire conversation which is very tiring to do.gt We all know Buffy as being this badass strong interesting superhero. But does Parker know that? Parker is just a upper classmen attracted to a freshmen girl. This girl doesnt Once again from his perspective really bring much else to the table other than her looks. Parker did all the work to create an intimate romantic attraction Buffy went along for a ride and got some sex out of it. Did Buffy want more? Yes but did she want more because she was promised more or because Parker was that good to her?gt I argue it is because Parker did such a good job of creating the conversation and the moments not because there was an implication or promise of more. When Buffy confronts him about that he is very blunt and very honest not looking to string her along for more. But we often see this from Buffys perspective we know Buffy much like we know what ourselves has to offer if people dig deep enough. But we rarely do a good job of evaluating ourselves to see if we were offering the other person enough from their perspective. To Parker if sex is all you have to offer than thats all he is interested in.And here See the curse with Buffy is that her Slayer life makes it impossible to open herself up to men romantically. She cant share who she really is so she has to create a shallow vernier of a life to share and her alter ego is very uninteresting. It wasnt Parker at fault it was being a Slayer.And here Parker is ethical from his perspective and from Buffys if you remove her emotional point of view from the equation.These initial posts of yours dont strike me as being framed within a critique of Parkers twodimensional character writing they sound to me like a detailed defense of a character you felt was unjustly villified throughout his arc on the show. If Well actuallying Parkers asshole or nonasshole status as a holistic Buffy character wasnt ever your angle perhaps in the future you might frame your criticism more precisely to help folks understand your true point. ,buffy,dd37d1y,1,t5_2sd68

No. He could have killed her several times in her sleep or as spike showed in one of the moments she hesitated to kill him he could have killed her. He chose not to because he wanted to torcher her.

10622780,0,t1_ddbfaj5,Most of it is. Outside of Xanders speech and Buffys sudden tearyeyed response its great. But the dissonance between how they wanted Riley to be seen versus how he actually comes off is a problem and what they chose to do with Buffy chasing the helicopter after everything frustrated me more than almost everything the shows ever done. I didnt rank Into the Woods poorly because I dont like Riley. If they had written the same episode with a different ending I wouldve considered it great. But they have Buffy sticking up for herself against some highly unjustifiable statements made by Riley only to undermine that and have her accept all the blame which she doesnt deserve.Is it higher quality than most of Season ? Yes. But outside the worst of the worst from that season those episodes were campy enjoyable and just fine. ,buffy,ddbnqev,3,t5_2sd68

Spike simply took all that on stride including the no redemption part of having being the worst monsters of their age plus he did a few heroic acts out of love and stupidity even before having a soul while Angel did most of them out of selfishness trying to still make a few brownie points with TPTB so he could be forgiven he actually became a real hero after he forfeited his part on the Sanshu prophecy. ,buffy,df3r2lp,1,t5_2sd68

You dont remind someone who was an alcoholic of all of the awesome things they did when they were drinking. My favorites but had good and bad elements were SpikeDru BuffyAngel and WillowTara.

That final gasp. That look of peace. Part of you is desperate to know whats it like? Where does it lead you? And now you see thats the secret. Not the punch you didnt throw or the kicks you didnt land. She merely wanted it. Every Slayer... has a death wish. Even you. The only reason youve lasted as long as you have is youve got ties to the world. Your mum brat kid sister Scoobies. They all tie you here but youre just puttin off the inevitable.

11435651,0,t3_634r6x,Like someone else has said the show isnt meant to be bingewatched. They have encounters throughout season  and the attraction grows on Buffys side because of how mysterious Angel is. Theres plenty of reasons for her to fall for him throughout season . Angels side of the story is explained in Becoming  she inspired him to join the world again etc. I suppose I might be somewhat biased towards them because after watching Bargaining as my first episodes Becoming was the second episodes that I watched and immediately from that episode it was clear to me just from the Close your eyes scene.  I can see why people ship Buffy and Spike given that their relationship is more realistic but IMO after season  its near impossible for me to ship them together. Sure they have cute moments in S especially in Touched where I can acknowledge that if they hadnt been so unhealthy and abusive towards each other in S then I could definitely get behind it.  But I digress since this isnt really about BA v BS. Honestly they might be an idealised relationship but in my opinion theres no doubting that we didnt see them fall in love throughout Sthe start of S.,buffy,dfs7x7t,7,t5_2sd68
