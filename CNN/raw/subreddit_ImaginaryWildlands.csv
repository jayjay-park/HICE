4386604,0,t1_csjdc0u,Yeah some digital painting tends to. Im sometimes a little irritated by it but I usually try to just see it as a characteristic texture of the medium like you can see in oil paintings. I actually find it refreshing that digital artists are often not imitating physical painting nowadays but rather giving the medium its own style and feel. ,ImaginaryWildlands,csk3ut7,1,t5_2xz44
