2151887,0,t3_2jn9ji,If the wing defender is much closer than the flat defender than you want the wing defender to drop onto him. Now this is good because the wing will not have any angle to make the shot but this means that offensive player on the flat will drive to the opposite post to give the wing player much more water to gain an angle and a better shot or for a cross pass shoot. Since your coach is telling you guys to drop off the wing then I suspect that youre not playing in the level that would usually know what to do on that type of drop. Its a good drop but is super risky if the opponent knows what to do in that situation.,waterpolo,cldcqnl,2,t5_2ru9k

You dont have to bulk order them either but for a specific picture youd have to design yourself or have a company like Truwest design one for you or me! ,waterpolo,coxaegc,1,t5_2ru9k

4529019,0,t3_3d27py,I would say practice making sure your wrists stay straight. Im picking back up the sport and in the heat of the game I tend to roll my wrists to the side of the ball skewing my shot and it doesnt skip even if I wanted it to. It looses power to as you arent following it through correctly,waterpolo,ct1iopv,1,t5_2ru9k

5952599,0,t3_3pdebl,I know this is an old post but I stumbled across it and wanted to share my pre and postswim haircare  I have long thickfine hair. Before Ill put coconut oil a LOT of coconut oil all over my hair  tip to root. Then if Im feeling particularly concerned for my hair Ill shower and get it wet before getting in the pool. I also wear a silicone cap which anecdotally seems to do a good job of keeping pool water out. Afterwards I shampoo and condition with a clarifying shampooconditioner. Stuff specifically for removing chlorine from your hair would probably be better but Im too lazybroke to order it. In order to revitalize your hair now I would go overboard with coconut oil or maybe something even heavier  olive oil or something. The lighter the oil the longer you want to leave it in for before you next shower. Coconut oil you could leave in as long as overnight olive oil I dont know that Id leave in longer than an hour or two. Again this is all anecdotal so take it with a grain of salt. Go ask whoever cuts your hairworks with hair for a living she will be better able to advise you.,waterpolo,cxzwzeq,1,t5_2ru9k
