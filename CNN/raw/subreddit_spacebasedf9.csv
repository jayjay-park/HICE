2246563,0,t3_2kvspr,gt Why not just keep your mouth shut let people stew in their anger and if you like the pile of garbage that was handed to us enjoy it?To be fair if you have the right NOT to keep your mouth shut then so are the white knights. I dont see why you have more right to say something than they do.gt TLDR  DF doesnt need you defending them youre just angering fellow gamers.On the flip side of that youre also angering those fellow gamers who defends the fucked up company that is doublefine. One side is no more in the right than the others.You feel ripped off? Fine then live and learn from it. Never buy anything from the same company again. These so called discussion doesnt add anything of value IMO.You can discuss as much as you want but the company already took your money and theyre never going deliver on their promises. I doubt that will ever change even if posts like this keep popping up. We dont need the same complain iterated over and over.,spacebasedf9,clpe3b5,8,t5_2ysqe
