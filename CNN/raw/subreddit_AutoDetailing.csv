4360,0,t1_ceesgo0,Ill chime in here. I have a  GTI and the GLI is almost identical. They feel incredibly tight responsive and have immediate power behind them when you need it or want it. The GLI is just a little different in that while driving it is more relaxed and smooth when compared to the GTI. Same motors and transmissions though. Almost identical interiors too. Just little differences due to one behind a Golf and one being a Jetta. Very comfortable seating that hugs you like a bucket seat but still feels natural enough to drive it daily without being annoying. Both have Dstyle steering wheels with contoured grips for the hands and thumbs. In the end both are fantastic vehicles that are very fun to drive. I definitely recommend driving both though before you buy one. I really liked the GLI at first but when I drove the GTI I knew it was meant to be. ,AutoDetailing,ceexmjn,2,t5_2sjf8
9928,0,t1_cefjucu,I would go back to about  grit and try sanding over again. You have to remove the previous deeper scratches of the lower grit paper in order for it to work. As you move up the clarity of your headlights should progressively get better that way by the time you hit the last grit of sandpaper all youll need is a polish. Since youre doing this by hand you could always get a bottle of ultimate compound that way you have more correction ability than plastx,AutoDetailing,cefkd8z,1,t5_2sjf8

But i drive my car daily in the springsummerfall so will they come back? Yes if the car isnt cared for properly. The swirls come from washing and drying the car mostly. With correct methods equipment and protection you can reduce the chance of swirls to start coming back. ,AutoDetailing,cerxuko,1,t5_2sjf8

208482,0,t1_cf25kur,If a car has perfect paint I bring it up to my customers for added protection but I think many people believe their car will be impervious to damage. I tell my customers that is helps prevent scratches and makes it easier to wash bird droppings and the sort but its not a forever type coating and still need to be treated with care. I opticoated my car but treat it like the paint is made of soft butter and its a hot day. Ive also put it on our shop van which gets beaten like a step child and it has held up wonderfully. I havent personally seen any reason to not use it. I have not personally used cquartz yet but all of the side by side tests Ive seen havent made me desperate to try it out. I dunno. I need to get some and see for myself.As for my wheels getting back to the washing I do have a separate washing apparatus for my wheels. I have Pagid Reds on my car and while they stop like a boss they are crazy dusty. Its a pain in the backside on my summer wheels which are BBS Style s.

The reason you need to do this is because you dont want an alkaline slurry to get through the carpet and hit your metal floor. After vinegar sits on the salt for a couple minutes it comes off with a wet rag. You can follow up with Folex to remove stains and dirt as well. Sure the car will smell of vinegar for a week but you wont have to worry about a corrosive slurry damaging your car.Take a look at this writeup.Edit I had no idea that there was so much conflicting information out there!,AutoDetailing,ci034oc,1,t5_2sjf8

1778001,0,t3_2ev7rw,My experience and what I have seen is a automatic car wash weather its the gas station type or the dedicated car wash type they will ultimately damage your car.  They are extremely aggressive and I believe they must legally recycle the water which means there will be dirt in the water.  A tip I would suggest is using a leaf blower or one of these Chemical Guys Jet Speed dryers.  This speeds up the drying time big time for me.  With this and a waffle weave drying towel I can dry my car quickly and touch the car as little as possible.  Drying is commonly where damage can be caused because your dragging the same towel over the car in a wiping motion and you may have missed a spot and now are pushing dirt all over.  Another thing I do which I believe speeds up my wash time is I wax my rims when I wax my car.  What this does is speeds up my washes between waxes.  The brake dust still settles on the wheel but comes off very easily.  I dont have to get in every corner of the rim to get the brake dust.  Just a fast wipe down with soap and water usually removes all the dirt.  I think the extra time waxing saves me big time down the road.  Plus your rims pop and have a layer of protection.     ,AutoDetailing,ck39sn4,1,t5_2sjf8

1856790,0,t3_2fuogj,Water spots could be occurring for a few different reasons. Do NOT let the water dry on the paint during a wash. Always keep the car moist until you are ready to begin towel drying. As far as towels go I currently am using a Waffle Weave Microfiber Towel from TheRagCompany Their products are top of the line in my opinion. Try not to work in direct sunlight. This will keep the surface of the car cooler therefore water will not dry off of the car as quickly giving you time to dry it with a cloth.  Do you have hard or soft water? Before I had a water softener installed water spots were going to happen no matter what I did. After the water softener being installed water spots almost never occur as long as I keep the car wet until I am ready to dry it.,AutoDetailing,ckcxsey,1,t5_2sjf8

If I dont have time I will drive home to get the water off then spray  sprays per panel then dry. But you risk dust particles or pollen. If my wax is strong then Ill blow dry it then spray wax. Or else Ill dry with large MF then spray then use my nicer MFs after. ,AutoDetailing,cowr82v,1,t5_2sjf8

4150238,0,t1_crta7pp,DAs make applying waxsealant by hand much easier and faster but theyre not necessary.   I would personally go a different route for the tire shine and the spray wax. Get a gallon of Duragloss Aquawax instead of the Optimum Car wax  its easier to use and cheaper by a significant amount. It lasts a long time.  Ditch the chamois  those will cause damageno matter how minor if you miss a spot while washing. They dont pick up dirt like microfiber. Id just stick with that water magnet from Meguiars for drying. You will want to pick up a lot more towels for the interior  exterior. You can get a nice pack of Kirkland microfibers for the interior at Costco and I personally like the Spectrums from The Rag Company for other stuff.   Id skip the ultimate polish and swirlx for now until youre ready to start polishingcompounding with a DA. Hand applying either of those will not provide any meaningful results for customers if youre trying to do this in a normal amount of time. Hand application is okay for your own car since you can work on it for however long you want but not under time constraints IMO.  Other than that I think youre good to go. You wont need a deodorizer for every car if youre really giving them a good clean either.,AutoDetailing,crtcaq7,2,t5_2sjf8
4156753,0,t1_crtc4rn,Oooooh these kinds of details are always fun to see because you get the most dramatic results removing decades of neglect. Unfortunately theyre also some of the more expensive and intricate details since the patient has been diagnosed with....everything.For some TLC after years of neglect Id do the full nine yards for it Wash clay paint correction polishcompound waxing and maybe some repairs for trouble spots like really bad paint chips. On the inside nearly stripping everything to clean the carpet and nooks and crannies would probably help.If youre new to detailing thats a LOT to take on at once. Do a walk around the car with good ol fashioned pen and paper and take notes on what needs to be done.

Itll be a huge investment to start off especially with the proper tools and products for that caliber of vehicle.

4505228,0,t1_csxv6oy,Clay Bars do strip waxes and sealants.      Nanoskin products are awesome. They were originally made for professional detail shops who need to clay bar  cars a day. A traditional  clay bar can decontaminate roughly  vehicles while a  Nanoskin product can decontaminate roughly  vehicles.       There are a few things to keep in mind if youre considering a Nanoskin spongewash mitttowelpad...        Nanoskin products are much more cost efficient than traditional clay bars.  Dont forget to breakin the Nanoskin tool on the glass first as directed.  Generally speaking Nanoskin products are slightly more aggressive than a traditional clay bar. So if you want to minimize your chances of putting swirl marks into your paint as much as possible use a fine grade poly clay bar instead.  When using a Nanoskin spongewash mitttowelpad use light pressure. Weve found when teaching detailers how to use a Nanoskin tool they tend to throw out proper clay bar technique out the window. You should still work in a small area rinse the Nanoskin tool often use light pressure and use plenty of lubricant.  Ive used all of the Nanoskin products and I prefer the wash mitts and towels because they provide the most feedback. You can feel the gritty contaminants as if your hand is in a plastic bag while using the towel or wash mitt.   Drop a clay bar....throw it out. Drop a Nanoskin product.....rinse it out and carry on. Ill make a separate post on Nanoskin products in the near future.  ,AutoDetailing,csyj9a8,5,t5_2sjf8

4596527,0,t3_3dm9fz,Ive been cleaning my car since May  exclusively with Chemical Guys EcoSmart and it works really well and is pretty easy to use. The benefit it has over ONR is that you dont have to dry the car and it doesnt use any water. Spray on wipe off  thats it. I get my car done in  mins. I always wipe in  direction and use a clean side of a microfiber for each wipe. No swirls or scratches. Heavily soiled car  just apply more EcoSmart and check your towel more frequently.The spray bottle that came with EcoSmart gave out pretty quickly so I got a new one from Home Depot that works pretty well. Nothing fancy. Just a generic spray bottle.I dont use EcoSmart to clean wheels though. This portion will require water but less water than you would use with an ONR wash.  Here I use Sonax wheel cleaner a Mothers wheel brush and a  gallon pressurized sprayer you can find this at home depot  typically its used for spraying fertiziler or other cleaning agents filled with water. Spray down the wheels with Sonax. Let sit for  mins clean with wheel brush. Pressurize sprayer and spray wheels clean beginning at  oclock position. Wipe dry with micro fiber towels. I use about  gals of water for all four wheels. ,AutoDetailing,ct9zerv,1,t5_2sjf8

He put out this thorough video not too long ago covering a lot of wash basics. He has a pretty large back catalog of useful videos so check em out. So youre delving into this community which will tell you to throw out the yellow sponge and pick up highquality microfiber washmitts and towels. Check out TheRagCompany for those products. As you go through the wiki you will find products that are commonly used and well regarded.Also orbital polishers or buffers are pretty dangerous to paint if theyre in the wrong hands. The safer more common tool in this community as youll see in the wiki is the Dual Action DA Polisher. Read upwatch videos on DA polisher use. Larry has some good ones. Meguiars is pretty standard stuff cant really go wrong with it in my experience. I use their Gold Class soap their M and M as well as their washmitt.

5428508,0,t3_3pbhju,You mentioned elsewhere that the headlights do not feel rough. That is usually not a sigh of clearcoat failure.I would suggest getting a small bottle of PlastX and trying a small test area with a microfiber and see if it clears up. Because if the yellowing and the roughness is on the inside of the headlight there is little you can do about it.If it does clear up then I would recommend getting the Meguiars headlight restoration kit. I have used both it and the M kit and I find the Meguiars one to give better results.Effectively the kit from M and Meguiars are virtually identical as M owns Megs they just go about it in different ways. M uses three stages of sanding and one polishing. Where as Meguiars uses two stages of sanding one polishing stage and a refining sealant stage.The biggest difference in the kits is in the polishing pad. M uses an orange foam where as Meguiars uses a Microfiber fluffy pad. I find that the microfiber is much easier to control and allows for much better access to smaller areas and doesnt get bound up on those stupid little headlight tits that some cars have on the lens.The M compound is pretty much just PlastX and the results are virtually the same. However the refining glaze in the Meguiars kit offers much better water repelling has a UV protectant added and seems to do a better job at keeping the headlights from rehazing.The last vehicle I did this one was a buddies Frontier in Phoenix that had severe oxidization. That was nearly  months ago and his headlights still look like new. And his truck has been parked outside the entire time.Now this isnt to say the M kit is bad...it isnt. But I just feel that the Meguiars kit is a much better overall package and is easier to use.,AutoDetailing,cw5jq30,2,t5_2sjf8
5433003,0,t1_cw642a5,Yeah ive actually been contemplating the products listed on the product guide. In paticular  ONR rinseless wash and wax we dont have access to a hose here so i have to pop  cents into a tap to get  buckets worth of water then use a smaller pail to dish out the water onto the car. This obviously gets a little bit tiring. But Im debating if using ONR would save that much time over my current albeit laborious method of washing without a house. As for waxes Ive been intrigued by Colinite  since its almost universally recommended. For interior cleaning Ive been thinking about Sonax Leather foam cleaner and conditioner rolled into one and Sonax matte cleaner for dashboard and interior plastics. For MF cloths Im gonna try Rag Company once I can confirm that they can ship to Singapore owise will have to settle on amazon products.

Offering winter prep packages with paint protection with coating or sealants are a big hit before it gets nasty outside. Also think about offering services to inlcude undercarriage cleaning and salt removal from carpets.

6375114,1,t1_cze9er8,Personal preference I guess. But pressure washers can easily be misused with too much psi or just using it too close to your paint. Even if youre not really misusing it pressurized water can take a small issue like a minor chip or scratch and turn it into a bigger one. Or for instance when the pressure washer unloader is activated when you first squeeze the trigger. That initial blast obviously exceeds whatever the pressure washer is rated as. So even if youre using something low not sure what qualifies as low maybe  psi? you can still end up with some problems. Personally I would say go for the softer option if you have a choice. Even heavy dirt and grime can be softenedloosened up by wetting it with a garden hose just takes a little more time.,AutoDetailing,czea45e,1,t5_2sjf8

6682194,0,t3_470zss,As mentioned previously any type of polishing will remove paint clear coat from the surface.  Wax will add a sacrificial barrier for a short time maybe mo MAX with a super durable synthetic wax.  The only way to actually add a more long term durable barrier and a layer of measurable thickness other than PPF  Paint Protection Film is to place a nano coating on the car after polishing to the desired level. I would recommend looking for a ceramic paint coating which also has hydrophobic properties.  This will provide paint with a protected surface that also resists UV Chemical contamination and the hydrophobic qualities of ceramic coating will help topical contaminants from adhering to the vehicle surface and make it INCREDIBLY SIMPLE to clean.  You will definitely need to maintain a coating with regularly scheduled wash intervals.  So overall  a ceramic paint coating seems to be the best solution to actually ADD a durable layer of protection after polishing.,AutoDetailing,d0ahx1q,2,t5_2sjf8

7189203,0,t1_d1v7znh,You cant take everything a company says literally brotha. A sealant would last a couple of months on your vehicle and a lot of these companies throw those words on their product to make it seem like the best thing available. Usually anything containing some form of natural wax is considered a spray wax while anything that is made from synthetic polymers is considered a sealant. Now is chemical guys wrong for this? No its just marketing mumbo jumbo. So in essence I would pair their meticulous matte sealant as a detailer since it doesnt seem to last long. Maybe a couple of daysweeks but no one knows. Anything that just amps up gloss and shine while having some cleaning ability we call detailers. Actual spray sealants like carpro reload gtechniq cv and sonax polymer net shield are all spray sealants. They are in spray form and last  months per application. So to be clear technically its a spray sealant but when talking online and with other detailers youll find out that the chemical makeup and durability are how we classify most things here. ,AutoDetailing,d1vcnhu,2,t5_2sjf8

Id think the compound would remove old buildup on its own. The reason you dont need it a second time is that the paint prep takes off wax Silicone residue  and other associated stuff thats unfriendly to sealants.   Once its off its off.  Neither compound nor polish should have residues that would interfere with the sealant. ,AutoDetailing,d6ycxya,5,t5_2sjf8

The only cons are application time and prep work is much longer but its worth it because the longevity is up to two years or longer depending on what system you use vs up to  months with a sealant. The protection is also superior.If youre asking if I have a preferred coating not really. I only work with cquartz as of right now but only because thats what I have experience with. If youre worried about the price hike on Opticoat cross shop it with other coatings from detailers in your area. You really cant go wrong with most of the popular ceramic coating options. If youre applying it yourself look into getting another coating system. The prep work will be the same. ,AutoDetailing,d91rj8t,5,t5_2sjf8

9544402,0,t3_5bjzpo,Detailing products are usually not cheap.  The best way to save money is to buy in bulk gallon size youll save over time rather than having to go to autozone to buy more soaps waxes microfiber towels wheel cleaners.  Will save you money for years.  For instance Meguiars glass cleaner gallon concentrated.   dilute  with distilled water you just bought yourself  years worth of glass cleaner. Id say buying in gallon concentrated gives you a x better value over buying the partsstore consumer stuff.   I know because ive already spent probably hundreds at autozone  parts stores on just car shampoos and glass cleaner just taking care of a Camry.  Meguiars Shampoo Plus amazon linkMeguiars Glass Cleaner amazonMeguiars Xpress Spray Wax amazonAlso the Last Touch detailer wheel cleaners interior cleaners leather products.  All good value.  etc.  Compare the costs to partsstore grade products.  Kirkland microfiber towels amazon good for basic jobs that you dont want to use more expensive towels on.  Save all your spray bottles bottles of spray wax interior cleaners glass cleaner sprays etc to recycle amp reuse.  Put the gallonsized concentrated versions in them relabel the bottle with a sharpie.  You just saved  in bottles costs.  Invisible Glass Reach and Clean tool.  This saves your back and neck muscles from becoming dislocated trying to reach into corners while cleaning glass.  This tool is an essential in my book.  I think its .For DA polishing look into the meguiars DA microfiber system.  You want the one with the  backing plate.  Also buying in bulk principle also works here youll want a lot of buffing wheels so buy the pack.  amazon linkYoull want a clay bar kit.  Meguiars clay bar kit is a good value I like that it comes with a case to store the clay.  ,AutoDetailing,d9pjmnz,2,t5_2sjf8

It was probably a lot higher strength though someone in the sub may have recommendations for that.

Try to find something slim like a credit card or a business card and try to remove them that way. Yes not ideal by any means but they gotta go. I also picked up a windshield scraper from Autozone for about . It came with metal razor blades and some red plastic ones. You can try picking this up and using the red plastic blades to remove the dots. Wouldnt be a bad tool for any detailer seeing I use it to remove baked on contamination from windshields. Clean up as you go! Itll save ya loads of time!Edit My suggestions are not paint friendly I admit which may leave some light scratches or marring. So if you do take my suggestion and try it inspect the area for imperfections and do a light polish to fix Edit x I figured you mean that the dots are stuck and wouldnt come off with a wash.

Cheap gas stations would sometimes skip using special chemicals designed to stop the filaments from leaving a line of plastic residue looks like a scratch on the surface of the car.  Of course some car washes scratch cars by hand too!.There is no substitute for a professional detail washing your car.  My wife goes through the touch free spray wash every week then tips high school kids to scratch her cars clear coat with the cloth rags they use OVER and OVER.Four out of five dealerships in the US use the system I am talking about.  Broadway Equipment Auto Butler has been in business for  years and has equipment installed in s of car dealerships for OEMs including Ford General Motors Chrysler Toyota Honda Nissan Subaru KIA Hyundai BMW MercedesBenz Mitsubishi Volkswagen Audi Volvo and Mazda.  How do you think dealerships keep hundreds of cars on their lot looking shiny every day?  By hand?  Too many donuts to eat.  Thousands of auto dealerships send dozens of cars through these cloth based car wash machines every day.  You can stick your arm in the mechanism.  I am not in the auto business.

11604936,0,t1_dgbap79,If you are just getting started its fine not to have a DA.  It will let you figure out if this hobby is for you without a large investment.  You will look better than  of the cars out there with a few key items  Wash  good soap microfibers two buckets and grit guards  Decontaminate clay kit  Allinone cleaning wax  microfiber applicator pad more microfiber towels  Ongoing maintenance quick detailer quick wax and yes  even more microfiber towels Wash clay and wax.  Afterwards weekly or at least biweekly wash and quick wax.   Use the quck detailer for touch ups and the odd bird droping and the like.   In  months  do full wax again.  In  months re clay. This will let you really refine your wash technique  which is where most scratches come from after you do a full correction.   If you cant keep that basic regimen  it may not be worth it to dive hundreds of dollars into full correction and the maintenance required to keep it pristine.  However that basic combo will have your car looking great to  of the people on the road  likely including you.  ,AutoDetailing,dgbfgiq,2,t5_2sjf8

11633465,0,t3_65p8jd,Work at a dodge jeep and Chrysler dealer as well Still in high schoolgoing to college and i assume we are around the same age but my advice is just do it the way they want it done which is as fast as possible and to make the cars look nice which nice to them is just clean. We use dirty brushes and bath towels to clean and dry our cars so im assuming your dealer will do the same i just dont say anything because a job is a job and it pays for me to do things. Just do how they want it and youll be good ,AutoDetailing,dgenz9m,1,t5_2sjf8
