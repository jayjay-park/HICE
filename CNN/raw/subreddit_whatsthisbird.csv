404624,0,t1_cfmndqn,Heh yep.  The only Redtailed Hawk call that took me off guard was a Blue Jay that would hang out near the trail head of a park I frequent Bay City MI.  The little bastard could mimic the screech perfectly and when its right overhead in a densely wooded area it makes one look twice.

933564,0,t1_chae3qa,The female yellowthroat generally has a brownish head and back yellow throat and breast and paler belly. The bird in OPs image is doing a pretty goofylooking pose that might be obscuring this pattern for you  this looks a little more normal. They also have a longer tail  look at the difference in where the undertail coverts end in relation to the tip of the tail on both birds.Female Yellow Warblers are pretty much yellow all over with some olive tones to the back and tail. Behavior can also help separate the two  youre a lot more likely to see a yellowthroat down low in grasses or shrubs while a Yellow Warbler will be more likely to be seen in a tree though both do tend to hang out in riparian areas.,whatsthisbird,chaeg3r,2,t5_2tb3z

1111083,1,t1_chuhq5i,As I said one of the main flaws of this approach is that cowbird parents actually DO check in on their babies while they dont take care of them. And sometimes the lack of a cowbird egg in a previously parasitized nest will result in the cowbirds destroying the nest of the host. This means that the hosts own babies die some of the time anyway if the cowbird eggs are removed. Both the cowbirds and the hosts eggs die in this case unfortunately. Im not trying to spite your decision but this is why Id advise against removing the cowbird eggs along with my own mindset that nature should not be tampered with.,whatsthisbird,chul6yr,2,t5_2tb3z

It was briefly known as Lulus todytyrant but following the death of Ned K. Johnson one of the people responsible for the description of this species in  the name was modified to Johnsons todytyrant by the SACC.  Following the move of this species to the genus Poecilotriccus from Todirostrum it was recommended modifying the name to todyflycatcher.

One of my big beefs with flower books is that they are organized by color so when I travel I end up spending half a day leafing through the book looking for all the Fabaceae or Asters or whatever instead of just flipping to a section.

3503694,0,t3_30dvod,For practical purposes Im going to assume the colors are at least close since you didnt mention it specifically.Flycatcher species will stand out in a unique waythey like to perch where they have a good view of the immediate area then they will fly out to try and catch a bug and return to the perch or one nearby. Popular perch choices are the end of a branch if leaves arent an issue reeds tall flower stalks dried or fresh fencepost sign. For whatever reason they dont seem to like to perch where there are lots of other birds at least in my experience. Its almost as if they have a little radius within which they like to be the only bird.You will rarely see them in a bush or deeper into a tree the way a chickadee or sparrow or junco may do and almost never checking it for bugs.Hope that helps!

8475670,0,t1_d60wl1i,Ive argued this point before.  As your property a cat is your responsibility and therefore you could be charged with violation of the MBTA and any similar state laws.  But I see a few problems with this idea in reality.  First the MBTA has little teeth.  Violations are a lowclass misdemeanor with small fines.  It can be hard to get even repeat offenders charged  for example those pigeon fanciers killing raptors intentionally and in great volume but the penalties being a fine and community service  This was for blatant repeated and flagrant flouting of the MBTA  not just some guy with a cat he lets outside.  Second manpower.  It takes a lot fo time to get this prosecuted.  Evidence prosecutor judges etc. all have to spend time dealing with this.  The wildlife agencies that would go after these cases e.g. FWS game wardens etc. are almost always horribly understaffed and can barely keep up with people like these fanciers that brag and post a howto for killing raptors much less a cat owner. Finally any prosecutor that does take up the charge of someones cat killing birds will get some severe pushback because of the very thing we see on this site.  People love cats many people love when little fluffy kills something because its what they do without regard to the ecological consequences.  I wouldnt envy the shitstorm that would rain down upon that prosecutor.  Hell  Congress last year tried to make it impossible to prosecute violations of the MBTA  what do you think idiots in Congress would do to the MBTA if someone started using it against some poor catloving American.  The MBTA would quickly get painted by anyone with windenergy interests or anyone with an R after their name as an antiquated law that needs to be gotten rid of.Tldr  No teeth to the law no resources to enforce it and a shitstorm of backlash prevent this from being implemented.,whatsthisbird,d6100yh,7,t5_2tb3z

As others mentioned this bird has a longer thinner more daggerlike bill that is more typical of a Great blue heron. On top of that the proportions of this bird in comparison to the Doug fir is sitting in suggest its pretty big. Much bigger than Id expect a night heron to look next to those same needles. Plus Great blues nest and roost in the Doug firs along the central coast in good numbers so this behavior isnt unusual for them. ubnaslund were you in the Yaquina Bay or near the Embarcadero by chance? ,whatsthisbird,d7mjwdk,12,t5_2tb3z

9981974,0,t1_db8eaym,I get your point and lets be clear common kestrels are incredibly hard to sex and age. Its not for no reason Dick Forsmans Flight Identification of Raptors the holy raptorbible imho says only adult male and femaletype birds can reliably be identified in the field. Perched birds are easier but imho often require multiple photos as well.However for both of the photos you have posted I find it hard to exclude the possibility that both birds are nonsubadults. The first could be an adult but it could also be a cy which are slightly different from adults in May when the photo was taken. For an adult I would expect some clear spotting at least often if not dominant located below the streaked area. I cant tell if what Im seeing in the bottom part of the image is spotting or streaking tbh.The second photo taken in the end of October shows a bird with plumage that is definitely not in perfect condition anymore look at e.g. the jagged outline of the remiges which indicates that it is a juvenile since adults by then have moulted entirely and should thus show a very fresh plumage.,whatsthisbird,db8oh1t,2,t5_2tb3z

10210301,0,t1_dc1dbn0,Are European starlings and rats gross in their native range? Are swallowtailed kites gross when they eat the eggs of native birds? Would they be gross if they naturally expanded their range a bit to the north because humans changed the climate a bit?      You know that subjective assessments of beauty and disgust about birds are socially constructed in a pretty arbitrary way? Some Chinese cultures revered the magpie as beautiful and romantic Germans thought its a symbol of evilin both places its a nest predator.      Were Iiwis gross when they first colonized Hawaii and were busy extirpating some local species? Why was that long ago colonization OK and something to preserve but the current colonization by starlings is a bad thing? Is it just selfloathing of anything human aided? Is it just fear of change from a certain point in time ??       Note these are all questions that I asked myself as I switched from a starling hater to a starling lover.
