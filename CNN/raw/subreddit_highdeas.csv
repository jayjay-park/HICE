Both notions are impossible to prove disprove or until recently investigate. The belief that its about past lives is a matter of faith.

Also dont put arguments in my mouth I never argued that religious people are dumb. Its too easy to do that and its not true. Lots of intelligent people believe and have all kinds of wild opinions religion being one of them and there are psychological reasons for that. So let me explain this a final time so you get the point. I specifically replied to your question as to why religion and religious thinking should be dismissed.  You miss the bigger picture this isnt even about science or scientific thinking. Its about critical thinking and have evidence for beliefs. NOT scientific evidence just ANY plausibility. Thats how theories get momentum. How will you convince someoneusually a religious person with evidence to value evidence if they dont do so in the first place? Thats the BIG difference.  the brilliance of science and other areas of critical thinking is that they welcome being wrong it progresses by seeing what is needed to be shown wrong. Contrast this to religion its based on faith at the end of the day and from the beginning. It can never be proven false for any of its claims. ,highdeas,ckwuz9o,2,t5_2qy0n

3141604,0,t3_2w2pec,I think theres a transformation that takes place whenever you do this.  ltrantgt You have to put that thought into words to think it out loud.  Thus the thought is forced into an order that can be made into words.  In some ways this may force you to understand and organize that thought better.  There are certain parts of language that arent necessarily parts of thought e.g. showing direct causation or relating the idea to others in particular ways.  In other ways being forced to conform to these rules can limit a thought there are certain more ambiguous aspects of ideas that we dont have a good way to communicate to others.  Language is built to facilitate communication between people so it can be limiting when you can leave out parts you already know.  I feel like I and likely others develop a bit of a shorthand.

When youre up there you forget how to walk and fly all the time. No drugs needed you just stop looking at reality the way other people do and that starts to scare them. You in a term of matrix  just keep on stopping bullets. Theres an article about that subject you can find in my other posts   delete.me   if you want to read k article... This ones is kinda variation of the theme but not so moviebound. This time I try to do it scientifically. And whats that  my knowledge of mind clockwork.I hope youll like the other one too hope youve seen Matrix so you can get into that perspective. Its kind of messy so I decided different more clean approach with more earthbound metaphors.. But if you like flying  that will take you High. Maybe even make you watch the movie if you havent already.. Anyway  enjoy and I as always will appreciate your feedback. ,highdeas,cx38mai,1,t5_2qy0n

8282334,0,t3_4swg4g,Thats possibly a component but a big part is that cancer occurs later in life mostly  beyond when humans would have usually reproduced looking back in the range of hundreds of thousands of years. There isnt as much selective pressure postreproduction aside from more diffuse helping out your family kind of selective pressure. So the selection wasnt as strong on the cellular machinery for correcting mutations for that many years. It does a remarkably good job at correcting genetic mistakes as chromosomes are copied each time a cell splits through mitosis but mistakes slip through and each time that happens the dice are rolled as to whether or not that will affect a gene that is important in regulating mitosis. If enough of the right genes just happen to have the right mutations in a cell it will turn cancerous. Our bodies actually have specific immune cells that cruise around looking for these cancerous cells and most of the time they can find them in time before they start splitting out of control. But eventually there are enough rolls of the dice that one is going to survive and then you have a cancerous tumor. Thats why we tend to get cancer in areas that have the most mitosis going on.
