It seems the only thing youve found is rather speculative and were much more focused on things which are published. If you had the symptoms Delayed gross motor development Delayed mental development Delayed fine motor skill development Delayed speech and language development Hypotoniayou probably wouldnt be the type of person to study your own DNA and post about it. But it seems reasonable that you might want to get your doctor to order such a test and with that result in hand it would be interesting to record what you learn on the talk page at,SNPedia,cub223c,3,t5_37839

I had an appt with a genetic counselor today and I am getting testing done but it will be several weeks before I know anything. ,SNPedia,d1seyfo,2,t5_37839
