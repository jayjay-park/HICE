10171,0,t1_cefkubf,We are no threat because most of us cant be bothered to shoot some in game object for hours we are not a threat because we dont care for alarm ops and multiple reinforcement timers. We dont have the numbers because our environment does not allow us to have too many people in the same wspace system and you risk losing all of your connections due to mass strain.As far as organization goes I am laughing at you most of the wspace groups are much better organized then many null alliances. Unlike you we HAVE to fight in systems that might favor armor or shield fleets. Unlike you we have to have a nano fleet for small gang null sec raids. Unlike you each of us have to have a scanning ship a hauler a capital ship or an alt and a Tech ship. All of that requires organization but it does not end there unlike you we have to use rd party IGB tools that allow us to scan and rescan our space. We have to keep intel on each and every wspace system and group we come across there is no Sov in wspace so there is no easy API Sov pull like there is for you. We need to be aware of our situation all the time no local list to help us. Unlike you we have to live from our POSes no fancy station for us so that means we have to be wary of our POS security and protect ourselves against corp thefts.Lets see finally there are wspace invasions. No fancy supercaps with ewar immunity to put structures into reinforce no we have to do that. We also dont get to show up for timers if the invasion is ongoing it means  action. If we want to help our allies if their system is being invaded well we have to spend hours with our scanners and capital ships rolling our static no titan bridges for us.Having said all that it sounds to me like you are playing on easy mode little boy but that is fine you wouldnt cut it in wspace anyway.,Eve,ceflcwn,12,t5_2qil9

Likewise more payout on destroyed items such as rigs modules cargo based on the mineral value of the item so as to avoid price manipulated items leading to profiting from your own bounty. ,Eve,cel98gm,1,t5_2qil9

152522,0,t3_1vrxec,As someone who has worked on many large scale systems with thousands of concurrent users I do not believe there is an easy answer for this question.Two things come to mind.. EVE is over  years old it would be difficult to go back and rewrite much of the underlying code. The folks at CCP have given us some minor glances into some of the virtualization they use its all outdated and not very good but it was something invested in a long time ago and will require significant work to move away from.So if they were to rewrite EVE using modern technology and techniques for server distribution and clustering they would most likely but obviously not guaranteed since Im going off of tid bits and assumptions from CCP conversations get far more bang for the buck. How much more is hard to say though I feel like it could be significant.. We dont know how much the current system or a new rewritten system would cost so we kinda cant know. Need more numbers.As far as China goes thats all political Im afraid.,Eve,cevsy0n,1,t5_2qil9

155090,0,t3_1vtf0m,The best simple fix for this is to have all timers in a constellation synchronized. You put them into reinforce whenever you want but all of them come out at once the same time. You may have one large fleet battle or you may have better effort by spreading the fleet out over multiple systems. Doesnt abandon the current sov doesnt fuck up HP balance doesnt really change much but creates an incentive to not blow your alliance load on one fight in one system. You can sure but there is at least finally a useful alternative. It also would allow for some creative strategies in choosing what system to attack or whether to go blitz mode and try and get them all at once. Youd still have to grind down the other structures anyway so it doesnt make it inherently easier just possibly faster.,Eve,cew3h7r,1,t5_2qil9

162110,0,t3_1vy5gd,The CFC has come down for gudfites and to be this winters honourable third party after a strong showing on Ns part in the summer. It is also an extension of the foreverwar against the last remnants of BoB which against all odds continues to draw breath from beyond the grave in the rotting husk known as NCdot. The CFC has helped the Russians to numerous victories  both strategic and tactical  and has even taken the station system AFV in Immensea for itself in spite of the muchvaunted superiority of the wrecking ball. By all accounts this war has met and in some cases exceeded our expectations. A and SOLAR have been an absolute joy to work with past differences not withstanding if anything the enemy of my enemy being my friend has never been more true than in this case. Omegafleet has and will continue to be a thing. This war has also proven invaluable in providing shobon little bees and our allies with muchneeded combat experience many new skirmish FCs have also stepped up to the plate to lead the forces of freedom in the neverending fight against elitepvp.

197567,0,t1_cf0u8t3, .I talked about this in another post but in short  no. PL is old experienced and famous. Granted this is the largest loss ever suffered by any group in Eve but PL is exceptional. I highly doubt this defeat will cause them to implode. PL is way tougher than that. The individual responsible for paying the sov bill may or may not face consequences. It heavily depends on whether enemy spies were involved or not. If the person really did just mess up and forget to pay he will probably be kicked out of the alliance and members instructed to kill him on sight forever. . For the politics of the game this is a major victory for CFCRUS. The Halloween War has been roughly in stalemate for months now. This victory will probably mean the end of meaningful resistance in this war for NPL and if the losses were great enough it could leave them weakened in future wars for the next  months. CFC will trumpet their success and do everything in their power to discredit PL because CFC doesnt stop when they blow up your ship  they stop when you quit playing Eve. But like I said in part  PL is not going to stop playing Eve. So CFC will run their mouths endlessly but the reality is that PL is not done. If PL is indeed severely weakened from this defeat other entities may take the opportunity to gang up on them. That eventuality could given enough time actually destroy PL. This was just two big groups slugging it out if literally everyone in all of nullsec decides to dogpile on top of PL its unlikely they or anyone could survive. But I doubt that will happen. PL remains formidable even with this dent in their supercap strength. If I were PL I would withdraw back to my home space right now and double up on my defense patrols. But Im not an alliance leader so I may be unaware of other complex plots which may be unfolding.,Eve,cf0y1bs,5,t5_2qil9

Most people will investigate your corp see what kind of ships you can fly and if they can fly better ships theyll war you just for the sake of the super duper easy fights theyll almost never lose even if youre the best pilot around. Station games are a great way to lose ships. In high sec its one of the easiest ganks in the game.If you have assets you care about that are attached to the corp your options are more limited. I would say if you can ditch the corp form a new one and laugh at the ISK they wasted warring you if they follow. If they war you again theres no limit on the corporations you can create but at a certain point the ISK cost to continue warring you guys will not be worth it to them.You could also try and hire a mercenary corporation that hunts groups that try and prey on easy targets. I cant think of any offhand but if you search through the forms or maybe revejobs theres bound to be more than a few groups of people who would be willing to help you blow up their ships or worse depending on how much ISK youre willing to spend to harvest their tears.,Eve,cf77i35,2,t5_2qil9

260939,0,t1_cf7so8u,Yes naturally ancient historical conflicts map well into a virtual spaceship game.Look theres a fundamental difference between the notion of guerilla warfare in the real world and its analogue in EVE. First and foremost the difference in travel time is staggering. It took weeks or months to move an army in ancient Asia. It takes at most a few hours to move a fleet in EVE.Armies require supply chains food water clothing heat all the rest. That kind of logistics challenge doesnt really exist in EVE at all and to the degree that it does the level of challenge is radically less due to things like jump freighters and the existence of Jita.They are not comparable.

284649,0,t3_1xd3o8,Generally observing battles when youre not participating is frowned upon. This mostly comes from the fact that Eve is famous for having spies infiltrate corporations in order to pass intel to the enemies. This is even more risky when it comes to new players because everyone can create an account and pretend to be new to the game without much time or effort put into the character.  Get someone to teach you the basics of fleet combatmovements when there isnt anything going on. Also if they havent done it ask them to help you set up your overview for PvP.  During an actual fleet the FC may not have the time or may not be able to split his attention to actually try to help you out and explain things you dont understand. FCing is often like herding cats and the amount of things an FC has to deal with can put quite the strain on someone. Not to mention if things go wrong they will be the ones to take the blame people may decide to stop going on their fleets because they lose ships and so on.  Some newer FCs who are still learning themselves and take things slower give commands for every single action etc might be easier to follow in the beginning.   More experienced FCs especially ones used to flying with people who know what they are doing will often rely on their fleet members to know whats expected even if the FC didnt give explicit commands.  Also even if you told the FCother older members that youre new they may not be aware of your exact lack of knowledge or may not recognize that its you the new guy undocking in that rookie ship. They just see a bluepurple rookie ship undocking when theres not supposed to be one in space. If you want to do something like that make sure you ask for permission first. If you didnt manage to hear a command ask for it to be repeated on comms. If the FC is currently talking you might want to use fleet chat instead. If you didnt understand why something happened in a certain way wait for the fleet to be over and ask then.  Tbh youve picked a somewhat rocky path. Youll learn much faster but be ready for a lot of confusion in the beginning.,Eve,cfa9np4,8,t5_2qil9

He usually points CCP in the right direction anyway.Ill probably watch the video tonight but without seeing it I can tell you that using the money from banned accounts in any way would increase the ISK price of PLEX. If they bought PLEX with this ISK demand would increase directly. Even if they spent it throughout the market in a broader way inflation would very slightly increase the prices of everything.Did they maybe sell PLEX from banned accounts? This would increase supply and decrease price and it wouldnt be as unreasonable as creating more PLEX themselves.In case the minute video ends up being horribly tedious could you tell me where in the video they talk about this specific point?

I couldnt fly it well but I could fly it good enough to run level s in a respectable amount of time.  I dont remember exactly how quickly I jumped into a Dominix but it was quick.  I flew smaller ships to run s and s while I was training my skills up and building up my standings to get level  missions.  vexor and then myrmidonI ran the epic arc chain of missions it was good fun good experience and good isk for just starting out.  Sisters of Eve were the missions I was doing for the LP rewards.  They had a great LPisk ratio thenyr ago and they still do now.Im probably in the minority when it comes to this conversation.  I personally love the challenge of trying to make in game money by playing the game.  If you needwant to plex your account as soon as possible it is absolutely doable as long as you put in the effort to learn the game and be as efficient about it as a newb can be.Knowing what I do now Im not sure that I would go about it the same way.  I feel confident in saying the same approach would work but there are a lot of other ways to make isk.Currently I do combat exploration sites to make the majority of my isk.  Its EXTREMELY random how much isk you make doing that but I find it more interesting than doing level  misssions and make plenty of isk doing it.,Eve,cfd1kgf,1,t5_2qil9

He referred to any group in the cfc that wasnt in gsf as pubbies the same term he used for all nongoon outsiders. He also made it pretty clear that was a derogatory term.A couple months back there was a chat log posted here on reddit from some corp in the cfc but not gsf. No I dont remember their name sorry. The members of the corp were discussing amongst themselves whether they wanted to remain in the cfc because they resented being referred to as subhuman by allies.Like I said the problem is the attitudes of goonswarm line members not the actions of their leadership.,Eve,cfgd5yw,-4,t5_2qil9

372999,0,t3_1ya5tr,You have my vote.The  accounting software interface is a crucial point on your list IMO and applies to point  on your list as well. The interface is extremely outdated and hard to get into. It should get a full overhaul not just some tweaks here and there because it simply doesnt come close to the seamless interfaces we have all around us today. I know of people who viewed it as too big of a hurdlenuisance to conquer and did not sub after trial. I did not sub after trial myself many years ago when i tried Eve for the first time because of it although in all fairness improvements have been made since then.Another related issue is the lack of information easily available ingame or from an officialreliable source online about general game mechanicsmodulesskillsetc. Not talking fleet tactics and such but elementary things as to what agility exactly means what are the differences between cloaking devices or how to even get started with PI.But the real big issue and im interested in your take on this is that new players can NEVER get on a level playing field with veteranslong time Eve players. Most relevant when doing  vs  PVP. Eve is certainly not a game that requires a large amount of IRL skill to play. In contrary it needs virtual skill the one you train most of all. And when all conditions are equal between you and your opponent the one with the most accumulated gametime paid for skills trained over time will win the fight.The latter issue wont see a fix im afraid it will break the core player base of Eve the vets. On the other hand it will prevent Eve from ever getting out of its cozy little niche corner in the gaming universe.,Eve,cfjfd76,2,t5_2qil9

400460,0,t3_1yo31j,The best part of this story is we werent expecting the chimera at all. They chat us up in lowsec when we saw them light the cyno but never saw them jump anything in. Our fleet was the only thing in local apart from them so we figured our cover was blown. When they started crushing the c we didnt have scanned we thought they were closing our entrance so we rushed into the neighboring hole to try and catch a rev. When that wasnt the case we dodged to another wormhole next door so that they wouldnt see our fleet during transit between their hole and the lowsec. When they did start whittling down our entrance with the orca and phoon we figured they were playing it safe and shutting us out. We warped to their hole with the notion of oh well at least we can grab this orca and phoon. Turns out theyd jumped the chimera into the lowsec seeing that we were gone from both the lowsec and no where to be found in between and warped it to their hole at the same time we did. We landed on their hole seconds before the chimera.Praise be to Bob!,Eve,cfm9uq3,8,t5_2qil9

418950,0,t3_1yvnq2,The column starts out interesting but seems to stop short. There are lots of opportunities for solo PvP beyond FW space and categories of solo PvPer worthy of their own mention. For example  lately the only Pewpew I have been looking for is big game hunting i.e. killing BCs and BSs with T frigates solo. Something about pulling this off just makes me smile every time in a way that the quick dirty frig fights of FW space dont. I spend more time hunting than fighting but the end result is more rewarding in terms of killmails ransoms and tears. Lately I have been doing this in high sec because there are more targets and more bling fits but it is entirely possible to set up in strategic locations and do it in low or null as well  I have done so in the past and it works.,Eve,cfo6udl,4,t5_2qil9

435482,0,t1_cfpwi54,Another thing that Im not even sure if anyone mentioned is WH space.  Its like a completely separate game that lies between the cracks of the game...Wormhole space is space that is completely empty except for what players have brought in and sleeper sitesdrone rats that drop super expensive components.  There are no SOVs or anything like that who rules a wh is basically by player influence alone. People set up player owned stationsPOS by trucking in supplies then have to keep trucking supplies in to keep it active.  WHs also limit the size of ship that can go through and entry ways close and reopen other places and entryways in to WH space have to be tracked down and change location.  WH corps go on roams will clash and they will find inactive corps that allowed their POSs to run out of supplies and open up the nest egg for major amounts of loot.  Basically Isk runs out of peoples ears there but theres a good chance that your corp will run in to another corp and lose everything at one point or another.  I mention this to let you know the huge depth in the game...people have played this game for years and havent even seen WH space or maybe just had a cursory jump in to see it then left.  High sec alone occupies a lot of peoples time and people who are based in null sec rarely go to high sec except to mess around with either suicide ganking or faction warfare or to truck supplies out if theyre in the hauling business.  So dont feel like youll ever run out of things to do...its just that almost everything comes from player interaction unless you just grind missions nonstop and use the pointsisk from that to buy stuff from the faction store...then I guess if you only ever did that you could avoid interacting with other players but it would be really hard to do.  Youll at least be popping in to trade hubs and stuff.Anywho just join a corp that looks good.  Theres Brave Newbies Inc who have been pushing for new members theres a salvaging corp that you could probably make lots of fast cash in that wants new members and advertises quite a bitsomething synergy?  Idk and theres a few reddit based corps like dreddit fweddit and a few others...theyve had falling aparts and stuff though after a recent war that smashed the alliance that dreddit was head of so Im not sure how stable they are atm.  And theres Red vs Blue which is basically a two corp in one that runs an eternal war against each other in a specific region and lots of people have alts trained in small shipcruisers and under combat there for cheap pvp.  Sorry for the dictionary I just wrote.  Hope it helps and I hope you enjoy your time in new eden!  If you get bored and feel like quitting just grab all of your ships and put cheap guns on them and suicide them in to people in lownull sec or fit them with high burst guns and onetwo shot miningtransport ships in high sec with your brother.  Being in the mind set would take off the stress of dyingbecause thats the goal and you might enjoy it and spark some interest back...but if not then youve lost all youre stuff and wont be tempted on resubbing because you just threw away all of your stuff.,Eve,cfpwi8d,2,t5_2qil9

Lets take a look at it from the opposite side that of someone myself who only has an hour or three per week that they can play and look at the situation in that light.I support my PvP habit using PLEX. Ill inject one into my account every two or three months and will take out T ships to PvP with. I can do this because of Tiericide and because many probably even most of the T frigates through cruisers are viable now I cant afford to fly BCs and up so Im omitting them from my comments at this point in time.If I had to use an expensive T ship in order to get into PvP Id have unsubscribed from EvE a good while ago having to inject a PLEX into my account every few weeks as opposed to every few months wouldnt be worth it and when I do have time to play I dont want to spend two hours one week running anoms or missions just so I can spend an hour or less the next week PvPing.For someone like me the thrill Talvorian Dex gets from his T ships is the same thrill I get from my T ships. A m ISK T frigate with a T fit may be nothing to a regular player but to someone dependent upon PLEX it represents a realistic portion around . of what I can do while a m ISK Tfit cruiser is at the upperlimit of what I consider affordable  of that PLEX.Dependence like that creates a solid mindset where any ship youre able to redock in and fly again another night is that much ISK youve essentially gained but that mindset when dealt with long enough also creates a mindset that is averse to risks you might otherwise be willing to take especially towards the end of the ISK from a PLEX.From my perspective it isnt a sad thing that the age of T has passed. The passing of that age is the only reason Im able to go out and actually play a game I enjoy. Being able to lose a dozen T ships instead of a single Vagabond isnt a bad thing.,Eve,cfsnafy,1,t5_2qil9

Granted it has this title almost by default because the single worst solo frigate in the game is the Punisher and the Executioner is in the running for nd worst.The standard Tormentor fit is a pretty good scramkiter with scorch crystals which can also become a pretty good brawler by switching to faction frequency crystals.

483074,0,t3_1zn5d6,Once upon a time Guidance Systems were seeded by NPC sell orders in most market hubs. They were ridiculously cheap. Like a couple hundred isk each. And as many as you could afford were available at this price.Then one day a particularly tentative Goonswarm director was reading over some patch notes for a very soontorelease expansion. Among the notes was an indication that Guidance Systems would no longer be NPC seeded but instead would be a PI material.This was sure to bring the price of Guidance Systems up so this Goonswarm director sent out mass broadcasts encouraging everyone to spend as much isk as they possibly could on Guidance Systems. I think the actual cost to make Guidance Systems is something around k right now. But the price of Guidance Systems has never been that high due to the amount of Guidance Systems that Goons bought up right before the patch. Literally billions of the item hundreds of billions of isk worth. mil invested then is worth  billion today.To this day every time you buy a t drone you are putting money in the pocket of a Goon either directly or indirectly. ,Eve,cfv6g40,18,t5_2qil9

And since theyre necessary to make money and mining scales so well in nullsec you dont really mind plexing umpteen million accounts.

Edit Also its a good note that I could pump capitals out at a pretty good clip so it was helpful to Alliance mates along with being no more mindnumbing than anything else that makes money. Edit  It also means that you need to run  hours of PvE a month. If you already do that its hunky dory. These days I dont have the time so Ive found other ways of making money.

505289,0,t1_cfxoute,cynoing refers to jumping to a cynosural field. Large capital ships can use jump drives which allows them to move in between systems without using jump gates. To jump in between systems a friend of the capital ships pilot must first fly to the destination with a ship that can open a cynosural field essentially a giant space beacon that the jump drive can lock on to. Wherever your friend ends up putting the cyno is where your capital ship ends up appearing near. This dreadnaughts cyno was right smack dab near the part of the station where undocking ships come out meaning he was really easy to get close to and bump A bad thing for capital ships as they take a long time to move and align.The Dreadnaught is a Naglfar class. It is the giant ship at the center of those concentric circles on the map. It is a really tall vertical brownish ship thats bigger than almost any other ship on that field. Just look at the center of the screen and you will see it.The reason that the smaller ships are shooting the bigger ship is because the bigger ship wasnt allied with the smaller ships. Often in lowsec or nullsec the places in eve where you can kill people without CONCORD attacking when someone who isnt allied with you shows up it means they are trying to kill you so you try and kill them. The bigger ship the dread just came out of nowhere with the intention of killing off the smaller ships.

510457,0,t1_cfyaczd,I generally use the Cerberus. I find the following problems The Kinetic damage bonus makes it best to have faction scourge loaded. However Kinetic is easily the highest tanked damage type and is a primary or secondary t resist for  races. This isnt normally a problem with other caldari ships if it werent for the reload problems. The reload makes it absolutely unpractical for real pvp. Your idea of targets can change in a matter of seconds and having the right missiles loaded is absolutely vital for surviving a fight. While having faction always loaded you will always rape frigates but you will get lolowned by cruisers who are faster than you. Also if you start fighting a ship and a second one warps in that has high resists to your damage type you are boned. Your actual dps is terrible. Prior to the changes I was able to get around  dps in a RLML Cerb. Now I get around  when factoring the reload.,Eve,cfyaigg,3,t5_2qil9

Kiting ships in general have an easy time doing this especially if theyre against shorter ranged opponents. Capacitor warfare is also useful as your enemy will drop their warp scram on you if they run out of juice. Some scramkite ships can also  overheat their webs create some distance outside enemys scram and bail off. Most of the time you cant really do much about it after youre caught though.

574258,0,t3_20nvsn,I love the manticore its my favorite ship. As far as training goes standard PvP stuff is essential. Dont fly it if you can afford to lose it. As the most fragile of glass cannons I cant understate that. I would suggest trying faction warfare on the  frigate plan. This will teach you the basics of correct applied aggression and choosing your battles. You will have different more dangerous targets in FW. The most important part of PvP is being able to get away when you need to and having the skills to bring the fight to appropriate targets only. Once you fight in a ship that cant cloak you will absolutely love the manticore. I would suggest joining one of the downtrodden factions like the caldari and fly a point and annoy condor attacking everything you can. If you are able to dictate range in a condor you will have very little problem dictating range in a slower battle in a stealth bomber. Also most of the skills will transfer nicely over being a missile boat.The bomb is a whole other animal. You will have to practice with it specifically. Using the tactical grid and dictating elevation while cloaked are essential skills to dropping a bomb on target.Essential skills you must teach yourself Intermediate Dscan Skills Masterful understanding of bookmarks strategic safe spots and perches. Masterful Range Dictation Basic Elevation Dictation. Strong Target Acquisition skills Drake is always bait Masterful Egress Skills.

I could only see this as not a nurf to those ships in wspace if they increased the compression rate for rorqs over this new array. Im not really an expert in wormhole mining but I am really good at killing wormhole miners. Most that I come across arent worried about ticks per hour most are focused on surviving the cloaked ship gank. When it comes to miner boosters the real effect is felt over a long period of time.

599551,1,t3_21097a,Fleet battles were more fun pretitans where dreads were the biggest ships and generally they were just for taking POSs and such.  This would also be preinterdictors aswell so fleet fights were much more interesting and more heavily focused on large volley alpha strikes and ewar to prevent alpha strikes.  The entire concept of a ship in large fleet warfare sitting there and tanking for more than volleys was just silly.  Small gang warfare was similar to how it is now and this was were logi showed up as a serious force and tacklers were much more important as there were no dedicated tackle ships like dictors or heavy dictors.  Granted it wasnt just rose colored lenses you had true nanofits like nanophoons that were insane.  Extremely OP vampire builds and EWAR was insanely dominate.  Overall this made combat at almost all levels much more interesting imo simply because there was less stupid shit going on.  Battleships were truly ships of the line.  Though arguably most importantly bridging wasnt really a thing which meant fleets couldnt just go wherever whenever. In general Id be ok with the additions from the fleet capitals outside of the jumpsbridgesetc.  That aspect simply trivializes travel and distance to a huge degree for next to no costrisk.  ,Eve,cg8f7va,1,t5_2qil9

Reddit is a sufficiently large collection of people that there might be something gained by getting some info from this group. Some of whom might not frequent the Eve O site.A similar comparison would be to look at the dozens or hundreds of various opinion posts scattered across many community web sites.

630411,0,t3_21coxo,Im sorry about your loss OP.  The bonus room rides the very very thin line between scamming allowed in eve and harassment a bannable offense.   I hope you will be able to continue playing eve and avoid this sort of outcome in the future.For those curious part of the reason the scam works is the sheer number of people involved.  This is not one person telling the mark to trust them.  This is a large number of people telling the mark how amazing the scammer is and indoctrinating them into a specific trusting mindset.  There are victims that have a lot of fun in the bonus room and there are others who get extremely upset.   For those suggesting legal action.  Even if Erotica  and the OP live in the same country Im not sure what laws Erotica  could be prosecuted under.  The OP was convinced to stay in teamspeak for the purpose of gaining an in game item that is owned by CCP and neither Erotica  or the OP actually have claim to.  Barring that there was nothing preventing him from leaving the channel.  As for the rake as one person mentioned.  Erotica  makes between  million and a few billion on average with the escrow agents getting variable amounts.  The other advantage of the bonus round over other scams is that the loser is always at fault.  Erotica  and the escrow agents will always find a rule that was broken or the participant will have to leave midway through.  I personally hope CCP will take actions to curtail the bullying mentioned but leave the scam itself as a fun and viable way of making money.,Eve,cgbxflg,1,t5_2qil9

For people that make it trivially easy to gain the confidence of it really boils down to a single trade window or contract exchange and its over.Bonus rounds are just getting started where a traditional isk doubling scam ends.  The player is then strung along while he thinks hell get it all back and more.  The scammers stand to gain nothing more  they already have his stuff.  They just keep him around as long as they can hoping to get under his skin for no benefit other than tears.  Prolonged harassment of this kind is clearly against the EULA had it happened in game.Miner bumping is an activity where the bumpers also stands to gain nothing but tears.

678447,0,t3_21xgjo,Hello again industrious capsuleers.The ORE mining ships received a massive rebalance in the Inferno expansion which did the classes a lot of good but also had a number of flaws appear over time. Now that were reaching the second anniversary of that change this is the perfect time to revisit them.The Inferno changes followed the same goals as the rest of the Tiericide project. Previously Barges were a linear progression of underwhelming Procurers and Retrievers up to the Covetor and Exhumers had very narrow roles as miners of specific types of resources.After Inferno the Barges and Exhumers each skewed towards a different playstyle giving players multiple viable choices depending on what attributes they personally valued.In practice we underestimated the value that players would put in the iskeffort advantage of the Retriever and the Mackinaw leading to a less diverse mining landscape than we would have liked.Well be keeping the basic role breakdown that the  balance created but adjusting the bonuses quite significantly within that frameworkThe Procurer and Skiff remain the tankiest of the barges but gain an extra low slot bringing their fitted yield up to the same level as the Retriever and Mackinaw as well as a new bonus to drone damage and hitpoints. Asking a dedicated PVP ship to defend a mining fleet can often lead to mind numbing boredom for the PVP pilot so were providing the option for players to make sacrifices in their mining ships to allow selfdefense.The Retriever and Mackinaw keep the solo and lowattention mining crown thanks to their untouched massive ore bays. Theyll be getting a slight decrease to their yield to help moderate their strength as the previous round of balancing underestimated how much players value ore hold size.The Covetor and Hulk remain the kings of yield at the expense of tank and ore hold capacity. Their abilities in large scale group mining will be further improved through the addition of a  per level bonus to mining laser and ice harvester optimal range.Were also going to be switching the way that bonuses on the barges are applied to put more emphasis on the skill bonuses and less on the role bonuses. The skill bonuses to both ore mining and ice mining will be duration based instead of yield based providing parity between the effectiveness of the ice mining and ore mining bonuses.Top end mhr will be dropping a bit for ore mining and increasing a bit for ice mining.The following image summarizes the results of these changes on barge mining yield. The numbers are in effective strip miners and they assume max skills and that all but one of the lowslots on each ship is filled with a T MLU or IHU One upgrade for the Covetor and Hulk two for the rest.Barge Yield  ,Eve,cghe1l3,9,t5_2qil9

The Chimera can of course fit  DDAs with a full tank  DPS at the cost of all its cap regen while the Archon can fit one DDA and have a slightly better tank than the Thanatos or two DDAs and an equal tank plus  extra damage.  This will only get worse for the Thanatos when you consider faction DDAs.In a situation with multiple carriers where you have the ability to refit a maxgank Thanatos could be useful dps vs dps for the Archon and dps for the Chimera until its primaried and forced to refit to tank but overall the  fighter damage bonus is now a bit underwhelming.

697131,0,t3_224jee,Im sure this has been brought up many times in the past but i would love to see logi between T cruiser and carriers. There are many fleet doctrines and pve stuffs that require alot of rep over time and even when carriers can be used it doesnt seem to be the best solution especially when the entire game descends on every carrier floating in spaceA t logi battleship would be awesome in my opinion. Having it require logi V as well as the standard T cruiser logi requirements would give players a natural progression that also rewards their training time if they decide to fly T cruiser logi afterwards. The ships would of course have more raw repsec potential and more range. Tank is a tough issuemore raw ehp than a t cruiser logi of course but you cant overdo it. Simply giving a logi battleship t resists seems like overkill.With the micro jump drive battleship logi have a great ability to follow friendlies or get away from the baddies. It gives a much more synchronized fleet for battleship doctrines that already utilize mjds and force cruiser logi to dualprop.Price would be above the t hull obviously i dont know where the sweet spot is but perhaps m above its t counterpart is a good start? Needs to be an investment given its abilities but not so expensive that its overshadowed by carriers.I would love to also see some type of module that scales the triage module much like bastion mode does. I dont know if it could work if operating the same way howevernot being able to be repped by buddies would be a big disadvantage for a ship not able to tank anything near what a carrier can. Perhaps a module that does increase rep and cap but to a much lesser extent and as a result you simply cannot move but can still be repped. Or perhaps a module that allows for more rep and cap but hurts your own tank.Also! they would have hull bonuses for rep drones because yeah rep drones! Perhaps drone bay restricted to certain drone types? If they werent restricted and they had decent bandwidth i could see people using these as a mainline ship in a fleet would be pretty broken to have that rep potential with a full flight of sentries.,Eve,cgjil7q,1,t5_2qil9

730077,0,t1_cgn8gj6,Lets start with a tldr Python threads are only useful for IO operations and a few other edge cases basically. So if youre waiting on something coming in across the net or from disk etc then the threads will all run concurrently. Except run is not really the right word because theyre not actually running anything theyre all just waiting on IO save for one thread which is actually running.When you try to do actual calculation in multiple threads thats when you run into Pythons biggest wart  the global interpreter lock affectionately known as the GIL. Because of this lock which is required due to Pythons highly dynamic structure and mutability features only one Python interpreter process can actually execute code at a given time all others will spend most of their time waiting on the GIL.So your threads are not really threads just background IO waits. Thats really all they can effectively be used for. I love Python but this is by far one of its biggest weaknesses. Many attempts and forks have been made to try to remove the GIL and use something less restrictive none have been successful despite many many manyears of development time going into this effort.Multiple processes is indeed a solution but it has problems of its own particularly on Windows where processes have high overhead and IPC is complicated.,Eve,cgn9i1p,6,t5_2qil9

744545,0,t1_cgoe2pq,One issue you might find with that approach is the fact that in eve pvp the vast majority of people wont engage unless they know they will win the fight. Therefore if both of you sit in the plex you will only be engaged by superior forces. You can always dscan and run from greater numbers but a good FC will hide additional ships out of range until he has you tackled.Id suggest utilising these tactics yourself. Have one guy in the plex and the other nearby or in another plex hiding your numbers from the enemy and attracting more favourable engagements.Finally I think using two brawlers or two kiters would improve your success rather than flying one of each. Trying to use two different styles of fighting will allow the opponents to more easily use your weaknesses against you and make it hard for you to use your strengths. Eg. two enemy brawlers will tackle and isolate your one brawler and kill it with their superior dps while your kiter is useless. Once your brawler is dead you are unlikely to be able to successfully kite and kill two opponents so the fight is lost.,Eve,cgowt49,2,t5_2qil9

I was talking about how it has a high sig radius in general as the armor fit runs counter to its own bonuses. Speed tanking requires high speed low signature. Neither of those is optimal in either phantasm fit. High speed is hindered by plates. Low sig is hindered by shield mods. My point being it makes a crap version of both regardless of fitting. It is still worse off than either actual ahac at being an ahac. The  number was just what I had in my head at the time from the shield fits I made the armor fit is lower but the problems remain.

790726,0,t1_cgu14t9,So primarily its because of range.  Missiles outrange just about everything and dont have to factor in falloff and thats balanced because rangetransversal doesnt affect its damage just speed of the enemy ship.  Then they also have the advantage of projectiles in that they can select damage type.That being said you can do missions in either amarr or minm just fine.  Amarr has the advantage of free ammo good range and when theres either a thermal or EM hole good damage.  Minm has solid range with artillery and good damage from the selection but when you get to large ammo it gets pretty expensive  this is coming from a guy that doesnt mind taking an extra minute on a mission though because a few extra minutes usually doesnt save me enough time to do another mission when Im running missionsI only have say an hour or two to play at a time.  I have both minm and ammar trained and an abaddon and maelstrom I use to run missionsI have a nightmare but thats overkill and I dont really notice much of a time difference between the two or when using faction ammo  the difference would be huge over the course of a day but not in a small time period.  If I was running missions as fast as possible though I would think blitzing would make a much bigger difference than anything else.  So if youre going to spend several hours missioning go with minm or cross train in to missilescaldari.  If youre only missioning here and there and plan to do other things with your time amarr is just fine and saves on the trouble of dealing with ammo.Note  I havent actually ever gone after missioning as a full career or anything just used it to grind standings and do the occasional epic arc.

819456,0,t3_23ftlf,TLDR depends on how large your orbit isA lot of this is about what kind of ship youre attacking.  Keep in mind their drone bay type of weapon if they have a web  neuts and obviously if theyre alone P  Another thing to consider is what you have.  Generally youll see MWD interceptors with either long point or scram  web.  Some fit an active shield or armor repair or a MSE.  If you have a long point I suggest you keep the MWD on and keep right at the edge of your point range in a wide orbit.  This will make it hard for drones to hit you impossible for almost all turrets out of range for rockets and HAMs and out of neutwebscram range.  This is the safest place to be.  If youre fit with a scram you have to be a little more reckless at the benefit of shutting off their MWD and webbing them.  You cant orbit at full speed when youre that close to the enemy so youre taking the full penalty of sig radius bloom and not taking advantage of the full speed you get.  This is where your ships agility will help you keep your speed up in close orbit so I suggest rigs that increase agility instead of speed on a close range inty and speed rigs on a long point inty.  When you get into scram range turn your MWD off so that your sig drops and you can better manage to keep at your top speed.  Right after your mwd turns off theyll be a small window as you decelerate where youll be going very fast.  Use this window to get a tight orbit.  If you leave your MWD on too long as you start the close orbit youll take a lot of damage as you slow down but still have a huge sig.  Its about coasting into the orbit.  I prefer to have my preset orbit on like m and manually pilot until this point.  When my MWD is off and im gliding in closer i should be about km when I hit my autoorbit and it starts to pick up without me losing transversal.  Remember that if you have a preset orbit at like km with your MWD on and you turn it off your ship will literally drop transversal and approach your enemy in a straight line because it is now capable of a an orbit closer to km.  this is why you manually pilot when youre making this speed change.  Once you have the scram on your target and your MWD off in a close orbit itll be hard for him to shoot you off with turrets or missiles.  Kill his drones first.  The dual medium autocannons can wreck your day if youre not careful.  medium turrets might get small hits but larges will miss every time.  Watch out for rapid light missiles launchers stay away from caracals.  Also avoid ships that commonly have webscram.  mostly blaster boats and whatnot.  If youre going against something with long ranged weapons its generally safe because they shouldnt be wasting slots on webs  scrams when they are supposed to be attacking targets much further away.  If they have a utility high slot watch out for the neut though.  Dual prop interceptors get the best of both worlds.  They can get under the guns and then keep a huge speed up.  you can live with a web on you if you have an AB on.,Eve,cgxfalr,2,t5_2qil9

I was party to two such corporations.One took initial investments from the community in order to buy a stash of capital hull and component BPOs.  They were then researched and used to build and sell hulls.  Those running the show received a cut of the profits off the top the rest was split between share holders.  Eventually it stopped being worth the effort and we liquidated.The other corporation was a T production assembly line.  Everyone was involved in running copies invention production etc...  We initially tracked job contribution on the honor system again requires a very small very trusted core of players for this to work! but eventually someone wrote an app to pull API data and collate it automatically.  Roughly  of the monthly profit was put into a lottery pot.  You got tickets based on job contributions.  The rest of the ISK was put back into the corporation buying morenew BPOs expanding our towers from one up to eventually four etc...  Now everyone is burned out and the corp is just a shell for our bittervet members to run personal industry projects.,Eve,ch3nzej,5,t5_2qil9

903346,0,t1_ch6uvb1,Ok posted from my phone the first time here are some helpful links.Holy Grail of EverythingFor your specific problem I was a little wrong in my OP... You need to search through two tables but the gist is the same.The first table you want to search through is the InvMarketGroups table.Basically you want to start by doing something like    results  select  from InvMarketGroups where parentGroupID       while results is not empty        if the first result hasTypes              add category to itemListCategorys            remove first result        else            result  select  from InvMarketGroups where parentGroupID  currentmarketID            add each item in result to results remove first resultThen you are gonna want to take your itemListCategorys array and search through the following table where you select the typeID where marketGroupID  item in itemListCategorysThatll give you a list of all the item IDs in the category or sub category you want. Theres some stuff that Ive left out but that should shove you in the right direction. Once you have the item IDs its really easy to use some API calls to one of the many eve market sites to get the actual buysell prices. ,Eve,ch6yru1,3,t5_2qil9

939944,0,t1_chb1vor,gt CCP is taking sides.I think thats exaggerating. Just because current actions or even the current development phase is focused on PVE doesnt mean CCP is taking sides.MMOsand especially EVE are huge ever changing oceans of systems and content that constantly roll back and forth. Maybe theres a PVE wave rolling in now but that doesnt mean that there will no changes to PVP to even things out again. But the implication that CCP is slowly killing PVP is simply exaggerating.Also as someone who is playing MMOs for such a long time as you you should know very well that people always bitch about changes no matter what and when without even wanting to try it out and seeing how the players will keep the balance and if the changes are actually not making things way more interesting for both parties in the long run.,Eve,chb4lfq,9,t5_2qil9

994216,0,t3_25gzsz,I can see a lot of utility in eliminating aspects of the grade k system along with the freshman through senior designations.   In subjects with established nonsubjective learning goals it makes sense to have achievement rankings and side specialties.The resume this would produce looks less like a dated entry from a prison release record and more like a infographic.A big part of it is the budgeting and statepaid ampm childcare aspect of the public education system.  Labor is a big part of expenses equation despite the amount of money that disappears into the financially opaque publicmanaged monopoly.  A thirty student class looks like a good experimental sample to a statistician.Solutions would involve eliminating the teacher from a lot of curricula objectives and replacing lecture hours with machine learning in and out of class.   The opposition to such objectives even with evident successes from pilot programs would cover the entire political spectrum.   What is more likely to succeed is attaching a modular learning program to the current system we currently enjoy and then observe as the successes it elicits tend to eclipse the importance of the old system.  The result of this will be the old system being adjusted to conform to the requirements of the new system.The nice thing about technology is that it is possible to have individual students working on their own projects at their own speed even when they are grouped up with their age mates.  The primary function of teachers would still be to administer lectures but evaluations grading and academic advancement would largely be mechanized.  Academic tracks would largely be customized to the students abilities and proclivities with the main advantage of allowing them to advance farther than they would normally in fields that match their strengths and interests.People do learn all their lives but it is wasteful to spend the early years of higher neuroplasticity in tasks that do not capitalize on student achievement.,Eve,chhasjj,1,t5_2qil9

1050062,0,t1_chnmdz9,gt The map never changes no reason to not include it in full client side.There have been a few dev blogs in the past year talking about how they are working towards being able to dynamically change the map data. gtOnce you have the graph in memory which takes no timeLoading things into memory is also nonzero time. Assuming you already have enough space in memory Eve is only bit so youre already limited there then you have to wait for the disk to read everything. Plus you wouldnt want to keep it all in memory all the time so thats a lot of loadingunloading for something that is only needed when you set a destination. gtFinding the shortest route is stupidly fast thanks to how optimisedsp algorithms are. This is a video game. You are adding more algorithms on top of everything else already running. There is going to be a performance hit regardless of how you code it even if it is O because the client is literally doing more than it was previously. EvE autopilot only cares about jumps so if we use Dijkstras all the weights are  and there is no math to do you are just trying to find the shortest number of hops. Adding in math via distance between gates is going to turn something that is roughly On into On nO because of all the math you now have to do.

1088932,0,t3_26kkwr,Talwar is generally used for long around km range kiting especially massed in a large fleet where their high combined volley damage can alpha enemy ships.

The limit of its practical engagement range is km but the DPS is much better around km. Also not tanky at all no grid to fit an MSE.Autocannon thrasher is a nice brawling boat with solid DPS lower than a blaster catalyst but the option to load Barrage and project damage out to km. Good for killing all sorts of frigates if you are soloing or in a fleet good for quickly ganking high value targets with cheap ships. Can be reasonably tanky with either armor mm plate or shield MSE.

PvE in Eve is just flat out boring because of how it works not because of the lack of story. Conflicts and steering events is where PvP comes into play. The sandbox allows you to take a stand based on Prime Fiction if you will and fight for it. No matter which standpoint you take in Eve therell be enemies you can go after.

1183653,0,t3_27o0ac,This fit does  less dps a  difference and is extremely unlikely to be ganked. It costs less than m all together.Lets say every mission you run you make  million and run a one in one thousand chance of being ganked in the blingy ship. If you do the mission  faster thats like youre making . million more each mission.However because you have a . chance of being ganked and the ship is  billion its like youre losing  million each mission in gank probability.You can see in the end things come out pretty evenly. If flying a blingy ship like this not knowing what hostile intent those in system might hold towards you gives you a certain thrill then Id say go for the blingy ship. If youre looking for a steady and stable source of income then a more conservative approach might be warranted.Finally if youre going to bling a ship for gods sake fit T rigs. They dont even drop so they do nothing to increase your gank likelihood.EDIT Also guess Ill mention that security status means nothing because mission ships are usually ganked by alpha based ships that will only fire a single volley before being concorded.,Eve,ci2s3k0,2,t5_2qil9

1189770,0,t1_ci3gmt3,Its basically you being permanently at war with a bunch of other people in lowsec.  Being at war means you dont worry about gate guns against war targets.There are sources of Loyalty Points in FW.  You then use those LP to buy shit and can turn around and sell that shit for ISK.  Basically the two sources of income for FW are running plexes from complex different from Pilot License EXtension plex.  You go through an acceleration gate into the plex and orbit a beacon.  Sort of like a domination point from an FPS you being in range of the thing starts to move ownership of the plex and therefore the system into your militias favor.  During the time youre orbiting the beacon someone else can jump in on you and attack you.  FW is designed to be a source of content in forcing war targets towards each other to clash and fight and a source of income.  The income draws more people into FW to create more fights.The other source are FW missions.  Basically a little more hardcore than Ls and usually way the fuck far away from the agent to force FW mission runners to move across the warzone to give people the opportunity to attack them and therefore create content.  Usually people run them in Stealth Bombers cause you can solo the missions themselves fairly easily with them and traverse the warzone in some semblance of safety.  A group of Heavy Assault Cruisers could also work.But essentially its people using small ships cruiser and below getting into fights with each other.  During offtime people will try to grind money out of the plexes and missions in order to afford ships to take out on pvp roams through the warzone.Ive not explained it very well but its still something you should get into. Way way more interesting than the pure grind of what you did before.,Eve,ci3guuo,1,t5_2qil9

1309735,0,t3_292tzu,Troubleshooting crashes is a tricky issue and requires a lot of low level technical data.  For a start Id check your log directory to see if there were any errors logged around the crash.  The default location is CUsersusernameDocumentsEVElogsGamelogs on Windows .  If theres something you were doing both times when the crash happened you can try to reproduce the crash in a safe environment to gather more data.What Id suggest is the following.  Install and run LogServer while playing EVE.  This attaches to the game and will create a much more detailed log file that CCP can use to trace back the crash..  Install Microsofts DebugDiag program.  If EVE crashes again dont close the program.  Open DebugDiag and take a minidump capture of the ExeFile.exe process  thats the EVE game process.  Youll get a .dmp file which will have a capture of the process in the crashed state.  It would be more helpful to get data as the process begins to crash but that would mean running DebugDiag to monitor the process ahead of time which can affect gameplay..  Open a Bugreport   not a Support Ticket.  The GMs probably wont be able to help you with this.  Use the Technical category and assign it ATTN  CCP Snorlax  he handles a lot of the crashfreeze issues Sorry to push more work on you.  Make sure to provide lots of detail on your computer system  CPU Motherboard RAM Video Card Sound Card OS etc.  Make sure to submit the game logs the LogServer file and the crash file..  Create a post in the Issues Workarounds amp Localization subsection on the forums.  You can search around and see if anyone else is having the same issue as you reference those threads.  Reference that you submitted a bug report.  This will let the devs communicate back to you as they cant with the current bugreport system really needs fixing!Hope that helps.

Erasing it just usually means another Gb to download.The issue here is that MacOS since Mountain Lion have a security feature called Gatekeeper that by default blocks you from running any software thats not been signed by an identified developer aka someone who paid apple for that.There are two ways to bypass this and I really recommend you pick the first one discussion on the comments belowFirst option is the casebycase way Go to your App Folder Where you dragged the EVE Online icon when you first downloaded the .dmg file and RIGHTclick controlclick  twofingerclick.. Pick the first open option on that list.. This will give you a popup but this time its a different one and has an option to launch it anyways. IIRC you only need to do this once for every app then it remembers it.The second option is the permanent one Click on the topleft apple icon open System Preferences... then Security amp Privacy top row.On the bottom half of that screen there are three options for you to pick for Allow apps downloaded from    Mac App Store   Mac App Store and identified developers    Anywhere. You want to select that last one. if the options are grayed out theres a locked padlock on the bottom of that screen.. click it enter your user passoword and it will unlock the options for you. I suggest you lock it back afterwards.Which one you pick is kinda up to you and how you plan to use your Mac.Source Long time player on an MBP that formatted it bc of a bad hard drive a couple months ago and had two skillqueues expire while I couldnt figure out why the heck my download would always be corrupt.,Eve,cij8xs4,3,t5_2qil9

Youll want to do these in a notbattleship.  Fly to Apanake or Pancake or whatever. Grind SoE level  missions until your fingers bleed enjoy the healthy ISKLP conversion rate.  Read the evesurvival report on each mission very carefully before doing them and overtank at first a lot of stuff can kill you if you do it accidentally but once you learn not to do it youll be at no risk example attack of the drones can scram and dumpster a well fit battleship if you shoot all  triggers at the beginning  Use a Paladin or a Napoc or a nightmare.

1360253,0,t3_29o0gw,well Im still quite new myself coming up on  months and still learning.  I made a mistake of playing Eve solo for first month and it was boring. The best thing I can advise is to join a corp and try different things. Brave Newbies Eve University or RvB if you like pvp. Personally I think Eve uni is a good starting point because you can choose what you want to learn and once you get some sort of foundation you can join dedicated corps. Hauling Mining Ratting Incursions Wormholes roams there is lots of things to do. As a new player though best thing is to join one of the corps i mentioned they often give you free ships skill books and are willing to teach you lots of things. ,Eve,cimsq19,1,t5_2qil9

Make tacticals k above or below belts with a fast frigates then come back in your thrasher warp tac to tac and then when you find a Clone Soldier warp to an asteriod next to it. Over heat MWD spiral in and kill it.I usually use a Mwd Dual Web fit mm ACs and faction phased Plasma. Once you have spiralled in and are are close enough to get under its tracking slow down until you are just taking a little damage so that you get max damage from your guns. Fitting metasatis rigs to improve your tracking helps too. You can then armour tank it or fit an armour rep and a nos.Alternatively I some time use a mn AB thrasher sig tank it the whole way in until im close.

While this was happening PL escalated with some supercarriers. BL couldnt break reps so went to shooting fighters and dropped in supers on the POS edge. BL started on Nyxs but  jumped out in low armor as hictors were killedjammedneuted. PL began to jump in Archons which were killed by the BL supers while the BL subs kept shooting fighters. BL bridged in hictor heavy reinforcements and finally were able to kill a PL Nyx. A second Nyx was near death but PL Archon and supercap reinforcements arrived to stabilized it. After killing a few more Archons BL supers disengaged by coasting into the POS shields as NC. caps and supers arrived to reinforce PL.

1426361,0,t1_ciuytbn, Cant cloak while being targeted by the rats. You would need to warp to drop all locks from the rats. If you log out while cloaked you uncloak align to a random location nearby warp then sit there for  to  seconds before disappearing even without any timers.  Its REALLY easy to probe and get you during all that.I dont know of any video guides but I can explain.  It helps if everyone in the gang is familiar with polar coordinates vector notation and that the dscan is conic. The scout will be the person with the fasted dscan in the west.  The others should have an excellent understanding of the coordinate systems used. All pilots will be looking at a map of the system which shows the orientation of all celestials.  Press F the bottom map is the standard reference.First announce your initial scan location e.g. origin p. Due East is zero degrees and increments to  degrees counter clockwise through the four quadrants.  So early reports would sound something like thisIshtar with hobs out.  Gates near p below plane first quadrant. System scan shows  anoms.The scout dscaned at  and found a ship  origin at planet  system scaned and waited for anomalies to pop deprecated reduced dscan to  and pointed the camera straight up no result deduced target is below the celestial plane  looked at his current location from the top left of the screen System name nearest celestial then turned his dscan to  and scanned up to  quadrants and continued to reduce the angle and scan around the assumed location until it fit in a reasonably tight cone around the anomalies in the area.Now lets imagine there were no anomalies in the direction the vessel is detectedMagnitude au.  Small medium large angel wrecks Origin prime near star guessing west of p below p.  au from p.  CLOSE.  wrecks NO POSThe scout changed their overview to include wrecks on the next dscan and also reduced their dscan range until no target then adjusted in and out until they get an idea how many au out the target is.  This is the first complete vector and is enough to find you guaranteed in the first probe scan.  While beginning their warp they tighten the scan cone to  to  to  while warping.  This provides a d view of where the target.  When the target disappears it means they flew out of range this provides a second magnitude and additional spatial sense of where the Ishtar is.  They lost signal while warping near the star which becomes the origin for the second vector. The scout also noticed a nearby planet which helps to improve the spatial sense.  We know exactly how far away the planet is so the scout is now creating a relative map with a second set of polar directions in brief.  This is for the prober.  Now he knows exactly where to drop the probes and what range they need to be set at.  The most significant information is that there is no POS  the scout changed their range back to au with POS modules and detected nothing but the ishtar and drones. The wrecks suggest what kind of site complex mission the Ishtar is doing and how long they might be in there for or how difficultdistracting it could be.  The scout now leaves the system and nothing happens for a strategic period.  Usually very short. At this point Im usually able to give extremely accurate results to the rest of the gang.  Down to  degrees off e.g. OP au P ltau  If were being patient Ill type that out and let the prober mull it over and decide how he wants to get off scan for the probe drop and set them up for the move.  At this point its up to the prober to call someone in and warp their squad on top of the signature.To the Ishtar ratting this will look as innocent as two random people passing through the system a minute or two apart and then probes and local filling up.  If he isnt warping within the next few seconds he will be caught.,Eve,civ2l8t,6,t5_2qil9

1463595,1,t1_cizq006,We knew before we even started that the capitals were most likely wrecks waiting to happen. It happened in a c hole with a c static which means that for us to get those capitals out SYJ had to not care unlikely Lycosa had to keep being bad probably and we would have to wait for probably at least a month probably more for  or more holes to roll into us with a way out and not have an active corp living in them. Pretty unlikely and annoyingly long term. Honestly Im glad we SDed the caps they were a giant ball and chain around my ankle holding me to that POS. SYJ will probably say that we SDed them because we were scared and infact this has been said in mails from Bradford but the fact that we SDd them before we even knew they were there proves this just isnt true.Either way this was never about gaining the ISK. It was about denying it to people we see as undeserving of living in c space and mostly it was about seeing if we could do it at all.Its a great feeling when you can start something like this caring not at all if everything in there blows up and you get podded out.

1464337,0,t1_cizc10v,I tried building this in EFT and it doesnt really work unless youre willing to not exploit damps in which case why use a celestis? You could go AAR instead but I dont like it. With two damps you can reduce most cruisers lock ranges to ltkm k overheated. An MWD nano celestis could be pretty deadly in solo PvP but I wouldnt use lasers because it has serious cap issues. Most of your DPS is in drones anyway. The web could be swapped for basically anything else but it might be good if someone actually got into lock range of you since you can hit them with the web before they finish locking and keep burning out. You could also drop a cap mod but Im pretty sure youll need all the time you can get to kill anything with this fit. One problem is that you cant expect to break a good active tank without neuts and getting into neut range is hard. Youd also need to refit for all capacitor mods and use a rd damp to reduce lock ranges to km on attacking cruisers. Without a web youre playing with fire unless you can successfully neut out their tacklepropmodDPS before they kill you. Id recommend not trying to break activetanking cruisers. This fit will probably die to drone ships since the drones can shoot you even if the owner cant lock you. MWDing destroyers and frigates are iffy they have low enough EHP that you might be able to kill them before they get under your guns and damps. If not youre probably tankier and might kill them with your drones before they finish you off. You could refit to mm autocannons for better tracking if this is a concern but even with the web Im not sure you could track an MWD frigate orbiting at . Bonus if youre baller enough I strongly recommend using an offgrid booster with skirmish and information warfare links. Your ship will become staggeringly awesome and your damps will reduce an enemy cruisers lock range to km km overheated. Edit to bonus yes you have a km unheated point now. Yes you can make the fit work with only one damp now. No you should not fit an ancillary shield booster instead now. In fact Im really not sure what else you could fit in place of that damp. A cap booster and swap a lowslot to a DDA? You might be able to run a webscramABneut fit if you have boosts. Youd be cutting it pretty close your damps will lower a cruisers lock range to km or so without heat and you can scram to km . overheated. Also you have no DPS if they manage to take down your drones. Id recommend playtesting it if you think youre elite enough. Yes you pretty much need all relevant skills to level  or its going to fail miserably. Edits for the edit god this setup has a few serious problems. One is that a smart opponent might kill your drones leaving you less than  DPS. Another is that its a kiting setup but it can only kite one ship at a time. On the plus side it can keep that ship tackled which a lot of sniper cruisers couldnt. Youll also have problems warping in on anything unless you can land outside its webscram range or you use an ABscram fit. Itll take you so long to kill anything that the target will have plenty of time to call for backup and run you off. Finally anyone who guessesdies to your fit and brings a sebo will completely wreck you. If you want to use an unorthodox comedy fit the dualweb blaster exequror is probably a better choice. Give this one a try if youre bored though. ,Eve,ciztwfu,0,t5_2qil9

I think Id be a good mod simply because I have the time to dedicate to it since Im on reddit about  of my waking hours anyways.  That and since I dont actually have any ties to any ingame group Id like to think Id be fair and unbiased. Mod philosophy Id say completely handsoff if only to reflect the spirit of the game itself.  Mods should step in to remove obvious rulebreakers and maybe when theres an issue that affects the entire subreddit maybe somebody wants to ban all killmail posts. Questionable content will be decided by the community.  If enough people report the post and its actually questionable no report brigades pls it should be removed.

1514650,0,t1_cj5vmya,Has less to do with isboxer and more to do with a lack of good counters to coordinated bombing MSEfit bombers can tank a single volley from any medium turret ship you cant shoot more than  of them down before a volley detonates. You cant easily firewall them with smartbombs.  Even if you could you cant operate smartbombs on a station so it wouldnt have saved the Harpy fleet here. Bombing effectiveness grows uniformly with the number of people involved given enough bombers you could kill a slowcat ball.Given a sufficiently competent multiboxing bomber the only real way to avoid being killed by bombs is to build doctrine ships that are so tanky that you need more than two volleys.  Its a bit like the old days of AOE Doomsdays when every ship in a fleet needed to have at least two plates and active hardeners.  And even then ISBoxers will simply start packing a third fleet the same way that Titans simply started doing multiple DDs at once.CCP is unlikely to ban ISBoxer tbh they need the account revenue.  But stunts like this make it more likely that theyll nerf stealth bombers  theyll reduce bomb damage or reduce the number of bombs you can fit in a volley or add a modulemechanic that hardcounters bombs or reinstate the old mechanics of cloaked ships could decloak each other or reduce bomber EHP so they can be oneshotted again or so on.In other words ISBoxers will be responsible for nerfing the only effective antiblob mechanic that exists in Eve today.  gf?,Eve,cj64zc2,21,t5_2qil9

Lower sig radius usually better tanks maybe less damage  have a number of cap warfare hulls curse bhaalghorn geddon dont usually rely on missiles which can be ineffective if the target warps or your fleet doesnt switch targets quickly  slave implants are awesome mid slots free for more ewar mods tracking cap boosters guardians are pretty superior logo the archon is a better triage  capital then the chimera less fitting issues and more cap but with lot slot damage mods now in game the spider tank of shield carriers might have some serious potential Cons exists in  environments safer or at zero.  If caught must fight and win or be cut down  capital reps for armor is plain out classes by shield this crys for armor caps to get some love the revelation is now the worse dread you can buy based on tracking damage and somewhat its tank potential dual rep revs look interesting zealots are just gonna get raped by isthars and muninnsIm sure I missed stuff but back to the treadmill!,Eve,cj6xggp,2,t5_2qil9

1581270,0,t3_2cbhpc,Dont sweat it so hard. It sounds like the point isnt really to win or find the perfect matchup for a rifter but to learn the ropes and have fun. So instead of hard countering her crucifier or kiting slicer you should each try a bunch of different things to see how they fly and what you like. If youre sticking with all tnamed fits your ships should only cost a couple mil at the most so you can easily afford to experiment. And now that i think about it unless youre really tied to amarr for some reason you should fly something else. Amarr frigates REALLY depend on t guns because you need to be able to load scorch. Most amarr fits you see wont work at all with tnamed guns. If youre limited to t lasers neither of you will get a lot out of this  you wont really learn how to fly amarr and she wont learn how to fly against them. Try gallente instead or caldari if youve got missile skills. Tbh not having t long ranged ammo is going to make these fights different from the real thing no matter what race you fly but its particularly true for amarr.Short list of things to try...Minmatar cookie cutter rifter  plate  aar nos in the utility high shield rifter td armor rep breacher dual tanked breacher dont laugh it works td slasher.  amarr dont fly amarr with t guns.gallente rail atron high dps hull tanked atron dual rep incursus single rep inc web instead of cap booster railcursus a tristan of any description.Also keep in mind that going all tnamed is going to affect your dps more than your tank so fights will feel different than out in the wild. It shouldnt affect what youre doing just keep in mind that in the real world the incoming dps will be WAY higher. ,Eve,cjehq8x,1,t5_2qil9

1612191,0,t1_cjhw7ed,Yes what i said,Eve,cjidtfl,0,t5_2qil9
1613198,0,t1_cjiidtf,We floated an early proposal concerning this issue on the wormhole forums which discussed the option of implementing a delay after players jump through a wormhole before the K wormhole is visible. After discussing this idea on the forums and at Fanfest with members of the Wspace community we heard the major concern that the idea as proposed would have caused players to feel helpless like there was nothing they could do to detect the potentially hostile players in their system. This is a very legitimate concern so we went back to the drawing board.The result is our next proposal which we believe effectively navigates the concerns of the hunters and the hunted.As of Hyperion we are planning to have K signatures appear as soon as the first player jumps through their wormhole connection. This prevents players in the destination system from receiving unfair early intelligence while also ensuring that a vigilant player can determine if a potentially hostile intruder has entered their system through a new wormhole connection.Once a wormhole has been jumped through once the K signature will remain scannable for the lifetime of that wormhole. This scannable state will persist across downtimes.We are looking forward to your feedback on this change and will be reviewing it from this thread Loosening of Bookmark Copying Restrictions Feedback threadThis final change is a bit more focused but should still be of interest to most wormhole residents. Over the years we have implemented certain restrictions to bookmark copying since it has historically been a major source of database load for EVE. At this point after many other gameplay changes wormhole residents are the most common users of the bookmark copying system and the request was passed to us from the CSM to investigate loosening the restrictions around this activity. We have done some investigation and it does appear that we can safely reduce these restrictions.So as of the Hyperion release you will be able to copy more bookmarks at once and the operations should complete significantly more quickly. We will continue to investigate loosening the restrictions further if the first set of changes works out well. While you wait for us to finish the ongoing work that will eventually enable the longrequested alliance bookmarks this should at least be a helpful change to tide you over.As always we are interested to hear your feedback on this change and to hear what else you would like to see from the bookmark system in the future. Feel free to post all your bookmark feedback in this thread In Closing These proposals are not the only improvements we hope to make for wormhole space in the future and we are actively discussing with the CSM other improvements that could be made. We encourage you to keep communicating your requests both directly to us here at CCP and to your hardworking CSM membersWe hope you have enjoyed this dev blog and that you are looking forward to the Hyperion release as much as we are here in Team Five O. We are very interested in your feedback on all of these concepts and we encourage you to post your feedback along with reasons for your arguments in each of the individual feedback threads linked with each section of this blog. We will be hard at work over the next few weeks coding refining designs responding to feedback and testing changes for wormholes and we cant wait to see how all you incredibly clever players find a way to pleasantly surprise us once again once Hyperion arrives on August th.As for the rest of the changes you should expect in the Hyperion release CCP Seagull will be posting a Coming in Hyperion blog soon with an overview and we will be continuing to release more dev blogs with all the juicy details in the coming days.Good hunting!CCP Fozzie,Eve,cjiidxn,15,t5_2qil9

1620877,1,t3_2cvrgt,Suppose they implemented it..For a player with auto renewFor a player wanting to continue to play EVE they would just roll over into the next month.For a player with the intention of cancelling their account they would be reminded of the end of cycle and then cancel their subscription and not roll over into a new month on accident which means CCP gets less money.Now suppose we have a player without an auto renewA player intending to continue would simply have to log in to the website and renew the account for another period and then log back into the game no harm done.A player intending to quit the game would be reminded of when the cycle is. Consider if they werent reminded they might simply forget when the cycle is and not be able to log in. They might have forgotten to transfer characters or assets and would have to subscribe for another cycle to transfer a character. I suppose assets ans isk could be transferred with the  hour plex grace period but CCP considers this abuse.Either way its a better money making decision for CCP to NOT remind the player.  CCP doesnt care about PLEX time because theyve already got the money for the PLEX.,Eve,cjjh6qs,2,t5_2qil9

Hauling ships have general limitations on how expensive stuff they can carry without excessive ganking risk.T haulers are paperthin and can be ganked cheaply so they should not be used to transport more than  million ISK worth of goods or you risk getting shot at by suicide gankers.If in doubt or if moving large percentage of your net worth use courier contracts. few million ISK and someone will move it for you or you get the collateral you set if they fail to deliver  which you can set higher than the worth of the goods. mil of stuff? Set collateral to  mil and you effectively profit if someone ganks the courier that moved it.Edit And no you cant really do anything to make the gankers life terrible. Anything you do will just make him happier as he is doing it for ISK and tear harvesting. He already got the ISK the loot that dropped and if you provide him tears thats a free bonus.

1641087,0,t3_2d3zuk,I made my first hundred bil running missions. By blitzing high isklp conversions before fuzzworks was a thing you could multibox about bilhr pretty easily if not more. I bought the LP of my corpmates at less than I was able to liquidate for too and that got me into the faction mod bulk sale business.I made my first trillion in the faction mod bulk sale business when I discovered West and Greying which abused a bug to make your faction mod contracts they werent on the market back then appear the cheapest while overpriced by  or  times their real value. It was a shitton of work but was satisfying.I made a few more trillion running FW missions back when CCP redid FW to make missions the most stupidly profitable thing ever. No bug or exploit I just learned the mechanics and took what I learned a few years earlier missioning in highsec into FW space. Optimised the routes multiboxed it and cashed out.Throughout this time I was pretty into the character bazaar. First flipping toons then training from scratch to sell. Its an awesome place to invest if you have too much isk to get a good  out of the regular ways because it can swallow a trillion isk of liquid capital in a few days while still rewarding active management with over  monthly yield. According to my spreadsheets that has yielded between one and two tril profit.Since then Ive mainly played dota but some plex investments and the like are keeping my net worth pretty high. And every now and then I still sit down for a session of multibox blitzing missions because when I looked deep inside myself I found that ultimately Im a huge carebear who just likes missioning. Its still not so much under a bilhr the way Im doing it.I started playing a loooong time after the t bpo lottery and never owned one never won the alliance tournament never stole a super I made my isk doing things which were open to anyone simply by taking the time to work out how the bits of eve come together and where the isk was.,Eve,cjm0v4v,6,t5_2qil9

1756086,0,t1_ck0i3xj,I worked behind the scenes in game development for a year. A year is more than long enough to understand that you people have NO idea what goes on in a developers head. Imagine your favorite dev working on the code for your ship. I assume you think that he gets to the office at nine works takes a lunch break around noon oneish. Then goes home to his wife around five or six. Maybe pulls a late nighter every once in a while.Thats not the case. Most game developers in the industry work between  hours a day every day. When it comes down to crunch time they sleep on the couches in the office because by the time they get home get a shower and get something eat they need to be back at the office in five hours. This lasts for years. Years of ulcers from their straight office coffee diet and chain smoked cigarettes. Years of being crucified whenever they change some asshole fans favorite broken item. Years of ignored silence when they send out a successful update. After a few years of this they realize they can pretty much code on autopilot. They just do what theyre told and scape through their job. Comments get shortened and then eventually get nixxed entirely as they realize that they wont get in trouble for it. Their bosses take it for granted that theyll always be there to work with their specific code so its not a big deal. Then one day WHAM. Economy tanks developers get laid off left and right. The much smaller company needs to take over what the huge company couldnt even handle and suddenly some old burned out veteran gets handed code that a barely less old burned out vet had been working on for years. Suddenly hes got to translate years of shitty comments on the code when hes lucky enough to get them in the first place.So let me tell you. You havent got a clue what CCP is doing and why its such a good fucking thing. Im not white knighting CCP because theyre CCP Im white knighting CCP because theyre doing to good and smart thing as a company working on their product. I would applaud them if they were a fucking cutlery company taking the time to make certain they were getting their product from a better source.Dont make assumptions based on my background. ,Eve,ck0igci,3,t5_2qil9

1758612,0,t1_ck0ivfo,So let me get this straight... you enjoy having more options being more capable and potentially depends on your setup being much more powerful than your opponents in a game and thats the problem of companies that develop games?Dont get me wrong I have nothing against multiboxers as long as they dont occupy the majority of the game. However you should take a look at your own motives first and ask yourself a couple of questions... Do you like playing games on easy? Do you like games where its relatively easy to outnumber or outpower your opponents whether its a PvE or PvP game and the main enjoyment in the game is the elegance of your performance? If you play RTS games do you tend to amass a much larger army than your opponent before launching an attack or do you keep attacking the opponent right from the start with just a handful of units? Whats more important to you early in a strategy based game great defense infrastructure or rushing to an advantage in offense? What would you prefer in a survival game an environment that is much stronger than you but gives bigger rewards in smaller quantities or an environment that is relatively easy to beat but providing a large amount of low value rewards which are still very useful but only in large quantities? Do you tend to use cheat codes that provide resources in a single player game? When playing puzzle games do you like them with a small amount of tactical moves that make you think before each move or do you like puzzle games that are mostly based on your speed and perception?Im not judging you or thinking that you play style is wrong but if your answers to above questions are Yes or Usually yes Yes Amass the army before launching the attack. Great defense infrastructure. Easy environment with lots of small value rewards. Yes or Yes during the replays. Speed and perceptionthan your play style is leaning towards multiboxing and there is nothing wrong with the design of games that you play.,Eve,ck0tw3q,3,t5_2qil9

1794358,0,t3_2f24u8,Mining is awful.  I trained mining skills for a month mining rocks out in space all by myself.  Trained mining skills so I could keep mining things while mining skills trained.  I wanted to get into a mining ship so I trained more mining skills.  All the meanwhile I just sat around in space scraping rocks.  I got bored and started training combat skills.I joined a newbiefriendly corporation look for wellestablished names like Brave Newbies and Eve University got in a rinkydinky little ship joined the first fleet I could and went chasing after bad guys.  Got killed almost instantly in the first engagement but the  minutes I spent in that fleet was the most exciting time I had had in Eve.  I ran to the first station I could blew half the money I made mining on another rinkydinky ship and rejoined the fun.Havent looked back.You can earn plenty of money doing missions or belt ratting with a good corporation and friends you can team up to do some of the harder missions and have protection in the more dangerous parts of space.  You dont have to mine for another second if you dont want to.In retrospect the main reason I got bored with mining is that I never learned anything.  I just went out scraped rocks sold rocks.  With combat there is so much to learn even bumping around in rinkadink frigates there is strategy involved.  You can learn something new every time you undock if you look for fights.Spend a month  training combat skills.  Go out make some friends and blow up ships.  And if you want to do mining or Planetary Interaction later great.  I have PI set up in a nearby system and Ill go out mining if I want to watch a movie or something.  Combat is where my fun is though  go out and find yours!,Eve,ck5btrh,1,t5_2qil9

1867085,0,t3_2fyox2,So here is the situation from an HONOR line member.  Aura was askedasked to takenot sure on that specific over HONOR IT when our previous IT resigned due to RL commitments burn out assorted other reasons.  HONOR then lost several members of leadership either to being tired of leadership and just wanting to PEWPEW or in some cases Aura himself. HERO coalition leadership told HONOR we needed to get all our SOV in a holding corp because various reasons including fewer people having access and bills and the like. A meeting was had with Aura and he was given time to transfer SOV. After stalling for a length of time a meeting was had between HONOR leadership and Aura and everything was ironed out and SOV would then be transferred in a timely manner.  days after that as shown in leaked logs Gav Aben and Aura had a meeting in which Aura reneged on his previous agreement to tranfer SOV stating he wouldnt transfer it until HONOR leadership was settled and did not even state what he would consider to be settled. Coalition leadership stepped in again and were in negotiations with Aura because at this point the veiled threat was if I dont get my way Ill drop SOV. After spending several hours in negotiations trying to get Aura to transfer even  or  systems as a show of good faith and that he did intend to transfer it once he was satisfied about leadership settling or whatever he cared about. After no agreement being reached and due to time spent already Lychton told Securitas to boot them and HERO will just retake the SOV. Following this BPA agreed to take IG into their alliance on conditions from Hero that Aura was not to be a part of BPA IG had to give back or reimburse HONOR for alliance moon goo that was never received by alliance logistics. BPA is already walking a thin line or outright breaking the agreement by telling Aura any alts he has in IG can that Hero does not know about can stay but that he cannot talk in voice comms. Also while HONOR IT he refused most times or gave and took back IT rights on whims when he was asked to share IT responsibility so no one person would have all the keys to the castle so to speak.

1933194,0,t1_cklxoyj,From my Perspective as someone who has flown and done Frigate PvP for the past  years I think Light Missiles have been powerful for a long time I dont think they will go away with a  DPS Nerf. I think a lot of people here are overreacting to this and kneejerk reacting because of the situation with the GilaWormIshtar being overpowered and unaddressed. I Understand the frustration with nerfing a weapon system because of what appears to be  ships abusing it. But honestly I would rather they adjust Light Missiles rather than cripple ships and prevent them from using alternative weapon systems either Crow Nerf makes Rocket Crow worse for no reason for example. Here is a breakdown of the changes of how I see them. Crow Its getting a th launcher losing the  Kinetic damage bonus and gaining an application bonus instead Its also losing a lowslot.The Crow will be able to fit MWD  x LML with  PG mods in the lows nanos and PG mods in the mids without any fitting mods or rigs although requires AWUIV. Will need a PG Rig if you plan on using a Damage Control or someother PG using module in the lowslot. It will be near impossible to get a Medium Shield extender on a Crow with x t LML unless you feel like going double MAPC and trading your speed or double PG rig and MAPC which is not recommended. The damage change means the Crow is no longer kinetic locked although its DPS with kinetic missiles is now lower. Overall  unbonused to  unbonused missiles is a  DPS buff but then taking away the  DPS loss from LML changes means the Crow is now doing  more DPS total And applying it a bit better with nonkinetic missiles. Compared to now the Crow will be doing  less DPS with Kinetic Missiles although bare in mind you now have an application bonus now too so the actual figures youll be seeing in game will probably be better than this. I think this is also a pretty decent buff the Rocket Crow its only losing  DPS with Kinetic Rockets but trading that for selectable damage type and the application bonus PG was never an issue on the Rocket Crow and youll be able to fit DCIIMAPC  mwdscramwebMSe  x Rocket II post patch.The Malediction change is something I disagree with. I dont think you should artificially restrict how a ship should be fitted by only applying a damage bonus to one version of a weapon system. I honestly didnt think the Malediction was that bad anyway it doesnt have a missile velocity bonus so its forced in a lot closer than the Crow is honestly the  DPS reduction on LMLs hould have been enough for the Malediction.The Heretic is getting a . DPS buff with the switch from ROF to Damage bonus but that coincedes with the  DPS to LML nerf. The heretic is getting some small buff to massagility so it will be a bit more mobile overall this means the LML Heretic will probably be in the same place as it is now very strong and the Rocket Heretic has actually had a pretty decent buff. The Flycatcher has gotten a massive buff.  Launcher on a ship which has a  damage bonus for Kinetic. Its also getting better fitting to take advantage of this although it will still be hard to do tanky LML fits Rocket fits will fit easier.  Its getting a . damage buff So overall . when combined with the LML nerfS. The Rocket Flycatcher is going to be so awesome. Im kind of disappointed that they didnt address some of the other ships like Condor Breacher Talwar Corax Kestrel Hookbill and the Hawk. Prehaps for another balance pass. I think these ships will still be competitive though and all these ships were already strong with Rocket fits so buffing the ships directly would give them a unneeded boost.  Hopefully WormGilaIshtar will have some serious changes And not just a ms speed reduction next time around Im sure a lot of the outrage here is because these  ships have remained in a broken state for a long time with just a minor slap on the wrist for the Ishtar while other ships get meaningful nerfs that hurt them much more.

1944463,0,t1_ckni8j0,gt Think about how many people ENJOY mining. Theres a lot of them believe me.In December of last year I joined BNI. I did pvp roams with them and had another character that ran with BOVRIL doing mining ops. Id say the ratio of PVP to miners was about... twenty to one. I could easily find myself in forty man one hundred man frig fleets out of Barl back then. Bovril? We were pushing five man fleets in procs and ventures in Brelly. Maybe ten if it was prime time. So thats my exposure to how quickly people will pick up mining. Which is why Im hesitant to think that enough people will pick that up in a hypothetical situation where we didnt have people multiboxing miners even if it meant a huge profit increase. Theres just so much out there to do besides mining.gtThe issue of multiboxing isnt as much as the issue if ISBoxer imho.What is the issue then. How is someone boxing  miners hurting the gameplay? Is it simply because you think it drives prices down thereby lowering the income incentive to mine in the first place? Because in my experience total anecdotal evidence here when I ran with miners the isk was the last thing we were thinking about. Sitting around on comms getting drunk and shooting rocks is incredibly relaxing. Sure we turned around and dumped it into industry but that from what I saw wasnt the primary motivator you know what I mean?The guys that run  bot fleets are running it for numbers pure and simple. Its not about the income per se its about making that little number tic up. Its a meta game and people are going to mine if theres botters or not. ,Eve,cknic5r,2,t5_2qil9

In this case they just took the most recent public example of people being disgusting human beings.Why create an example? So eve can try to shed its really shitty public image of being the Mos Eisley Cantina of MMOs and discourage people from acting like sadists in a video game. For EVE not to die at this point they need to fix public perception. A good start would be to stop EVE players publicly declaring how hilarious it is to treat other human beings like shit. Does it matter that whoever this guy is got unbanned? No. Nobody cares. CCP doesnt even care. As long as the banning was public CCP can quietly reinstate almost all except those they mentioned by name publicly the banned people later and the example is still understood. Groups have short memories.The dude who wrote that article needs to step back and look at what CCP wanted to achieve instead of thinking hes some kind of special snowflake that deserves attention. Any good business doesnt fuck with a customer that is making them profit unless the reason is to make more future profit.

So past contestants help to both advertise and legitimize the scam.I am reminded of an old essay written  years ago titled On Cooling the Mark Out Some Aspects of Adaptation to Failure Basically the idea of cooling the mark is to convince the mark usually to let them convince themselves that they werent swindled. Some examples of cooling the mark           From the ending of The Sting    The guy in the double breasted suit at the tellers window was the mark. In order to prevent him from getting his money back from the con the fake police raid happens.

2017772,0,t3_2htab4,HEROBRAVE Hopefully Effective Rookie Organization owns Sov in the southeast. HEROs foray into sovholding is propped up by NPL. HERO and PROVI provide a good buffer zone between CFC space and N space in the south. N does not have the benefit of anything like the BOTLORD accords that prevent PL and the CFC from attacking each others sov in the north so this buffer zone is desirable. Much more desirable than the Russian alliances that held the space during the Halloween war who were temporarily aligned with the CFC.          Now HEROBRAVE is not necessarily allied with NPL. There is fighting between the three alliances nearly everyday in terms of fleet skirmishes for fun. The only pretense of blue status that exists between the two is that N members are told not to disrupt HERO sov operations. HERO holds Sov at NPLs discretion  that much is clear. They are preferable to the alternatives. Also it would be a PR nightmare for the CFC to specifically target BRAVE because that would be frowned about by the entire community due to the fact that TEST there is bad blood between them and CFC would be fighting alongside BRAVE who are seen as adorable newbies. Opening up hostilities against TEST would provoke NPL to get invoked as a third party in a fight in their own backyard. Brrb v. would probably go a lot differently if fought in HERO space between the CFC and NPL.VFKIV is the CFC home in Nullsec politics the following systems will standout immediately VFKIV KSQS KK HIXH and VDTH.

If you want to get to providence staging system for example you could go to Yong first and set your clone there. Then you have  jumps in lowsec until you are in nullsec. Then you have probably two or three jumps with jumpbridges and maybe a few jumps until you are where you want to be. If you get podded you will end up  jumps from providence and can just try again.

2042196,0,t1_ckz8wj6,I disagree.  We have the meta we do because getting places in time is important because drones are an extremely good weapon system because nullification makes life easy and safe and because Ts are very comparable to battleships but much much faster.Supercap drops may be a small factor in why we dont use battleships but look at what PL brings when they want to fuck with us and arent using caps.  Ishtars and Ts are the fleets Ive seen over and over.  Theyre not choosing those because of fear of getting dropped but because they are a superior choice to BCBS hulls with the current balance of the game.Capitals will have two choices on the offense.  Jump in or take the gate in.  If they jump in they place themselves at a fatigue disadvantage vs the defender which can undock in a system or at least respond with a shorter jump.  As far as taking the gate jumping into hostiles is generally a disadvantageous position but the fact that caps are extremely slow to burn out of bubbles and cant MJD makes the disadvantage far greater.,Eve,ckzeppv,1,t5_2qil9

Stop thinking this.  You CANNOT take a heavy armor fleet and fight skirmishers.  It just doesnt work.  If the meta is skirmish caracals then mallers are a poor choice to fight them.

2239830,0,t1_cloizjl,I never said it was a valid public internet address but it is a valid IP.gtIm no wizard with regex but  is  digits. And therefore cant show up in an IP address except as a port. Presumably the expression matches up the rest of the sequence and just ignores the leading  part? Fixing that puts us back in spoof territory where you might add random garbage to an IP to mask it but is that really a problem we have around here? Seems like from what you are saying its really not. The unfortunate reality is that this sort of filtering is really damn hard and thats before you throw in crafty users.I am. P and it isnt a valid part of an IP but as in the example I pasted above it doesnt matter as the subsequent digits are one. Even with word boundary detection.I think we should drop the IP address detection from automod and let users report it. Theyre better at detecting them anyway.

What were trying to point out is that we can google this in  seconds literally so why would he be unable to do so?I am more than happy to help people out but if youre looking for help and you do not show an inkling of motivation to try and learn more before asking questions what reason do I have to really help you? Hes literally asking for the rundown that five seconds of googling under the term T Production EVE could tell him as well.Sure some subjects are more challenging and thats why his second question is a good onegt and how to actually do it since the update. If he had done research prior and he asked what changed about the whole process that wouldve been a nondiscussion point.In essenceI have no problem helping people out I like to do it.But I have no reason nor is it logic to help people who are not proactive.

Highsec incursions are one of those things some forms of wormhole jewing basically only the most highend sort like cap escalations another. FW kinda but its not as good as it used to be thankfully. Traditional oldschool methods like noncarrier nullsec ratting level s etc. are almost without exception complete garbage these days in proportion to the better methods.What they should IMO do is nerf the better methods to be in line with the worse methods and nothing else.

2416954,0,t3_2n5805,There are some good guides on youtube about trading. And almost everything else. Here are a few points. Your friends wont be of much help in providing security. Haulers are often killed in high sec by people who know what they are doing. They scan your cargo and calculate if you are worth the loss of their ships to kill. This is not griefing this is a cost of doing space business.Trading can be done either by buying and selling in a trade hub Jita Amarr Dodixie and to some extent Rens and Hek or By region trading which involves moving a lot of stuff or you can find an undeserved mission hub and be the guy that provides easy access to needed items for a price.Hauling can and probably should be contracted with reasonable collateral to a courier contract. There are also reputable space truckers like Red Frog. I was stupid once and lost a tech one hauler with several billion worth of faction items to a gank. HOWEVER Almost every corp that is any good has people that haul things and do needed logistics work like keeping the POS Player Owned Stations fueledMining is easy but takes dedication and the realization that miners are the low end of the food chain in eve.Manufacturing can be fun I buy my minerals on contract from miners and manufacture faction ships Navy Omen and Navy Augoror mostly from blueprints I get from Loyalty Points LP I earn in the game. I recommend you start with ammo because it moves fast and it is hard to not make at least a little profit.This is all my opinion.

2448168,0,t1_cme2mgi,Starlight appearing simultaneously across all systems in New Eden doesnt make much sense. Here are some very rough estimates of the power of this distant... eventLets assume the distant new star is roughly the apparent brightness as say Betelgeuse as seen from Earth. According to wolfram alpha the light intensity from Betelgeuse to Earth is .e watts per square meterUnfortunately the new star is not being observed as radiation propagating through space at light speed. It is being observed at many systems at the same time yet lightyears apart. An estimate of the new stars luminosity using traditional methods requires we know the distance to the new star and applying the inverse square law basically taking one energy flux measurement and integrating across a sphere. Ill use that old method since thats all I have.Note an energy balance of radiation across any unit volume requires radiation from this new star to also be absorbed by an unseen substance spacetime itself? Dark matter? Fairy dust? at every point in space. Otherwise the new starlight would rapidly grow in intensity at all points in space incinerating New Eden. So taking a wild guess that the new star is only visible in New Eden which I am guessing is  light years in diameter the amount of energy being dumped into New Eden via this new star is    .e Wmpi ly  .e wattsAnd somehow systems closest to the new star arent being incinerated and the farther systems are getting a boost to apparent luminosity. Somehow the nature of the event releases energy at superluminal speeds. And somehow the radiation is being constantly absorbed at every point in space to prevent the photons from the new star from piling up as they appear seemingly out of nowhere at every point in space. Also this assumption also happens to be a troubling point in physics how do you estimate the energy density in a volume of space WITHOUT normalizing dividing by infinityQuantum shenanigans aside assuming the new star is a point source located somewhere in New Eden the explosion is likely not a supernova Betelgeuse has a luminosity of e watts since the energy output is still within an order of magnitude of stars like Betelgeuse. If the light is very distant though then the luminosity of the event could be through the roof.The fact that the light is appearing in all systems simultaneously leads me to believe some fundamental property of all space across New Eden is being altered.Maybe the light will grow bigger and bigger with each patch until a dragon pops out and incinerates all of New Eden.

Thats all well and good Id love to be able to do that I would make a lot of easy or practically free money.What ails me is that although I would be able to do this others would be too. This would lead to wildly fluctuating prices due to more frequent artificial inflation on products.But the core of the matter is still the same the market is exactly that  a market.

2514901,0,t3_2og7ou,The reason people make alts is to gain access to capabilities that would be time prohibitive to gain access to on their mains or to support another character in a way that their main character could not provide to itself.  Examples  You have a combat character with  months of combat and tanking skills you absolutely need to fulfill your ambitions.  Yet you also want mine refine manufacture and trade to build some long term wealth.  Thats months of additional training that will delay your combat progress.  So you make an industry alt.  You train it to max industry mining production etc. skills then you use a PLEX to transfer it to your main account when its trained to where you want it.Another example is if you get your main to a point where you want to fly supercaps.  You cant dock up with them.  Once youre in them youre stuck.  Plus you need a way to move around without being too exposed.  That means using a cyno.  So you create a new character and train him to use cyno generators for your supercap pilot.  Once hes done you might train him to do something else but mostly hes used for a cyno. A cyno is a jump portal allowing a ship to jump several systems away without the use of a jump gate.,Eve,cmmu3fj,8,t5_2qil9

2543877,0,t3_2otrwg,So you have a bit of a complex question. First EVE is not at all pay to win.  Real money gives you time to train and investing more can be a big cash infusion that will buy you shinier ships.  The thing is though those shiny ships dont generally do you any good until you have the skills.  And by the time you have the advanced skills necessary to benefit the money you make will generally follow and that cash infusion is largely unnecessary. More money will NOT train you faster. It is entirely possible to play the game for free earning enough in game cash to translate into playtime extensions. Though it is generally NOT recommended that this be your goal for the first couple of months it can turn a beautiful game into something more tedious. As many others have pointed out it takes an hour or so to have enough skills to join a fleet and make a difference.  You wont be doing much if any damage in that time but you still play an important role.  If a ship can warp away it will unless YOU have it pointed. An enemy will cause a lot of damage unless YOU have them jammed up with EWAR.The bigger and shinier ships take time.  Sometimes a lot of time. In the trailer where they exclaim Is that a Titan!? the largest most expensive ship in the game to train into that ship is on the order of months.  And to fly it well not just adequately can take longer. I should also point out that I said bigger and shinier not best. There is no best ship in EVE.  There are ships more adept at some things but with the exception of the free noobship every ship has a useful situation.  The first frigate you fly continues to be useful no matter how many skill points you gain caveat it may not be useful to what you like doing but it will have its place.Just like any endeavor there is a learning curve as well.  In EVE that curve is particularly steep and some of the time required is time just spent learning the game.  Case in point the time it takes to command a fleet is small. Sure you can get skills that improve fleet performance and size but to actually do it is quick. But because of the steep learning curve you are unlikely to get many opportunities.  It requires much more knowledge and experience than skill training.Fundamentally though EVE is about players and their stories.  It is their exploits and plotting and epic kills and stupid losses and corps built and empires ruined and on and on.  Are you going to get a subscription and be famous and known through the cluster in a week?  No.  Can you make a difference to your corp mates and contribute to the story?  Absolutely.  EVE is like any good novel in the best ones the protagonist doesnt start as king. So find what you love get a sub and start cranking out chapters.,Eve,cmqme9f,3,t5_2qil9
2543906,0,t1_cmpvitv,I agree. Although an opt in system probably wouldnt work very well for live a hunch not much to base that off of keeping it on SiSi would have probably been best. However I still feel alright about this just because of the fact that CCP seem to be iterating pretty quickly. They seem to have taken it seriously enough that they are probably going to release a bunch of fixed stuff and it probably wont be everything when the next iteration happens.Best case scenario would have been for them to at least wait until they got everything under wraps but I feel this isnt too bad either. However if CCP dont fix a fair amount next Big patch. Theyll deserve scalding for it.,Eve,cmqmj5b,2,t5_2qil9

2566101,0,t3_2p4ymy,Not sure if any of this is helpful to anyone but I started typing things out and ended up with a blob of text... hope it isnt too hard to read and someone finds something useful out of it       If you are ever against a missile ship when in a turret based ship then keep at range will probably be better for you than orbit. This can also be true vs. other turret based ships keep an eye on how much damage you are doing and how much you are mitigating by keeping an orbit. An Interceptor is your best friend when it comes to moving around the Universe travel fit they get through systems in  seconds warp before people can activate modules and arent affected by bubbles.   By the time it has been announced in patch notes it is too late for market speculation.Learn how to PVP in frigates. They are cheap the combat is fast paced and completely unforgiving of mistakes. I skipped frigates for years when I finally started to use them and go out by myself in them I learned more about manual flying transversal and the more advanced PVP tactics in a few days than I did in all the time before that. They are also a whole heap of fun and the fastest way to get back in to a fight.Faction Warfare Lowsec space is some of the best space in game to go if youre looking for a quick fight in a Frigate. If you bring anything bigger than a Frigate then be prepared to lose it to a blob very quickly. DScan the automatic Camera is amazing for using to scan something down with your overview. Add Planets Belts etc to your Overview. Change the area to  degrees and range to as far as it will go click down the list of objects on your overview and when your camera settles after each one click Scan. Using the automatic camera and manually clicking on items in space to shift focus is a great way of doing this too narrowing the scan area from  down to  and finally pinpointing your target.Fix your Overview  Google Unfuck your overview or a recent thread was posted  I havent tried it myself but it may be worth looking in to Ignore local chat in Jita  nothing they say is true. Dont pick anything out of any cargo can just sitting on the Jita  Undock. Dont shoot that flashy guy sitting on the Undock or a Gate. Dont accept that Duel request.  of the people that do this are griefers and will have the odds stacked so far in their favour that you were dead the moment you thought Whats the worst that can happen?   There are a few which are just looking for a bit of fun and a fair fight unless you can tell between them I would err on the side of caution.Dont be afraid to lose ships or expensive modules. Ships are Ammo in EVE. The only use for a Killboard is to learn fits. Anyone who harps on about ISK Efficiency or shames you for a loss expensive or not is not worth listening to  if its the whole corp saying that then it may be time to move on. EVE is a game blobbing people and stacking the odds may be fun for some but they are missing out on so much if they refuse to do anything else.Dont fly what you cant afford to lose this does not mean that you need to have billion isk to fly a billion isk ship it means that if youre going to quit the game because it took you three years to get that much then fly something less expensive. It means fly what you are comfortable replacing or comfortable putting x hours of grinding in to replace.Try a bit of everything dont listen to people when they say that x or y is boring  general consensus may be that way but you may think otherwise.If youre getting in to this game heavily and want an alt then start training now not in three months when you really need it. Use a Buddy link from your main account to get a  day Trial for the alt if you then pay for a subscription you get the  days free plus either a PLEX or a month Game Time for your main. If you use a PLEX to subscribe your new alt then you will get a month game time for your main. Go to Account Management to get your Buddy Key and to redeem the plexgame time. Alternatively you can use the Power of Two special whenever that comes up its a much cheaper ? month subscription.Income   Ratting This is generally x amount per tick. It has a low upper limit and income is pretty consistant  an Ishtar in nullsec can expect mtick or mil an hour income with decent skills.   Exploration Relic and Data sites can be worth it you can make a good amount of money as a relatively new character. This fluctuates quite a lot by the amount and quality of the sites you find and also the random loot they drop.   Exploration DED  Combat sites are usually worth doing they have the chance to drop Faction and Deadspace loot along with Pirate ship BPCs which generally worth a lot. Income varies a lot and is almost entirely hinged on what the Overseer drops when they die. That could be nothing. Requires a well skilled character in general.  A few billion in a few hours and then  million over the next week of four hour days is not unheard of.   Faction Warfare This can make a lot of money both doing missions and sitting on buttons  it also enables a lot of fights which can be terrible if youre looking for safe income or great if you want a fight or two while making money.   Industry Extremely competitive you will want to read up heavily on this and really know what youre getting yourself in to before doing it if you want to make serious money.   Station Trading This is probably the highest potential income in EVE you sit in a station with a or multiple trading characters and you buy items at their low point and sell at their high point. The more starting capital you have the more you can make.   Other ways There are a lot of them Wormholes Mining Mission Running  LFactionPirateL Belt rattingofficer hunting POS Reactions Capital building Invention Scamming Hauling.

In highsec you will be dealing with bumpingsuicide ganking.  This would be the most likely time you would be able to help him because it wouldnt so much involve your skill levelcombat skills and more so about helping him with situational awareness. positioning counter bumping looking out for potential threats to be able to leave in timeBut these are not things that you need to necessarily be a combat character for.You would most likely only be putting your actual combat skills as far as helping him to shoot at rats. If you are in highsec killing them is very easy. As you get into more dangerous space the rats become more difficult and will require better combat skills.  Mining in lowsecnullsec introduces a whole different set of problems unreleated to the NPC rats as well.

2583680,0,t3_2pdrqv,. You should have stayed away. This is one time where your instincts were screaming at you and you wouldnt listen. Remember that.. EVE through Steam... dont do that.. If you still have the PLEX you got with the starter pack dont do a brain fart and put it into your cargo hold to take it somewhere else. That will introduce you to the concept of the kill mail in very short order. Dont count on CONCORD to defend that for you. Never put PLEX in the cargo hold. When you put PLEX into your cargo hold you have no more friends in EVE.. We are definitely going to look for an opportunity to shoot you in the face. Just count on that happening. But that doesnt mean we dont like you or anything its nothing personal it happens to everybody and you should fully expect it.. The only thing to do when not if your ship gets blown up is to get another ship and carry on.. Youve seen the merest glimpse of EVE. Youre looking at the first step of a steep cliff all the way up the learning curve. You will be amazed at how deep this particular rabbit hole goes.. Do not wait for EVE to happen. You make EVE happen. Thats the whole point of the place.. EVE is alot better than what I was expecting dont be a smart ass kid. We came in before there was such a thing as an Orca to ooze your way through a mining op. We had to cart our ore from the belt to the station on bare foot in the snow uphill and with wind in our faces both ways and we had to carry the ore in a wet paper bag. While being shot at. Better than what you were expecting? Sheesh! Do you want us to carry your bags for you?. Flying a ship and fitting a ship are two very different things. Just because you can move a ship some place does not mean you have the right skills to properly fit it. Never forget that. I can fly a Moros but I dont have the fitting skills for it so Im not going to bother to try and sit in one. Fly what you can fit properly. Youll be happy you did so..

2586812,0,t3_2pflun,for a low skillpoint low money and low experienced pilot i would say join a newbie friendly active faction warfare corp.there are faction warfare sites in some lowsec regions and they give huge amount of money and they can be done in a frigate worth less then a million isk.you may need some buddys to protect yourself from hostile players while runing those sites and some corp logistic to get stuff from highsec.but i would go so far and say that you can make  million isk in an hour with a cheap frig. in reality it will probably be much less because you will get involved in some pvp combat.there is also the option for exploration but i would not consider that a steady income. sometimes you spend  hours finding a relic or data site  andreturn home with nothing and sometimes you get  million isk in a few minutes.you kind of have to like that explorer thing to go for full exploration.if you want to stick with mining join a nullsec mining corp. they will provide you with logistics fleet bonus and protection from npc rats and the income should be much higher,Eve,cmw8fv1,1,t5_2qil9

There was no point feeding them more kills.Upon MY OWN RECOGNIZANCE with NO endorsement from OE leadership decided to put a stealth bomber alt into specter fleet to provide a warpin for a squad of bored OE people who had originally logged in hoping for a fight. We wernt teamed up with Shadow or anyone else. I doubt they would have answered if we had convoed them. Our only goal was to comedy whore on as many battleships as we could.Yes I am a prick but it was pretty hilarious and we denied SC much of a good fight and probably allowed a lot of Spectre fleet dudes to escape who otherwise would have died.,Eve,cn1sg2r,-3,t5_2qil9

2643098,0,t3_2q79ox,I suspect this is a troll BUTGeneralizing an entire alliances membership as anyone with a grudge against Goons and the old NC. Covers a rather large swathe of individualscorporationsalliances from the long history of EVE and really doesnt capture a group very well. There are balls loads of people who dont like Goonsold NC that lovehatedont care about NC. and. Is pretty disingenuous and really doesnt accurately represent NC. as an alliance. There are plenty of people in NC. who dont really care about Goonsold NC. Additionally our PL member corps have most definitely changed. A lot. And even if our member corps havent changed much relative to other alliances literally every single person in PL came from somewhere else in EVE from every alliance and coalition you can probably think of. A rather large portion were of at least moderate standing in their previous alliance. Even though it is largely left at the door everyone at some level brings their own personal perceptions bias ideas beliefs etc. and that gets mixed into the alliance. And that has brought and brings about lots of change even if its not at a corp level.While NC. may contain large parts of alliances PL has fought with over the years...so does PL. We have entire corps from the alliances youre listing out and as I said above we have tons and tons of people who were recruited from people we have fought. The idea of usefulness and more technically speaking Meritocracy is a core value of PL. For example in Waffles the PL trainingrecruiting corp the rate of your graduation is completely dependent on how useful you are. If you are a useful person or a facilitator of useful people in pretty much any alliance PL wants you and your corp history is largely looked past.For example weve recruited loads of some of the most useful people from Black Legion over the past year even though we actively fight with them very often. The risk of spies or whatever dislike is maintained is considered worth it considering the skill sets they bring to the table past being an F pusher.BASICALLY I think your first few points are completely wrong and Im not sure why you even needed them to attempt to justify your research which is all very true but largely independent of your aforementioned corphistory discussion.Im also a little upset with myself that I wrote so god damn much holy shit especially when everything I wrote can be boiled down to Its a game.

2850539,0,t1_cnrslmx,First off thanks for the answer but I have other questions especially since it seems there were changes to POS things right before I started playing EVE. Because of recent changes it seems like some info is a bit scattered and conflicting when I try my googlefu...so are racial standings for a highsec POS still a thing or no?reading some patch notes for crius updateI think it sounds like there is a stacking bonus for multiples of the same kind of assembly arrays for example having a couple of small ship assembly arrays with a couple of small advanced assembly arrays gets you a larger ME bonus am I interpreting this correctly? POS fuelI understand there is a ? reduction for fuel requirements in SOV systems what are the requirements for highsec? Just what it says on the BPOBPC? Plus the starbase charters?Sorry for the following wall of text but Im info hungry lol. This toons main focus has been on Mimnatar T ship and exploration module production for my main toon which is a  month old null sec explorer. She can also do Gallente T because I wanted to build Prospects but other than that I dont own any Gallente ship BPOs just the T component BPOs. Shes based out of Amarr but I buy the refined moon goo in Jita in bulkbetween  mil worth and ship it to Amarr. I currently turn out about a dozen each of Prospects Cheetahs and Hounds per week with some Huggins and Rapiers mixed in for good measure. She can also do Sleipnirs and Panthers but hasnt yet because of the relatively large amount of materials involved. Because of the bonuses I feel like I could produce more T BPCs and components if I did so in POS. I understand fuel costs are a consideration but I AFK mine about  blocks of ice per day while Im at work and my PI is geared towards the commodities needed to make fuel blocks not to mention I have fully researched BPOs for Amarrian and Mimmi fuel blocks. I can buy the charters with LP I earn for running Missions for the Amarr Navy so that eliminates that cost as well. Is this the type of scenario I should consider a Hisec POS for? I even have a tower and associated structures built from BPCs that I either found with my explorer or bought cheap on contract.TLDR is the bonus to production and invention a hisec POS provides worth the effort if costs to maintain it werent an issue?,Eve,cns3tjy,2,t5_2qil9

2852920,0,t1_cnr3ivx,As uxXxcockandballsxXx said its not possible to actually see who took what when from a regular corp hangar.That doesnt mean you dont still have tools to go spacedetective with and potentially catch your thief if theyve slipped up.First off its possible to see the contents of all corp members hangars in a station your corp has an office in  in the inventory index at the bottom of the corporate hangars tree is another branch for Member Hangars opening it lets you see each members hangar. This view shows both ship and item hangars combined together. If one members hangar just so happens to be full of items that match whats gone missing this is probably your thief. Note that you can only add items into members hangars like this you cannot take from them.Second if your corp requests API keys from its members then you can use this information  for example you could plug every members API into a program like jEVE Assets and search for missing items to see if members have the stolen loot in a nonoffice station or on an alt. You can also use programs like EVEMon to look through their transaction history  youre looking for wallet transactions that show items that have been stolen being sold or wallet journal entries that show player trading for  ISK this usually means the player was trading with their alt hence the lack of ISK exchange  innocent on its own but a red flag if youve never heard of their trade partner or if theyve sworn they only have  account. Also check the contract history both for completed and outstanding contracts  its not unheard of for people to hide stolen items in an item exchange issued to themselves or an alt where it wont be seen by the previously mentioned methods. Repeat all of these for any alts a player has even outofcorp. It should also go without saying that if previously collected APIs no longer work thats a red flag in itself if the player refuses to provide an update its likely they have something to hide.Finally theres also more basic detective work if you can establish a window when the items were stolen it will help narrow down who might have taken them if they were removed during a corp op who was in corp but not on the op? If they vanished after an op concluded who WAS on the op? When were the stolen items added to the hangar? Who would have known they were there?,Eve,cnsdlmv,1,t5_2qil9

2883842,0,t3_2t1osh,I had my first real pvp experience not too long agoIve been playing for a few months now. Mainly Ive been doing solo pve and training skills working on assault frigates atm cant wait. But Ive been wanting to try pvp for a while now. So since my corp is currently at war and my skills currently make my usefulness a tad limited in fw I decided to head out into the lawless regions of low sec. I fitted up a Kestrel with MWD and warp disruptor nothing in my inventory but rockets and a dream and began my journey.Eventually I came upon a nice system in Gallente space maybe . .. I went around to each station and took note of who was docked at each one then set up a bookmark from which to monitor the gates. A little while later dscan informed me that a very promising frigate just undocked from its hangar in station. My pulse quickened I immediately warped to k. Double checking my resists weapon ranges default orbit range I made sure I was ready for action the moment my ship hit the grid.AU .AU Km Km. And there it was. My prey sitting in space like a deer in the headlights seemingly unable to react to the danger in front of it. My heart leapt Oh Ive got you now you poor dumb bastard. I said entirely confident that I would soon be celebrating my first real kill in Eve. I turned on the MWD and smashed the orbit key as I deftly tapped control to initiate target lock. Soon my missiles would unleash a barrage of fiery spacehell down on my unkowing quarry smashing his ship to pieces and securing victory for my own.But then my heart sank. A message on the screen meant that something had gone wrong. No lock. We have no lock on the target hes jamming us! But... Wait a minute there was no icon indicating ewar effects on my hud. What the hell is going on? I thought Is this guy a gamedev or something?! Without a solid lock on my target my mission was doomed to failure. This reality began to sink in slowly as I circled my wouldbe opponent outside this rundown station out in the spaceboonies. The object of my agression at this point seemed to realize what was happening and as he wordlessly turned and meandered back into the station into safety I also suddenly realized what was happening as my eyes were drawn towards a smallish unobtrusive green button on the ship UI. I then took a moment to process all of what has just transpired as my Kestrel drifted lazily into the hull of the station bouncing off the side as though to symbolize the level of my ineptitude and the classic irony of my incredible noobishness after which I sighed calmly docked my ship and went to bed.TLDR First time I ever tried to blow someone up in low sec I forgot to turn the safety off. P I had a good laugh at myself the next day.,Eve,cnvw8p5,1,t5_2qil9

In addition it looks like these sites are spawning fairly far outside of the system they inhabit.

2904589,0,t3_2tdqcc,While newbros arent entirely right in saying theyre just fodder theyre not entirely wrong either.Consider this player A meets player B in space. Player A is a newbie with . million SP. Player B has  million SP and several  million SP alts accrued over the years. Player A flies the best ship he can fit and afford which aint much. Player B even if he is flying the same ship has significantly higher stats on that ship because everything from fitting to tank is lvl V. Further he has a virtually probeimmune T booster alt sitting in the system buffing him even more. But even without the booster alt its still a onesided tankandspank. At . mil SP theres nothing you can do its just numbers its mathematically impossible to win. Regardless of player skill at such a meeting player A will die to player B. Horribly. Now youd maybe be saying Well its v youre new and hes a vet you should lose. Not true. In most other MMOs beyond a certain point  week   months the newbie can easily take down a vet if he the player not the char is skilled enough. Further in FPSbased MMOs where its aim and movement that matters more than anything a day old char can take down a vet assuming weapons dont scale. Case in point Pirates of the Burning Sea as a lvl  day old but playing  hrs that day I took down a lvl  solo max lvl was . That was an MMO where player skill vastly overshadowed character level and skill.And that is why EVE is losing new players and that is why new players feel theyre just fodder. Because until you get to a certain point in your training months and months down the road you are not even a speedbump to a vet. Whats worse when you finally reach those perfect skills where your frigate is comparable to a vets and all your small modules and weapons and drones are trained to V do you know what happens then? He docks up and reships and comes out in a cruiser. And you go FUCK! because guess what? Your medium modules are not even lvl I yet and his are all lvl V and youre right back where you started. But you man up and you train mediums. He reships to a battleship and youre screwed yet again. Rinse repeat. And t his translates into literally years of training until youre on even footing.The simple answer to this problem is of course that the best ship is friendship. So bring friends if youre a newbie? Except this cuts both ways. What if he brings friends? And they all bring their boosting alts Logi alts etc? You still lose. Badly and all of the above still applies.Now Im not denying that a newbro CAN make a difference. They can tackle they can herotank blah blah. But the thing is doing those things you sill die more often than not. Years ago when on a new char I was playing FW in my shitty Atron I managed to lock and tackle a battlecruiser. I was the first and only to die. And then my fleet finished him off. But that my friend is the precise definition of fodder.TLDR  Youre not entirely wrong and newbros are not entirely wrong and nobody is totally right. Both points of view are valid. And since newbros point of view is valid and its what causes them to leave the game in great numbers perhaps the game needs to change if it ever wants to reach the end of that second decade alive. Just saying.P.P.S. Downvote away but it wont make this thing go away. With player retention at or below  just going through the same motion as weve been doing for the past decade and circlejerking isnt going to make the game magically get better. Consider this during Summer of Rage at its absolute lowest the weekly average was .k players. For the past year the average was .k and for the past  months it was .k. Think about that. We are approaching Summer of Rage numbers as the games business as usual numbers.,Eve,cny9a7h,0,t5_2qil9

Ever.Once you get chosen for ganking you dont have any choices except to hope that the gankers didnt bring enough ships. Particularly once you get bumped youre done. Even if you log off the gankers will typically bring in a throwaway alt in a noob ship to shoot at you and keep you PvP flagged and on grid.The only ship that Im aware of that has any preemptive or midganking defense is a jump freighter which can jump out to an emergency cyno if the JF pilot has been smart enough to set one up and the gankers lack the forethought to keep the target pointed at all times during the gank.This incidentally is why any CCP employee that talks about defending or escorting your freighters is unfortunately lacking in EVE experience. A highsec freighter with a web ship flock of logi and some Blackbirds along could and would still get ganked by TornadoThrasher alpha. Gankers routinely bring enough ships to pull this off. They would just retrain the necessary skills if escorting freighters ever became a thing. And the defense fleet would have no choice but to sit there and watch it happen. They could maybe avenge the loss... after the freighter blew up.,Eve,co6x2rr,2,t5_2qil9

Its been so long I cant tell you what to look for but if you look in the top CCPEVE directly for some recent files you might find them.   The only thing you are risking is having to perform a full install.  Id petition CCP at this point to see if they can identify some files that need ass whoopin.

Another way of looking at it would be I got to kill you got my fix of fun so here. Let me explain how you couldve avoided that and have a ship. Lets go have fun now. No one said anything about fighting back. We all know a new player who is eager to jump on a Battleship will have the worst time taking on even NPCs as he hulls up. Part of the teaching goes along those lines. The other part is situational awareness. For example say you were in a lowsec data site. It is just you in local. I jump in. You fail to notice I just jumped in. I scan you down and you fail to notice the probes. I warp to you and you fail to notice me on dscan. That is an easy minute or two which you couldve used to warp off cloak dock pull range from the warp in etc.Surviving does not always mean winning fights.Also I never said PVP is the main reason of the game. But Im glad you are starting to get the idea. You cant be shitfit if you are fit for a specific purpose within the role of that ship. A rifter with expanded cargo holds? That is stupid and therefore a shitfit. A Mastodon with inertia stabs and shield tank although could be better it has the sole purpose of going fast from A to B and being able to take a bit of punishment if need be.if it makes you happier or whatever then sure.

What the fuck is he supposed to do with that thing once he logs on knowing nobody having no friends not understanding what a titan is for how to use it who to use it with?PL had been tracking a guy who left EVE. They knew who his cyno alts were and where they were last seen. They see that someones selling a Ragnarok on EVE O boards. Its that guy. They spot his alts moving through systems. They know where he was the last time he logged off. Then the titan toon logs on and it lands on grid. PL was there poof. The guy in the titan was appreciative of the fact that he had been tracked for two years I aint even mad! just so they could get him. Its capers like that which ordinary gamers just dont understand. They dont know of any game where you would have this much of a lead time on a developing story where someone would be waiting and preparing for the exact right moment to strike.

This would have several implications.First it would mean Carolines Star was a very large superluminal smartbomb. There must have been an event near the Caroline Star where the aggressors needed to make absolutely sure even ships fleeing in warp bubbles were destroyed.Second if this Jovian cruiser weapon emits radiation at FTL speeds then any object within a solar system that can be scanned by combat scanners could be instantaneously lanced by energy from hundreds of AU away.

We ask you to fly all racial T cruisers  even if you havent trained for example medium sized T amarr guns you having Amarr cruiser V means that we can get you to train logi skills and have you be in an aug and in the future a guardian in fleets  a bomber  for our dunk blopsing fun  and a ceptor  for you to start off with scoutingtackling in low sec which imho is one of the most demanding jobs in EVE piloting wise . Waffles are low sec pirates and how could they not since we are the training corp for PL. We abide to a nomadic way of living which means that we do have our forever home in Kinakka Black Rise but half the time we are deployed wherever our glorious leader deems we stand a higher chance of farming content. In Waffles we log on with the sole purpose of learning more about the game AND teaching our newbros as much as we can in the same time. While you will find many MANY newbro friendly corps I can assure you that none of them are so focused in actually taking a little pile of shit that every newbro in EVE is and turning it into a lump of gold! We will literally put on the line EVERYTHING for you to get better by letting you take out fleets suicide tackling for you spending  days cloaked on a titan pos waiting for the next log session of some fucker scouting whs to find you targets and basically anything you can think of and its pvp related  even indirectly  we will do for you! We will love you... but the tough way. In Waffles you will not meet the there go and get blown up attitude that many newb friendly corps have. We will demand shit from you we will point out your mistakes in an aggressive way we will haze you to death for being such a baddie BUT we will make sure to include advice both theoretical AND practical on how to get better. If you genuinely want to get better at this game and you want to do it in a corp that does everything from solo to mid sized fights then I think its safe to say that SWIGG is THE way to go. We have NO SRP and we allow NO carebearing whatsoever on your waffles main. You will need to have a nice way to generate ISK  be it via selling PLEX nopoorsallowed or by any of the broken isk generating activities this game has to offer . Thats for starters. If what I said interests you in the slightest come talk to us in the JOIN SNIGGWAFFE chat in game to find more about what we want from you and how you can join us.Whatever you choose to do fly dangerously. It is refreshing seeing newbros being interested in proper pew pew than how efficient they can be afk ratting in null sec. Also fuck null sec!o,Eve,coguk6y,1,t5_2qil9

When I signed up I wasnt particularly pleased with the artistic styling since I found it bland and too similar. Every ship is coloured in the same style as designated by the in game manufacturer which is fine but I would really like to be given the ability to colour my ships and differentiate myself from Tengu ABC on a fleet. I think it could only add to the universe and make it more interesting. Skins are not the answer because I dont want a skin that looks like anyone elses I want to be able to make my ships unique or when Im flying in my alliances fleet I want to be able to fly our colours.Contrary to your opinion I think by allowing customization you can only add to the EVE Universe because it gives players more tools to enrich the environment.  ,Eve,cona3dh,2,t5_2qil9

Someone who actually enjoys playing the PvE game?What you are describing are three separate people.People who like challenges do not partake in most PvE activities in EVE since they are very repetitive and provide a poor training ground for all but the most basic of PvP principles. People who like challenges also are not pussies and do not fly overpowered ships just whatever ship will give them the best chance with their current skill level to overcome their challenge. Because outside of a challenge run ala speedrunning why would you legitimately handicap yourself and claim you are being competitive?Someone who isnt a pussy and blitzes sites in their T does not like to be challenged since challenge reduces ISKhr. Arguably few of these people enjoy playing the PvE game as you put it because of the aforementioned repetitiveness.

3188384,0,t3_2wnk9b,There is a person or two on that list that are not completely horrible. The problem is I dont know about you but others are in my opinion bad candidates despite some having some good ideas due to being heavily biased to their favorite game play mechanics doctrines and general idea about eve.  And that makes them worse than having horrible ideas. It will most likely be impossible to find a truly no biased CSM but there are some good candidates who forum posts are not a long list of im to incompetent to deal with something so I will petition CCP to fix it in my favor..   And then there are people who just down right have no solid platform or have a platform so stupid one has to ask them selves have they ever even logged into the game.    From the list of candidates    Alyxporturgt Has an OK platform nothing to impressive but does not show a heavily biased history on forums or interview. Tho he has stated that he thinks cloaking needs to be addressed along with cloaky camping and any candidate that makes that  statement is off my list right away because cloaking and cloaky camping are mechanics that CCP did pitch perfect and are  perfectly fair to all parties involved and thus pushing for a change means you would destroy a completely valid and fair  game mechanic which puts in question everything else.    Ariete  gt Seems a pretty decent candidate. His platform is somewhat short in terms that he just explained generally what he would like to see and push for but. From his posting history he does not seem to be heavily biased towards any subject or entity however seems to lack full understanding about some . topics but good candidate overall.    Bobmon  gt Looks like a pretty decent candidate platform wise. Red flag for me with his was a point on his platform showing interest in PVP only characters to me this would be a useless mechanic that makes no point in an open PVP environment. In a game like Guild Wars with PVP environment separated sure in EVE it seems a colossal waste of dev time with little to no benefits. That point aside he had a good deal of valid points on his platform so while due to point above he would not be my candidate of choice he certainly is a good candidate.  corbexx  gt I actually really like him as a candidate. He has a good history does not seem very biased to some subject and seems open for discussion. He seems to be WH focused and not so much on .LSHS and that is actually good he has some valid points about environment outside WH and unlike a some other people form WH space does not seem to hate ls.hs. WH wise and the fact that he seems rational he would be on my list of candidates.  Gorski Car  gt He seems a little biased to some subjects but from his forum posts and reddit posts you can get that he is a pretty rational person open to discussion. He has and had pretty good ideas and seems to know what he is talking about you can judge for your self by looking at uGorskiCar . Hes not the shining candidate but hes on the list of the pretty decent candidates.  Out of all candidates these are the only ones I would put on the list a nottomuch biased with pretty decent idea about how to do things.  The thing is there are few other candidates that are actually pretty good and within their own gameplay environment have pretty good ideas but are just to heavily biased against things they are not part of.  And the reason I am against such candidates is because they are part of the process of hindering valid mechanics and ships simply out of spite because they dont like it or are to incompetent to deal with them.  Because of people like this we have had Drake nerfed despite it being a fragile turd of a ship that was able to be countered by pretty much every other ship in the game these people disliked the ship and pushed to have it nerfed simply out of spite on top of all that followed horrible Missile mechanics and nerfs after that came horrible warp speed changes and non of them spoke up and so many other things.  Because biased people are what keeps us trapped in  year updated cycle where we first try to balance something but end up nerfing it into uselessness and than  years later we realized what we did we did out of spite and made the thing useless so we try to balance it again and we make it incredibly OP again which just resets the circle.  ,Eve,cosh5ai,7,t5_2qil9

On the other hand I would actually be able to play the game please do something about learning implants too. The fundamental way the game is played changes and its because of me. Id be okay with that.As it is the soft limit of k bookmarks for a character and perhaps even the very recent change of not being able to stationtrade more than  items at a time might have been in response to this business venture.So if CCP opts to make a change that would render my business defunct in the way they did with WTZ I can remain happy at the fact that my action permanently changed how warp tactics are put to use.

To prevent this hauling goods in a ship with a lot of health or tank is a good idea. In an Iteron which has much lower tank it would only take a few ships to kill you and take your stuff.To be safe in High Sec you need to make yourself a harder target by having a tanky ship not hauling in excess PLEX for example and not autopiloting as this will put you a few kilometers further than usual jumping from each stargaze and will scream to the observant players Hello Im not paying any attention and Im safe because the pretty music of high security space is playing please shoot me and take my things.,Eve,cpcq00v,1,t5_2qil9

You may potentially be able to get in to Fountain via wormhole though this would be difficult to do unless one opens up to Thera making it much easier to find and unless you get really lucky and it drops in to a system with an active battle youre likely going to die horribly at the bubble camps that will be up on the way to the battle as people will shoot everyone thats not blue to them.  And the bubbles will likely be on the gate themselves and youll have some distance youll have to slowboat in to get to the gate or youll have to slowboat out of the bubble to warp off.  In both cases youll probably die  your Algos will likely get scrammed before it can get out of a bubble and aligned out to warp and it likely wont have the speed or EHP to make it through the gate camp to the other side.  Which also is probably camped and bubbled so youre going to die horribly in the attempt to get away from that one unless you can crash the gate which leads you back to the people you just ran from,Eve,cpi4om5,5,t5_2qil9

3435606,0,t1_cpjv9xy,Id say its highly likely that SC will beat Valkyrie to release. Mainly because they had several years headstart they began in  and Valkyrie in  I think? And its not even debatable that Elite already has. In fact featurewise Id say Elite is at least a match for Valkyrie already and theyre working on more. Including drumroll please a socialavatar portion though theres no ETA on that one yet. Both are shaping up to be much broader and deeper than Valkyrie by itself.And while yes its not blackandwhite thisorthat gamers are getting older. That means less time to fuck around. Just speaking for myself I play less hours per week now and buy fewer games now. Which is ironic since I can afford many more games now than I could  years ago. I just dont have the time. And that means that given  titles that are awfully similar most people will flock to the strongest title and others will die off go FP whatever. Its the same reason WoW is still king  its the strongest most featurecomplete fantasy MMO out there still. Nothing that came out since then can come even close. So people tend to stick to what they know. Oh sure when Elder Scrolls Online and Wildstar came out there were dents in WoWs subs but they came back. I see no reason why Valkyrie wont suffer the same fate as ESO did its already down to BP from PP and probably FP soon.,Eve,cpjvuvd,-1,t5_2qil9

My Level  mission running progressed fromTempest Maelstrom Machariel.Tempest  So long ago I dont remember how it did but not great if I recall correctly.Maelstrom  Fit between mm arties and mm autos based on spawning distance drones to take care of the frigs that got close.  Tanked like a boss.  Medium pimpage encouraged to get the best out of it cheaper than you think these daysMachariel  On paper it looks like a chainsaw balancing on a toothpick statue... ITll bounce around a lot destroying anything it comes in contact with but appears so fragile that youre worried about the slightest wiff destroying it.  But heres the secret... You dont need more than ms ms if you have balls cap with the shield booster.  Fitting it with mm autos t please do the ship justice and  or  RF gyros... youll easily put out near  dps at meatgrinding distance.  Having  full flights of drones help too to take care of the small stuff.

3474851,0,t1_cpnw614,I said the most important thing not the only factor that matters. Use common sense. If you ignore the need for range speed alpha tracking etc. then youll end up with a ship that doesnt work for missions.T cruisers need to be well tanked because they dont have much of an ehp advantage. Sometimes you can find yourself in a situation where youve warped right on top of a big group of fairly tough NPCs. It doesnt happen often but you cant predict when it will and when it does your tank will save your ship. It will give you time to get to range while reducing their numbers to reduce the incoming dps.Cap stable might sound overtanked but experience flying T cruisers in lvl  will make you realise that its not. Having  minutes of cap with the repper running would be enough most the time. But what if one day you need a bit more than  minutes? Or what if youve had to overheat your repper and your guns and now youre starting to cap yourself out and realise you need to warp? What if that means you dont have enough cap to warp? The answer is you lose your ship because you thought cap stable was overtanked. Now youre about  million isk down and having to waste time reshipping.,Eve,cpocwzj,-1,t5_2qil9

Without genos you cant get the TE on there and most people instead opt for a second nano or overdrive injector or they forgo the anci rep or leave themselves with a crappy meta disruptor. In all cases they lose vs the slicer thats over on CPU.Why not just buy a  cpu implant? Because then you have to rip it out when you want to fly something thats over on power grid. Or in the case of this retribution you cant fly it at all without genos.Because I have genos I get to fly around in k ehp frigates without stupidly expensive slave sets or investing  days m isk and a further m a month on a link alt.I can also fly fucking insane confessors like this one with my genos in.They are the most versatile two little implants in the game.

Makes for juicier wspace KMs.With that your  pod would be  faster than your naked pod which isnt a huge deal and wouldnt be at all affected by changing into various skill categories.I guess then again if youre making all base attributes the same theres no reason for training times to vary based on attributes either at which point you might as well convert all learning implants into acrosstheboard versions.Or maybe just eliminate them as was said.

3538603,0,t1_cpvk18s,I dont want to insult you or anything but the skill requirement to play is really low.I am not sure you have actually played a game that requires player skill in it. But lets see If it is so skill intensive in tactics and positioning why there is no indicator showing the direction of the opponent ship? Eve is essentially a submarine simulator with much better vision try playing silent hunter  to get a feel for what reasonable combat mechanics look. The only skill based part of the game that requires some effort is based on the angular speed idea. There is no skill anywhere else in this game. Theres a reason that the most highlyskilled solo pilots can take on two or three opponents get one or more kills and survive and its not having some amazing ship overpowered modules or unattainable skills. You can nearly max out your skills for combat in any particular ship type in six months or so. You mean a pvp fit ship killing pve fit ships? Please prove me wrong but I have not yet seen anywhere in Eve  v X engaging with the same fit ships because its skill based not simply flying a better fit ship so we want the ship difference to be identical and  winning versus X players.RTS games like Starcraft dont require aiming but have an exceptionally high skill cap for many of the same reasons tactics positioning and reacting quickly and appropriately to a complex and changing combat situation are where the challenge is.SC has a strategy in it which is based on macro management does not exist in EVE and micro management of usage of skills do not exist in Eve and positioning of different units you have one unit. You cant compare a single unit game with a strategy game.... Eve is more like a slot machine while SC is more like poker.Edit as  highlighted fitting the ship can be considered part of macro management in a slight sense.,Eve,cpvmg32,-4,t5_2qil9

3568537,0,t1_cpz0huk,I agree completely. If ewar allows someone who doesnt control grid to stall capture indefinatly by suiciding lowstake ships like griffins then its not working as intended. Now maybe it wont work out like that. Wouldnt defenders be able to blap small numbers of griffins before they can jam? Im assuming an entosis ship would fit sensor strength so it would take a prohibitive number of ships to jam it. They could also bubble the gatestation where the griffins are coming from to prevent them from entering grid. Alternatively they could deploy a marauder and laugh at the griffins but then again forcing the use of a specific ship class for entosis because of ECM is uncool.,Eve,cpz1gqr,3,t5_2qil9

3577927,0,t1_cpzhjsc,The Dunning Kruger effect is what the article is poorly explaining. It is one cognitive bias out of many. All cognitive bias are studied within the field of psychology because they are large source of what people use to rationalize their understanding of the world opposite to fact.The Dunning Kruger effect is well known. Here is the actual paper that initially introduces it. The Dunning Kruger Wikipedia page has some tldr oriented information and further cited sources see bottom citations for the curious. If I had to suggest only two sets of things someone should read to improve themselves logically it would be to study the types of cognitive bias and logical fallacies To take this to human organization issues I would the suggest a follow up with evidencefact based management as management of human processes is generally rifled with bias.To sum this up with my own personal anecdotal experiences as part of my realworld professional job I perform scientificengineering based interviews. In those interviews we check both for personalityteam and abilitiesskill fit. Prior to the interview we have a selfassessment form where we have interviewees rate themselves on the topics they will be interviewed for on a scale from .

3659389,0,t1_cq9cacx,You kind of have to be really old to remember this but there used to be a ton of hype for WIS. There was always an active thread asking when it would be ready and suggesting features they could add. Then it finally gets released and its halfbaked and doesnt even allow player interaction and the NEX store stuff is considered overpriced...This is admittedly third hand info. But a guy I know talked to one of the devs at a meetup about it and the whole Summer of Rage thing has apparently turned the entire thing into a do not touch area for CCP. Theyre still releasing new clothing I think but theyve either been keeping a huge lid on WIS development or theres nothing happening there and I know there are people at CCP who want to develop it further,Eve,cq9e9di,3,t5_2qil9

Psychiatrist and Harvard University professor Chester M. Pierce coined the word microaggression in  to describe insults and dismissals he said he had regularly witnessed nonblack Americans inflict on African Americans     In  MIT economist Mary Rowe extended the term to include similar aggressions directed at women eventually the term came to encompass the casual degradation of any socially marginalized group such as poor people disabled people and sexual minorities. citation neededgtInteresting Microinequity | Racialism | Microaggressions in the classroom | Discrimination Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcqay oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecqay.

Move the bubbles every time you scan the new static and reduce the hole to crit if you have the manpower.  A crit hole is far better for you than an unscanned new static.  ,Eve,cqek9mj,1,t5_2qil9

I dont think its nearly as bad as the Worm though which belongs in the Cancer Tier for being a ship without any weaknesses a MSE kite Tristan will actually die to a brawling combat ship if it gets caught early enough a neut tristan can be kited and killed outside the neut range by a KestrelBeam Tormentor etc. A Worm with MSEDC CDFEs kills a blaster fit comet at m while still being able to kite at km.   ,Eve,cqn3o15,2,t5_2qil9

3809962,0,t1_cqq9bo2,I dont think ECM is nearly as dominating as it was since we Did Myrmirooks RIP never forget Gobbins. The Tiericide changes have seen big boosts to sensor strengths across various class of ships notably CS and HACs are much harder to jam out now. There are also a lot more viable racial ship types for different Archetypes now AmarrGallente Rush teams are actually decent now etc. The Ganglink changes have made it so Sensor Integrity is much more commonplace thanks to the fact that it boosts lock range which also helps with damps hybridmindlinks and less of the bonus being invested into the mindlink makes SI a consideration even on an offspec Claymore for example.  More CS being viable also helps before Sleipnir was basically the only one that actually mattered.There are also much more viable Drone ships. I think limiting Sentrys to T would take away a lot of their strengths and allin potential. While still allowing Sentry comps to be a thing.

I cannot afford to donate much with real money but PLEX  Good allows me to donate silly amounts of virtual currency so as long as CCP dont profit of it which they dont then I am happy  I believe there was something last time about CCP having to pay tax on something related to it but they pay that out of their pocket.

Go in to fitting in the ship with the skin license you want make sure the skin is NOT applied. Now with the fitting window open switch into the ship you want skinned and activate the skin in the moment of lag before the fitting window updates. Takes a few tries. ,Eve,cqvd7m7,2,t5_2qil9

Players can murder the hell out of a week old player in hi sec and scam them for every cent they are worth or take them under their wing and teach them the joys of the game. Clearly picking the color you want for your space ship that no one can see  of the time its in space is just to much freedom for a sandbox game.

3939536,0,t1_cr5a9r1,Ah okay gotcha that certainly clarifies it for me.But how do you deal with the total lack of bonuses to relicdata virus strength that a noob ship has? Doesnt that just make running a ghost site with one a bit pointless if the odds of success are so really really low given how hard some of the sites are?Wouldnt jumping into one of the T Exploration Frigates Heron Imicus Magnate Probe andor using a set of the cheapest scanninganalyser implants be of greater benefit in this scenario? Or is that just throwing ISK at a near futile improbability so just going with the noob ship is the lowest rISK exposure.Im not a new player but have been out of the game for almost yrs so for all intents amp purposes I may as well be in some respects as so much has changed since RL got in the way. I just wish Id kept up the subs for the account to keep the skill queue going as I couldve had so many lvl skills done amp dusted in that time.

Pulled my probes and started warping to the hole but the internet was not on my side as I failed to land on the hole and got Socket Closed. Much nailbiting ensued.SIX HOURS later my internet finally came back and I was warped back to my safe spot. I cloaked up and decided to go home instead of Null. warped to my exit hole and... whats this? it wasnt there. it was gone. poof. nada.I warped to the Nullsec wormhole knowing Id rather be exploring Null than Wspace and landed right on top of a Rook and a Tornado... collapsing the hole. I jumped through as fast as I could and the rook followed me but my little orange Imicus was too fast for him to lock and the anom. promptly closed behind meThe wormhole dumped me in Fountain which wasnt optimal. but after ish jumps and several reroutes and gate crashes to avoid bubbles and dictors I made it home to my lowsec staging system several million ISK richer than I was before.,Eve,cr6jlmp,8,t5_2qil9

Try to meta the neuts and cap booster and see how it looks.  If i recall correctly the ancillary armor reppers use low powergrid comparied to the deadspaceT so that should probably stay.  You can try a nanopump instead of an egress port maximizer if youd like a little more tank vs cap.  and if you want more kite put a nano instead of the EANM and maybe keep the egress rig.  The way the fit is on the killmail handles cap pretty well.  You can keep it all going for a while with the  neuts on and mwd for a bit.  Most frigate fights dont last that long but i want the ability to hold a cruiser without capping myself with the neuts for a while.

You grind and make isk and thats it  I just never thought this had to be changed.But if you really want the missions to have an effect on the game world... you could make it so that once players do enough missions in a system its security rating increases. Conversely also make it so that the security rating of systems near lowsecwithin say  jumps naturally decays every day. Since security rating noticeably affects mission payout that would have important consequences for the mission runners.You could even take it one step further by also restricting mission levels based on system securityi.e. . and .  only level  missions available . and below  level  and  missions available . and below  level   and  missions available etc. and therefore creating a dynamic system of supply and demand for mission running which would force players to actually move their ass and go where the missions are not just sit in Osmon sucking on that SoE LP tit.Also imagine the tears.

4029229,0,t3_36nrjl,Off the top of my head some quick things you can do each night Missioning though you burnt out on that. Mining high burnout risk. Segues into gas harvesting the ninja variety of which can be both entertaining and profitable. Salvaging either of the legitimate a la Pro Synergy corp or ninja variety. I highly recommend the latter. ExplorationCombat exploration inconsistent but highly profitable. TradingIndustry setupandrun ops like youve already described though highlevel trading might necessitate a bit of micromanagement. Lowsec PvP usually busy. No hourslong roams and structure grinds like you often find in null. FW stands out. Contract hauling.Most of these can be done solo or in a group. Trick is finding the right group. Eve boils down to either resource acquisition or resource expenditure. The latter involves PvP. The former involves a number of basic activities and their advanced or emergent variants some of which Ive described above. You will get bored of acquiring ISK eventually so if you have any chance of sticking with Eve youre gonna want to develop a taste for PvP of either the market or combat varieties.

4085402,0,t3_37d7qs,Heres what I think youd be doing in Brave.Setting up a lot of IT stuff first. Its a chore but once its set up it works pretty well.You then get instant message pings if theres a fleet up. The fleets try to be newbie friendly but are sometimes fairly serious business. You can type questions in the chat but it wont always be good to ask on voice if were in the middle of fighting. You can ask using a special voice comms key called a whisper key that lets you talk to the line members without disturbing the FCs while theyre doing superserious stuff and thats a good method.There are also class fleets called dojo. These are lessons usually in space about a specific part of the game.Many of our roams are more laid back. Some of us FCs actively seek out newbies and persuade them to step up and do things  I sent one of my guys in alone to get his first solo kill earlier. He won  just as well Id have been a bit ashamed if Id sent him to a horrible lonely spacedeath.Brave is a lot more chatty and chaotic than the other similar alliances. Personally I love that particularly our crazy home defence fleets but some people find it a bit overwhelming. Still that and everything actually is completely optional.Brave also has much busier and more dramatic subreddit  you can look at it and see if thats the sort of thing you want to get involved in. For personal iskmaking either mine in a Venture explore in a frigate with core probes or do some ratting with a Vexor Navy Issue and drones. You might want to do one of the others to get the isk for your Vexor. You should prioritise personal wealthmaking to start with so youre at least stable. Eve is a much better game when youre not flat broke.Your best bet might be pick one give it a week try another one for a week then another. Theres a very different feel and culture to them and what suits one person may not suit another.If you do give Brave a try we run regular newbie collecting fleets so ask about that and youll get escorted to where we live.,Eve,crlym4u,1,t5_2qil9

Then Im not talking about  scaling it sorta works there but about the  setting.

However it may not be so bad with a modded overview like the Sarashawa one and it might actually be a bit more intuitive once people get used to it as right now its a pretty radical departure from what we are all used to.As I said Im not praising the new icons nor am I bashing them these are just idle thoughts on the matter currently and Ill probably have a bit more of a polarized opinion regarding them once Ive tried them out.,Eve,crtd2fl,1,t5_2qil9

Maybe some fights after fozziesov hits but fuckall of that grinding shit right now and frankly entosis mods are just going to bring the gudfights to Karmafleet space anyway. Theyre not doing anything like grinding structures grinding some rats maybe for that fat loot right now and its GSF so its not like you absolutely have to do that stuff anyway  especially not if youre a newbie and dont know what the fuck yet. Theres spots for all of the people he mentioned in Karmafleet frankly with minimal BS. GSF lets you do what you want to do. Yeah you wanna click those paps to rep your corp whenever you can but theres paps given out for all sorts of ops  not just pvp and not just sov stuff which like I already said is drastically changing anyway and might be actually fun well see. Anyway dont misrepresent. Pandemic Horde is cool and has its benefits Karmafleet is cool and has its benefits and BNIBrave is cool too for their own reasons. I could break down the differences and the benefits of each but I think the OP needs to do a little research read lurk and kind of figure out the lay of the land. The three are VERY different. All have benefits and drawbacks. I have an opinion on it but it doesnt matter what I think  its what the OP and his friends want. All three offer mining PVP and PVE. Though I will say that since PH isnt really mining focused they might not have dedicated mining operations and logistics in place could be wrong on this also BNI is having fun in fountain but theyre getting fights there and mining might not be an option sometimes if theres shenanigans afoot.

4183618,0,t3_38qlgk,Youre conflating a couple of different things here. Outposts are alliancelevel stationlike structures that can only be built in nullsec one per system by the sovholding alliance. Minmatar outposts can be upgraded to have the best base reprocessing yield in the game .. Since you just have a solo corp put this out of your mind.Starbases POS for short on the other hand are corporationlevel assets anchored around moons. These can have reprocessing arrays anchored near them. There are two versions the regular Reprocessing Array which is anchorable everywhere and has . base reprocessing yield and the Intensive Reprocessing Array anchorable anywhere outside highsec with . base yield. Stations which are NPC controlled have at best . base yield and depending on your standings have taxes also so a POS will always give better yield than reprocessing in a station.However the bigger benefit of a POS for a miner is the ability to use a Compression Array. Depending on what your local market is doing compressed ore typically commands a substantial premium over both ore and minerals and that alone should make a POS economically worthwhile for a regular miner. Any manufacturing or research that you end up doing at the POS will be a bonus.,Eve,crx4w0a,2,t5_2qil9

4242750,0,t1_cs3lcdc,Yeah pretty much agreed . It used to be really useful to have bookmarks on gates because you could get warpins on things that were otherwise fairly inaccessible. Then combat probing gets made so easy that anyone could do it as well as fleet concepts being able to do DPS out to near warpable range making the range of being safe from being warped to and still not getting wrecked shrink to being very very small. Its really the combination of those two together thats problematic.So they fix.... fleet warping. Right. Things IMO that could possibly work much much better than this  Making the minimum warpable distance go up to km or so maybe even km. This also gives some rather nice room for things like dictors to be able to position and drop bubbles that deny warpins without being nearly on top of a hostile fleet. Making this work for combat probes but not bookmarks. Itd be relatively straightforward to disallow bookmarking probed ships but still allowing bookmarking of probed structures signatures and  other objects which would remove the loophole.This would still give benefits to someone who spent the time to go make a bunch of ping bookmarks on a particular grid without being oppressive. Or you just have one interceptor bro making corp bookmarks on grid which  minutes later you can think about how to use and if theyre in the correct spot... that sounds a bit more tactical.,Eve,cs3v51k,3,t5_2qil9

4275861,0,t3_39yb8x,First off I am not saying that links are in a good spotBUTmn Phantasms are feature fits that are very hard to pilot efficiently. With links and snakes they can reach ks but are basically useless to do anything else but to fly in a straight line and its very hard to project decent amounts of damage to actually kill stuff if your target does not want to get killed. You fought a linked feature fitted lone but linked Phantasm. Same goes for the Oracle. To reach k he must have had an mn MWD and its pretty impossible to actually hold stuff down to kill it. You got unlucky to not get your transversal up in time but shit happens Edit If this guy did what i think he was doing he didnt even use links and actually came up with a pretty neat idea. This guy obviously knew what he was doing. Chances are if he would have just used a proper kiting ship without links there would have been a lot more casualties on your side. I get what you are saying. But in this case you basically died didnt catch the guy because he suprised you. Also these feature fits are a pretty rare sight for the sole reason that they are actually not very good at killing stuff at all. ,Eve,cs7lw6c,4,t5_2qil9

Figure out what you like and you can be just as capable as anyone.  And personal skill is way more important than skill points.  There are shit tons metric of course of resources and the community is worlds better than what your used to in wow.  The community will shit post all over each other but really at the end of the day sticks together pretty well.  For random learning check out Eve Unis wiki at   There is so much info there you will give yourself headaches in a good way.  The Class Library section on the left side bar is good to.  Check out in no particular order EveUni Brave Newbies Pandemic Horde and Karmafleet for some great organizations that love new players and will hook you up.  ,Eve,cs9lno8,1,t5_2qil9
4293716,0,t3_3a5x5d,Im exWoW player myself and started EvE a few years back. I recently created a fresh new character to fly in low level ships because it is more fun for someone than fly super big expensive stuff.Here are few things you want to keep in mind . Forget most of the stuff WoW taught you. Seriously. Most of the things are not applicable and sometimes works opposite way or even against you.. In EvE there are no linear progression and you can just jump in to endgamewhichever you think it is right from the start. Also there are alot of new player friendly organisations. Join them immediately. EvE is not for a single play. hint check out Brave Newbies RvB Karmafleet. Be ready to read a lot and do research on your own. Google and youtube will give you most information you need to succeed in EvE. Also will inspire you to login in time of crisis and frustration it will happen too.. This game will teach you many things. As many as you allow yourself to be taught. Be patient.. This is important. There is no turning back after you will get some of the ropes. All other MMOs will look like crap and not worth a single minute spent there. So make your decision carefully. All in all I would say I never regret. I flipped table a few times but you will learn that this is what makes EvE so exciting.,Eve,cs9mgtm,2,t5_2qil9

Ingame footage with no interface showing that is visually appealing even if the subject matter isnt particularly interesting and which is nicely edited and scored  Example most TEST propaganda  Ingame footage with the interface showing but showcasing some kind of interesting gameplay  Example Marlona Sky  A huge narrative driven piece combining the above approaches  Example Rooks and Kings  A video that doesnt necessarily have any ingame footage but portrays current events or entities in Eve for comedic effect  Example Do you like Waffles?  CGI generated alliance tournament ads that corpsalliances pay people to make but nobody remembers  Example I literally cant think of an example.

The last real influx of newbies happened because of a nullsec battle in BRRB and lets face it unless CCP does something incredible the game is on the slow path of MMO death. What little scraps of new players we all get will want to go where the party is at... nullsec. Does a new person want to spend  weeks waiting on API checks interviews SP reqs or other harsh requirements to gain entry to a null entity? No. Gamers want instant gratification these days and Eve is the worst at that. BNI once gave that better than its predecessors and now PHKH are doing similar.

Tradeoffs IMHO.Skill train boosters would be good too but again I would suggest something that is obvious for newbies. A  Social skill booster instead of a  charisma booster.My biggest take away is that I dont want to see those risks go away. You shouldnt have an easy booster that can never be lost.

You wont find any in C. c or C systems. You can ID the system type before jumping in by showing info on the wormhole and reading the wormhole text Once in the system you can check the exact type and what connections it has by looking the system up in EveEye or by using a wormhole mapper like tripwire or siggy.You will also find that holes with a Highsec static that is connected to a system near a trade hub get farmed quite quickly so sometimes you have to go down the chain a bit before you find a quiet system.,Eve,csw28rz,1,t5_2qil9

4516401,0,t1_cszx8pc,I agree.  Straight up agree.However there is one thing youre missing and you have to remember that humans play this game and sometimes the emotional effect is far more consequential than the practical how much isksov was lost effect.Let me lay it out really really bare because youre evidently intelligent so that makes me think youre actually trying to avoid the main issue.The problem isnt that you fought Brave along with anyone else in Eve.  The problem also isnt that your players have so much xp that it leads to a potential doctrine imbalance that puts you at a huge advantage even when massively outnumbered.The problem is that you refuse to take a loss when youve earned it while having pretences of being better than others  When you took fleets of ts or on some occasions even carriers and you were beginning to lose the entire alliance dropped SupercapsTitans just to prevent the FC who played badly from actually getting the loss he deserved.  For a group like Imperium this is par for the course.  Goons openly admit that they play the game this way.  Hey Goons youre shit at eve cause you had to drop  titans and a fleet to save a ratting ishtar Yea we know.  Welcome to Deklein!  Were shit but so are you lol.  But PL has pretenses of elite pvp.  There is the fundamental difference.The point is you are showing a group of new people that as a direct and exclusive result of playing this game longer than them skillpoints you can field ships that they can not defeat no matter what.  You are also playing coy and bringing in subcaps which due the isk and skillpoint gap are still at a huge advantage but not literally unbeatable.  So far so good.  The problem is when you lose a game that was rigged in your favour and flip the table over.  THAT is the problem.  When you started with a skillpointdoctrineexperience advantage and STILL LOST ANYWAY and then dropped unbeatable ships to prevent that loss that is the problem.  That is when players quit the game.  Few nullsec newbs quit because they lost sov or lost a ship or a fight or whatever.  Its Eve you lose shit everybody knows that.  But when you try really hard to gang up with other newbs and overcome PLs skillpoint isk experience and other advantages and you actually succeed for once and then they basically win anyway because LOL TITANS thats when a rational person decides to either join a group like Imperium or simply stop playing a game they cannot win.  Dont argue it you know in the case of superstitans its true.  Can  cruisers piloted by PLs best take down an unfit Titan piloted by a newb that doesnt know anything about Eve?  No?  Case in fucking point.  And the big reason this is broken is because other players do not have access to the same tools you do in the sandbox they are denied to them for literally years.  Skillpoints can only be acquired through the passage of time where any window licker can get more if they just pay CCP money.  In fact the best way to accumulate skillpoints is to sit docked in hisec with  implants and use remaps that are not realistic for enabling gameplay on a timeframe lower than one year.  In other words the best way to get setup to win is not to play.None of the mechanics that enable this are your PLs fault.  That blame lies on CCP.  But you engaged in a campaign of demoralization that is typical of goons against an enemy with nothing of strategic value while simultaneously acting like youre simply better players than them.  Not just more experienced or with more skillpoints or whatever.  No better.  That hypocrisy combined with the combat power of capssupercaps has led to  or more of Brave members being gt mth inactive and that was back in Catch.How you want to split the blame between PL and CCP is up to you.  ? ?  ?  Who fucking cares really.,Eve,cszxq5v,-14,t5_2qil9

Your CEO and directors should be doing that and providing you with training when possible rl schedules.

4632174,0,t1_ctefcmb,gtlmao salty tearsshitlorddetectedOn the off chance that youre serious people much smarter than me have posted about this ad nauseam. Essentially to save a super once the HICs are on it you need to kill EVERY HIC before the super melts under the shitloads of DPS coming its way. Look at the size of the fishing crew on this killmail. Lets assume a dread and a titan put out  thousand DPS each moroses do more. Well also estimate the DPS of a blops to be around . HIC DPS is probably negligible they might not even fit guns  idk never flown a hic. Plugging this dudes fit into EFT he gets  million EHP with all level  skills.  dreads  titan  blops and a thanatos assuming the thanny gets about  dps with fighters equals approximately  thousand raw DPS   to be exact  Im rounding up to   because its easy and there were lots of moroses on the km. With that damage the Nyx is dead in  seconds.What am I getting at? There are  HICs on the killmail  all of those needed to be killed in  seconds to save the Nyx assuming that no more came in  Im sure there were many extra HICs inbound.  divided by  is   therefore there needed to be enough firepower to kill a HIC every  seconds to save the Nyx. HICs are usually very tanky a bit of EFT warrioring gets a Devoter to  thousand EHP in a maxtank fit so it would take a hugeass probably stratoplevel fleet to save just this one super.But now lets look at the bigger picture. This dude is in Provi and Aridia is  region away from Provi. It would be a major logistical hurdle to get a stratoplevel fleet over to Aridia only to have LSH and pals likely blueball them  because why would they engage a fleet that size? Theyre a lowsec entity and Provi are a decently sized nullsec alliancecoalition. Sure it would save their super but having to burn a fleet all the way over there would certainly be a PITA for the linemembers.While the idea of Oh just have your alliance mates come save you is an attractive one for most of the super kills we see coming from regions like Aridia and Derelik its a taller order than it seems. So they try to move solo with disastrous consequences and reddit gets to have a giggle at their misfortune. But it really is silly that Aridia and Derelik are such huge chokepoints and CCP seems to be constantly killing ways to move supers in relative safety rip garage door cynos. By the way this post should not be taken as grrrr LSH  they do what they do extremely well  just to try to convince reddit that getting killed in Aridia doesnt mean youre stupid or lazy because that seems to be the overwhelming sentiment.,Eve,ctege5t,10,t5_2qil9

4689894,1,t1_ctlodkr,I mean I appreciate the response but...  That doesnt answer my question at all really.  You didnt tell me what you had been looking forward to you told me what you wanted.  And honestly any gamer has a laundry list of things they want in their game but as with all gamers wishlists yours gets a bit extreme.  Theres simply no reason why EVE is the game that will allow you to change your star color or builddestroy starts.  A lot of your ideas are very grandiose or big picture but I think they lack realism and ignore some basic details.  Lets be honest  without some revolutionary new system thats never been seen before grinding will always in some way shape or form be a part of the RPG experience and though we like to drop it in favor of just MMO EVE is an MMORPG.  To expect that CCP will be the pioneers on this while simultaneously managing such a large game where each section has deeply interconnected pieces to each other section as opposed to say WoW where you might be able to isolate balance issues to levels    or in raid instance X or in battleground Y is a bit of an overreach imo.  Your idea of fun is very broad and I feel it seems removed from the development process of this game and potentially any other game.  Just curious how long have you been playing EVE and how do you keep up with updates?  There is a lot of stuff to update and tweak and balance and it makes the balancing act devs must play is ridiculous.  Players have been begging for sov changes for years and CCP has finally delivered when many people in null criticized CCP for not taking care of it sooner they neglected to realize that there is a whole population read  most of EVEs population that lives and dies according to Empirespace rules so the best policy was mostly to fix the glaring issues that resonated for most of the population.  Once they did that they transitioned to implementing nullsec sov changes.  Im not saying your ideas are bad Well making simple choices is bad.  Complexity drives EVE and is exactly what should be strived for.  Perhaps instead of simple you meant nontedious?  Tedium and complexity are very closely linked sometimes but a good game has a great depth of complexity with little tedium but that CCP is working on that  theyve even addressed the idea of wanting sovereign space to feel more like cities in space.  On starting with the fun  how does one do this?  Furthermore how does one do this without gimping your future development?  One thing youll note from CCPs changes is that they keep referencing their desire to have a tweakable updateable system which will allow them to implement more new content more often and more cleanly.  When designing a system if you dont have a long term vision you will end up with several distinct pieces that become difficult to balance with one another because you didnt have an idea of what to do with them in the long run.  Theyre not JUST designing how nullsec will work theyre also designing how changes to their game in response to player feedback will work.  Blizzard thought the Berserk was a great racial skill for Trolls when WoW launched not realizing that people would read this as not good for spellcasting.  They thought well right thered probably be fewer troll priests anyway theyre trolls but they failed to account for the fact that it meant that the playerbase that DID want to play trolls would almost be forced out of the priest role because other races the undead just did it better and no one wanted a damn troll priest when they could have something more efficient.  They needed a clear vision on how trolls would fit into the meta and provide solid content for every player and every group but because they were new to the MMO field they drop the ball at first.  Something they thought would be fun differing your classes by race to add unique options and strategies became something more like indentured servitude  youd almost have to roll an undead priest because no one wanted your lesser troll priest.  Every designer of every game has to look at this and say how can we make it so if weve produced something broken its easy and quick to update?  So to return to my original question what were you looking forward to in the new sov system that they didnt deliver on?  It just kind of sounds like you had this whole idea of your own for new sov that didnt line up much of what CCP has been talking about for the past year.,Eve,ctlpd1y,0,t5_2qil9

4727331,0,t3_3fn70q,Im just going to assume youve seen or are aware of suitonia eveiseasy and chessurSD videos. If not go watch some of their stuff especially suitonias videos should be very good.So firstly if you are reasonably new stay the fuck away from FW. Sure the time to fight is much shorter and there are plenty of frigs looking for fights and you can even get fair fights. But a large number of fights you will get blobbed or the opponent will be snaked and linked. At least in null that doesnt happen quite as much.If you do choose to go to FW choose a location and get to know the neighbourhood. Who are the people with perma links who only fish in medium plexus with recons who actually gives you a fair fight. etc..  Then prefer side systems and pockets for looking for fights. You will find a lot of people who will just warp off but sometimes you might find someone who will stand and fight.As for null. If you cant find fights in null I would recommend going for that entosis idea but instead of fitting one simply go looking for them.  Scalding pass for instance has a heap of activity with spinning those new sov thingies.Go hunt entosis ceptors. It will force whoever you are finding to bring something to fight you and its also decent money with entosis links prices.You can also go to RNMY and if you see any feign disorder people in local demand a v at the top belt. They might not give you a fight but if they do agree you are guaranteed a fair v.,Eve,ctqf59o,1,t5_2qil9

Dualprop helps keep a portion of your sig tank once you reach your target nosferatu also helps.IshkurVengeanceJaguar are the main heavy tackle ships that I would recommend. Vengeance gt Ishkur in bigger fleets and when your fleet will fight people with plenty of support so you need sheer tank over dualprop.

To the point I think this concept has worn out its welcome to some extent in eve.  We should be striving to make the AI as convincing as possible.  CCP has historically given preference to balancing PVP they seem to put  PVE in the well get to it whenever box.  Now personally I could care less about that on its own except in the practical sense that a combat site runner has ZERO incentive to hold position and defend.  Due to a gimp tank he has no real chance of surviving until support get on field.  Its entirely unrealistic with the current state of these mechanics to expect this to happen.

4775921,0,t3_3galme,Letting a chunk of my active training queues go dormantunsub.  In the last yearish the number of patches your company has done have left me less and less interested.  Kronos was shit for industry and the thing that redeemed it and made it interesting teams was removed.  Then phoebe proceeded to make capital game play a lot more boring.  And finally fozzie sov.  It made sov a boring game of who is going to go troll ceptor entosis whos sov today so they have to form in a day and magic wand it back?.  Grinding either required a time or asset commitment to troll hit which at least kept it interesting.  Fozzie sov is literally ccp asking how can I get you to unsub more accounts?.  If it wasnt for my Corp mates and me logging in to do things for them I would have unsubbed  months ago.  As it stands I dont need massed market accounts for funding mass capital death and anyone here knows Im the best at losing dreads I dont need a ton of new alts training up because the options are getting less interesting.  And I dont feel compelled to run  toons in sov warfare because all Im doing is cycling the magic wand most of the time.  And single boxing combat just isnt interesting anymore.  When  became normal and  was extreme cycling between them using isboxer  not multicasting actually cycling through them made the game fresh and interesting gave me something fun in a post phoebe world.  And then magic wand sov made it boring again.  So Ill either find something else that makes it interesting again or Ill continue to lose accounts until the only ones left are the ones I need for Corp management.   Id do anything for those guys and Ill continue to play for them until the last of them unsub but it may be with  active skill queues instead of .,Eve,ctwjpn4,1,t5_2qil9

4848461,0,t3_3hagfc,For jump fatigue ill restate an idea i posted in another thread that some people seemed to like.when you jump you get a stack of dick waving. once you reach  number up for discussion dick waving stacks you cant jump. thats it. youre taking gates no arguments.    after an hour time up for discussion you lose a stack of dick waving.    essentially what this means is you can jump ly at once and then ly every hour afterwards. this means you can deploy capitals anywhere in your territory fairly easily and you can move them longer distances but youre going to have a wait between jumps either once an hour and save a stack for an emergency exit or all ly at once then rest up for a few hours.it allows you to move caps locally quite easily but still stops large distances to be traversed quickly.I quite like the new structure vulnerability window mechanic and i think itd be great for sov. an hour a day or a whole  hours on a weekend. would make for some interesting ways to set timers. yes i know they arent the exact numbers im just making an example    the guy who sets it for  hour a day during his prime time... stuck in traffic on the way home and youre fucked. however that hr window leaves less opportunity for enemies to form up also.     hours on a weekend? clear your diary kids were going to binge netflix and orbit buttons! however that gives you the rest of the weekendweek to do whatever you want without worrying about sov trolling.    i do like the structure vulnerability timer thingy. far more interesting than every day for  hours you must babysit shit.,Eve,cu5onjv,-6,t5_2qil9

4914152,0,t1_cudtjga,Ive been flying logi when the enemy had effective cycling of primaries. They could switch targets FAST and it turns whats already a game of spacewhackamole into something more akin to this We had our guys trained to broadcast when yellowboxed. So we would get  or  broadcasts almost all at once. Reps would be split between the broadcasters but we were in a situation where the actual primary would need almost all of our reps to hold. The enemy would even fire a volley at one or two of the fake targets before settling on the real victim just so wed see them take damage so wed start a repper on them that wed have to wait for its cycle to complete before moving it. Oh and this was in addition to the jammingdamping of the logi wing. Nothing like figuring out who the real primary is moving all your reppers to them and suddenly.....LOL WHAT TARGETS?So in a perfect world with basic target calling and no EWAR the logi in that fight could have kept everybody alive.

But you got one guy ruling a dominant mega coalition with this kind of toxic attitude which is taken up by  of the null sec players so its not as benign as you think in terms of how it affects Eve overall.

4938846,0,t1_cufemis,Not really true.  There could be a system that shapes what can be attacked and when and what can only be attacked after some initial success.Consider Planetside another retiring game.  You cant take the Tech Plant until you cap the nearest outlying hex.  You can still go there shoot people and disable a few things but you have to follow the lattice to accomplish any real acquisition.  EVE could perhaps have a player determined lattices ensuring that there is a front line.  As they expand their empires the front line of vulnerable territory expands faster ensuring limits.  If players could build up a secure facility to construct things but its security would be contingent on owning and operating adjacent systems which were vulnerable.  The vulnerable systems would have more resources in them attracting both friendly and hostile predators.  More secure systems would be worthless for farming.  The vulnerable systems might have mechanics that were more favorable for having structures that supported either raiding or beachheads for more involved campaigns.  If it were possible to require that a Sov V system be surrounded by at least Sov IV systems and so on lots becomes possible.  Thats a big system rewrite though.  Higher sov could have benefits like making friendly structures impossible to scan without spies and make neutral structures easy to find and root out.  There might be structure defensive or offensive bonuses in effect or structures which disallowed ewar immunity on supers.  All manner of unpleasant things really.,Eve,cuh2xoz,1,t5_2qil9

Which was my nondream corp at the time. When I ejected from it someone stole it and it turned out they were a PL spy. My dad then stole it from that person and kicked them from PL and they told me they had stolen the ship and what happened so late at night I logged into my dads account and took it back.My dad got really mad about this so made a plan to kill me. Someone came in in a hictor and pointed me while I was midpointing to get away from where Pl was based. I blew up the first hictor but more and more started to land I could hear my dad yelling orders from the next room. PL started dropping all their supers on me and my dad came in and said eject from the ship or he would blow me up then kick me out of home.I said I would and as my dad walked back to his computer I had finished deagressing turned back into a stargate to Jita and then jumped through myself to safety. Thats when I woke up heart racing.I still worry my dad is a PL spy Even though he has never even played EVE.,Eve,cumw6s3,9,t5_2qil9

The spartans analogy is interesting as they DID have lands of their own while also fielding troops to support their albeit temporary hegemony in southern Greece.  Ive never led an alliance so Im certain there are both technical and diplomatic issues Im missing but is it so hard to have a blued group offer BL a roof solely on the premise of hey we wont shoot you plus jump clones for home sec content?

5042643,1,t1_cuttk0z,This kind of wellbalanced mature and constructive debate I have zero issues with. Thank you. I didnt say you got exactly what you asked for but I am saying that the empires formed out of Dominion and POS sov are perhaps experiencing growth pains and were seeing people react in both constructive and negative ways to those pains. Maybe that WII turns out to be what he wanted after all he just needs to get used to it and realize that it can do things the Xbox cant. And why not borrow from aspects that work in lowsec? Lowsec players are generally very happy about their game its got nothing to do with us having some kind of advantege were not interested in your sand castles we just want to fight. Surely a distributed system that promotes multiple skirmish FCs and medium to small fleets is a step in the right direction albeit in need of tweaks which thankfully the new system is very flexible to I think the CFC and Provi proved that. Anyway going into the details of the sov system was not my intent rather I was talking about how some aspects of the nullsec population have reacted in such a toxic fashion that literally no good can come of it.,Eve,cuttvi5,2,t5_2qil9

When the site is done you can get your deployable back.  Abandon it and lose the equivalent of a ship.It also isnt necessary to have a small med and large site in darn near every FW system.  Give some shape to the battlefield or at least on a per constellation level.  If there is going to be an XL site requiring an XL deployable make it commensurately valuable impactful and less abundant.

5126668,0,t3_3l5xay,The way the node system currently works discourages fighting because you dont need to fight on a node. You just go find a different one to hack undisturbed. The way to make contesting multiple nodes into surefire fights is if hacking does not destroy the nodes.So if  nodes spawn you must capture every single one to win. And if you try to cap them one by one the defense fleet can do the same and the fight will never be over. To ensure victory you must have a presence on each node.If the nodes are uncontested it is simple to win. In the face of determined defence it will be difficult to beat. This system will require lower node spawn but would still apply over a constellation allowing for tacticalstrategic manoeuvring. It will force fights because of the necessity to own all nodes and only once they are owned by the aggressor will the objective flip. This is one way I can think of that turns the current nodeentosis based system into providing surefire fights.,Eve,cv3yf1g,0,t5_2qil9

Nearly got pinched on a gate by  players from AAA trying to structure grind the stations out there to take sov. Overall was a good idea but kinda delayed my training into pew pew.

If you fight a marauder out of site youll probably run out of cap with your neuts  points. End up dropping point and he gets out. If youre planning on soloing with neuts bastion mode will make your DPS grind enormous. Even if they arent using their local repair module in bastion theyve got retarded resist and a neut equipped proteus does like  dps max with good skillseven that seems way too high? So way closer to  dps in bastion I think youd cap yourself out in a solo fight and then the marauder would either local rep your damage or jump out. Cause you have to keep point keep neuts up do DPS all he has to do is sit there and rep your damage wait out your cap. ,Eve,cv6rk0v,9,t5_2qil9

As of the current build nothing should appear different.   We have made a number of changes to some pretty old code that is fundamental for the structure work to happen and this is where you come in. We would love you to log onto Duality and just go about your normal test server activitiesPVP  Setup a POS with modules  Repackage and reprocess stuff  Run missions and sites  etc  Are Citadels available?  Not at the moment but eventually we will get them in your hands along with all the other stuff we are working on. Watch this space or another similar forum post.MassTests  These will be happening. Probably just the standard procedure that we have on Singularity but as always we will let you know about them.Bug Reports  If you see anything that you think is wrong or you are not sure is functioning how it does on TQ then please enter a bug report through the F menu. Include pictures of the actual issue makes my life so much easier. Big smilePlease try and enter the bug report before restarting the client as the logs are super important to us and when you restart the client we lose them. SadGetting on the Test Servers  Here is a link for how to get on the Test Servers     Visit the link above and whenever you read Singularity replace it with Duality and it should all work. Famous last words.Regards  CCP Claymore on behalf of Team Game of Drones.It is basically a copy of the code running on TQ.

5235707,0,t1_cvgia6s,It was going off of the abilityexperience curve idea mmos had early on that they adopted from RPGs where there would be a class weak early on but very potent later once it had matured.  So like how fighters were supposed to grow linearly and wizards exponentially.or in wow where the opposite was true for a time.  Games standardizing across the classes was a later development.So while the other classes would always be gimped by capacitor needs and speed minnie were supposed to be able to be flexible in tank damage have the fastest ships and never use cap for weapons....however to make effective use of it you have to have literally everything maxed.  In the meantime you could still spec in to a specific fitgetting less damage paying for ammo and being able to fit less except for the ships like the rifter that had an extra turret hardpoint or something similar but the strength of minmitar wouldnt be unlocked until later.Theyve standardized everything a lot aka giving other races ships the advantages minmitar had but minnie still has a lot of the weaknesses without said payoffs..well they didnt have the payoff until they nerfed certain shield fit armor ships and started tweaking projectiles.

5267830,0,t1_cvkgfzp,gt  Im usually just running damage control my guns and an armor repairer.I mostly theorycraft but here are some thoughts.Youre active tanking in PvP you generally want to buffer tank. In your case where it looks like you use armor tanked ships this means you want armor plates. So you have a large pool of armor HP in exchange for powergrid instead of regenerating HP in exchange for cap. If you shield tank there is the Ancillary Shield Booster which is basically a regular shield booster but boosts more shield and uses no cap when loaded with cap booster charges. Or you can regularly buffer tank with shield extenders.There are also Cap boosters themselves. Theres the mid slot module which gives you an injection of cap and the charges themselves which you load into it.Theres an ancillary armor repper too but that still uses cap but when loaded with nanite repair paste gives a really good boost of HP per cycle. Downside of the Ancillary modules is that you get about  cycles before needing to reload and reloads take  seconds.Other than that hybrid turrets sip cap lasers gulp it and missiles and projectiles dont need it. Oh and the damage control doesnt use cap last I checked legacy code.,Eve,cvl0vi9,-1,t5_2qil9

Sure there is a risk but that risk is NOT important for zKill and Squizz. If you do not want people to assign APIkeys to a website such as zKill thats your choice.

I like tears as much as the next chap in game where it cleverly manipulates the meta game to any particular advantage.  But this sucks.  I really feel sorry for this toon for a number of reasons.  Hes committed a lot of energy and time but obviously failed to see the opportunities the game could actually be offering him. Hes managed to join up with a Corp that didnt put him straight.  Hes managed to avoid and simply not understand that he doesnt have to cave in to Code.  I hope and truly trust that someone helps to put this toon back onto hisher feet and provide some decent and mature guidance on ideas and approaches to the game that work.  Its in none of our combined interests to have young toons in the game who are getting trapped by the shallowest of cobwebs in the early parts of their careers.  Rage quits induced through ignorance are a problem for us all across the game and we should try and do what we can to help.  If the toon affected wants to reach out to me for some guidance then by all means go ahead.  I dont want to see you leave the game and want to see you learn the game and how to embrace it and make just a little part of it you own.

5365288,0,t1_cvxfmuw,I always feel only casual marketeers use that stuff and they probably feel incredibly smart for a few seconds then. Even more when they are changing multiple different digits by hand. After three rounds of undercutting at max they usually bail or go far cheaper so I can snatch their order and repost it higher. Never saw someone battle me for the cheapest price for hours using that stuff. However I think it is smart to do .. ISK steps in Jita to avoid race conditions until everyone does that.In the end the guy who mechanically updates dozens of orders by . every five minutes is going to win and does not need those tricks. He will mechanically adjust though if you use them. At max they help you for five minutes. I value my own time higher than someone elses time so I go for the least required effort. If someone is serious he has multiple orders anyways so he can instantly fix it if he missed out.If someone does the big scroll wheel thing you just go adjust gt cursor right gt  backspace backspace gt cursor down gt enter. Easiest way to go from x. to x. blindly. I usually do that on my secondary mouse  keyboard with just one hand on the side while playing on another box.However I always smile when someone keeps undercutting me in . steps behind a small order that is too cheap or the inverse for buy orders.

5440345,0,t3_3phjcu,After finally finishing the BS level V skill prerequisites for interdictors I decide to head over into HS to pick up the skillbook. When I reach HS I realize I have an hours worth of training some random ass science skill before I can inject interdictors so instead of just ship spinning I decide to take my pvp fit confessor out through one of the WHs in system.I jump through into a promising looking C. Scan shows a a dictor and hictor and some other trash sitting in a POS.... hopefully theyre offline but since I dont have cloak I dont want to go and check the POS. I drop probes and warp off the the far corner of the system hoping that as long as Im off dscan theyll just think the probes are from a enterprising explorer.Only  sigs in the system so it doesnt take me long to quickly scan down all the sites... and one of them is a WH into a C! Awesome!I head through into the C. These babys can be great for making isk in the right ship and my dual tanked confessor should be up to the task. Its no cap stable pve boat but the C isk should easily cover the cost of the navy cap boosters and nanite paste.All the  combat sites are gone so I know that someone must frequent the hole regularly. I decided to scan down all the sigs and there is only  sleeper relic site worth looking at a Forgotten frontier quarantine outpost. Ive run Cs before without issues so I decide to head in without looking it up on google first.I warp in and quickly pop the frigs no big deal they go down in  or  hits each but start taking decent damage from the cruisers. I have to OH and run my aciliary repper to stay up and pop  cruisers before having to warp out to reload and rep up. I get back and finish off the wave and a new bunch of cruisers appears. No big deal.I start shooting these Im kind of annoyed at having to run my anciliary repper but thats what I get for bringing a PvP fit to a PvE fight. Soon though I notice Ive shot the wrong  cruisers first and the next group have spawned. A bunch of frigs and a BS. Without an AB I cant get up enough transversal to speed tank them and with my MWD my sig blooms too much that the cruisers are getting perfect hits. I decide to burn towards a celestial with my MWD on and string the sleepers out. This works well enough the frigs get in range first and I blap them all pretty quickly... crap that spawns the final wave another  BS and yet more frigates.I spend the next  minutes warping in and out at range blapping the frigates when I can and slowly taking out the cruisers  at a time. Thank Bob for the km optimal on the confessor.Eventually Im left with just  BSs left. I try to burn in range to get under the guns of one of them but the other  start getting a few really good hits and I have to make a hasty warp out in  armor with both reps running. When I come back theyve repped back up. Bastard sleepers. I resort to my old tactic of stringing them out. Im just able to pop one of them as my ancil repper uses the last of my nanite. I burn under the guns of one of the remaining  and the dps slows enough for my single T rep to hold. I switch to gleam and the BS goes down in no time at all. With the last BS all on his own hes no challenge at all for my beefy little confessor.I finish the site with  cap boosters left no nanite and the most engaging PvE experience I can remember having in Eve. I feel like Ive managed to run the site thanks to smart piloting managing my range tank cap and D modes. Thats something that almost never happens to me in eve.I loot the field and come out with just over  mil in sleeper loot. Not bad for a single site in a confessor.,Eve,cw722jo,10,t5_2qil9

Even without knowing specifics about which hullsmetas will be top of the heap a smart investor should have settled into their bets a while back.With that though I just expect a longlowheat on capital parts more than any specific spike.

I currently have  days of game time on my super account to see if I want to use it anymore.  Or if ill sell it and buy carriers instead.  Fighters are just fighters now you change the skills they have  That fight there basically means you can launch a bunch of Thanatos drones but equip them with Torps.

5666266,1,t3_3spgj4,First off yes I dont play anymore. But considering my real life background I cant help but weigh in on this if the community would be so kind to hear me out.Trying to give the players more immersion is great as long as it does not hamstring their efficiency at pew pewing another player in the face. If they have to pick between things looking amazing and having a view that lets them make better decisions to not die in a fire they will pick the latter every time. Not to mention there is a difference of what looks great as a spectator and what looksfeels good as being there. Two different things competing with each other over the same screen real estate rarely works out. When you consider the best way to play EVE effectively is to be very zoomed out given the mechanics of combat adding a cinematic experience is not possible. Well unless you completely revamp combat where the optimal way to play just so happens to be the same as a cinematic experience. Basically not likely to happen.So what can be done? If both cant share the same screen then give each their own screen. Most video makers seem to have at least two monitors. Allow the option to turn one into the cinematic view while keeping the main monitor the players tactical one. Complete with all their opsec chat channels tactical overlay zoomed out for maximum tactical awareness. Then they can have the cinematic monitor be free to do all the pans tilts dramatic zoom in on explosions and all other things cool like be zoomed up on the ship to show off that new sweet SoE skin you just bought. Maybe the camera tails the last set of cruise missiles that are heading for your targets ship bleeding structure. Maybe it shows a radical new UI that looks amazing but not practical for actual use. Who cares its just for the viewer to have the feeling they are there in the action. There is countless things that can be done with the cinematic monitor because the player is busy on the tactical one. Streamers and video makers can setup the screen record to be just the cinematic monitor and nothing else. Maybe they can add local chat on it that does not look like it is from Excel. Think of the possibilities.I really dont think it is as big of a technical hurdle for CCP. They can do some amazing things. Well thats my thoughts. I hope they are welcomed.,Eve,cwzgeuz,2,t5_2qil9

Remember with the Imperium defense and survival ALWAYS take priority over instigating conflict. You might find the concept of the Imperium not surviving hackneyed but you also didnt have everything ripped from you due to a lazy direkkktor not paying the sovereignty bill going from hundreds in fleet for casual formups to a maximum of  possible. Losing Delve left scars that will never heal. Well do everything we can to avoid that fate.Also capitals only worked to punch above your weight when your opponent didnt have any. Nowadays not only are capitals less effective at punching above ones weight we have more of them than anyone else.

5818414,0,t1_cxibe3r,I wouldnt say Im necessarily looking for pvp or pve directly. I guess Im trying to dip my hand in both pots without losing too much from either. honestly Im looking for a way to turn weapons skills into isk that isnt boring enough to make me want to drill my eyes out anoms and isnt sporadically dependent on locations and people to work. I know these sights can be run much more efficiently with groups but my playtime tends to be dead of people who are willing to or capable of doing something that isnt AFKtaring. Im working on convincing some buddies to keep a ship handy when the opportunity presents itself but the solo option is nice.To me its new and exciting and while it remains that way I want to try it out as fully as I can without moving entirely into a wh. Not yet at least.Even getting jumped is ok if I can have some fun putting up a fight. Which is why Im curious about wh tactics. Other than what I see hugging the whole in kspace I have little firm knowledge on it.,Eve,cxibufp,2,t5_2qil9
5818698,0,t3_3uw4lh,gtOne night we had planned a freighter op to transport minerals and moon goo to empire to sell. A freighter op?! you are probably asking yourselves. Well this was back before we had jump bridges or jump freighters. If an alliance wanted to transport large quantities of anything they needed to set up a freighter op. A freighter op would consist of several standard freighters being escorted to empire with a fleet. We would take every single gate jump to the nearest safe system.I sort of wish conflict drivers like this still existed. Real conflict drivers that are created out of the need of players e.g. we need to set up a logistical op with heavy escorts and scouts along the way. Shit like that jsut sounds so awesome. Jump Drives sort of spoiled us a lot. yeah sure let me just log in my  cyno alts,Eve,cxid45m,29,t5_2qil9

Wars only happen when Theres a reason to fight Theres a will to fight The fight isnt mindnumbingly boringHint  Whackananom isnt funIt also doesnt help when people can make x more in highsec running incursions than they can in the . systems they have to play whackamole to defend constantly.  Basically the effort vs. Reward is just not there anymore to cause people to be willing to put forth the effort to fight big wars.  Not when you can make more isk in highsec than in . and get more fun PVP in lowsec than in ..Right now with the state of things wars are only fought as long as the fights are fun for both sides.  As soon as one side or the other decides the fight is pointless they just turtle up or evac because honestly its not worth the effort to take the space or hold it depending on which side you are on.

5883708,0,t1_cxqucc7,numbers in this post dont bother with links or implants for the sake of simplicityA guardian with an ECCM and x rECCM from a friendly battleship has  sensor strength. This means that a Falcon has  chance to jam a Guardian for each cycled module. Maths can tell us that the chance of being jammed out is  per cycle . to the power of  gives the chance of all events failing which means the chance of at least one jam landing is . though this is a gross simplification just for the sake of comparison. The chance of landing two consecutive jams is hence  and the chance of landing three consecutive jams is . I think. My head starts to hurt when considering probabilities with this many variables and my spreadsheet for this kind of thing is broken atm after I tried to improve it.To give some kind of meaningful comparison a Guardian lands reps on a cruiser hull in  seconds. Add in an enemy recon Lachesis with  damps and friendly support battleship giving  sebos and a Guardian lands reps on a cruiser hull in  seconds. This is an increase of  which is pretty comparable to the  chance of being jammed per cycle I think especially since the Lachesis is at least tanky...Comparing unbonused ships is interesting also.Unbonused damps are counteracted almost exactly by sensor boosters.  damps to  rsebos is a decrease from  seconds to . seconds though its the same number of server ticks anyway. A rd unbonused damp pushes the timetoreps up as far as . seconds and a th takes it up to  seconds. After that they arent really  useful. So  unbonused damps is an increase of  in timetoreps.Unbonused jams have  chance of jamming out a Guardian with  sensor strength  rECCM. So  jams is  chance just under and  jams is  chance. Interesting  unbonused jams have  chance of jamming out a guardian with  sensor strength whilst  unbonused damps is still only an increase of  in timetoreps. Arguably if youre fighting in ranges of km jams could be more effective if you have high numbers of utility mids compared to the expected number of enemy guardians.But damps are more consistent and probably more versatile as scripts let you force guards to come closer or whatever whereas ECM just... jams them occasionally. And very very occasionally. If you can refit and have racial jammers then its certainly an interesting proposition. Perhaps more interestingly a Machariel has a  chance of being jammed out. With  unbonused jams you can push that to  chance of jamming them out which is probably better than damping them down. Though I dont know how much losecnullsec uses EWAR against DPS anyway ? and of course unbonused damps are just as annoying for them in some ways.tldr damps do the same as ECM just more consistently and without the occasional RNGod moment. If you have an excessive amount of EWAR and the ability to fit racial jammers jams might be better than damps at ranges of under km but its a niche thing to think about anyway.,Eve,cxqvyfm,3,t5_2qil9

I personally didnt get involved in Cloud Ring and have no plans of doing so. I skipped the test deployment too. Cuz i didnt feel like it. So i have been doing my own thing going on LAWN roams fighting NC. when they come pewpew and if Mittens war happens to interest me ill go find out if thats what i wanna do.As for telling him ive never spoken to Sion in my life. Never spoken to Mittens either. However LAWN leadership knows  where i stand as do the diplos so they can tell me to cool my jets if i go overboard. And obviously i stay in LAWN for many reasons. Sending sion a message beign all YO I DONT AGREE STFU NOOB REDDIT IS TOTES LEGIT may make someone feel better but thats all it will do. Sion isnt gunna change his opinions cuz  LAWN linemember said boo you. Hes gunna keep on doing him whatever that may be. And when he does make legit points as i explained in my other post you should read it i think i did well for once i cant just say Well this is all crap youre making me look bad too when i agree with some of it.Apathy is a great nonmotivator. Not really being motivated to stand up to the leadership but still wanting to fly around and shoot is a totally legit way to play Eve. At the end of the day if i agree with sion or mittens or even my own alliance leadership or not is my own buisness. Things will continue to be run the way they are and I am free to leave at any time with no reprecussions ie they wont hun me down as a traitor if i decide i am not longer having fun. And i will keep trying to stand up to the horde of angry redditors on behalf of myself and the other linemembers who think similairly to me if there even are any of you... tho im convinced somedays its just me and then a million of Mittens alts.

5934769,0,t3_3wnmdi,Im in favor of something along those lines plus I think that repairs should take resources rather than just capacitor or money.  In the past Ive even advocated for the removal of hull repairers but requiring charges or nanite paste for hull reppers would work just as well.When originally conceived I was hoping to establish a new utility for capital shipyards mainly to tie capital assets to infrastructure.  Thatll be irrelevant once supers can dock in the new citadels.  Ive also favored having stationcitadel refining be slower than POS based refining.  If the timesink was put there it would free up CCP to reduce the diminishing returns curve on the front end and allow more investment or more aggressive mining strategies.,Eve,cxxkuud,-2,t5_2qil9

6014422,0,t3_3xv16g,WARNING Semilong post incoming.What a lot of people seem to have overlooked is that its not just the mechanics used to capture and hold Sov that are important but the underlying reasons for holding Sov in general. The mechanics of taking sov from someone else while good for smallscale conflict drivers see various lowsec and NPC Null entities grabbing a few systems or poking at a larger entity to force fights out of them they simply do not translate over very well into largescale conflict drivers. This was also an issue with Dominion Sov and is not fixable via capture mechanics alone. So while I would have to say that I would like to see a hybrid sov system introduced after the Citadel expansion one where you can capture structures via Entosis mechanics and destroy them via pew pew for instance the underlying changes to Sov that I would like to see have nothing to do with how you TAKE sov and everything to do with what you do once you have the stuff.

6023836,0,t1_cy9876u, As someone who uses wormholes every single day the null wormhole nerf seemed unnecessary. There is counterplay to it which I think makes for great gameplay. I think that rolling back part of the nerf would work just fine maybe only nerfing the rate by  of the amount it was actually nerfed would go a long way. C wormholes already can serve as more than just PI farms. Cs are very interesting for some types of gameplay. I know some people who manufacture out of a CHS allowing for ease of access to any number of HS trade hubs. I know other people that mine in Cs providing for very low traffic access to Nullsec Ores.  I believe that the isk distribution between  and  needs to be looked at. As someone who has lived in every class of wormhole the main gameplay restriction on lower class wormholes is for PVE not scaling your income to the number of people in your Corporation. Farming your static doesnt work for C and C wormholes and personally would love to see more meaningful group play come to low class wormholes. Refer back to . I really feel like the daily scanning for a small active group can be manageable but with the increased number of connections and the lack of inhabitants it often feels like scanning out long empty chains. The frostline and bloodraiders before them sites have done some temporary help in just getting more people in space. Wormholers should be able to change pods now. But definately in citadels.

If its too much then hit warp and youre out almost instantly if you arent warp disrupted.  For PvP Experience. Asking in corpalliance chat.

6065996,0,t3_3yll96,Perhaps I should clarify some stuffI believe that CCP has a vision for the war system as an extension of things that go on in other parts of the universe. When the nullbears are slugging it out over whatever region is in the news this week they or mercenaries could wardec their enemies and their alt corps to disrupt hisecbased supply lines. The system was most likely intended to allow entities who are at war elsewhere to carry their war into the trade hubs and mission systems.The way its largely used in reality is different. Mercenaries are hired to disrupt alliance activities and destroy highand lowsec structures but a lot of it is simply guys like me who enjoy the experience of hunting in highsec. I compare it to preferring boxing over MMA there are a lot more rules and limitations but theres a certain elegance to it.So fixing the war system is going to require some other significant changes. Make longterm corporate membership meaningful. It should be much more preferable to remain in a corporation and defend it than to jump ship. This is an instance where the carrot is way better than the stick if someone wants to bail out of a corp because of war let them but there need to be tangible benefits for not doing that. Maybe certain perks become available after  days in the same corp? I dont know. Make longterm NPC corp membership unpleasant. Ive long thought it would be fun to have procedural politics between the NPC corps. Basically their standings toward each other can shift somewhat randomly. If standings get bad enough members of the corp might lose docking privileges or agent access. Imagine Caldari Navy or Sisters of Eve dropping one of the NPC corps to  for a few days denying access to the Jita hub or L agents. Its motivation to get out of the NPC corps and its worldbuilding! Create win conditions for wars. Lots of people have lots of ideas on this. Most of them favor defenders far too heavily but Ive seen some good ones over the years. Maybe CCP could do something with citadels? I dont know. This is why we pay them ,Eve,cyeqsk3,3,t5_2qil9

I wonder whether this has more to do with a post empirecoalition period or AegisSov.Fair enough. Could possibly be the case in the long run we will have to see how it all plays out. However with the current mechanics I think coalitions rebuilding into megacoalitions is a thing of the past.gt The Game of Drones Structures are not designed just for one area of space they are game wide so certainly they will have an effect everywhere. Based on that it would seem CCP is choosing not to force entosis on everybody so Id stand by them considering it a failure.As far as the stated failures of entosis sov what you were mentioning was talking about station timers in particular.

Where its part of the design process rather than an afterthought.Support is better now than it was in the past with more being added as time passes rather than just support for whats there. Im not sure theres enough for a full time dev though. So Id prefer the collateral efforts of a number of devs where its less likely to be impacted by vacation time than one full time,Eve,cyinb80,3,t5_2qil9

6117893,0,t1_cyksms0,OK Im going to try and do this in sequence of your post.Revelation  You point out that Veniel at no point says that the Jove are dying out succumbing to the disease and that the race is doomed. Instead he implies that they left. By choice. This is true but he also more or less states that their population has diminished by about  just in the last  years. Im also not sure that the choice of system is significant  there are much closer Jove systems to reachable space and definitely closer to Geminate  but I like the rest of what youve got here.Revelations  Nothing to add here  even EVE Source explicitly mentions the apathetic and pacifist tendencies of the modern Jove.Revelations  This one is shorting fuses in my brain. If the discovery of Anoikis quickly led to the fall of the Second Empire that would mean the Sleeper presence there is only about a thousand years old. Somehow Ive always had the impression they were supposed to be much older.That being said it sort of works with the Jovian disease hitting at that time. Theres plenty of evidence suggesting the Talocan implemented massive quarantines due to some sort of diseasevirus  its possible that the Second Empire reencountered it and it manifested as the Jovian Disease leading to societal collapse and the largescale retreat to virtual reality of those who became Sleepers. For even more farreaching likely nowirrelevant tinfoil the Broker TonyG acquired a disease that followed his infomorph between bodies and increasingly destroyed his clones soon after birth and eventually led to erratic behavior parallel with Ouria? with even CCP Falcon pointing out that he was an idiot in his final years. Perhaps the same disease happened to him but manifested differently due to his nonJovian physiology. His cloning method was much more similar to DUSTies who were developed from Sleepers than regular capsuleers which kind of adds to the credence of this crackpot idea.Revelation  I agree with you but youre possibly generalizing to all of the Directorate what may only apply to the Society as Raish would likely refer to Veniel by his Society title Archon rather than anything Jovianspecific.Revelation  Very interesting stuff. The only thing Id add is that it apparently quashes what speculation there was that the remains of the Directorate were somehow cooperating with Sansha.Revelation  See my discussion of amp about timeline but this is also interesting the Sleepers are a branch of the Stasis factions who lost many outposts during the Shrouded Days but were also p. of EVE Source the most vocal faction in getting the emerging Third Empire to migrate from Curse to their current space where they found the stellar lattice and likely other Talocan artifacts and rediscovered Anoikis. Veniel credits this to instinct but I think its possible that fewer records were lost than we and most surviving Jove think and some may possibly be recoverable in the future.Revelations  Ive got nothing but to note that  does clarify that the Drifters are not in contactcooperation with any Jove group that Veniel is aware of.Revelations  You nailed most of it but there are a couple of things Id ask Who if anyone will be the next vector for the Other?  We dont know exactly how it got out of the Construct but we do know there were multiple Others in there and in Templar One Grious states that any immortal with a predictable clone jump could be vulnerable. Did anyone else of importance also die and reclone that day? Has its intermingling with Jamyl damageddestabilized it?Revelation  When you say The Other is not friends with its former compatriots in the Sleeper Construct do you mean the Sleeper residents or the other Others? You do ask why its hostile to the Sleepers  that is at least partly answered in Templar One the main of Sleeper society was intolerant of purely artifical intelligences and strove to purge them.Revelation  I hope youre right that well be learning a lot more about the Society and Raish. Two points I would make Firstly while the SoCT and the SOE are to some extent rivals officially they are in good standings with one another  ingame so mortal enemies might be a bit of an exaggeration. Second I dont think its confusingtroubling that Raishs first order of business is to ask about the Upwell Consortium. After his time with Veniel he likely knows more about the Drifter threat than anyone else in the room and certainly knows more about Sleepers and Others but not so much regarding this upstart group. His first act is to request information on something of developing importance not preemptively supply it which is more or less exactly what the Jove would have done.Whew! Now that thats done I look forward to your post about Jove Space and the Talocan.,Eve,cyl1heo,1,t5_2qil9

6124149,0,t3_3zfv41, Mining is a great way for new players to get started making isk and building a mineral stock. At first it might be more profitable for you to purchase your raw materials from the market. Eventually you may want to mine them yourself but your reprocessing skills are going to need to be trained if you want to turn ore into raw materials. Until you train reprocessing skills it may be more efficient for you to sell raw ore that you mine and use the isk to buy minerals. BPOs do not get used up. They can be researched to increase their efficiency and you can create BPCs from the BPOs. BPCs can be sold via the contract system for extra isk. If you eventually use a POS player owned structure to manufacture your items be sure to manufacture using a BPC. If your POS gets taken down you do not want to loose the BPOs with it. Instead keep your BPOs in a station and make copies of them to bring to your POS. There are many good ways to sell weapons ships and ammo. You will find it semidifficult to make good margins at first if you sell in the largest trade hubs Jita Amarr ect If you sell at a smaller hub your items will take longer to sell but you should be able to make a better margin. Good luck and have fun! Eve is trial by fire and you may loose a little investment isk here and there. Stick it out and youll do great!,Eve,cylr306,3,t5_2qil9

6131665,0,t3_3zj9qy,People have been complaining about this.Drone aggro mechanics are incredibly weird. Ill tell you a little story about when I changed my VNI fit and ordered in new VNIs. I have had been doing Sansha Havens in the same system for a while with no drone aggro problems. When my new VNIs arrived it was a problem with both of them. The first  sites I did was almost impossible since I had to recall drones  times every site but I think after I did like  sites the problem went away. To this day I have no idea what the actual fuck was going on. This is how random the NPC aggro mechanics are. Anyways I think that having a Automatic targeting computer on your VNI might help. Its the difference in my fit vs a lot of others Ive seen. It might also count as EWAR. Its also useful when afkratting since you dont have to target the NPCs who only yellowbox you manually. This vaires depending on what pirate anoms youre trying to do. The only time I have aggro issues with it is if I my drones dont attack anything because the frigs only yellowbox me and cant get into range or if the NPCs spawns too far away from me.

6132176,0,t3_3zh6a6,The game itself is really brutal and no that is not an exaggeration but for some of us thats the whole point and the longer you play it the more you get to know everyone else who has played it  or at least if you dont know them you share a bond with them.The newbro starting experience is currently very confusing on top of all that which IMO is really hurtful to new player retention. So heres my big tip. When you log in youll be presented with these popups called Opportunities. Follow them for a bit but dont take them too seriously. What will be most helpful for you is to hit your F key and then go to Career Agents. Open that and pick one of those agents  it doesnt matter which  and right click on them to Start Conversation. A window will pop up that will show which station the agent is located in. Right click the station and choose Set Destination.Then look to your right corner to your overview which looks kind of spreadsheetish. The row that has turned yellow is your destination. If it is a box then it is a station and you are in the same system with the agent. If it is a circle with a horizontal halfslash thing its a stargate and you have a short trip to get to him or him. Either way right click or click and hold for a radial menu and select either Dock or Jump as appropriate and navigate to the agent.Once to the career agents do all their missions. The skillbooks they give are now redundant with a couple of exceptions but they still teach invaluable skills and doing the missions will leave you will several million ISK and a collection of useful ships including at the end of the Advanced Military one a nice destroyer.Welcome to EVE!,Eve,cymnxcm,4,t5_2qil9

If a pilot is not in a good corpalliance and also not well established isk wise personally. The risk of losing their fancy new ship and modules stops people from wanting to do things. If the insurance actually paid out some realistic market value of your ship and modules then I think you will see a lot more risky activity. Further there exists a player base that no matter what will enjoy aspects of gameplay that do not involve PVP or null.

From my experience isk is plenty in null.  Ran a data site found a M BPC. ran a combat anom got a M deadspace drop. Mined a few hours got a couple hundred mil in compressed ore.  etc. etc. note the BPC and deadspace drops are rare but you still get a good amount of isk from doing these things even without rare drops.I havent done too much PvP yet  not sure where the isk is there... From what I hear you can harvest tears and sell them in Jita but I could be wrong.My advice  decide what you think is fun for me this is a combo of mining ratting smallgang pvp PI exploration and anything else I can do with my low skills and find a group in null or maybe in a WH that does those things.  The added risk and additional reward make the game a lot better IMHO.  And you can typically fund yourself doing whatever you want with minimal effort  grind.,Eve,cyo9da5,2,t5_2qil9

6150493,0,t1_cyoayfr,You dont have much investment experience do you? CCP is a solid midrange company with their hands in a lot of baskets. They poses the most dynamic hardware infrastructure in online gaming...no other game can cram  people comfortably into the same room and account for all their actions. They have had a successful product that has grown and continues to grow for over a decade now they have several smaller projects that have also brought in a steady revenue source whether you like to believe DUST  was successful or not is irrelevant when the numbers show it was and is.CCP is not a Blizzard or EA level of juggernaut they arent going to grow  just because they announce a new game but they are hardly a trash company. Their stock would be consistent and a lot of smart investors would seek out such a stock commodity to support more risky spending elsewhere.I have traded stocks daily for  years. There is nothing on the surface that says CCP would be a trash stock if it were publicly traded they would be likely trending up presenetly rebounding from their abandoned project but even that isnt wholly bad because instead of continuing to throw money into the fire they sold their IP the vampire RPG or we and still pulled back some of their losses. As far as a business is concerned anyone who can remain competitive in the gaming market for  years without being consumed by a bigger fish or simply dying out is a successfully run business.Just because you dont like how CCP has handled EVE recently or think leaving DUST on PS only was a shitty thing really means jack shit when talking about investment potential. The more pies CCP puts their fingers into the better chance they have at hitting that homerun...Shit EVE itself back in the day was widely considered a garbage game something that belonged in the s and somehow got skipped over for a decade...look at it today.

6155468,0,t1_cyp2w91,And the main objection regarding refit removal is capital warfare. Lets have a hypothetical situation. Major nullsec group with ten times my numbers is fighting me. To survive I have to drop triage as we dont have pilot numbers to drop the  guardians instead of the  triage.To keep triage alive when its primaried I have to refit to max tank. At present this is no problem. Approach other triage refit off each other. Under the new system I either have to accept death as max rep fit triage cant tank for s sacrifice my fleet as I cant rep them whilst waiting to switch my resists out to tank the suicide dread they dropped or drop in with a cap unstable fit that reps about half as much ie. come max tank fit.The obvious solution here is to drop in max tank fits and scale the number of required carriers upwards. Or if they dont have the dps to melt halftank carriers to drop in carriers enough to let one of them not rep for part of the cycle so that you can have one triage in cycle and not repping at all times.The point is that the solution here is bring more carriers. Wait. That sounds..terribly like n warfare to me. Whoa. How did that happen?By allowing us to refit between tank and cap and rep and all these other modes the number of triage pilots you need is relatively low. By forcing us to drop in maxtank to survive if we are primaried and need twice as many caps or not rep for  of cycle having survived to refit to easily tank incoming dps and need more caps you favour people who have more caps. Guess what losec groups fighting at insane odds dont have the people to do?Now the same kind of questions can be asked for other things. Dreads are obvious as are supers and other capitals.Where it gets interesting is subcaps but their refits tend to much less drastic much less frequent not so situationally demanding and generally much lower impact.Adding on a s wait time for a mainline DPS ship to refit isnt the end of the world. Doing it for triage would be the act of not repping would by itself defeat the purpose of triage. Just as not shooting in siege defeats the purpose of siege. ,Eve,cypb90t,2,t5_2qil9

How much easier to you not think it is to earn m isk with an old character. You can do incursions rat plex more efficiently run missions and do exploration more efficient. With that much gametime you should be able to get m just as easy as someone new would get m. Assault frigs are way better than regular t frigs. If an enyo is doing a plex its going to crush tristan atron incursus and usually win a fed navy comet. Its not going to crush a garmur but if you are going to argue that its a t ship and therefore t ships are equally good as t without fcatoring in the cost then you can just as well say that flying a t ships are acutally better than t ships because you can fly an Utu.Ares is better tackle than atron Enyo is better to fight with than incursus Ishkur is better than Tristan Keres is better than Maulus Helios is better than Imicus Thalia is better than Navitas.

A  command destroyer jump would be  of them aligned to a target k away. They all activate their prop mods within  second of each other and then you get a chain effect the first pulling all three within k of the target the second jump pulls them all on top of the target the third going off jumps all three plus the target  k away form his original position. This in most instances would remove him from repair range of his logistics ships.In this instance the command destroyers pulled the TEST FC k away form his fleet and PL warped in to headshot him however the friendly logistics just managed to catch up with him in time and save him.,Eve,cytwbw0,5,t5_2qil9

Effectively limiting the number of potential participants and viewers. At the same time forcing players who live in an area of space the very nature of which fosters the type of small gang fighting highlighted by wspace and Iowsec to join an alliance shell or otherwise a la Rolled Out and Sky Fighters with Sky Syndicate or Hard Knocks and Hard Knocks Citizens to name just a few.But I digress.,Eve,cyxj9pc,3,t5_2qil9

Im not here to be some sort of hitman trying to undermine you and like I said I have mad respect for you I just think you made the wrong call and left because you thought things were a certain way but you didnt wait to see it play out. I also said before that Im glad you are having fun now I really am but I only retorted the way that I did because I thought you were coming at me and moreso my beloved alliance. I do love them most of all and I will stick up for them right or wrong even though I know deep inside that youre not the enemy. No I dont like some guys in PL but like I said there are some guys that I like very much so again  Im glad youre having fun. You went with what you went with but in the end of it were still tens of thousands strong. Sure now we may seem like bears or whatnot and not the elite pvp that PL is but thats not really the whole picture now is it? When one leader falls another rises to take his place. Someone will has? taken your place. Someone will has? taken Blwarfs place. Its the nature of the game. I LOVE some of those guys in PL that I talked shit about. I do what I must because despite my love for those guys I love my brothers in goons more than my love for lost friends and I stand with my family no matter what and as such I stand with our leadership until the bitter end. Just like I stood with you until you left. Perhaps we stand again together someday. If that day comes I welcome it. If I can reunite with Grath and Elise and my friends even penif who I admittedly towed the partly line on but in reality is my favorite and my most missed friend of all then I look forward to that day. In the meantime I must consider the legion as all of us are to consider them  a worthwhile adversary who must be undermined and fought on fronts that cannot for now revolve around ingame strategy. I hope the day comes when BR is seen as a small skirmish. I know it will come  what side you guys are on when that comes is not in my control. If we were to meet on the grid however I know you would be a worthwhile adversary so I look forward to that day with anticipation as I wait for the day I am reunited with my old friends  if on the other side of the coin this time. Take care of yourself and enjoy  again I am truly glad youre having fun with your guys and thats what is truly important. Its just a game after all. I havent forgotten that and I cling to the belief that our leadership hasnt forgotten that either. Be well.  ,Eve,cz6cuxg,-6,t5_2qil9

6314486,0,t3_421lbi,I payed one ransom ever back in  when I was doing booster production on an alt... warped to a gate on it thinking I was in a bomber actually flying an Itty with a bunch of booster production stuff in it. Realized I fucked up in warp landed on the gate with a bunch of tackle and Ts. Tried to align off but tackled GG. So I Jumped through held cloak and put a Ransom? in local.  When my gate cloak expired I was promptly tackled by like  of the T Cruisers while just sat there at ms in a show of good faith that I wasnt trying to ruse them. Not like an Itty without a cloak is going to sneak off They wanted m ransom given the value relative to my cargo and Nulli not having a reputation for scamming seemed like it was worth the gamble they would honor it. After making sure they were in agreement about which one of them I was supposed to pay I went ahead and sent the isk. Shortly later they dropped tackle I safely warped off to the nearest station the ransomer even wished me a good day.One of them convoed me after I got safe curious how much I was carrying so I guess their price was just a shot in the dark on their part. Looking them up now from my chat logs it was some guys from Gemeinschaft interstellarer Soeldner.The real problem with ransoms is that people usually want too much isk. Demanding m ransom on a BC is like  replacement cost and the victim has no idea whether to trust you. Gambling m with a m payoff if the ransom is honored just doesnt seem a reasonable proposition I would need to have a  chance of the pirate honoring for it to make sense to pay and we all know how frequent scams are in eve. And for most people a kill mail is worth more than the  ransom a reasonable person might be willing to pay. Given how many people just delay and never pay its often not worth bothering unless your pretty bored and willing to accept song ransoms. Frankly m was too high for most Ittys and they were just lucky that I had enough in mine to gamble on paying which I may not have done if I didnt know the alliance they were in.,Eve,cz7dyaa,2,t5_2qil9

If you need to build a web site then maybe focus on the APICREST more as you can get tons of information about the game from there then put that data into a database for use. Something simple like downloading data on some of the new CREST data here Or look through the documentation here On the first link Im not sure if its new but I think the charactersLocationRead to show where a character is could be fun to work with. Maybe make a map use the static data for this or CREST and show where a few characters are and maybe query something like asset locations or something. That way you get live data link static data and then update them every new cachedate.If you want to do anything with the market there are tons of things you can do. BTW databases are huge awesome digital buckets of usefulness. Its surprising how many people dont know how to use their wonderfulness.Hope that helps.,Eve,czd9l1i,2,t5_2qil9

The jump range has been severely limited and jumping gives you two timer before you can jump again and jumping quickly again will increase the time before the next jump.

Its a case full of edges. I think it makes more sense to have a concept of logistics reports.... maybe tied to kill mails.Maybe a logimail would give stats referencing the kms that happened over the same time period by his fleet...or by people he repped? Maybe logimarks would happen based on some metric of base hull ehps and reps or kill mails referenced.

6411566,0,t3_43i7us,C sites are manageable in a tengu yeah. It doesnt necessarily need to be passive tanked C sites neut but not so heavily that you cant fit to regen cap fast enough to get by anyway. Consult Rykkis wormhole PVE guide for the specifics so far as what kind of DPS youll need to tank and how heavy the neut pressure will be.So far as the logistics of it otherwise... Start by scouting extensively and doing your research! Youll want to either use a different ship for this or refit your tengu for probes and a cloak. When youre trying to assess a particular wormhole to decide if its suitable to run sites in you want to scan every signature in the system and check out all the connecting wormholes. If you see ships on dscan in your target hole or in any of its neighboring wormholes try to get eyes on them and figure out if they belong to active pilots or if theyre just pos trash. Consult zkillboard to determine if your wormholes residents or neighbors are active PVPers and also if there has been any recent same day activity there. Be wary of running sites in systems with too many connections especially if its a large system with entries off dscan from your sites or with active pilots especially PVP pilots in either the wormhole itself or in its neighboring systems. In line with the above your ideal target system is a C whose only current wormhole connection is its kspace static which you entered through with plenty of sites which is either unoccupied or occupied only be fairly inactive residents which has not had recent killboard activity and which is small enough that you can see the entry wormhole on dscan the sites youll be running. The closer you can get to these conditions the better. Once youre ready to start always keep your probe scanner window open with all signatures set to ignored that way you can immediately notice if a new signature spawns and pause to safe up and scan it down to ensure that it isnt a new wormhole that youre about to get dropped on through. Always deploy a mobile depot when you land at a site and try to stay fairly near it. Keep a set of warp core stabilizers in your cargo so that if you get tackled by just one or two ships you can usually refit and warp off. If youre too heavily tackled to have a chance of escape and you dont think you can fight your way out tear off any blingy modules and stash them along with your loot in the depot then return for it later  theyll only be able to reinforce the depot not destroy it so youll have a full two days to get back in there.  Dscan religiously! This ones kind of a given for wormhole living especially if youre solo but its worth repeating. If you find youre doing this frequently consider setting yourself up a second account. Having a second pilot even with only very basic skills to sit in a cloaky T frigate exploration frigate if you want to stick salvagers on it griffin if you want some emergency pocket sand to keep ears on a wormhole connection for you can be invaluable. It wont necessarily even cost you significantly if you use the buddy program to fuel your main account by activating the secondary one. Dont be greedy! If your gut says something isnt right  if you spotted a helios on scan but just for a second or if you saw probes flash up then disappear if your wormhole has half a dozen different entries and you dont feel confident that its a quiet chain  well better safe than sorry. Just pack up and move on. As a solo daytripper if you want to do things safely you should expect to spend at least as much time scouting out your target holes as you do running sites and sometimes even much longer. If you want a steadier stream of sites look into moving into a C or C wormhole with a C static  this is much more involved though and beyond the scope of what were discussing here now.If you have decent drone skills a passive shield tanked Gila refitting off a mobile depot is another good choice. The performance is similar but the ship will usually be a bit cheaper without risk of skill loss should you get dropped on and more capable of defending itself in case of a gank by hostiles with neuts. It doesnt work quite as easily as it did before the Gila was nerfed a patch or two back but still quite workable.,Eve,czifie8,4,t5_2qil9

From most lowsec players perspective the Imperium is a nearmindless lumbering blob with an odd star here and there thrashing about lowsec with a mentality most players there find anything from repulsive to comic.

Given that a plex will give one month of sub time which is m skill points with s and that injectors can inject k SP then assuming the cost of SP would be the same as the plex cost to obtain it this is CCP saying that injector skills will cost x regular training.

6532738,0,t3_453vng,Im biased heavily so Ill just say this. Its probably the best dread in the game right now. I think a Nag and maybe a shield Moros have more DPS but short of ganking towers or other caps they dont compare as a blap platform. The Phoenixs tank is also second to no dread. Im talking INSANE amounts of it. I have a Kintherm tanked Phoenix fit I use on Sisi sometimes and I commonly and effortlessly have tanked  Moros at Km. It has something like a  EHPS tank against Antimatter. Having something full tank fit thats also full DPS fit resulting in your space manatee shitting out  DPS is a sight to see. And when that inevitable driveby Titan shows up simply refit off a your neighboring depot or carrier to that specific Titans damage type and enjoy the pretty doomsday while youre still sitting above  shield. You can also switch out all that tank for application mods and ditch the torps for cruise missiles and suddenly your alphaing interceptors and marauders alike. Another benefit is that it can also serve as its own support platform when it comes to dropping on subcaps. With a Nag or a Moros youd need a webpointpaint boat but with the Phoenix you can just say fuck it and throw those in your  mid slots. Last but not least of the  dreads and the Rev Im fairly certain its the preferred PVE option. This isnt my area of expertise but I trained citadel cruise  last night with injectors so I could rat and see what kind of ticks Id get. Its on par with super ratting. Wormholers love it too. Of course all this might just go out the window when CCP fucks with dread guns in the near future. ,Eve,czv1ck5,19,t5_2qil9

Sad to see CCP stooping so low to acquiesce to the whiny entitled people.What part of Carriers and FAX being better than current and having current Carrier  be roughly equivalent to CarrierFAX  was so upsetting to people?I was perfectly skilled in a vastly overpowered ship and now that CCPs broken them into  ships I want to be perfect at both instantly even though theyll both be better than before!,Eve,czvgxi7,-2,t5_2qil9

6554924,0,t1_czxbtal,Hi Mates!As first revealed at EVE Vegas  we are making some major changes to capital ships in EVE in the upcoming EVE Citadel Expansion and you can expect additional dev blogs as more details become ready to announce.  In this blog Im going to cover the new Force Auxiliary capital class our transition plan for current carrier pilots new capital modules and some design discussion on combat refitting!Force AuxiliariesOne of the biggest components of our capital changes this spring is the new class Force Auxiliaries which some of our players have taken to calling FAX or FAux. This class represents capital repair logistics in a fully dedicated form. Heres the beautiful new ships and their preliminary bonuses as of nowApostle high slots  mid slots  low slotsAmarr Carrier Bonus per skill level     bonus to Remote Capacitor Transmitter and Remote Armor Repairer amount     bonus to all armor resistances     bonus to maximum capacitor poolRole Bonus    Can use  Warfare Link modules simultaneously     bonus to Armored Warfare and Information Warfare Links effectiveness     reduction in CPU requirements for Warfare Links    Can fit Triage modulesMinokawa  high slots  mid slots  low slotsCaldari Carrier Bonus per skill level     bonus to Remote Capacitor Transmitter and Remote Shield Booster amount     bonus to all shield resistances     bonus to maximum capacitor poolRole Bonus    Can use  Warfare Link modules simultaneously     bonus to Siege Warfare and Information Warfare Links effectiveness     reduction in CPU requirements for Warfare Links    Can fit Triage modulesLif  high slots  mid slots  low slotsMinmatar Carrier Bonus per skill level     bonus to Remote Armor Repairer and Remote Shield Booster cycle time    . bonus to local Shield Booster amount     bonus to capacitor booster charge strengthRole Bonus    Can use  Warfare Link modules simultaneously     bonus to Siege Warfare and Skirmish Warfare Links effectiveness     reduction in CPU requirements for Warfare Links    Can fit Triage modulesNinazu  high slots  mid slots  low slotsGallente Carrier Bonus per skill level     bonus to Remote Armor Repairer and Remote Shield Booster cycle time    . bonus to local Armor Repairer amount     bonus to capacitor booster charge strengthRole Bonus    Can use  Warfare Link modules simultaneously     bonus to Armored Warfare and Skirmish Warfare Links effectiveness     reduction in CPU requirements for Warfare Links    Can fit Triage modulesAll of the Force Auxiliaries will have a  m Fleet Hangar and a  m Ship Maintenance Bay.Some of you may have seen preliminary stats for these ships gleaned from early test server builds. Its important to remember that making predictions from unannounced test server details is always done at your own risk.In particular we want to reassure wormhole players that the mass values for the Force Auxiliaries on our test servers are designed to be released alongside an increase in the maximum jump mass of the existing capitalcapable wormhole connections. This pership mass limit increase is also designed to accommodate capitals fitting the new capital armor plates. Wormhole connections that currently allow Dreadnoughts and Carriers to pass through will continue to accommodate Dreadnoughts Carriers and Force Auxiliaries and will continue to disallow Supercarriers and Titans.There will also be corresponding changes to the stats of capital remote repair modules and triage modules at the same time. For instance dont worry about the loss of the range bonuses on the hulls as the range will be added to the base modules to compensate.TRIAGE CARRIER TO FORCE AUXILIARY TRANSITIONForce Auxiliaries are going to completely take over the old Triage role from Carriers leaving Carriers to focus on their new offensive capabilities. As a result we want to make sure that our transition plan accommodates all Carrier pilots. Heres how were planning to handle itFebruary ReleaseWe seeded Light Fighter and Support Fighter skills. You can begin training them immediately in preparation for the expansion!EVE Citadel Expansion    Any carrier with a triage module fitted T or T in station contract or ship maintenance array will be changed to a Force Auxiliary of the same faction.    Any carrier with a triage module fitted T or T in space will be changed to a Force Auxiliary of same faction. Its drones and fighters will be moved to its owners home station.    Force Auxiliary blue print originals will be available on the market.    You will only require the Fighters skill to use Light Support and Heavy Fighters.    The FighterBombers skill will be renamed to Heavy Fighters and give bonuses to heavy fighter squadrons. Heavy Fighter squadrons will only be launchable by Supercarriers.    The Light Fighter and Support Fighter skills will give bonus to Light Fighters and Support Fighters respectively. More details about the fighter transition plan will come in a later blog.No More Force Auxiliary SkillsOur original plan was to introduce a new dedicated Force Auxiliary skill. After player feedback weve decided to go another direction. Force Auxiliaries will instead use a renamed Carrier Skill. If youve already purchased a Force Auxiliary skillbook the purchase price and any skillpoints trained will be refunded.MODULESWhile were talking about Force Auxiliaries we though you might be interested in some of the new modules that well be releasing with the Citadels ExpansionCapital Ancillary Shield Booster and Armor RepairerReplicating existing Small Medium and Large Ancillary Shield Boosters amp Armor Repairers. The Shield Boosters will require capital sized Cap Booster charges while the Capital Ancillary Armor Repairer will still use Nanite Repair Paste. The armor versions of these modules will be limited to one per ship just like their smaller cousins.Remote Ancillary Shield Booster and Armor RepairerLimited to one per ship were introducing Small Medium Large and Capital versions. Like the local versions they require Cap Booster charges or Nanite Repair Paste to operate. These modules should add a new aspect of optimization gameplay to repair ships of all sizes.Capital Emergency Hull EnergizerWhen activated pushes the hull resists to  for  seconds. However it burns out after cycling once. This module is a type of Damage Control so you will have to decide if you want an Emergency Hull Energizer or standard Damage Control. Heavy Stasis GrapplersYou can find out more details about these here! Only fitable to battleships and capitals.Capital Scriptable Armor amp Shield HardenersSimilar to Armor Hardeners and Shield Hardeners but they can be scripted to provide either very weak protection from all damage types or high protection from a single damage type. These modules will allow capital pilots to react to incoming damage in a more customizable fashion than is possible with Reactive Armor Hardeners.COMBAT REFITTINGAs part of our work on capitals we have put together a capital focus group comprised of some of EVEs most experienced capital pilots. They are a great help to us. One of the hottest topics in that discussion group is the proposal weve made with the capital rework to restrict refitting in space whenever the pilot has a weapons timer. We are still planning to go forward with that plan and after a long talk on the subject we thought it made sense to include our reasons in this blog rather than just in the focus group.Lets talk about why we want to make this change. We feel that its essential to the fitting game and all combat in the game that you have to make commitment to decisions. These commitments scale depending on their impact think ammo choice vs ship choice but ultimately all of EVE is a about meaningful choices and their consequences.Refitting in space removed an enormous amount of commitment basically offering all possible fittings to any ship at any time so long as they have a CapitalNestorDepot nearby. The addition of more refitting service options Depots Nestors has brought this issue into sharper relief but the underlying design flaw has been in EVE for many years.,Eve,czxbz8e,15,t5_2qil9

CCP wants to stop people from generating alerts based on ingame events by out of game tools.As far as I am aware these are two different goals within the same spirit and two different limitations that would apply  Youre not allowed to use thirdparty tools to visually emphasize or highlight parts of your clients in any way that does not include the entire client. Using a thirdparty tool to manage your windows efficiently is permitted under this ruling.  You are not allowed to utilize a thirdparty application or method that generates any verbal or written alerts automatically based on information from within the client and logs.I think thats pretty clear at covering the two subjects without being too vague yet giving enough of a blanket to cover the case by case mindset. You can then set very specific exceptions to these broad rules such as   You are allowed to communicate with an external tool via CREST API.  You are allowed to utilize the IGB to parse your location to a service such as SiggyTripwireFleetup.That way everything is nice and defined easy to understand and still broad enough to not bog down in one corner.,Eve,d0bvtv7,2,t5_2qil9

The LY range of systems vs. their gate jump distance and which constellation theyre in is a huge strategic conundrum not often addressed in fozzie sov debates.Regardless if SMA was using all this space and the space was all RFd by single entosis ships surely SMA should have had enough pilots in the area to prevent the reinforcement.

Find a group that doesnt require anything from you much and experiment with things.If you join a PvP group more my cup of tea than say mining groups although those exist as well youll get some camaraderie far from propaganda and learn about people.

The only thing we really have to go off of when trying to judge how good HAW will be is rapid lightheavy missile launchers and those have been pretty stupid good so I feel like HAW will find their place.Also to address your other comment below The fact that you get to perfectly apply k dps to subcaps with just a vindi or two is pretty broken.  IMO the only reason you dont see more of it in kspace is because of the counterdrop threat but in wormholes dread blapping is pretty broken and in my experience at least the main thing that stops groups from doing it is knowing that people will stop fighting you if you dread blap them all the time.  Maybe these changes wont make blap dreads any more common in kspace but that has nothing to do with how strong blapping is and this should balance them out a bit for wormholes which adds another interesting option.,Eve,d0nur68,0,t5_2qil9

If people are only in wormholes to make isk and refuse to pvp we dont want them in wormholes anyway. Good riddance. People have been evicted for less.Play it my way or not at all. This is bullshit. Heres what it comes down to youre mad that people live in WHs and can deny you content on demand. Period. You argue that WHs arent a safe place for people to make your isk? WHs arent your personal playground where the only rule is give PvPers content as soon as you see them. If you want to gank someone work for it. Ive logged toons off for a couple of hours in a farm hole to jump on an active bear after he closes and pickets his holes. Ive camped HS connections when I know someone just put a DST through headed to a hub and gotten a DST full of fuel coming back in. Youre mad at the yacht because you cant kill it? Cry harder. The yacht isnt the problem. The problem is you want content on demand and youre not getting it. gt I did not start this discussion of nerfing higgs nullification.

Oh and one last thing  We dont want you in WHs if you dont play the way I like!! lol who gives a fuck who you want in WHs?

Im not sure but I think  dps is where you break through ancillary armor reppers depending on the fit.Those are average numbers of course Im sure someone is going to be annoying with their garmur slicer fit and how its lt dps and my numbers are dumIt also really depends on what kind of ship.  A slasher.. might do? maybe? Ive had fun with an executioner and beat my corpmate in a sabre in a duel with it.fot t frigate best bet is probably executioner. faction? garmur if you want to be a svipul.

At this point theyll rake in more dough by releasing something even if its mostly vacant of content and leaves  of their promises as future goals a fairly simple to make campaign and a basic MMO version release would net them a LOT more money given how well their uber hard shitty mobile game style microtransation system has worked.Creating a cult following of heavy spenders and fanboys while slowly crawling towards your goal and pocketing most of the incoming money is very effective probably more so than bailing on vaporware.Usually abandonment DOES happen eventually but theres so many more years this could be milked for which means releasing content even if its done slowly and poorly.,Eve,d12m1z8,0,t5_2qil9

Anything that matches and is not subscribed you can invoke hours for PLEX and grab what you can in four hours.There are lots of other hacking methods that work fine too. A lot of EVE players seem to fall prey to realisticlooking phishing attempts via email that look like official CCP emails. And of course EVE players share their passwords with each other and then those people turn out to either be careless or lessthantrustworthy.So dont be dumb dont share your passwords across accounts or websites dont share your passwords with others and change your passwords frequently.,Eve,d19bb0e,2,t5_2qil9

7006101,0,t1_d1aa5n8,Youre right that it doesnt work in cases like supers and titans because yes theyre expensive but theyre ultimately created by common minerals. Everything in the supertitan production chain is individually common and cheap but collectively expensive. Theyre only expensive as a whole because of the vast amount of inputs required.With faction gear like Shadows a necessary part of the production chain is a blueprint drop. Its price is high because of rarity not input costs. Supply is gated by RNG. Can faction gear be farmed and drop in price? Of course Rattlesnakes are a perfect example of this. But its inherently much more difficult to increase supply compared to something like a Titan or super.,Eve,d1ahiml,2,t5_2qil9

Theres a ton of groups that claim to be for the newbros but weve made great efforts to make that a reality. Aside from just free ships and skillbooks we also have an in game help channel open to all new players to get help with anything from pew to mining with friends from high low and null covering all time zones for you. We also specialize in small to medium gang fights so youre not lost in the blob wondering what to do like some of the big blob groups.What we offer above all else is memes. Lots and lots of memes. Literally the entire corp is memes. I dont know if any of us are real or just sweet meta puns. Real talk though check out our revejobs post for all the details laid out Definitely get in touch with us. With the recent changes to starting skills for new players you can literally jump into the fight and make a difference day one. Theres never a bad time. Were extremely active in Amarr FW and based in the heart of the war zone. Weve been trashing the Minmatar for a few months running now so no worry of getting stuck in a deaddying militia.

7048087,0,t3_4c5r7q,Its really difficult to explain to an outsider since there is so much history and nuances to every major conflict in EVE Online. The game is a sandbox and have been online for about a decade so there is a LOT of player history around.In short there is this coalition called the CFC or The Imperium as they have rebranded themselves now. They are the largest coalition by far in the game something like  ? members. Since the Great War where the CFC and their allies managed to defeat Band of Brothers the previous big boys of the galaxy the CFC have grown until they dominated the map. Due to tons of different reasons a lot of animosity has built up between the CFC and basically almost everyone else. This is probably the war thats spinning up now where a large effort to try and bring them down is starting to take place.Although its far from certain a major war will take place yet since it is so early and the loose coalition of alliances that are hitting the CFC are basically trying to find leverage to launch it into a larger conflict. If that goes badly they might just pack up and go home and let the CFC keep on being the CFC.The Vale of the Silent is a region in the EVE Online galaxy cluster. It was previously held by one of the CFC alliances but they just announced that they were going to abandon it due to the invasion by the new coalition thats fighting the CFC. So so far the invasionwar is going well for the new coalition and badly for the CFC.

Then the attackers would have to think it was possible to win and throw everything they have into the battle as well. It could also be sparked off because something big Think Titan or some supercarriers get tackled either in range of both groups or close enough to in range for both to get there.

It can be done but it takes sacrifice and commitment and knowledge that things DO get easier. I love my kids but kids will take everything you have and resent you for having nothing left. Thats just how they are. That takes a toll and I would recommend getting professional help. The long battle of being a parent of an autistic child takes a toll like when you KNOW the enemy is nearby but you dont know where.They made me take pills and I hated it but dammit if it didnt work. I also adjusted my diet and got more active stepped away from video games and out into the world with my kids.Good luck and be tough buddy.

On the other hand whatever longerterm response those bee guys have planned its hard to imagine that it would go worse if they still had all their space to safely make ISK in all the extra supercaps whose production has been aborted and the thousands of members whove left in the face of uncountered MBC aggression.

Not only does this make for slightly more meaningful gameplay than just shoot a rat but it also adds a potential income source for newer players selling them to the lazy or a potential conflict driver for lowsec especially if you made better drops occur there. ,Eve,d1ygwz7,11,t5_2qil9

Is out of game social engineering part of the game or isnt it?  Is it fair game to build trust with someone even going so far as to spend time with them in person when my hidden agenda is to abuse that trust to take them down in a video game?  CCP said yes and that was a fateful choice for the culture of the community.The guy who published that stupid article and no doubt encouraged and approved it is the consequence of that choice personified.  His claim to fame in the game is his selfproclaimed ability to engage in said social engineering.So yeah the lines are blurred but he didnt blur them.

7265248,0,t3_4ewqda,gt One reason CCP Games could be eager to see the end of Gianturcos reign is a new project of his. Gianturco is offering other game developers access to his trusted band of mercenaries. He will hire out these players to help developers test their new games environments  for a fee of course. The reason for this move is to protect himself and his allies against the failure of the Eve Online universe.This part is fascinating. The Mittani has threatened to remove Goons from Eve before it happened during Incarna as a response to Monoclegate. That resulted with him being flown to Iceland where after an intense weekend of discussion Mittani was hailed as the player who saved the game from the folly of its developers.The phrase failure of the Eve Online universe straight from the Mittani through the journalist to us unquestioned means the failure of the Eve Online universe to be a suitable place for The Imperium.I wonder how many of the people in Saranen patiently waiting for their space emperor to produce a masterstroke will accept being told fuck CCP were all off to Crowfall or wherever.

7267180,0,t1_d243lmv,Explaining MechWarrior politics is difficult because it stretches back decades.  The short of it is that some of the most active and heavyspending whales think Pareto principle dont exactly make the best or most capable players.  Theyre really invested in the game because theyre diehards but a lot of them are clueless as to how to expand a games appeal.  A lot of these players are also older and really stubborn.The upper management of PGI the developers were doing a lot of things wrong and were enormously hostile to criticism.  They surrounded themselves with the heavy spending whales and courtiers.  When rmwo started to ask tough questions about the state of the game the staff started disappearing and the core of the whales not wanting to hear dissent either left with the booted moderators and formed routreachhpg.  Anybody who had put in effort trying to help reform the game has long since given up on MWO and left which explains rmwos tumbleweed population.Myself and many other units banded together with the Goons under the savemwo initiative.

7314210,0,t1_d29hspx,Note that much of my experience was before Fozziesov when I was a newbie. Though I still am a newbie.The Null PvP you hear about revolves heavily around larger groups. Often its FCs who are making the bulk of tactical decisions. What ship you fly is the one that your FC tells you to fly. You will engagedisengage via being told to align and then you get fleetwarped. You have a dedicated scout gathering intel. Your targets are called by your FC and you had ought to be shooting the given target. Your performance will be gauged not on individual standalone prowess as much as it will be determined by your ability to work as a component of a larger overarching whole. Personally while it makes fantastic blog posts and is amazing to read about its less fun to actually be in. It is fun to say I was there! after the fact when you are able to look back and realize what you helped accomplish though.In solo PvP an experience which seems to be catered for primarily in Lowsec. You have to perform many of the tactical duties of a fleet all on your own. You have to decide when and who to engage you are the one tracking them down you will be fitting a ship according to your skills and preferences not the FCs. You will be the one to scout them and tackle them and kill them. Solo your personal skills against your opponents will determine what wins the fight not the FCs.Even in small gangs with  people youll still be making many more decisions and be much less along for the ride. Every players skill and ability to think on their feet is valuable while your FC may be calling targets but youll be flying your own ship perhaps an ECM ship where your FCs commands hold no bearing on what youre doing as you focus on making sure that your opponent isnt opponenting.Socially a lowsec corp is typically much smaller than a normal one. The one im in is  members strong. But at the same time youre not drowned out in a sea of talking people. I know everyone there I know why were there. When we fly together there are no requests to clear comms we can chat as much as we like. If you were to try that in a fleet of over  it would  and does  get very loud.

The other is one of the most engaging and rewarding gaming experiences you will ever have. One that will pull you time and time again into the Awesome.The difference is very simple joining a group good or not joining a group bad. To start out join a group that caters to new players. My recommendation is Pandemic Horde. In game channel is Join Horde. Regardless of who you pick join a new player friendly group get on their comms get on their IRC read their new player guides ask questions and go on fleets with them.

The structure owner would know exactly when that would happen everyone else might only know the window.Active gameplay along the lines of a periodic opportunity windows will not suddenly make Rs not worth holding.

Naturally they will fly stuff like caracals and the main point of their fleets is to have fun. They dont need to win a war since the MBC is a coalition and helps out its allies when they need it. Your point is still a bit weird though considering Mittani is obsessed with caracal and interceptor fleets. I guess you admitting that coalitionlevel caracal fleets will never win a war is a start though so keep learning and youll pull through.gtundocking and welping fleetsAs long as they are having fun and learning how to get better its completely fine.

This is what I mean when Goons think theyre above the rules. gtSorry Im still stuck on the fact that moderators here use spies in some groups chat to moderate this subreddit.So you admit you were caught? Good. We dont have spies you guys really really think about reve a lot and overestimate how it functions.gtIve got a report in there about being told to commit suicide which is clearly lower priority because its someone from TISHU and I probably deserve it according to reves moderators.Oh stop being such a dramatic baby I deserve it seriously grow up from these childish arguments implying I want you to kill yourself. Typical hopscotch leaps of logic.

I suggest you get out of highsec  despite the additional danger  and join up with a group like Eve Uni who will teach you how to BECOME the dangerous one.

That money went onto the incursion toon to buy and fully fit a Rokh as well as buy skillbooks. I had more then enough left to also grab the two Rokh skins.I ignored her for a month or so then started to go fly incursions. Theyre cancerous but about to the same degree as speedtanking sites with a VNI or an Ishtar.

Most people in highsec dont want to pvp they want to be left alone. If you force them all to do it they will quit eve and the economy will suffer.

7532909,0,t1_d2ycvcg,The core concept of highsec is to discourage unwanted pvp otherwise why have Concord thats the point of the duel system? If I want to stay in highsec so that I can be free to run my missions or mine then that is my choice. Yes you can come attack me but you will lose your ship so that limits you by deciding how much I am worth to you. There are ways that we can make ourselves much less valuable so as to discourage you further. If CCP plans to nerf POSes and possibly even NPC stations then highsec citadels should have the same protection as pilots. Unless wardecced it should get you killed for attacking one. The wardec mechanic also needs to change too many assholes pick on highsec industrial corps because its too easy and cheap to do. Also CODE are you fucking kidding me? You guys run around blowing people up because they are afk mining and  different reasons. You guys feel like you are the eve police. If someone isnt playing the game the way you think they should you harass them. Nobody made you the enforcement of whatever doctrine you feel is the reason for the game. ,Eve,d2ygdlb,1,t5_2qil9

7533447,0,t1_d2ygdlb,gtThe core concept of highsec is to discourage unwanted pvp...It is of course not. Nonconsensual PvP is at the heart of the game design. CONCORD is there to provide consequences and a cost to aggression. Thats it. That provides an economic disincentive to random aggression and thus some protection for small group and solo players to operate. Proof that highsec is every much a PvP zone as the others can be seen by the fact CONCORD can be turned off against any corporation for just an administrative fee. You are not intended to be able to operate without thought to your defence or in the absence of risk. gtIf CCP plans to nerf POSes and possibly even NPC stations then highsec citadels should have the same protection as pilots. Unless wardecced it should get you killed for attacking one.Citadels do have the same CONCORD protection as as pilots and require a wardec to explode probably two actually as it will take longer than  days to fully explode one. I am not sure what you are complaining about. gtNobody made you the enforcement of whatever doctrine you feel is the reason for the game. Its called emergent game play. CCP provides the sandbox and we players provide the content. If a group wants to claim highsec and enforce their claim with space violence that is completely within the spirit and design of the game. The reasons for blowing people up are for the players to decide. Or perhaps you have an approved list of reasons of when it is acceptable to attack another player that I might have missed? ,Eve,d2yikuy,0,t5_2qil9

The steady decline in activity saddens me because I still think it is a promising concept I wish there was more I could do to help revive it.I want to stress that anybody can use the channel as a place to not just talk about MicroGang but to organize fleets. We have a mailing list teamspeak experienced pilots who can offer advice and at one point had a website with suggested fits not sure if still up or up to date. This is to enable players to get past the learning curve sooner.If nobody answers your questions in chat dont hesitate to mail any of the Warlords. I will respond it may take a few days though.There is no minimum level of competency before you are allowed to take a fleet out or join one. I encourage people of all skill levels who are interested try their hand at leading a roam. The barrier to entry for MicroGang is low. Some of the best MicroGang fleets I have been on or heard of have been in cheap disposable ships no links new players and not everyone made it back alive.

7628786,0,t3_4jrocn,I think there needs to be a complete overhaul on the bonus system.I tend to prefer Baking all race specific bonuses into a single link Bake the implant bonuses into various meta and faction links or make the implants provide a flat bonus to any link being used Allow all link bonused ships to fit  links and remove command processors and remove all utility slots on any boat that can use links. Each link fit will have a slight local tank bonus Flatten out the ship bonuses between T boats and T boatsI feel this would remove the ridiculous and required clone swap when you are trying to run leadership bonuses for different fleets.  Greater flexibility in what ship the link pilot wishes to use.   Removing the utility slots forces choice between DPS and fleet utility.  Flattening out the bonuses allows more use for the lower rung of link boats.There may be a need to refund some SP for this but if the idea of toning down the reliance upon links is the goal then we need to make some drastic changes.,Eve,d39coix,1,t5_2qil9

Plus ideally some of the missions would prepare them for the journey. Maybe a deadspace course fo a few rooms and an RP module to call the fleet to take you through various travel and scouting related activities like making safes coming in at angles to avoid bubbles.Could even do something where a group like the BR would create classes of say every player who entered this chain of missions in two week chunks and puts them in a chat room like incursions do to encourage them to pack up for safety.,Eve,d3bhvkz,1,t5_2qil9

7797458,0,t3_4m4cdn,Hey broFellow high school bro in this corp. I should start by saying that I am in no way trying to judge you or anything. So just keep that in mind in what I say.Ive been through a not entirely different situation from you. I was bullied quite a bit in elementary school and middle school although now that I am a  tall freshman I have been lucky enough to avoid it. I have one rl friend who I havent seen in months. I am perhaps less affected than you are by that bc I have ASD and I dont especially mind not having friends but I still feel you. With regards to feelings of suicide if you havent already you definitely need to seek professional help or talk to the help you already have.My next piece of advice to avoid this situation again is that you spend a bit more time looking at whether you will fit in in the gaming group in question. I genuinely dont think that we are a good fit for you. You werent actually kicked for making a gatecamping thread  you were kicked for your response to how the thread proceeded. A member made a joke which was funny and lighthearted. I have ASD  I often have difficulty with sarcasm and I dont always knoe when someone is joking. But it was obviously a joke  perhaps with a bit of hazing but a joke. You responded very poorly imo  not a judgement of you Ive made an ass of myself too but that is the fact of the matter. When applying to join this corp I was warned by the same recruiter who worked with you that I would get hazed a lot. And I was asked if I was prepared for that. I said yes. I probably got some of the worst hazing of the new members because of my unfortunate name but I was able to handle it. Presumably you werent. In future I would advise you to take careful consideration of that.Another thing which leads me to suggest that is what you say about how all your PvP is gate camping and that you arent an elite PvPer. You also say the reason you do that is bc you are sick of dying over again. A huge part of our philosophy is that while we dont all go in elite we all do our best step up and learn from those around us. Your attitude simply gatecamping doesnt really match up with that.Again I want to reiterate that none of this is a judgement of you  we all play the game differently and that is totally ok. I really do wish you the best of luck and I am sorry for how much you are affected by this.In conclusion I would strongly advise you to put great care into finding your next eve home. A poster in this thread mentioned Provi  I think based on having spent  of the  months Ive played living there that would be a good choice for you. If youd like I can point you to a corp that I think may be a very good fit for you a corp I called home for  months. Theyre a chill group who fly in a regularly active gatecamp with nearby blues and are usually very respectful to each other.My bestBlinky Jimmy Waffle,Eve,d3shsnh,16,t5_2qil9

7909535,0,t3_4nld0k,Links have no real involvement in them. This is my biggest complaint. There is no choice behind the use of links. Either you have them and its awesome to have them on so you turn them on or you dont have them.Making links on grid is a conceptually good option. It means you can kill the link ship and that it has to be actually flown. On a theory level this is awesome and how it should have always been. In practice however its just another buff to the blob who can keep their links alive and are able to sacrifice more of their DPS pilot pool for links. I think the overall best possible answer to links is to straight up remove them. Theres not a ship left that ONLY has a role of links. Command Ships are all great at combat and Command Destoryers really only have links attached as an after thought. The only ship that you couldnt just delete the link bonus from is the T subsystems which could simply be repurposed some howdefensive subs are pretty populated anyway so just steal something from the other Ts. The other issue with AOE links is that it really gives a buff to brawling and a nerf to kiting.The other option that would do some really good things would be to make them targetable. The rep links would need to be rethought since youd really just want to put them on a logi and never move them. However it would make flying links an ACTIVE role. Youd have to keep up with who to add links to moving speed and tackle range links onto the tackler who is going in for tackle keeping up with who is being shot at to give resist links. ,Eve,d453uir,14,t5_2qil9

I have absolutely zero experience with GCS and very little experience building EVE spreadsheets at all.  I learn quickly and am by no means a computer layman but is using this going to be akin to my cat trying to read the American Journal of Physics? I do have access to Excel and Im familiar with it.

Either they they have super tiny windows or theyre a bit lacking in scale.To estimate super capital scale take the visual information of two windows on different levels i.e. window on deck n and the window below on deck n on a FAX and apply that ratio to your desired ship. The Leviathan windows are pretty small and dont represent the heights of decks that youd see on a FAX.

8049419,0,t1_d4kt6a4,Ah yeah I think we agree with each other then. I just realized I totally misused the word profilic when I meant quality. xDA lot of the people I was thinking of were quality over quantity. Despite many of them being one and done you could expect someone else to pop up every few months.gtThere are far more of them than there were even a year ago. Pretty much any battle of any size at all gets a video.Man you dont even know the half of it and a lot of them are so bad not even talking about piloting skill. With OBS free becoming available versus paying for fraps which required a proper setup its like players nowadays just hit record on a roam toss some music on speed it up and upload it. Believe it or not in addition to having higher quality intros  editing and overlays the more well known video makers would pay active attention to their camera angles and zoom distance.

When you find the corp stay loyal to them if you can.  It takes patience to teach and being there for them when you finally know how to fly is the best way you can pay them back.

Depending what one does hauling alt on same account helps to separate the work. Without second training queue there is no point to train hauling skills to alt instead of main. Except of course standings or to have hauler in npc corp e.g. protect against wardecs. Like if you are null pilot and you need to do hisec hauling for your PI.People use multiple accounts to be able to do more things at the same time. People use them for intel eyes in systemsgateswormholes. Or people can move their DST with second account while main account is making sure there is no camps.Basically with friends you dont need accounts but if you like solo EVE you will end up having multiple.Also its handy to have one trade hub Jita pilot so you can always buy and sell stuff there and use contracts to get the stuff where your main is.,Eve,d4vg6e2,1,t5_2qil9

8146472,0,t3_4qs6qo,Id like to see a whole slew of new anchorables preferably with nontedious setup or maintenance mechanics attached to them.A mechanism for making intermediate anchorables somewhat defensible without relying on an arbitrary HP buffer seems like it would be useful.  To that end Id argue that we need some sort of anchorable object that puts certain minor anchorables drilling platforms scanning arrays masking arrays beachhead lodgemnts cyno networks OGB projectors assembly facilities refineries or what have you into a conditionally invulnerable status.  This protector anchorable would have to be pushed over to make the minor objectives vulnerable.  Entosis comes to mind but frankly I prefer to see something that is vulnerable at least  hours of every day if not all the time.  Another option is give a sieging dread just a single one the ability to destabilize this array after a given amount of time knocking down the content walls on a whole smattering of minor to medium sized objects throughout a claimed system.  They could then be found and assaulted by normal subcaps or any kind of ship to good effect.  Deployment of a protector anchorable would have to be conditional on something that both defenders and attackers can affect like ADM or some new mechanic.  Conditional sov would be nice but its a pipe dream right now.Id like to see a whole range of deployables aimed as much at individuals as for different size groups of players.  It would result in a lot of dscan clutter as POS modules already are but frankly that is more a problem of the deeply flawed directional scanner than it is for the idea of player cultivated environments.  CCPs biggest fear is that players will have to load thousands of objects when the enter a system.  There are probably sneaky ways to get around this however it could also be addressed by economic means.  For example an entire system could have a deployables budget.  If there was a rent attached to that the rents could go up for each registered deployable until players voluntarily spread themselves out.  Perhaps there might be a way for groups of players to upgrade or reinforce their systems via risked investment but thats a high level design consideration.,Eve,d4vut8e,1,t5_2qil9

But there is a very strong correlation with the revival of content lately after the CFC has crumbled as the sovholding powerhouse they were before.We can argue about the finer points of propaganda but while both CFC and PL still have big sticks to dick around with it did lead to a surge in content all over the place. That EVE went after the CFC is entirely their own fault for becoming what they tried to fight years ago. Its their own fault to let people like Digital Ebola and Xenuria have a platform to commit their depravities. So dont come here bitching about the fact that people went and blobbed you as the CFC as a whole has caused this themselves.,Eve,d4x577i,2,t5_2qil9

Then file a ticket and include the entire bundle of logs if you can and poke someone like CCP Falcon until you can get ahold of someone up the chain that you can pass the mess off to directly along with the ticket number.As someone who does bugfixing for a living something like that would be a gold mine for a bug like this that just sort of randomly shows up and affects random people all doing more or less the same thing.

8181958,0,t1_d506v7e,I think your idea of what the game is supposed to be is a little overly restricted.Youre never supposed to be entirely safe and you can never entirely escape other players but its absolutely intentional that a lot of this content can be run entirely solo especially the highsec stuff. The same goes for a lot of content in other MMOs. Devs have realized that there is a subset of players who like to play with others but dont actually want to play with others if that makes sense. Theyre essentially happy with a limited solo experience because they either like the game or like the idea that there are other people in the universe with them and you cant really do anything to force these people out into the rest of the game.Personally I take the philosophy of to each his or her ownBy that same token youll never force a lot of players to take risks theyre not comfortable with when theyre trying to make their ISK. If you make it extremely likely that someone will lose a Carrier with any regularity then youll probably see people just stop risking them because if youre going to lose a Carrier on average once every couple of weeks then someone will probably lose one their first day out or twice in one week and not be able to buy another and then what do they do?Plus on top of that if you cant actually secure space to some degree then the whole idea and benefit of Sov kind of goes out the window.As much as many people like to go on about how X doesnt pose enough risk and should be made more risky what I dont think most realize is that what theyre actually asking for is for that activity to be done less. For example there was no joke a thread on the FaID section of the official forums going for over two years where someone wanted CCP to inject Low Sec between the four empires make the only way to get from Jita to Amarr to pass through Low because they thought this would turn the game into a gankers paradise.,Eve,d50aman,1,t5_2qil9

8182397,0,t3_4re7td,Hi again everyone its been a long time coming but finally managed to get a new and somewhat novel plot made up with some of the monthly economic report data im just waiting for someone to show me where CCP Quant already did this P This one shows the ratio of player to corporation ISK in wallets plotted from  up to about April . The faded line is the raw data and the thick solid line is a smoothed model that is simply there to highlight the general trends in the data over time. A higher ratio means players had relatively more ISK in their wallets compared to corporations and a lower one means they had relatively less ISK. I hope you find it as interesting as I did that there were quite large swings in this ratio over the last number of years. Speculating reasons why is always fun In case you missed my last post here it is  and shows volumes of trade over time annotated with significant events.  I also have an album going where Im storing all these plots which you can find here including an updated version of my first plot thats a lot clearer to read and zooms in at around where WWB started.  All plots and data were processed in R with the ggplot package.Anyway I hope you all enjoy and if you have any questions or want to know anything about how I made these plots then please let me know. Fly safe oEdit As uChevisPreston has pointed out having a yaxis that doesnt start at zero can be misleading so just watch out for that when interpreting the graph. The graph is intended to highlight trends and sudden changes which justifies the use of a truncated yaxis. Ill upload a plot with the full axis to my album here.,Eve,d50cljx,8,t5_2qil9

However it would have been hard to make such suggestions when the system first came out where I had no experience with it and could not work out where the strengths and where the weaknesses of the system were.

8324707,0,t3_4tjw5t,Speed and timing is key.  Once you kill the center group anyone can open the can.  If you agro the other two groups by getting too close to the can or using drones things get all soupy and you have to wipe the room seems to me like its always the LAST cruiser...Keeping the center group lured out around the beacon and wiping them means a quick mwd run to the can and bouncing out of the room.If someone comes in and messes up the run you can try sitting on top of the can and spamming open as you pop the ships in the ensuing hairball until you manage to pick out the ones from the original group.Sometimes there are extra angels that warp in aggrod.  I havent tested if they are required kills to open the can.There doesnt seem to be any correlation to extra angel sorties or security status and extra lootimplants in the can.   At least that Ive been able to figure out.If Im running the room and someone else comes in Ill usually offer them the loot if they dont call down the aggro.  I really just want the point.  If they mess up my run though its a free for all but with a cynabal ms in mwd I can usually manage to stick close enough to the original group to ride out a damp and still get to the can in time for the button spamming contest.At . AUs I can be first in the room pull and lock up the center group and launch drones to swirl the hairball before the rest of the gang shows up and then Im  systems away pulling a fresh group in another shipyard while they wait for a second loot drop in the can.Ive seen guys in rookie ships swiping loot and picking up points just by being on grid at the right time Ive had big menacing gangs of tengus bounce in and assfuck themselves by running for the can and pulling the agro before IDing the right group and having to grind out the entire room while bumping their billion dollar toys on the can trying to pull a half mill in extra loot.  Ive had people warp off a finished room when I show up on grid leaving the loot?I once accidentally locked up a myrmidon in high sec while twirling in the serpent hairball... you get tired by the th shipyard... and didnt get a crim timer.  I unlocked and bounced when he started locking me back.  It was .  there was no crimewatch icons popping up my safety was on.  I have not reattempted.

8358794,0,t1_d5md6vu,you have no idea what ccp will or will not do and since they have not said shit about mining in god knows how long all you are doing is guessing in the wind. gtLike I said theres no way theyll do anything that increases difficulty for the same yield and if the market determines that the net effect here will be more minerals on the market and thus lower prices then there will probably be a selloff which would crash prices in the short term.you bash me for making assumptions and then all you do is make assumptions fucking roflgtBig big difference these things are not equivalent at all. The number of people who relied on IS Boxer was relatively small relative to all Eve players so the net effect of removing it was also fairly small in terms of number of accounts affected. It also was well received by everyone outside of those who used ISBoxer extensively so the overall community reaction was positive.the only fact so far is that isoboxer got banned and CCp cared more about the game than the multiboxers you are also making a huge assumption on how many people used isoboxer and how many people multibox mining also the reason people multibox mining is because the income is a joke if you dont multibox. miners are not multiboxers by choice. gtThis is reinforced by it being extremely unlikely that anything they do to make mining more interesting is going to pull significant numbers of people away from other areas of the game to mine so the change would only really be for miners not for everyone else.thats an assumption. also go fuck yourself with downvoting every comment i make  if you are gonna downvote my comments then dont bother responding you tool ,Eve,d5megb6,0,t5_2qil9

8415090,0,t1_d5tf0rr,All of that stuff about this making AT ships less likely to be fielded is fine with me. The only reason  ships is more survivable than one is because of how strong the ships are not because its somehow magically fair and more likely to result in both ships surviving.Youre also assuming that an unfair AT and a fair AT generate the same base number of views. Personally I suspect that the AT generates more buzz overall when its fair and competitive rather than when one team runs away with the game.Its also worth noting that the AT doesnt make money for CCP by itself its a big advertisement for Eve Online and a lot of nonplayers watch it. To be worthwhile those extra special ship views need to come from nonplayers which is unlikely since they wont really appreciate how special the ships are and are more likely to be linked to close nailbiter matches by third party sources as opposed to look at this stomp it involves billion in ships! lawl!.gt Except its not the best compromise in the slightest.Its a compromise between people wanting to see these rare and special ships in the tournament and people wanting to see fair fights. Ive already said this several times.It makes things more fair because as you yourself just illustrated  AT ship has a lot less swing power than  or more and as I outlined previously its also much more acquirable for a team if they want to invest that much into the tournament which makes it more fair than unrestricted use of unique hulls.,Eve,d5tfhb7,1,t5_2qil9

Edit and be ruthless about it. Dont use nine words if you can cut it to five. Dont use words like diaspora resurgent or coalesce unless you a need them and b know what they mean. Dont say player versus player we know what PvP means. Passive voice is your enemy.A twosentence example CONDI occupies over  different systems in the region.

So since you insist there should be more risk to reward theres almost zero here. Sure s are lucrative if you have the comp and SP to run them which means absolutely nothing the average player in Eve.

Eve doesnt have the population or production to maintain fully stocked markets all over the map there just isnt the demand.

Defenders if they actively use the space they live in make it harder to take.  It only takes  minutes on an ADM system to take it.  Use T links so its and not burner T frigs designed to pop when another ship merely looks at it and it generates fights.   And its not all day.  between   mins on  day to start it.   days later between mins  X hours depending on how many people from both sides show up to attack  defend.Regardless  you get to shoot shit and get dank killmails.Goons new meta is whining about playing these days.  ,Eve,d6hppdv,-4,t5_2qil9

8618639,0,t1_d6ivqy6,I dont even know where to start dude....Lets go over mercoxit first. A maxed out miner with max boosts pulls in around m  hour mining mercoxit Thats even with  yield implant  michis. You cant mine mercoxit at any given moment. Anoms dont have an infinite amount of mercoxit in them so the total iskh actually is way lower than that.The other methods you mentionedLevel s in hostile space gt that one is actually reasonable but lowsec is just a giant clusterfuck when it comes to PVE anyway. It doesnt matter what youre looking at be it Ls ratting exploring mining the income possibilities of lowsec are bad across the board once you compare the risk vs rewards vs preparation time.Running DEDs gt What exactly is hard about running DEDs? Theyre all the same get a standard Tengu fit from any forum do  minutes of reading done. Its not like its rocket science to shoot red crosses in the right order.Hunting with Blops gt This one is so stupid i dont even know what to say...And even if we disregard your absolutely horrible list of PVE activities theres still the comparison between mining and ratting. Sitting semiafk in an anom or ten while watching netflix takes less micromanagement than multiboxing the same amount of miners with the added benefit that you just get isk dumped into your wallet without having to worry about compressing  exporting  refining or whatever. And even if you get caught you lose one VNI or Ishtar instead of  barges  exhumers  a freakin rorqual.The whole point of your post is that PVE should be balanced with the amount of prep time you need to do and that will never be the case as long as people can afk rat or fly brainafk incursions in highsec. Both of those wont change though so this whole discussion is retarded.,Eve,d6ixh1g,1,t5_2qil9

8658116,0,t1_d6lhr5r,As the lead customer support server and tools developer Im going to go ahead and strongly encourage against this.TLDR Doing this will more than likely bite you in the a later on.First of all that number is far from accurate and while it remains a fact that weve become much more lenient when it comes to reimbursing ship losses as well as other things that is not by accident.A little backstory for context firstFor a long time the policy regarding reimbursements was simply No unless we can prove without a doubt that the loss was due to a bug or other issue on our end. The historical reason for this is complex but the biggest factors were concerns about the effect reimbursements might have on the overall EVE economy as well as the fact that we had very limited tools logs and resources to use to investigate ship losses and those in place were clunky slow and hard to use and understand. A blanket Nope! unless there were clear indications on our end of a bug or other server issues was the only realistic course of action lest we have the majority of the GM department dive into hours of confusing investigations for each and every case.A little over three years ago the CS department decided to kickstart their own development department in order to develop tools and utilities for players and GMs alike and move towards a more work smarter not harder way of doing things. Among the early improvements implemented was a massive rework on how we handle and investigate ship losses and the viability and potential impact of reimbursements. This led to a dramatic reduction in the time it took to investigate these cases as well as a much higher degree of accuracy in terms of spotting when reimbursing a ship would impact the game andor its economy in a negative way. As a consequence we could quite confidently switch out the old draconian policies of No unless... over to something more akin to When in doubt err on the side of the player... in addressing requests for reimbursements.Now the reason Im telling you this is because we were quite worried that this move might lead to players abusing or attempting to abuse there more lenient procedures so we built in quite a few safeguards into our new tools one of which Im going to dub the boywhocriedwolf flag. In short we track and log not just every ship loss and every reimbursement but also every reimbursement request as well as the final decisions for yesno calls on them and the reasons for those calls. This is mostly so we can spot and identify reoccurring patters that might indicate and issue with the game e.g. these types of ships seem to blow up  of the time when engaging this type of NPC even though statistically they should have a  chance and so on but this also means that if a player keeps abusing the new reimbursement policies by continuously spamming reimbursement tickets for every silly ship loss that gets flagged especially and can eventually lead to a blanket Nope! stance taken on any reimbursement requests for that player.Im very happy to say that as it turned out this very VERY rarely happens and that out decision to trust you guys to only request reimbursements when you feel confident that something was not right was a solid one and has not lead to increased abuse attempts or to players trying to game the system.But to be absolutely clear spamming reimbursement tickets WILL lead to bad things and if the time comes when you have to request reimbursement of your brand new INSERTBIGASSBATTLESHIPHERE loss due to what you suspect was a server issue but our records show nothing conclusive you do not want that boywhocriedwolf label blinking red in a GMs face cause of those  times you tried to get your INSERTCHEAPASSFRIGATEHERE back after the Sansha blew you up. ,Eve,d6nvoil,2,t5_2qil9

If you sub a buddy trial with a starter pack the recruiter is told Your friend upgraded their trial with an ineligible payment method.Since the reward is  days of time CCP requires that a normal full price of  days completed transaction with CCP occurs  either by the recruit subbing with  recruiter gets choice of a plex or  days of sub or by the recruit subbing with a plex recruiter gets  days of sub and one plex gets taken out of circulation and CCP can write it up as revenue.This has two effects it means that every time you need to sub your main for another month with  you might as well make a  day alt account.  Of course if you sub with  in   or  month chunks you get less opportunities to make alts but you pay less overall. it means that the occasional  starter pack that includes a plex with the package is great because it means that you can combine it with a  day trial for a  day alt for only  instead of requiring you to either pay a full  days sub with either  or plex on either the main or the alt.,Eve,d6pw9dz,1,t5_2qil9

8737061,0,t1_d6xqk1p,Well I hate to tell you but hearthstone makes more money in a year has more support has a stronger player base and following generates more content and has more frequent content releases than EVE online.This list was not made as a list of games in order or a final list for my rankings.  Its based loosely on game popularity in some cases and in others on games people should play due to very strong content by the developer.  EVE fails in both of these categories.Also your point that half my list is MOBAs and FPSs is indicative of the PC gaming community my friend.  There is a reason something like  of the top  twitch games at any given time are MOBAs and FPSs.  Partially because they are easier to watch sure but also because that is where player interest lies.  I feel i included a pretty well rounded list if you look at it as a whole.  Especially if you include the single player games which formatting made look funny.,Eve,d6xs4wm,-8,t5_2qil9

8741982,0,t1_d6y7q41,I wasnt there but your analysis is probably what happened. Its how we operate.Holding people in the hope escalation happens is simply very effective. A lot of people seem to have a lot of opinions about elite small gang pvp but its simply the logical thing to do. When you cant or dont want to bring more people you need to find different tactical advantages.  Holding on to someone so they will cry for help gives a high chance of reinforcements trickling in being badly positioned on grid and being unfocused in terms of fleet synergy. This is in part what allows for a few vs many fight.Its hardly foolproof and there are certainly alliancescorps that will not follow the script if you will but thats eve. But when that happens that means no content for the small gang so thats disappointing. If said corpalliance then also decides to camp the small gang in thats just a waste of every ones time. not saying that happened here only saw the reddit post before going to bed Finding a good fight and then Im not talking about the mythical gud fight takes a lot of time for small gangs. Sometimes you strike lucky sometimes you get camped in and just have to give up for the day or roam for hours and find nothing but a few ganks. And when you reach bittervet status being time efficient becomes a thing because nobody enjoys wasting hours and not getting good content.Also this myth that small gangs farming null bears is a one sided deal is fairly false. Id say in most of the actual fights opponents are always very happy for the content Ive on occasion even gotten evemails saying some pilot on the other side really enjoyed some cat amp mouse interplay that happened or a near tackle or even successful tackle.  Ironically I think both sides often feel they are fighting the odds in these battles.I dont understand why people get so worked up about chessur or kiting or even small gang in general. IS ONLY GAM. If people get upset because chessur called them low tier they should really look at themselves and ask why they are getting upset about that instead of blaming chessur for them becoming upset.  Obviously chessur wears his emotions on his sleeve which IMHO makes for a pretty entertaining stream. So I guess heres your respectful good post even if it wasnt shank ,Eve,d6yeeua,16,t5_2qil9

8753868,0,t3_4zz62g,Industry is a passive PvE option. You make a lot of ISK but over a general period of time.Ratting is an active PvE option. You make not a lot of ISK but generally instantly. This applies to standard subcap ratting though.Most industrialists wont tell you what they do for isk because they have either a monopoly or something close to it on what they make. More competition means lower prices.Also realise that you are never going to make money if you do EVERYTHING in the supply chain. Youre going to lose ISK and time if you do Mining Ore gt Refining to Minerals gt Researching BPO gt Copying to BPCs gt Building gt Hauling to Market gt Selling on Market. Instead focus on one part of the supply chain as most corporations do in real life.Oh also realize that human interaction and relations is very much a part of industry. Most people have certain markets cornered in every corporation alliance and constellation in New Eden however you can always strike deals with your neighbors. If you join a corp that for example builds Citadels try to negotiate a deal where they will buy your PI items for a set price. You dont have to haul them to a trade hub nor do you have to deal with transaction taxbroker fees which is a killer as your margins increase they dont have to import from trade hubs or farm as much in their local area. ,Eve,d6zw343,5,t5_2qil9

8870188,0,t3_51qkrn,The most easy way is jump km away after landing using a micro jump drive on your domi. Use sentry drones and omni tracking computers  sensor boosters in med slots to enhance their range. Light armor tank like  large repper  racial resist according to the rats damage profile.  Rest drone damage amplifiers. Drone link augmenters in the high slots at least .Use evesurvival or other mission info sides to learn which rats trigger the next wave and where they spawn so you dont end up in the middle of the next spawn. Use your mjd smart to get to the next warp gate if necessary. Jump in a direction so your destination is km array from the next warp gate for exampleThat way you are a sniping boat and most rats dont reach that far. Always shoot small ships first. As long as they approach you in a direct line. When they reach you you have a tough time hitting them. Dont leave your drones behind. Sentries are stationary and you have to stay or move to them to scoop them. ,Eve,d7e2l7a,5,t5_2qil9

8871869,0,t1_d7dvbma,I just realized I dont think people are understanding why I dislike ECM so much.  I dont think there are anything wrong with force multiplies I think theyre a great thing to have in a game.  I dont think that KeresLachesiss have anything wrong with them either.  I think that the concept of pressing a button and getting on your hands and knees praying to RNGesus is shitty in functionality.  I think that if you really want to make ECM have some real gameplay you have an optimal a falloff and a second falloff on the inside of the optimal I just woke up so my vocab hasnt caught up with the morning yet.  Basically youd have your first fall off at KM optimal at KM and a third at KM where things within that KM falloff you basically cant jam.  This forces other fleet members to actually protect their ECM ship the same way you protect any other force multiplier in a fleet.

Theyd basically have to live on stream sharing their desktop  to be able to prove they didnt RMT. Its just not possible.I sympathize with OP. This and other cases do highlight a flaw at CCP. It might not be their RMT detection. OP might guilty af. But CCPs ticket handling is clearly pretty bad. Any GM can grab a ticket close it and thats the end of it. Weve seen appeals where a second GM just references the ruling of the first with clearly no investigation. Weve even seen cases where the same GM that ruled the first time handles the appeal. I dont know if they have a customer service problem or a PR problem but these stories have been nonstop for years. As someone reconsidering playing Eve again stuff like this just weighs a little bit against that. I know if I got wrongly banned Id be salty af. So why not just play a new game? One without a problem with RMT or bans?,Eve,d7r6whw,1,t5_2qil9
8979878,1,t1_d7r5pdy,oh geeez its my least favorite game .. lets crucify falcon on redditok m lets see it throught lol. i see the regular nerds are afraid to touch this with a ft tungsten poleprotip if you wanna know who the real wicked despot is then just look at who the nerds are afraid to talk shit aboutgtJust for reference Customer Support do not deal with RMT cases. This is Team Securitys ballpark and they tend to investigate all cases in great depth.what would you say the purpose of customer support is in this case? sending him a sentence then ignoring for  days?????????? what the actual shit lelgtIf youve been suspended from the game youre more than likely suspended pending investigation unless youve been positively linked to RMT then youve been permanently banned.that doesnt mean anything. thats just buzzwordsgtIf youve been permanently banned for RMT and believe youre innocent and have filed a ticket to appeal then wait for a response.Imagine yourself in the position of OP  how much would you have waited? Would you have waited  days? OP is a saintgtCreating new accounts means theyre just also going to get suspended for ban evasion  Same as posting with an alt on the forums when youve been banned there for breaking the rules.wew damson thats some sage wisdom ladsgtPatience is a virtue when it comes to getting an RMT related ban investigated and potentially overturned. These cases are VERY complex theres often a lot of back tracing of where ISK has come from and gone to and it can take days just to make solid headway on a case thats fully investigated.what do you mean patience is a virtue? can you expand on this? what do you consider to be normal wait times? is it  days? or is it  days? where is the line drawn at? at one point this becomes literally harassment of innocentsgtIf you further exacerbate the situation by being disruptive with the support system or creating new accounts and causing further issues it can take even longer to get through your case and can cause delays for others too.there is a term for this  its called victim harassment. the support system is figuratively raping OP and then bullying them when they attempt to seek justicegtIf youve filed a ticket to appeal my best advice is to wait for a response. If you have outstanding game time youre worried about losing dont be concerned. All youll need to do is file a ticket with our billing team and theyll credit your account with the missed days if your suspension is overturned.thats the nd most arrogant thing ive ever read the most arrogant being the last sentence of your post. in a normal world the entirety of the people who participated in fucking over OP those peoples would be looking towards the ground with their heads bowed in shame.srsly whats the deal with the holierthanthou attitude? fuck the support systemgtHope this helps you understand things a little more.yo m you got this the wrong way around. here is where you write thank you OP for dealing with our dumb shitive explained this to you before dear komred. you are not looking at us we are looking at you. at the time when i explained it to you there was k nerds looking at you. today it is k nerds looking at you. keep this up and tomorrow i will be the only remaining nerd looking at u,Eve,d7r8t4j,-2,t5_2qil9

Rote because they were all dropped on their heads intentionally fit AC Maels with  Huginn support for a citadel bash. Literally a  day old newbro could tell you thats insane. Mael prices have nothing to do with Rotes choice to practice idiocy.Tempests are incredibly bad theres a reason no one uses them right now. Its  right now. Maybe you saw PL use TFIs once and thought that regular Tempests would work just as well for a completely different task? Either way that statement right there is perfectly emblematic of just how bad Rote is at understanding the meta right now. The fact that you unironically felt that Tempests was a good plan is just wot. You couldve picked any of a host of actually useful doctrines and you go with fucking tempests.LPT Learn to use EFT sometime its really useful. If Rote had a semblance of competence they wouldve recognized that AHACs are a brawling doctrine jesus christ. ANIs dont apply for shit at km so adding a sebo is literally just wasting your extremely valuable utility mid. You couldve had a TD on every ANI with no issue. But instead Rote once again failed to understand how doctrines work and instead of learning what makes AHACs so good in the current meta they just went some guy said AHACs were useful lets completely ignore the reasons and just use them while we pretend to be competent. Lets run through the doctrinesArty Maels A tried and true isk efficient doctrine that allows you to reasonably take on most fleets and win. The usage of alpha over DPS means that the numbers issue is mitigated. A significant number of alliances have used these to great effect.Hurricanes Welpcanes are incredibly good for doing isk efficient trades thats why goons horde TEST brave everyone with numbers uses them as a second string doctrine. They also have alpha which is dank for the reasons above. ANIs These are essentially miniAHACs they are incredibly tanky and allow you to hold pretty much any grid you want to hold. When fit properly they also have a utility mid similar to the Legion allowing you to buff your trackingrange apply ewar or basically anything else. Its called utility for a reason. These again see great effect in alliances with large numbers but lower SP members such as Goons. Maybe youre starting to notice a trend here although youre in Rote so maybe not.Harpies Are you outnumbered? Are you facing entosis? Do you not want to roll out a heavy doctrine because they move slower? Then harpies are right up your alley this tried and true doctrine and one of the few solid AFs allows you to haze all the entosis ships you like while not committing a shitton of slow ships to the field. Just apply Rails to the target and watch them explode!Combat Ceptors Bubbles got you down? With the combat ceptor youve got no worries! Just cruise on through like nobodys business to the other side and haze all their entosis ships while you cackle like a madman!As youve hopefully figured out the QFCs preexisting doctrines were incredibly well suited to the current meta using previously tested ships that are known to be good by a large number of nullsec alliances. Every doctrine has problems but thats why you have multiple doctrines so that you cover all your bases. Rote meanwhile chose the were shit and want to continue to be shit option and instead of recognizing the current nullsec meta they instead opted to go with absolutely shit doctrines that every other alliance couldve and did tell you were terrible. These are not the actions of a razor sharp lt pvp alliance these are the actions of a highsec corp making their first dip into nullsec.M the fact that you think I wouldnt bother to improve things alone shows your ignorance.

This reduces the velocity of the item being boughtsold in game. Higher demand for less items increases the PLEX price.    This will really bake your noodle the PLEX price will drop with two competing points one is less sunshine more casuals more plex for pew. Two as the price increases people sitting on stacks of PLEX will sell some to take profits put more plex on the market depressing the price.

9045232,0,t1_d7z237y,Yeap. Thats exactly correct. I spend the better part of a month living  Nomadic in this fit without any HS or POS support. I would find a system and rat it clear then scan down a WH and move to the next C and repeat. I did this for quite a while only leaving to drop off loot. I even ended up selling a few empty system for an easy halfbil or more.Its also very hard to catch. If you can dodge the initial gank attempt you are impossible to catch as you can just cloak. In a pinch you can instantly abandon any drones you have out Launch ECM drones and out them on who ever has you tackled in order to warp off and cloak. This has saved me a few times. It also helps that most people dont see a Stratios on DScan an thing It must be ratting. They thing It must be running a Relic site.I developed this back when I was first moving from Null into WH space I was also in VOLT for quite a while before leaving for WH space. I still use this fit on occasion as its a great fit for long term scouting for eviction targets. There is also the possibility of the random unfueled POS.This fit also requires no implants drugs or boosts.,Eve,d7z3bxa,1,t5_2qil9

9104451,0,t3_54x1lm,Honestly the idea that theme park and sandbox structures are mutually exclusive is false.I played another space game now defunct because of THE WORST IMPLEMENTATION OF A CASH SHOP EVER called Black Prophecy.Now Black prophecy was a space fighter game. It had a pretty extensive themepark quest chain which it doled out in small bits over a long amount of time. Basically think of standard MMO leveling and getting quests at certain leveling standpoints.Now it didnt have the entropy focused economics of EVE but it had its own functioning and fun versions of FW and POS warfare as well as open combat between pilots in any given system and a large part of the game was ratting for loot fucking with other people ratting for loot getting batphoned in to help your friends ganking people for lulz etc.Just before it went belly up they added some raids to the game which were well designed and a lot of fun.Like EVE getting in a good corp did a LOT for you in that game and corps in general did a lot of group pvp over the FW style nodes basically owning systems gave your whole faction a boost even though outside of FW you were often shooting at members of your own faction. as well as pve ratting to kill time and get loot etc.So the game set you on this path with some themepark content explained the basics of how shit worked and then said alright were gonna leave you alone for a couple days get back with us when you suck less and unleashed you on the sandbox. It was then up to you to figure out what to do with that sandbox to get to whatever systemic checkpoint xp specific star system etc. to continue that themepark chain. Most players within the first or second time they were told okay do shit and get back with us later found themselves in a corp found other shit to do and pretty soon most players were only doing the themepark bits when they didnt have a fleet.It worked.EVE could easily revisit the epic arcs concept to use a similar tactic for the NPE. Give them a nice cinematic introduction to new eden various mission types that teach them the basics in a context that feels important rather than like a chore through mission dialogues and plot arcs etc and reward players with stuff that is contextually satisfying. Just off the top of my head Im thinking about starting the player with zero SP and giving them special injectors for completing each phase as part of their introduction to the special status of capsuleer. By the time they complete their intro story arc they know what skills will be important to them they can inject all their newbie SP and use it more intelligently and the capstone to that quest line would actually unlock the training que as their passive learning implant as a capsuleer finally goes online.,Eve,d867izw,1,t5_2qil9

9134890,0,t1_d89v0an,Its sickening that the thought occured in your head that supers be produced under the ck label with the idea that people would be less likely to interfere. That actually happened. Everyone seems to do just fine producing and sustaining without needing this blanket and there is no medical reason to need this or to slap this label on this and that. What makes it wrong is that decisions were made knowing full well what the charity label brought with it and these things could have all occured without that label being pushed. It could all be done without that cloak of protection and that makes it sick. Its on purpose  it follows an agenda and above all did not have to be this way  all along the way there is the constant refusal to allow the kids to play EVE.  Now knowing that the label is tarnished with what you and others are doing you continue to refuse to change the way you operate. Why? Why ruin the label? Whats so important about operating in this fashion  The answer is nothing. Its not the childrens preference  it is your own. Is it any wonder why people question everything in relation to ck? Its shit like this  inexplicable shit that really ruins credibility. You are not the least bit concerned with this and thats a problem. ck is a running joke charity is a meme in EVE  at what point are you going to consider what your doing and change how ck is presented? When will you care about the image presented  when will you have any of the skills nescessary to be involved on any level other than sending isk from your character to another?

Youre right. Everything youre exposed to and everything you expose others to influences things. Words actually DO matter and have meaning! Even if you think something is funny those words STILL mean things and have the ability to influence and affect others.Is censorship the answer? Obviously not. Is there a responsibility for the words or ideas you perpetuate? Absolutely.

So we have like k possible new players yearly. Some from those will continue as alpha clones. Also many old players will be back to look if they should continue as alpha or sub back as omega.Also if we get even k new players yearly they will continue to cumulate. So in  years our player base will have significant portion of alpha clones. Question is how many players continue to play this game as alphas for long. How many of those yearly started new players stop after  or  and how many dont.The point is removing time restriction from the trial effects player amounts in long term and not just initially.,Eve,d8fexns,1,t5_2qil9

Their main purpose was to allow the use of some extra frontal armor for trenchsnipers.The german WWII M and M despite still having ventilation in from of two holes lack these distinctive lugs since warfare had become much more mobile and the option for extra armor was not neccessary anymore. Also the skirt and the flared visor were reduced in comparison to the M Stahlhelmvariants to reduce weight and material. Among other aspects that was a wise move because soldiers had less weight to carry around which is very relevant in mobile warfare.,Eve,d8lu3pw,3,t5_2qil9

The rewards arent worth enough and thus no one plays the content. The rewards are really desired and everything is farmed to death.Also do we know if these are Empire Faction NPCs or Pirates? If its the Empire factions I assume well lose standings for farming them.

Even with patreons or ad support the kind of money ISK or IRL moving around is pretty thin.  EVE demands a lot of the highquality content that takes a lot of effort to produce and it becomes harder and harder to fund that work.  CZTMCENNeocom have been an excellent service to consolidate content with the collapse of personal blogs but its not trivial keeping the lights on.Im glad to see a shady liability closed especially with the oncoming storm things like CSGO and fantasy sports have made but funding more toptier content in articles or events will require some creative work in the future.  ,Eve,d8p9k1k,9,t5_2qil9

Watching the entire thing go down as an outside was entertaining at the worst of times. Im just saying that we havent had the last chapter of this war quite yet and until we do it does indeed appear to be a victory with the downfall of IWI.Edit   He just made a new comment and it looks like hes currently banned pending investigation.

If ck is a scam people in PL got scammed way more than people outside of the alliance and that is NOT something our alliance tolerates.Do I think its a scam? No because then it means one of our dudes set out to scam us and thats not what we are about.

So I openda ticked and asked about whats really happening and wether or not I misunderstood something.GM SIRIUS answered me and explaind that this is intended and that you only get extra  days if you buy from CCP.

9337267,0,t1_d8z57pl,Thats not how it works. gt When has more sp never sic been an advantage?I interpreted this as When has more SP not been an advantage? As thats the most similar gramatically correct question although you cant debate questions you can only debate statements of fact. There are three main answers to this question  Yes more SP is always an advantage. More SP is sometimes but not always an advantage. More SP is never an advantage.In most forms of debating you dont need to take the polar opposite viewpoint merely not the same viewpoint. So someone opposing yes more SP is always an advantage does not need to demonstrate that more SP is not an advantage in every case merely that there is at least one case where SP is not an advantage.I can give you one example where having more SP is actually bad When you fly a Battleship without support skills. One of my friends rushed to BSes relatively early in her career and was constantly wondering why she couldnt use some fits or had to meta fit mods and consequently was flying a ship that was slow expensive had a terrible time applying damage and was surprisingly easy to kill. She could have been just as effective in a cruiser with those same limited skills. In this case more SP was not an advantage but a disadvantage. Her decisionmaking was stunted by her poor skill allocation. There is a common rule while training skill in Eve Its easy to sit in a big ship its hard to fly a big ship.If you agree that is indeed a case where more SP did not provide an advantage weve proven that there is at least one case where more SP is not an advantage and will move onto the next logical question probably something along the lines of When is more SP an advantage?,Eve,d8zkffd,1,t5_2qil9

9345649,0,t1_d908r02,Also of note ingame skill training has a small but noteworthy affect on how individuals interact with the market. A few skills viewable here can change an individuals capabilities drastically even with just a few days of realtime training. Im going to list a few general principles and default abilities below assuming zero training on characters.There are three five ways a player can engage in trade direct oneonone swapping of goods and ISK placing buy or sell orders buying or selling g directly on the market essentially a buy or sell order of duration instantaneous yet distinct from an order listing of a public trade contract and listing an item on a public auction contract.All buy and sell orders currently posted to the market are visible regionwide to everyone along with some lovely stats dating back up to a few years. Even if you post an order on the border of a region it doesnt cross the imaginary border into the neighboring systems outside the region. Buy and Sell orders originated in Jita the main market hub are visible across the entire region of The Forge regardless of how far any given system is. Even faroff systems like Obe and Fuskunen can see whats going on in Jita. On the other side of this point two of Jitas neighboring systems Muvolailen and Kimotoro will not be able to see Jitas activity despite the fact that they are next door.By default all players are able to buy from any active sell order currently active within their region. They simply need to fly there and pick it up or have it shipped. Continuing the example above someone in Obe could buy from Jitas sell orders without needing to be at the trade hub station itself but a player in Kimotoro could not.By default a player must be in the same station as an item to sell it on the market or to update the terms of their buy or sell orders originated at that station.Item Exchange Auction and Courier contracts can be created declined edited or cancelled anywhere regardless of character location. A character must be in the same region to accept a public contract. Nonpublic contracts which you are included in private corporation or alliance contracts can be accepted from anywhere.Skills exist ingame that allow the modification of these default abilities. The link I posted above had the full listing as well as descriptions.Also of note what would normally be considered scamming is not only allowed but encouraged. Misrepresentation of the contents or terms of a contract for example is extremely common. So long as you do not alter the mechanics of the game themselves you can market your stuff however you like. It is  the buyers responsibility to ensure they are not getting swindled. No matter how they interact with the market including direct trade contracts and auctions the buyer will always be shown exactly what they are getting and exactly what they will pay before the transaction is completed. Once completed there is no way to reverse or cancel a transaction if the other party does not wish to do so.The only scam a buyer can not forsee with certainty is whats referred to as an escrow scam. Im not positive if these are still possible because I havent seen them in a while read a couple years but I dont remember the specific interactions of mechanics and skill training being fixed by the developers to prevent it.Questions or comments Id be glad to help.,Eve,d90mmde,6,t5_2qil9

9358528,0,t3_58ohtt,FW missions are not as lavish as all those posts your reading say.  A lot of it was misinformation and exaggerated numbers.  Yes at one point Amarr was in T and you could make  mil an hour running level s.  The m an hour figures are bullshit no one got that solo.  Grouping it may be possible but were talking solo numbers.  It depends on what tier your in and what faction you are.  The enemy rats will have the EWAR of your enemy as well and they recently added frigates with Webs to them for all missions.  Which means if your gal and you want to run FW missions you will be fighting Caldari rats with ECM and webs.  Which pretty much rules out bombers.  The web buff to the rats was made to deter people from running sites in bombers.  Once your bomber is webbed you will get wrecked pretty quick as they are the weakest ships in the game.  I have heard its still doable with some fits like some ridiculous shield boosting fit with shield implants and shield drug but thats a lot to invest.Gal missions are one of the hardest because of the ECM.  Typically people run them in VNIs Ishtars or Proteus.  In numbers you can do it with bombers and jackdaws.  Again tier matters.  If your t you might as well plex instead of run level s.  It really doesnt start getting good until tt.  You also need faction with the militia to run level s.  Which means for Gal you need federal defense union to be . or higher.  To get that you need to plex sites or let someone run level s and let you leach the faction and LP when they turn them all in.  Usually you can find someone that will let you do this for  isk per LP.  ,Eve,d929em2,5,t5_2qil9

Theyve lost the entosis and sov war absolutely lost the propaganda war and at best theyve marginally won the ISK war.They basically have the option of either fully committing to a renewed fight which at some point will mean having to kill COs Keepstar at huge cost or finding a way out. I think though they will now try to find some exit strategy and move on elsewhere. With the Ascension jump range changes coming up the argument for investing so much blood sweat and tears into winning tribute is less convincing. Perhaps most of all it seems to me that the war has been particularly good for CO. Its given them a chance to draw a line under leaving the Imperium and WWB.

Its been a lot of steady small decreases each month that have added up to a big decrease for the year thus far.Overall the hypothetical influx of new alphas probably wont have a proportionate impact on the present waning cycle.  Likewise I see no real reason why the proliferation of popular new player run hublets will really cause a major swing.  There is some effect on rimcore exchange dynamics.The real cause is structural.  The way orders are limited tends to produce strong clustering.  The fewer orders you have the more you cleave to hubs so alphas will have little or no impact on market radiation trends.  Theres a good logical reason why gt of station markets are dismissed by players.  The reasons why CCP doesnt address this are a bit less clear.,Eve,d9hy2da,1,t5_2qil9

9582423,0,t3_5c5dbb,As a person who just moved into a WH corp about a month ago. WH space is weird. The best way to describe it is that space moves around you in a WH. On day you might be connected to a C with a carebear mining corp in it. The next day you might be connected with a C with a PVP corp in it. You will find you will be more in charge of your own safety in a WH. PVP is different as well. There is no local so the only way to see who is in system is DSCAN. Which only shows non cloaked ships in range. One day you might be in a C feeling lonely just doing some relic sites when all of a sudden  bombers decloak and blow you up. The next day you might be one of those bombers. The community seems really close as well. The people you blew up last week might come to help defend your home today.

9669238,0,t3_5dht78,If you want to get newbros interested in pvp I think it comes down to a single factor.Isk.As a very terrible eve player I quit my first activation period because I couldnt afford to replace my ships.  I realized after training  days to fly a bomber I literally couldnt buy another one if I lost the one I had.  I never undocked a ship I waited a month to fly because I knew I couldnt replace it.  I didnt know enough about making isk in the game to come up with a suitable way to replace what I would inevitably lose.I realize the idea of not flying what you cant afford to replace somewhat governs the game but for a newbro their awesome sauce new ship and its entire fit costs less than your small ancillary armor rep.  And..  they cant afford to lose them daily because they dont understand how to generate isk efficiently.So.. Id recommend people spend time teaching the new players how to make money.  You want them flying and losing ships regularly?  Teach them how to afford it.,Eve,da4xpil,7,t5_2qil9

Rail guns have long range and some ammo types can increase the optimal range.

Youve allowed your enemies to erect a Keepstar for Christsake and yet you still sit here and prattle on about how Snuffbox is anything but a few bitter old bitches who sit around and still circlejerk one another?

9770862,0,t1_dahgs76,Something that amazes me is the lack of insight a majority of people have when it concerns capital escelation or capital use in general. In regards to PL ive noticed many people love to complain yet simply refuse to do the legwork required many of our members do.In an escelated engagement I triple box what not with a main fax alt titan alt. Then theres other alts like Cynos or eyes etc etc. And then if i happen to be primed for a target  its not surprising for me to have every account logged in or on login depending upon the task or what is going on that moment.The severe bitterness and straight up even jealousy of some people who want the reward but none of the risk or the work irks me. But then again the level of work required for sucess isnt what many want out of a video game. Eve is one of those games where work preperation and dedication with above all patience can lead to great feats and victories. People just see a grid of Titans throw their hands up and cry foul when their shitty little F Hurricane is eviscerated by a hail of Scorch XL km away and cant understand why. Many are content to just sit idly by accept their fate and push F until they win or they come onto Reddit and bitch constantly when they lose. Its laziness and entitlement of the most comedic kind.None of them understand the work that goes into owning a Titan or the skills investment or the support needed. Im sure there are Devs who get constant complaints about Supers from every single corner from the poor TEST line member to the bitter OSS carebear who just lost their T on a failed move op. Point being is Titans and Supers are not invulnerable nor are they instant win buttons. They are tools.

Now you need to readjust the probes over the red dot or yellow triangle and scan at au or less and it should pop up  depending on skills.  If low skills then it might take a few more.  I believe the Basic Standard for explo is    .  For the scanning skill and its  support skills.  You will also want Relic and Data to at least  so you dont pull your hair out when playing the mini game.  Level  in both skills also is a world of difference when playing the mini game as well if you ever decide to invest in it.Tip  If you double click on a signature in the probe menu it will center the camera on that signature once you have a red dot as the sig.

There was this thing in my system called a Abandoned Mining Colony. I found that it was a good place to go because it had cruiser rats rather than just frigates like the other sites I was doing had. I warped to it one time as usual but this time there was something different. One of the rats names started with Shadow Serpentis. I killed everything and checked the loot. In it was a bpc for a Vigilant. I had no idea how rare that occurrence was. I spent the time to mine what I needed to build it then the training time to fly it.

Really dps gate guns are not really that worrisome if you have a logi wing.gt Easy access highsec marketsgt The only valid statement in the entire replygt SoloMicro gang PvP is easy to findgt Soloing in lowsec is asking to be blobbed youre more or less required to fly either turbo cancer ships or turbo expensive noncancer ships if you actually want to kill things in a meaningful fashion.If having to take on  people to  in a solo frigate fight is your definition of being blobbed then you have a pretty thin skin.  On average this is the level of blobbing that I see when trying to do solo in lowsec excluding your typical gatecamp of  people.gt Micro gang PvP is virtually nonexistent in lowsec because of gate guns and HighSP blobs.We take out micro gangs all the time in PlacidSyndicate and really dont encounter these problems.gt You dont have to have  blues to survivegt Yet most LowSec groups have innumerable blues  NAPsLike null some do some dont.  For example CHAOS works with SC on occasion and we fight on occasion. Any official bluing is usually on a very temporary basis.  I personally feel this works better than permablue treaties because you can still generate content and avoid the bigblue donut.gt You dont have to kiss anyones ass to survivegt If you dont pay fealty to your respective regional overlord dont expect to have any towerscitadelscaps etc. the Phoebe jump changes of  regionally locked most of the lowsec areas of EVE so youre stuck with whatever nerd wields the biggest stick in your region and you cant batphone anyone for backup.How is this different than null if you arent on the top of the food chain in your area?  Cmon now lots not be disingenuous here renter alliances are basically paying fealty.  They know they cant survive without protection from Big Brother.  Almost every small sov holding null alliance pays to the regional overlords to avoid getting evicted unless they just own such a crap region of space where its hardly even profitable to harvest moons or rat.  Lowsec isnt a lot different but neither is null.  Granted you can have a lowend moon in lowsec and nobody will bother you but yeah...try to take one of the Rs and youre going to have someone bigger and badder knocking on your door saying Pay up or lose it.

9956884,0,t3_5hztiw,Eve has a unique subscription model that is sort of paywin but really isnt.Part of the PLEX functionality is it allows a player to convert real money into in game currency.  Add that to that fact that in Eve when you lose a fight you lose that ship and need to buy another one.  Having more money means more ships which is a competitve advantage.However the paylose comments here ring incredibly true.  I spent my first PLEX on a faction fit Raven for killing belt rats.  Until that sentence makes you cringe chances are that any amount of money you throw at this game isnt going to give you any kind of advantage it will in fact just make you a target for someone else to come and take away your shiny new toys.However there is another side to this PLEX situation. Once you have managed to get a decent income stream going you will be able to afford to be the one buying those PLEX in game to keep your accounts subscribed and at that point Eve is freeplay and Im not talking about the endless trial model they have in place now.  You will be paying zero real life money for the game and getting the benefits of a paid subscription on potentially as many accounts as you are willing to dedicate the time in game to afford.,Eve,db5eo7o,1,t5_2qil9

9961515,0,t1_db5ynzb,New NPE is sloppy for one. For example those ingamewindow blue pointer tags are nice in theory but they have a tendency to do bad things like block the overview making you unable to target something you want until you reposition the camera which moves the tag out of the way. Its fine for an older player who wouldnt hesitate but it would annoy the hell out of a newer player especially if it gets them killed. Then if you do something slightly offscript like fail to stop your ship before defending yourself from the second seeker the tutorial will bug out  itll keep telling you to kill the second seeker when its already dead when you finally stop the ship. Sure theres a reset but if you have to be doing that its not exactly putting your best foot forward. Then several times during the tutorial you have to travel km for no reason.

10077164,0,t1_dbkzxu0,I totally understand you using attrition fits in the fighting in Vlil but you cant send derptrons to clear out plexers in the surrounding systems because you have to send too many people. If you are stomping a system with too many atrons tell some of them to form a squad under a squad leader in good ships and do something useful elsewhere instead of whoring on kms in a pubstomp. Or not. When you have a hammer everything starts to look like a nail.Regarding the s in each militia I guess you could say each side has almost the same raw materials. What matters is what they do with it.Regarding FW I was in it for  years and about k kills so I know about burnout morale failcascades braindrains etc... The rules of the war havent changed the landscape has. One thing I do know about those looking at FW from the inside is that they lose focus of the war and concentrate on what is in front of them on that day. Regarding saving systems imo you save them because of the effect they have on Tiers and morale. You can say didnt want that system anyways and try to save on morale but you can only say that so many times before you have  system left. You lost small corps with some of the systems that were taken corps that quit FW or that are now not going to help you because you didnt help them. I understand its not your corp or home system but in a war you rarely want to attack the strongest target first. The smart generals remove the alliesor surrounding systems in this case from the strongest target until they are standing alone with no support. Like at Vlil and Eha.During their retreats Calmil feinted around at Vlil with a few people still but hit all the surrounding systems hard with hitandrun solo plexers because they had a goal. During Galmil retreats Im not sure what they did besides do something else.,Eve,dbl2qd0,1,t5_2qil9

Goons typically find a home and then stay put for a long time  Test are more nomadic they redeploy about once or twice a year on average so keep that in mind if you consider Test  moving your shit around can be a hassle but it can also be fun to be a part of.. Goons are a lot stronger than Test. Until recently Goons were considered the strongest coalition in the game. Goons kicked Tests arse a few years ago and Test were practically destroyed. Although weve made a comeback since then were still massive losers compared to Goons.. Goons are aresholes to nonGoons a longstanding tradition rooted in Something Awful culture. Test are probably the most annoying idiots in the game in a good way.gtI do not care about winning I just want to have a blast and pew pew.Well if you dont mind joining the underdog and youre happy to be a little more selfsufficient I highly recommend Test full disclosure Im in Test and its honestly the best group Ive ever flown with so far,Eve,dbsfroi,1,t5_2qil9

While it can be played solo the game is often at its best when played with others.  The game gives you few goals on purpose you have to set your own goals and find your own path  but if you do as above achieving those goals can provide you with a great deal of satisfaction. However the game wont spoonfeed you content to do. EVE is not for everyone but take advantage of the unlimited trial and give it a shot. ,Eve,dbwao85,1,t5_2qil9

10249395,0,t1_dc5s4pd,In a way both games are outright similarBoth games are only as fun as you are and as you make it. If youre used to theme park games where you are gently guided along to get the max stuff for your character for the purpose of feeling better about yourself but not much else including actually using that stuff then Eve is not the game for you.In Eve the grind is not gentle but also has a different purpose from grind more but further up the tree now. Its meant to pace out your ability to do what you actually should want to do which may be well whatever you set your goals to be. If you play Eve like a regular MMO burning out is certain. Youll try to grind to max stuff and fail so horribly because youre not supposed to do that. It is not a game to be rushed and you will need to start with small goals exchanging them for larger ones as you complete them. The goals you have should have a purpose other than get this ship. Getting a certain class of ship isnt a purpose. Ships arent a purpose theyre a tool you get them because they let you do something. So why do you want that cruiser or battleship? So you can rat towards your next goal with a better and more fulfilling purpose? For the PvP? What do you want to do?Dwarf Fortress fortress mode at least is similar except that winning is too easy its too easy to make a hilariously stable fortress. But that fortress or a less stable one if you like the challenge can be used to take riskier goals that can put it in jeopardy which is where the real fun starts and when youve lost everything well thats supposed to happen.Its not about destinations its about the journey.

Youve missed this years Pod and Planet fiction writing contest but you might see if you can work ahead to come up with a compelling story. I participated this year and it really sparked my creativity. I also won super awesome prizes including enough to plex my account for several months if I so choose thanks to the generosity of donors to the contest. Consider reading a few to see if you get inspired too and maybe you can win something next year. Learn useful skills IRL and sell them for ISK  video editing graphic design etc.Do you have skills you dont need and can extract? Farm up enough buy skill extractors then extract skills sell the injector then use the money to buy more skill extractors until youve extracted and sold enough to plex your account.Write articles and submit them to EVE websites. Ive had only rejections attempting that myself and expect it is even harder now that there arent casinos bankrolling those websites but maybe youll have some luck there.Go exploring  At your rate of play you should be able to plex your account with two weeks of focused WH exploring and do whatever you want the other two. I promise that if I kill you in a WH Ill SRP you since I know youre a poor with three kids.Join a corp  steal their assets or otherwise scam them  plex your account.Run a scam in jita.Struggling to find a scam? Sell pictures of your wife but not your children thats crossing the line and will get you doxxed awoxed and KoS plus regularly assraped when you go to prison for ISK. I suggest you get her permission first. Im kidding. If you do this youre just a troll dick. But you could sell video pretending it is erotic material but actually send rick roll videos.

10320590,0,t3_5nrmqo,As is its bad idea. After some other possible changes it could be possible.Ship collision works pretty much as energy law states except with addition that ships avoid each other. So when frigate goes toward titan titan tries to avoid that frigate and that is funny.So what if ships wouldnt avoid ships that do not poses any harm to them. E.g. Titan wouldnt avoid frigates. Frigate would of course avoid titan and wouldnt hit it if you approach the titan your ships safety would stop your in time.Bumping would be bit harder now. You would need to have big enough ship to bump bigger targets. In addition we would have option ram. This would turn off the avoid mechanic from your ship.Thus frigate could ram titan and would just explode to its shields.If above mechanics would work enough well we could look if there could be damage from collisions.Ship explosions could do damage in non hisec locations. E.g. if I remember right capitals or at least supercapitals create smarpbomb style damage when they explode.,Eve,dcdw91c,1,t5_2qil9

10405780,0,t1_dcnjq6s,Thing is that anyone with the slightest clue of IT architecture knows that troubleshooting connectivity issues which only affect some users can be a fucking nightmare. Every game runs into these issues and I do mean every. I recall Blizzard with their nearinfinite budget having very similar issues just a few months ago. Most of the time its not even the fault of the developer but rather some ISP or datacenter shitting itself due to something else entirely. In the aforementioned Blizzard case it turned out to be people ddosing one or more ISPs something Blizzard cant influence directly. In that case some of us were completely unable to connect to Battle.net specifically whereas others could play just fine.The fact that it doesnt affect everyone is exactly why one shouldnt jump on the CCP Bashwagon until we actually know whats going on.tldr It sucks but it might not even be CCPs fault.

I dont like the suggestion of anchored objects being the bounds for a wardec.What needs to happen is that declaring war needs to be a more serious business. I mean TEST gets wardeccd at least three times a day  but theyre only doing it to grief us on the JitaAmarr undocks.What needs to happen is that declaring war purely to grief while it should be allowed to happen it should be extremely costly for that corpalliance to declare war. It should also be that a wardec can only be active at one time this stops people like Marmite or P I R A T declaring war on whomever they want because they make so much ISK from dumb nullbears with bil interceptors. These kind of alliancescorps would have to PICK whom they want to declare war on at any given time.Also having continuous declarations should increase the cost exponentially. So that a highsec corp that is at constant war eventually becomes too much of a burden for them financially.What this does is leaves the system in tact for the purpose it was intended for and might actually bring some interesting politics to highsec instead of pure griefing. If two corpsalliances really want to go at each other they can  for a cost.,Eve,dcnpdcw,3,t5_2qil9

It wasnt an eviction but some dudes living in a POS were putting up a citadel and we rolled into their hole  minutes before it finished anchoring. Obviously we fleeted up and jumped on it as soon as it finished. We would have left it alone but this hole was freakin empty. They must have set it up to anchor and just went to sleep. Bob was displeased with their lack of diligence.Apparently when it was at  hull they logged in though because they dropped  megathrons a tempest and a geddon on us. Those dudes had guts. It didnt end well for them but it was a good fight and for that they get our unending respect.I really hope we role into them again when theyre more established and they have better hole control.

I felt that I needed more solo PvP experience and didnt like being separated from my friend so I left TEST on good terms I hope and spent some time losing Rifters to duels outside Jita.  Some friendly people gave me advice and helped me with my fits.  My friend and I decided to join Brave together.  I joined up last week and found it a bit more laid back than TEST and I really like the pace.  I feel like its a better fit for where Im at and Ive grown to like the crazy bastards I fly with now. My friend has been dragging his feet on signing up due to RL stuff.  I decided to ride things out in Brave regardless of what he chooses Im enjoying it too much and hes missing out.Anyways fell in love with explo so naturally Im training into a stealth bomber to whelp other explorers because its probably the closest thing to being a space pirate anymore.

Medium Autocannons  They lost too much falloff to be viable as a result of the TE nerf. mm Artillery  It is useless. There is no scenario where it is optimal to use on any ship even when its the only artillery option you can fit. Shit tracking shit damage. Give it a purpose. Tacheyon Beam Lasers  The fitting requirement needs a reduction  they basically cannot be used outside of extremely niche ships in extremely niche situations. Battleship lock range is absurdly short in many cases all should be km to allow for lockmjdscramgrapple and other aggressive play. Currently this is impossible with many due to limited midslots for a sebo when a cap booster is required to be viable. Battleship lock speed needs to be changed. It is a terrible balancing mechanic.

In this forum post he is proposing what equates to a metric fuckton of fuel per hour to fully operate a citadel which seems pretty ridiculous I didnt add up al the numbers but I could easily see this consuming  mil an hour in fuel.A simpler proposal that people might actually get behind would just be to double the vuln timers and astras and forts maybe triple in the case of astras.  This would introduce more time per week vulnerable forcing single tz alliances to split it up over many more days.  Asset safety is only free in the same system and there is a decently long waiting period for assets.  Which compared to outposts which are not destructible at all I think is a marked improvement in terms of asset denial.I think i could also support the reinforcement timer requiring stront or straight up fuel blocks just like poses do now it would make AFK citadels much easier to kill,Eve,dd7algo,17,t5_2qil9

10589714,0,t1_dd87bhs,the petes are nullified cloaky they can get past gates just fine like most other covert ships with no armour plate. They have about k tank and rely on range which they dictate.They are the step up from mass inties you do get this right? more range tank damage with the same benefits and the exact same gameplay as shown hereWarp about using inties and pop shit whenever you can it is the exact same only you have range.You can reliably alpha inties as they come out of warp if your instalock they wont be moving. vs ? thats not what anybody would do you make it  vs  and you probably get  pops or so from the start. If an inty dies before it can do anything they lose mass of numbers quickly enough everytime they land on grid so this would force them to land far out then burn in to not get popped which opens up options.

10699098,0,t1_ddjiy0n,For what they are I generally think theyre fine but the ships are a little too narrow IMO. Unlike the other sneaky ships you really cant sneak up on someone which basically means you need a really organized fleet or lots of alts to really enjoy them. For a subcap I find that kind of lame.I have for some time thought perhaps Blops should become dscan immune. It would give you some ability to move them around conventionally without signalling your intentions and also allow you to fully utilize their lack of decloak lock timer. I imagine it might also make them popular as ratting ships especially in wormhole space.,Eve,ddjj6en,7,t5_2qil9

10769705,0,t1_ddqmg3k,Youre refuting something I didnt say. I never said the CEHE wasnt good. I said youre sacrificing a TON of tank in the hopes your enemy escalates  if youre dropping a dread ball you should never have DCUs fit because a dread ball is buffer fit and buffer fits really really need the CEHE. If youre dropping a bait dread it needs to tank an enemy fleet long enough that they need to escalate to break your tank  hence you need a DCU. The modules are very different. I would never drop a dread on an enemy fleet with local tank and a CEHE  because Im going to cripple my tank. If Im baiting so my buddies can escalate the goal is to tank the enemy fleet so they have to drop then you counter drop. A buffer fit dread is not going to accomplish that. And god help you if you fit a CEHE on a local tank dread or a dcu on a buffer fit one.If there are  dreads on grid all applying perfectly to your dread assuming m ehp with a dcu and T tank overheated against k dps per dread you will survive for  volleys. Thats an ideal world scenario  in practice they wont all apply to you. Regardless with  dreads primarying you youre looking at  cycles of capital turrets before you pop. The DCU adds k ehp tank. Basically you should fit a CEHE whena Youre able to tank the enemy subcap fleet long enough for them to escalateb When they escalate they will bring at least  dreads or equivalent dpsc The enemy will bring at least one titan or superUnder these conditions the CEHE is the net better module  the problem is that the fits you would use in those situations are very very different. If you are dropping on subcaps you are probably active rep fit. There fitting a CEHE is a really bad idea because youre murdering your local tank for the possibility that the enemy drops supers or a shit ton of dreads. Likewise if you expect supers or titans fitting a dcu is killing yourself since the k tank bonus is meaningless against a DD or a bunch of fibos. My point is that they are very very different modules. If youre dropping a dread fit with a dcu it should be local tank or otherwise dropped in a situation where everything on grid is dead before your tank is depleted. If you expect to engage in a giant cap battle the cehe is almost always the better option. One isnt a better module than the other theyre simply very different modules that serve very different purposes and complement very different fits meant for very different situations.,Eve,ddqtd4u,1,t5_2qil9

So you need one for each system since gating is risky and jumping is infeasible because of fatigue. The one exception is hysera where every missions spawns in the same system. Ive heard through the grapevine that people do missions there in supers because it is more efficient. ls are hands down the best pve isk in the game.

They hope there will be more conflict involving supers if one battle going bad isnt the final nail in the coffin of your alliance anymore because they really are in fact already replaced.One dont have to be a genius to realize that smaller groups dont benefit as much from Rorqs as the already big guys do. Lumpy for example doing great in punching above their weight but dont ever expect to see them mining in  Rorqs in one belt to built up their super fleet...,Eve,ddx3nu0,6,t5_2qil9

10834025,0,t3_5uwgsi,. The secret is to roll incoming connections and keep your static crit. Most people wont concern themselves too much with an anchoring astrahus but you want to leave them no room to get ideas should they stumble upon it.. Not in systems youd want to live in.. option . join an established corp. option . grow your corp put timers and your best defendable time zone try to give fights where you can with in reason of your size and talk and make friends with the other corps in Jspace. Most groups will not be interested in the effort of evicting you or the possibility of killing a potentially good addition to wormhole space for what ever little loot your  man astrahus has.. technically one oracle can do it question is really is it manned and is there a defending fleet? The only reason you should reasonably be concerned with this as a small new group is if you are killing an abandoned one because you want to live in the hole.gtAs far as our capabilities most of us can fly TCs and I can fly HACs HICs TCs and marauders. I was reading the wormhole meta thread from earlier and it seems our corp can field the current meta.This is a good start on the pilots you have but you should go with cheaper options like Sacrileges basically  the cost for a lower stat legion. until youve grown and got the hang of things.If you decide joining an exiting wormhole entity is the better option for you Hi I have a  corp. If you want to grow your own corp however I highly recommend you pick a CgtCC The C static is for rolling into and fighting other smallmedium sized wormhole corps the C static is for your isk making use tinker snakes or nestors to run the sites you can solo in marauder but ehhhh its kind of trash tbh. And dont worry you will get Kspace in chain Feel free to PM me with any questionsconcerns you have its always good to have more people in Jspace good luck I hope to see you around in the future. o,Eve,ddxgbxx,14,t5_2qil9

10865053,1,t1_de0masw,I dunno. Ive flown with TVP a fair bit now though not a ton as i dont play as much think .mil LP farmed over  months most in my first month and i havent really had a shitty experience at all. Thats approx  hours in fleet.Ive flown with Iron several times and not once have i gotten a powermad vibe from him. Hes usually pretty calm and collected.Risa is pretty cool. Was there when he got his badge and have flown with him a bit. Same for Forsaken  ive flown with him maybe two or three times but they were always a blast. Gaella and Dav are great too. Same for iHades. Not once flying with any of those FCs did I feel patronized or insulted. I dont get all the hate to be honest. Regarding what happened to OP  eh people get mad some times. Id be pretty pissed off if an hour of my time was wasted especially so given that I personally dont get much time to fly. I think Iron wanted to give the ISK out to someone in his fleet who just got delayed an hour or a loyal viewer not the guy causing all the grief which is kinda common sense. Not  eve nofucks spirit but makes sense.  Also even with optimal fleets and setups there is still a difference evidently a difference in iskhr between FCs. Its in the sites being run most FCs run closestclosest  but on bad days some fcs will prioritize other sites if possible and some wont  this is a can be the difference between mhr or mhr. It is in strategies when contesting which is huge  some FCs ive flown with pull extra iskhr when contesting due to strategy others spend a lot of time bouncing  which is funny but iskhr is usually equal to normal or low. It is in responsiveness to questions and speed of commands given. Some FCs like to remind people to pull their drones repeatedly. Some dont  so some people lose drones. Not the FCs fault but its a fact  FC frequently reminds to pull drones less drones lost. Some FCs also tell DPS to anchor up earlier some of us including me are bad. Some FCs run TCRCs different. The list is pretty big. It makes sense. tldr i think you guys give incursion FCs way too much shit tbh,Eve,de0niwg,1,t5_2qil9

The conclusion of Ron was that with regards to medium sized carrier fleets that it should not be possible for subcap ships to successfully engage carrier fleets. He brought up instead that Carrier on Carrier combat being  was an ideal scenario and that it should require you dropping carriers to fight enemy carriers.The group also came to the conclusion that with regards to capitol combat no one fights one another in capitol combat without knowing they have superior numbers.  When Asher pointed out that this could stall out fights as you cant fight carriers without carriers he was told that people need to get good.Then the cap engagement problem was blamed on jump fatigue changes.I would be interested to hear further talk on the subject because it seemed to stall out at those two dead ends. Get good and jump fatigue is bad.  I would be interested in hearing other solutions to this issue because I could see it becoming a real issue in the future.Great show as always asher,Eve,de81f9s,3,t5_2qil9

Steam is dumb dont do steam. cheapest way to play eve is thru subscription on eveonline.com as low as  a month. you can also play as an alpha clone up to mil skill points for free but youre very limited to what ships and modules u can use. you can freely engage the community as an alpha though so probably a good way to test the waters.. eve is the ultimate afk doing other shit game especially if youre a miner. pvp not so much gotta be paying attention for that.  most players evolve into using multiple accounts simultaneously as you get better at the game and better at multi tasking. . Yes. Join a big corp just so you can get on comms and start chatting up people because thats what this game is most famous for...the community. . Dont be a lone wolf its only your pride driving you to go at it alone. There is solo stuff you can do in eve but its either painfully boring or requires so much skill and effort youd have to be kind of a try hard to handle it. . Big alliances love new players.  basically there are things called activity indexes.  the more active players you have doing stuff in your sovereign systems the harder it is for other groups to mess with you...for reasons... just trust me on this one they want you. . Lol yes player killing is a serious danger in Eve. Thanks for the Diablo flashback.  Anyone can decide to unload on you at any time... there are consequences for unlawful acts though depending on where you are in the game  high security systems vs low security vs no security. Making friends shooting space pixel ships grindings isk... etc.  you should focus on the making friends parts.In conclusion eve is a pretty diverse game with a true player driven universe.

Most corps are not like this and will not function in any manner resembling this kind of coherence.  Your best bet is to practice good FC behavior call primaries more than once but less than four times broadcast the target while you call know your enemy and plan their moves before they make them and build trust with the people youre FCing.  Practice constantly.  Even when you think you can handle it  practice again and again.  Gather as much intel as you can.

For example I have an explorer who is the scout for my hauler alt that delivers the minerals I buy with my marketeer so my production character can build me another exploration frigate and fittings when it gets popped.  That takes time and a lot of it especially if you want to do it at a T level.    On the flip side and kudos to CCP for it I think that the alpha clone skillset is just enough to do the essentials that depending on the player it is worth training the whole set.,Eve,deimvw4,1,t5_2qil9

11042502,0,t3_5xmoqc,Okay. Ive been playing for  months and living in Nullsec for  month. Here are my newbro impressions of Nullsec life.  You are never safe. There is no true safe spot unless you are at a custom BM with a cloak on. Stations can be camped safe systems might be invaded or have cloaky campers.  The ISK is so much better. Holy cow its night and day. Exploration is my main source of income and I can only do so because of the value that explo sites have in nullsec.  It is harder to get stuff. If your corp station doesnt have it and its not in a nearby friendly system you may be stuck. In highsec you can always buzz to Jita. Unless you have a JF alt or are in a bigger corp that is very hard to do in Nullsec.  It feels like the EVE I signed up for. After living in Nullsec I could never go back to highsec. It feels too easy too low risk not enough cash reward for operating there. After living in Null for one week I promise your brain will start thinking about travel differently. I can undock and there might be anything waiting for me out there good or bad. It is EVE on hard mode. The veterans who have their blingedout Pilgrims interceptor gangs elaborate gatecamps smartbombing battlecruisers and allies within a few jumps all live here and killing is like breathing for them. You will be able to fight and kill others but there will always be someone who has you outgunned or outnumbered. If you have any other questions Ill gladly answer them. ,Eve,dejnci3,3,t5_2qil9

Since enemies are unlikely to swap damage type throughout a fight it will reduce incoming damage a lot after the module has adjusted. This will then allow to save cap on your reppers and most likely also overheating damage. It is a truly epic module for this purpose but heavily relies on the resistance phasing skill too not drain to much cap and adjust quickly.,Eve,deovl8h,1,t5_2qil9

If it looks halfway decent people will pay isk for it.gambling  bad idea IMO when ingame items bought with real  can be used to support it.  you start running into grey areas on national and state gambling laws.My personal thoughts on some other sinks  Mobile oneuse cap boosting arrays that can be used if you dont have a weapons timer or are locked by anything and are bought with a combination of iskindustry.Add a few new NPC sold items besides BPOs to NPC stores that are used in industry.  like maybe lower T citadel rig components by half but put a few bil or many bil of NPC sold components into the build.

Said aggressor would be liable for replacement of those items if your stance is that the victim legally owned those plex and he had them removed from his possession against his will by another party. But we all agree when we start playing that all of our ingame items stay the property of CCP.

It was talked a lot before citadel release and is commented here and there after. I think I would have gone personally with system that destroys some drops some and rest goes to asset safety. Though the current plan is pretty decent as there is stuff that drops and is lost by the owner.In any case structures should be compared to outposts in most cases.Thanks for your input though.

You cant turn it over to the corp because theres no legal entity to hand it over to and I can pretty comfortably say there never will be due to the eula everyone signs things like that get real messy for CCP.As for the TCP access Im trying to get more info from OP about the circumstance but from the knowledge we have if he purely said heres access for a couple days only then its still illegal for them to interfere later. Its the equivalent of giving your keys to the dog sitter or whatever whilst away for the weekend execpt they made copies and used them to steal your stuff later.All that being said I  agree you shouldnt use a site for a group in that manner and OP has dragged his own name through the dirt as much as anyone elses due to all of this.,Eve,dfj4xz4,1,t5_2qil9

Nor does the sentiment make sense  PvP isnt made meaningful because it takes more effort than dailies to participate in it. Its meaningful because there are assets on the line. Dailies dont negate the loss they can only compensate at a certain rate.There arent that many sandbox games to state in comparison that this is how sandbox games are. Even more so its debatable if EVE is a sandbox game at all  its just a buzzword that has been flying around EVEs history. Garrys mod is a sandbox game. A true sandbox game where nothing is restricted and you do what you want.

A testbrave  man fleet is going to have a percentage of players who simply dont have the skills to fly a fleet battleship. Dropping your requirements from two battleship skills to one and T large lasers to T projectiles might get you an extra ten battleships that might be interceptors or ewar frigates otherwise. Mixing in jackdaws has also gone a long way to solving the bomb issue. You can either tell everyone to git gud or work with what you have. Thats where the maelstrom comes in. ,Eve,dfx4577,2,t5_2qil9

11529460,0,t1_dg2uw4t,No it does not. THats what I am saying a  chance of failure is not a risk. By its VERY definition it is not a risk because it is a guaranteed outcome. Being risk averse by its definition is being unwilling to take any gamble in which the result is not certain. Anything in which there is a possibility for failure is a valid target for risk aversion. However things with a probability of  or  are exempt. They are not risks there is no possibility of failure or success in those. In economics and finance risk aversion is the behavior of humans especially consumers and investors when exposed to uncertainty to attempt to reduce that uncertainty. It is the reluctance of a person to accept a bargain with an uncertain payoff rather than another bargain with a more certain but possibly lower expected payoff.That is the definition of risk aversion it is a matter of uncertainty. You are unwilling to act on things that are not a near certain result. In the case of eve this is bringing overwhelming force to ensure the odds are certain or as near certain as possible. It is an attempt to increase probability towards  basically. However for things that are  certain. Such as a  DPS ship killing anything there is no aversion because there is no uncertainty. In that case it just moves into just being really dumb as there was never ANY chance for success in the first place.,Eve,dg2v71w,2,t5_2qil9
11530036,0,t1_dg2qcli,I think the problem you run into is where is the balance point in the delay.  Should a citadel tether after seconds    minutes  minutes? after grid change? after a warp?PreCitadel you would log off your super or titan in a POS when you logged back on your were instantly safe minus password shennigans.  Up until I want to say ? years ago you could even garage door cyno for moving in  safety.  Alot of the changes around the cyno being a certain distance from the tower had little to do with the garage door cyno and alot more to do with the use of cynoing a bunch of titans next to a pos forcefield to bump an opposing ship out.  Basically taking advantage of the way in cyno mechanics work when you jump a bunch of ships in.  While that may have been a nice side benefit it was not the intended target.  Edit If you want to add a tether delay it the only reasonable argument for how long should be based on how long it takes to get into warp in said ship class.  Which is at the very maximum for plated armor titans around  seconds.  Shield titans can get into warp in around  seconds.  ,Eve,dg2xjpu,1,t5_2qil9

It typically requires a lot of skills to even get SRP for the Guardian and thats not even including the long lead time to get to logi . People often forget just how vital the capacitor management skills are. Logi is an easy job when everything is fine but it takes discipline and coolness under fire when youre being bombed by a bomber fleet and everyones yelling and dying around you spamming rep broadcasts in a panic and then youre needed to triage injuries comes to the fore.Whilst I may not be a full time logipilot I often help out in that role when they need extras and usually when the shit hits the fan its a tough job.And we need some way of getting onto a kill mail for activating a rep on grid rather than having to use whore drones I agree!,Eve,dg75p9d,1,t5_2qil9

11616038,0,t3_65r1wb,Hey OP I dont have much to add about Torpedos vs Cruise missiles personally I went with flying a Tengu but I will say that you should consider using a Mobile Tractor Unit. Despite the Tractor beam bonuses on a Golem hull you have the opportunity to drop the MTU bookmark it then continue the mission. At the end of the mission warp back to those MTUs and collect your loot and salvage that way you dont need to wait on getting into range for your tractor beams and you dont have to wait for the tractor beams to pull in wrecks slowly.As for rigs I would consider the Large Core Defense Operational Solidifier II it reduces the cycle time of your shield repper allowing you to repair your shields significantly faster. It comes with large drawbacks namely youll need more capacitor to operate it but in a Golem you shouldnt need to use your shield repair modules all the time.,Eve,dgcos81,2,t5_2qil9

The issues mentioned in that thread has to do with graphics cards that only have one pixel clock hardware or where you have two different hzsignal monitors connected to a single pixel clock. If you use a high bandwidth hz DP output and a hz DVIHDMI output the hz one will recieve the wrong signal as the lower one becomes the master to not break the lower performing monitor with a single pixel clock.One pixel clock  can only send out one signal. Reference graphics cards usually only one one pixel clock aftermarket ones have two altho lately gimped. Usually its one pixel clock for DP and then DVI shares one with an HDMI port. And yeah it has nothing to do with drivers or grrr nvidia grrr AMD it simply is what it is. A Hz monitor should be connected to the secondary pixel clock DVIHDMI and the hz main one to DP depending on setup and graphics cards.,Eve,dgetn56,1,t5_2qil9

11732990,0,t1_dgokhuz,Technically I never dock up when I see someone in local. If its a cloaky camper I either play as usual but in cheaper ships or I go looking for actual PVP or I bait or I do something else ingame that needs doing. What do you think I should be doing? Ignoring them so they drop half a dozen blops on me? And if its a random neut I warp to a POS and the first thing I do when I land is access my SMA to swap into a combat ship appropriate for what the neut is. What do you think I should I be doing? BLOPs in hulks? Lol.But really even if I didnt try to fight ever could you REALLY blame me? Where I live and indeed in a huge amount of nullsec probably half of it the VAST majority of the neutral traffic coming through is explorers in frigates or droppers in TCs or intys. The former are hard to catch though I will chase them with a dictor now and then. The latter generally arent looking for fights theyre looking for easy kills. They also are hard to catch. And by the time they are in local or even reported in intel close by it is too late to switch ships to try to bait them even if that is what I was in the mood for.Theres a rare solo PVPer or small gang coming through but I bet  of traffic is  not really looking for an actual fight  not willing to take a fight even if you present one and  very difficult to catch because of cloaks andor nullification.Current mechanics mean the random PVP in nullsec meta is  dropping on bads  dropping on people distracted by Netflix and  thats very generous nondrop PVP. Shit needs to change so that this meta isnt goddamn awful both for PVEers and for the PVPers. Ive made suggestions before that there need to be more deployables like ESSs except more expensive and more valuable to both locals and people roaming in. Things in space that locals benefit from defending and neuts can benefit from attacking... and obviously that promote fights. My favorite idea is making it so that military and industry sov upgrades are not automatically active when they are installed but that a deployable needs to be put out to make anoms appear.,Eve,dgpyqck,1,t5_2qil9
