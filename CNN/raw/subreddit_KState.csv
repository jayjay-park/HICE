386050,0,t1_cfkrqmg,I usually go to the fridge because its closer to where I lived and they do have a pretty decent beer selection. As far as wine goes I always drank the  brand. Wine isnt really my thing.,KState,cfks2zo,1,t5_2s66f

4878455,0,t1_cu95evt,RAs make you pour it all out then they make a report to your building supervisor. Youll most likely have to meet with the supervisor and what happens after that is up to them. ,KState,cu9gtmt,2,t5_2s66f

6907583,0,t3_4aaz7y,Yes everything leases pretty fast. I would suggest talking to your department and potential other grad students about housing and roommates. You can get a place around month however the selection isnt going to be great and the undergrads will get to them sooner rather than later.,KState,d0zalbv,1,t5_2s66f

10072233,0,t3_5jzeqk,If youre on the wait list it will enroll you as soon as people drop and anyone in front of you on the wait list gets a spot. But as was already mentioned professors can add people manually if they feel its justified. They typically set the limit slightly below what it really is for just such situations.,KState,dbkfnci,2,t5_2s66f

11689366,0,t1_dgkydmr,No problem! Im not sure if you have enrolled yet not sure when enrollment begins but I know in my major we had a counselor for our grade before classes even started. If you have enrolled already you can log into ksis and see who your counselor is. They would have the information for this and any other question and would be more than happy to help. You could also call your department and they could find someone that would be able to help you.Also not sure if its worth it pricewise for you but I bought a laptop before coming to school on tax free day in Missouri and also got some extra deals for being a student. This was a few years back of course...,KState,dgl0a6p,1,t5_2s66f
