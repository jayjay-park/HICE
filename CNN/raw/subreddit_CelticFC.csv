1057857,0,t1_chob1ma,he wouldnt be my first choice to be honest but i do think he could do a pretty good job at Celtic.The only real thing that puts me of with Malky is that like Lennon he dosnt seem to do well with BS and things like the board and while the fans have worshiped Lennon his relationship with the clubs men at the top hasnt been so great.,CelticFC,choj70m,3,t5_2snki

5791042,0,t1_cxexk16,He had a better game than usual but maybe thats because he was beside a CB who seems to know what he is doing. You also got to remember the midfield played a lot deeper last night as a whole so it made it a bit easier on the back .,CelticFC,cxexm8l,2,t5_2snki

7562923,0,t3_4iwpy0,Do you mean the night or just in general?The night he had a decent game and set up Griff. He shouldve cleared it earlier but the ball hit a massive divot for St Johnstones first.In general he thought he was getting a move last summer and when it didnt happen he spat the dummy out for a good while. After he got over that he was played out of position for months to cover for Brown. His confidence was clearly low but he always put in a shift. Browns lack of mobility when he came back into the team didnt help. He wasnt really able to do what he did last season as often because he was having to try and help the midfield more than he should.,CelticFC,d31v95a,0,t5_2snki

8937621,0,t1_d7m5a2z,A league setup like this means that the big clubs are only going to get bigger and richer. I really think theyve done European football a disservice. Soon there will only be champions from the big  or  leagues and the rest of the places will be taken up by other teams from those leagues.

9096956,0,t1_d859lwj,I think the same about first goal. Im hoping our battering at Nou Camp will give City a misplaced sense of an easy ride and we can come out strong and give them a fright. Give them any time to settle and their class will show. We need to play to our strengths and defending without the ball is not one of them. Overall Im bizarrely optimistic. Very excited for this one.ps. Hoping Craig Gordon will have got a boost from the fans when he came on on Saturday. Otherwise Im slightly worried about his confidence. Not hugely impressed with this De Vries situation.,CelticFC,d85b30m,2,t5_2snki
