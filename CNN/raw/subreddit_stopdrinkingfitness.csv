11050862,0,t3_5xsz0a,Its giving me roughly the same numbers as my fitness pal with me estimating my calorific burn through exercise.   I always overestimate food and underestimate exercise.  I list myself as sedantry as I do work from home but I dont add gym  times a week consisting of an hour heavy lifting every visit.  I do include the km of gradient walking I do on the treadmill as a warm up though although underestimate that by a third with regards to calories burned.   ,stopdrinkingfitness,deklgyy,2,t5_3hfpd
