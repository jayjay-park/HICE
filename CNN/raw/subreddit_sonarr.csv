6957728,0,t1_d14umfx,Its usually a difference between the filename and the release name. In this case I believe its releasename HD p which is parsable but the filename contains HD  which isnt.Unfortunately almost all torrent clients name the torrents by the filename if its a single file download instead of the supplied release name.It may also depend on how youve configured the download client in Sonarr since blackhole has no idea which grab a particular download was related to but tbh I dont know whether sonarr would use the quality from the grab even if it did know the relation.,sonarr,d14zqqf,1,t5_345pm

7631911,0,t1_d38mcpe,I dont see anything relevant in the logs... it doesnt even seem to mention when it picks up a series.This is happening with manual imports btw... I suspect it isnt happening when episodes are picked up automatically.Ive confirmed that hard links arent the issue. With Sonarr set to copy mode I found that it also destroyed the original file on manual import.One potentially relevant detail about my system is that I dont have permission to write to tmp which is something Sonarr occasionally complains about.,sonarr,d39pgjy,1,t5_345pm

8121952,0,t3_4qh88r,Somebody correct me if Im wrong here but since youre more than likely on one public IP your domain forwards to forwarding specific sub domains to ports on a single private IP is either really tricky or if I remember correctly not entirely possible. What you CAN do  what Ive done  is just use different external port numbers for what you want to access as indomain.example.com points to ... or wherever you have Sonarr set updomain.example.com points to ... or wherever you have CouchPotato set upAnd so on. Obviously this just requires changing the external port number under the port forwarding settings of your router if it supports it. Again this is just my knowledge on the matter. If theres a specific way to do it with subdomains as youre wanting Id love to learn that too. ,sonarr,d4szaw1,1,t5_345pm

9135029,0,t3_55cz8s,The stuff you downloaded with sonar is probably relatively easy to redownload provided you keep your database backed up.Separate irreplaceable stuff explicitly and you can do a good job of backing that up  places one offsite automatic verified versioned. Everything else? meh a month unlimited usenet subscription could rebuild most of it.,sonarr,d89xjag,1,t5_345pm

9559600,0,t3_5bthsv,Would be interesting but not sure if currently possible. To add a series to Sonarr there are a few mandatory fields that you wouldnt know off the top of your head. Im not sure if it is possible but you could write something that would search for the movies and then add them with all the information that Sonarr requires ,sonarr,d9rf0rm,1,t5_345pm

10197426,0,t1_dbw5asg, Couldve been added since scene released it with that name but I rather just deal with it in Sonarr itself.    Its a daily series in the releases I could find  is part of the year.month.day stamp not the title and wouldve been parsed properly so theres no reason for a naming exception.    Is a bad release name coz there are two series by that name a  and  one.    are QoQ releases theyre the only ones in the entire scenepp world that slap the season year on it and thus are automatically rejected.    Is probably not a release name it was likely a title autogenerated by some rss feedsite or someones filebot on a local disk.    I couldnt find any release with that name.   Personally Im not opposed to Sonarr accepting the series year not season when parsing. But thats something we need to do in Sonarr and not the naming exception list. However it hasnt been a priority considering its usually scene without a year and tvdb with which do need manual exceptions.,sonarr,dbzxnty,1,t5_345pm
10783997,0,t1_dds9xfp,For your indexer are the categories setup properly? They should be by default but...Categories Anime Categories Just in case.Is there anything weird about the search results when done manually? Sonarr depends heavily on parsing and naming standardization. If youre finding the episodes because theyre... slightly weirdly named that could be why. If it is working for everything else this could be a one off issue and worth just downloading the nzb setting your sonarr tv? category and seeing what happens.Id say  of my downloads happen automatically but there is a small portion that Ill do by hand. Theyre all niche or weird shows  episodes for the most part though.,sonarr,ddsah76,1,t5_345pm
10870425,0,t1_de14m03,duh... thats a good idea Im dumb. Ill just delay it by  hours or something that way Usenet will get it first. Thanks,sonarr,de17gid,1,t5_345pm

11147680,0,t3_5z40cm,It does periodically test and reenable them but maybe not often enough to satisfy you. I assumed itd be a job in System gt Tasks but I cant tell which one. And youd have to edit code to fix it since it isnt configurable.Why are you running this on a laptop? Could you move your setup to a hardwired system that is always on?Radarr and Sonarr work best when they can parse the rss feeds  so they dont miss anything.,sonarr,devksz5,1,t5_345pm

SonarrRadarr pick up the files and move them to my media directories with the proper directory structures.Its pretty set it and forget it so far.I am on Linux but I assume that it would work similarly on Windows.,sonarr,dg6lzwz,1,t5_345pm

11724936,0,t3_679q6t,While Audio contributes to the file size you can end up with massive files that have stereo audio and smaller files that have . sound  its not really the right thing to focus on. What you really want to do is customize the quality settings for the profiles in Sonarr Settings gt Quality so you have a cap on the file size for each quality of file... So if you dont want anything bigger than GB then just set the slider to GB as the upper limit.  ,sonarr,dgp1vnr,6,t5_345pm
