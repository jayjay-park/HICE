3277924,0,t1_cp06ci6,Its actually a lot easier to deal with now if you know how to. There is a huge detachment of the hitbox on the TAir. Go in training and turn on the hitbox visual display and do it. Before It was just a giant blob that covered the character as well. Now you can underspace it much like the guns or spear. the hitbox thing is a huge nerf to what it was before. ,Brawlhalla,cp1wrfv,1,t5_31c1d

3472164,0,t1_cpo0lkh,There are a lot of things I like about orion. His weapons are really good when thrown he has super good stats and his specials are really good. The lance can be hard to get used to but I think once you get the hang of it it can be adapted really well to your play style. For example you can use the Nair both offensively because of its speed and defensively because of its hitbox. The lance is also a lot stronger against opponents at the same height as you but you are usually at a disadvantage if the enemy comes at you from above or below but with this patch it is going to be harder to get into these positions so the lance is pretty safe against Hattoris and the like.I am on vacation right now so I only have a little bit of experience on this patch so I will have to investigate his strengths vs the stronger character right now come Friday but from what I have played so far he seems to be in a better place than before.

3530866,0,t1_cpuq30u,Big rant but very good points that we can all take into consideration. Though its important to explain that I myself only admind the Steam chat and tried to get people into matches as fast as possible. The you in there is probably referring to Compton. I would also like to establish that this is how Compton speaks and acts its not him belittling anyone though it does rub some people the wrong way.My main purpose for making it a multiday though would be due to viewers issues. During GT there were very unfortunate times when the main stream and a sister stream were showing very good matches at the same time. We can either make it one day and have several streams where viewers might be conflicted in what to watch or a multiday with one stream and no simultaneous matches. Also Id definitely use Challonge or something like that. Thoughts?,Brawlhalla,cpuqr4q,1,t5_31c1d

3678905,0,t1_cqbj0id,Yeah... the T is pretty much in use for regards to signatures. The SSig just is weird. As for the heavy air moves in my mind it works a bit better to distinguish them due to the fact that there are only . If you start saying NHAir then people expect  there to be a THAir. Having specific names for those moves solidifies that they are in a unique situation. In the event that they add a sideways air heavy then i would definitely see the terminology changing.

4089903,0,t3_37gj80,I find lances tricky as well but I can beat them. You really need to keep on the move. I find the trick is to almost bait attacks like forward heavy do a light jump up and down air once theyre below you. Use well timed dodges and avoid staying right in front of them.This is a bit more weapon dependent but i often find when theyre in the air I can be a bit more controlling.

Hattori plays differently than Bodvar who plays differently than Cassidy who plays differently than Lucien. It really doesnt bother me that theyre all the same size and have roughly the same unarmed combat.

4682715,0,t3_3f1ovl,I love Gnash but because I love the legend I am able to point out what I have experience on the last few weeks. Gnash is A or B. The fact is that there are some weapons like sword katars and axe that have the ability to kill legends really quickly The first real man is just to slow to face them and his strength is not that influential. Gnash gets completely crushed facing those type of weapons and it is because of this Is hard to land heavy moves with Gnash. Most of the people that I fight dodge right through my heavy attack even though the animation has not yet finish but the full motion of hurt boxes did finish.  With all the nerfs on hammers Gnash has one less botton to use stomp is not worth using. Another botton that is really hard to land and its not rewarding enough is the Dheavy with spear. The legend has become really weak on the ledge.Other than that If think Gnash is one of the most balance legends on the game right now. every move of Gnash has a good start up time long recovery time and they can be dodge or cancel. Gnash is an example of a well balance legend that got hurt really bad by nefts that were not planned for him.,Brawlhalla,ctkswa4,6,t5_31c1d
4690410,0,t3_3f6ev1,Hi let me try and answer some of your questions . Im new to this subreddit but Ive heard a lot of people say that this in fact the main place to talk etc but there are also other places like Brawlhalla Competitive Community on Steam but mostly for tournaments and such. Id say that you should stick to reddit.. There are no hard boundaries between ranks. Ive seen people with higher ELO than mine be in bronze for example. But plat starts around  ELO and diamond around . As I said there are no hard boundaries so you may climb into plat with  ELO as well as with  ELO.. It is good to have one or two main characters but you have to keep in mind that sometimes a patch may change the meta so much that playing a certain character may not be as easy as it was earlier. Its always good to know what characters are stronger than the others and the best way to do this is by checking the tier lists here on reddit. Currently I strongly recommend checking Raidhyns and Tybos v tier list here . To be honest I cant say anything here Im to noobish sorry . Gold will be used to permanently unlock Legends once the game is fully released. Dont worry about the number of the Legends  there will be more coming and actually Valkyrie the upcoming Legend should be available really soon. Free codes can be sometimes obtained in various ways e.g. recently there was a code in Lootcrate. Be patient maybe in the near future devs will prepare something like that Im sure therell be info on that on this subreddit.I hope I have helped you with your questions but I think youll get more help from more experienced players also. Nevertheless  welcome quetsacloatl to Brawlhalla community D,Brawlhalla,ctlrouz,2,t5_31c1d

Tying an exclusive to a convention with limited attendance basically locks part of your games population out of owning a skin unless and this ALWAYS happens theyre willing to pay a ransom on ebay or other sites.

If you think putting something on the Internet and expecting it not to be stolen is ridiculous you should also probably not enjoy that art because after a while you definitely wont be seeing much of it.Or do you think I wont straight up punch a person in real life for stealing art?

5427548,0,t1_cw5dx5b,So youre saying that a weapon that is blunt everywhere but the edge should hit everywhere? Axe the blades are so large that nowhere that the axe would be hit would they not be getting hit by the sharp parts. Sword Hilt in the art is not even big enough for two hands would hit with sharp part everywhere. Hammer Very heavy with high momentum no matter what youre hitting them with the blunt area but the hit is much harder due to momentum. Spear  feet of light weight pole and  inches of sharp blade should not high close to you thats how spears work. It is natural and does make sense look at the kind of weapon and if you want something that is gonna hit when they are right below you close to you or right to the side of you close to you dont go for the weapon that has the lowest ratio of intended area to hit vs unintended. Look at the artwork on the attack animations then think of real life. Can you hit someone that is literally  inches away from you yes you swing it sideways or slide it across their back ect. Can you do that with a spear that is taller than you are? No. ,Brawlhalla,cw5fbfi,1,t5_31c1d

But the people that participated in that tournament are basically some of the best Brawlhalla players. And those players choose what is best and it seems like it is the sword and axe. I do not think the sword or Axe are OP either though. I just think they are a bit stronger than Lance so I always wonder why people keep complaining about the Lance... Probably all the FFA peopleAnd yea it seems the devs have tried balancing the game for both v and v ever since v ranked became a thing.

Sair is also super amazing yeh D so much force and a fast move. I have trouble with ground on bow since Slight is rather slow as you said and i can put myself in bad situations with Dlight. Even after playing to lvl  ember im still terrible with Nlight even though its awesome spacing move. I honestly try my best to DlightNlight and then depending on situation Sair or Nair. The one problem i have with bow is how weak SigAir feels. Just no force at all ive comboed people in red  times with it and theyve lived but it has such a nice hit box and good finish to combo string.

5842249,0,t3_3v949m,Guys just letting you know this probably isnt a rifle  BMG was asked about rifles onstream and they talked about how the bow was a challenge already because of how generally its thought of as a truly longrange weapon which theyre steering away from and a rifle would be even moreso.HOWEVER they did say that if they put in another firearm it would likely be some kind of shotgun or blunderbuss  something closerrange. Incidentally at least in my opinion keep in mind that I know literally nothing about guns that looks a little too short and widebarreled for a rifle. Looks to me like more of a shotguntype thing!

6044240,0,t3_3yaq9t,As a mid to high gold Cassidy main Id suggest learning how to properly use guns as theyre pretty strong on Cassidy especially if you want to learn to play a defensive spacing game. Otherwise if youre a diehard hammer fan I use both for seperate match ups or varying on how the enemy plays I would suggest that you really learn the benefit of tossing your weapon. And one of the biggest things that helped me when learning how to throw weapons effectively is to go into your control scheme and unchecking the box that uses your light attack to pick up weapons. Its a bit weird to get used to but once you get a hang of having light attack on a separate key its very very useful for racking up weapon toss into light combos where normally you would have to pick up your weapon.,Brawlhalla,cybwokg,1,t5_31c1d

For hammer dlight to a nsig is a pretty good string for your rank. His hammer dsig is good to use when people are chasing you as most of them dont realize the backwards animation is the wind up and they dont dodge it.

6298633,0,t3_41vxi0,Between the sLight and dLight more often than not you can dodge straight up or up amp away diagonally. Theres at least a  frame gap in hitstun between those two attacks for Ember currently the highest Dex bow user and even though dodge isnt invulnerable until the third frame there is movement on frame  amp  that can be enough to get you out of fringe cases such as this either by moving you out of the way entirely or keeping you just out of hitbox range long enough for the invulnerability to kick in. If the dLight hits most any followup is an easy combo so no help to be found there.That having been said it is possible to get the sLight and dLight to combo if the arrowshot portion hits meaty some later active frame after the first which requires the first portion of the sLight to either hit them out of the air at a specific height and speed or with the very back edge of the hitbox while sliding forward at a high relative speed to the opponent. Pretty rare though  times out of  this isnt the case especially in a match.,Brawlhalla,cz5l0ou,4,t5_31c1d

6330308,0,t3_42c0wi,If anything it feels that devs didnt communicate properly that sigs are supposed to be strictly punishers and finishers.I played a bit of smash before discovering this game and I was confused on whether I should regard sigs as smashes now I know I should or is it just like specials in smash a valid option to heavy instead of light for the hitboxdirection reason or no reason at all.And of course the fact that a crapton of sigs are nontelegraphed and have very little startup frames while the damage is decent is not helping.Edit just realized this post is on spammers in general not sigs. I have to admit that spears sLight and recovery helicopter spammers annoy me a bit more compared to sig spammers mostly due to the fact that they are usually more effective.Playing Ember as my main it actually amuses me how most hitboxes on nonember weapons are so incredibly generous and safe. When you plink with your bow and the guy just whacks back n forth with the sword and has a hitbox wall going its kind of unsettling.,Brawlhalla,cz96q2b,2,t5_31c1d

6619718,0,t3_46bo3n,I picked the game about a week ago. I took the time to try every single legend their combos strings pseudos etc and make an educated desition on what legend to main which ended up being Gnash. It was hard enough to play him in ranked now high gold against more solid choises like Bodvar ada sentinel and now i find out that not only Spear was nerfed pretty hard but hammer was too and for no good reason.I dont know man i feel very dissapointed with the staff. I was having fun but when it comes down to it im a pretty technical guy and i dont see the reasoning behind some of the bans. I just dont.Like someone said you shouldve nerfed Spears damage and not the ability of comboing which it wasnt an easy thing to do by any means.And about the hammer it is ridiculous. Dlight was a ver risky move and a poor combo starter to begin with just to nerf it even more. Now i will have to change my main i guess. Because i can take playing something thats not the most balanced in a good way as long as i have fun Gnash was already in a bad place and now talk about underperforming.Time to pick up Hattori or Ada i guess.,Brawlhalla,d041auv,3,t5_31c1d

6818960,0,t3_493zfy,It is pretty common often if you get matched with someone significantly lower ELO than you and you lose you could get matched with them again since you are now closer in ELO because they gained some and you lost some.  This could keep going until you are  ELO less than them or if you get a couple of wins that allows you two to stay around the same ELO.  It works the other way too if you are matched with someone higher and you win.  An example would be a  ELO person being matched with a  ELO person and the  ELO person wins.  They now have  and the other person has .  Both people immediately queue up again and get matched up the now  ELO player wins and now has  ELO while the second player has .  Say this continues and the first player now has  ELO while the salty second player has .  The second player finally adjusts his play style to suit what he is playing against and it is now  ELO vs.  ELO.  This doesnt often happen but like people have said at times when not many people are on it is possible to play many games against the same player especially if you keep trading games back and forth to maintain the approximately same ELO difference.,Brawlhalla,d0p87ji,1,t5_31c1d

The direction of the throw is effected by the directions you are holding as you release the throw button.Keep in mind that Throwing has  start up frames. Maybe you are releasing the throw with a direction while its still in start up. Release throw with direction. Throw is still in start up frames. No longer holding the direction when start up frames are done throw just goes forwardIf that is not the case Id look into what keyboard you are using and if it is an antighosting keyboard.

7041275,0,t1_d1eg0pn,The MMR system is not really different to the old elo system its still based on an elo formula. If you get pitched against someone you have not been able to beat there are several possible causes and they all apply to the old system as well.. Your opponent is good against you specifically but not against others in your MMR range. Therefore his MMR stays close to yours and you are matched against him repeatedly.. He has a significantly higher rating than you but there is noone else queueing for ranked thatd be a closer match and the system will therefore eventually pitch you against him. The alternative would be both of you to not find a match at all or at least a very long waiting time.. Its not been that long since the rank reset and there are probably a number of formerly high ranking players that have not reached their old rank yet.,Brawlhalla,d1ehhnn,1,t5_31c1d

Sure that gives it a shorter lifespan and probably turns some people away but its given me a view into fighting games I know this isnt a fighting game in the traditional sense but many concepts still apply that I would never have gotten otherwise.

Gun hitboxes work a very specific well thought out way. They have great reach but are worthless as you can see at short ranged to stacked with maybe one exceptionstanding down light. This makes them a unique and interesting weapon.They are what they are and they are currently very competitive. Adjusting them the way you suggest without balancing them in other areas would make them horrendously overpowered. Theyre fine just the way they are.It took me days to get the hang of them. More days than youve been playing Diana. Keep at it and you will get the hang of it. Before you know it people will be raging on your gun play.,Brawlhalla,d1m0ccr,1,t5_31c1d

7210502,0,t1_d1wr8h0,You dont gain or lose points based off of how close the match is. You gain or lose points based on the difference between your and your opponents mmrs. If you fight someone who is ranked lower than you and you lose there is a bigger swing because the system favored you to win. Conversely if you are favored and win you get comparatively fewer points because it was an expected outcome. Generally speaking youll get mostly close matches with some outliers to give you opportunities to go up or down more with that happening more often if not many people are playing because after a certain point around  seconds wait Ive heard the system stop trying to get you in a good game and just tries to get you in a game.,Brawlhalla,d1xs0em,1,t5_31c1d
7210577,0,t3_4e0933,Honestly the only thing that really gets under my skin in this game is v sword comps that do nothing but position and bait for blackhole setups. Me and my partner have managed to climb up to plat and the number of hattoribodvarasurikoji comps is actually absurd. I dont care about the balance in a v setting but the fact that sword characters who tend to be top tier at the moment also have the most braindead blackhole set ups just adds frustration of having to fight through two sword users. Ive been on both ends and when it happens to you it feels awful and when you manage to pull it off it isnt even gratifying. Its just a Well that was easy moment. Something that simultaneously awful to get hit by and not satisfying to pull off isnt something that a game should aim to design.,Brawlhalla,d1xsbht,1,t5_31c1d

7245357,0,t1_d21o48f,maybe i get downvoted to hell but i think its the genre in general.Fighting games  for the most people are not fun or interesting to watch.Super Smash gets all his views on big tournemants... and most of them only because its some kind of  nostalgic  feeling because alot of people playd it when there were young.  of the viewr are not playing the game anymore.After a Tournement the game fells down in views really really hard. Same with most other fighting games.For someone who just passing bye games like that are just  to fast  and they dont know whats going on.Same goes for Brawlhalla  the Playerbase is still really small it needs time  good advertisment  some good paid Tournemants to get the attention of more PlayerViewer.But thats just my opinion i also love Brawlhalla and hope it will get big soon ! cause its a really good game,Brawlhalla,d21qu3p,12,t5_31c1d

7505080,0,t3_4i5p4l,No. The reason they are adding multiple weapons and skipping certain combos is that they can go BACK and add them later. That way if you dont like Bow you dont have to deal with  characters released with a bow in a row. Think of it this way. We added Axe and got Teros. Brynn came next. Then Asuri. To make sure that players who dont enjoy axe got some new flavor  Then we got back to Axe with Barraza. Then came Ember to introduce a new weapon. After that we had Azoth to bring another Axe Character and Bow character. After that came Koji. When Koji was released people started complaining about  Bow legends released in a row. So then they mixed it up with Ulgrim Bringing another Axe but adding a Lance Character. Which was good considering the last Lance character was Scarlet which was  before... I think they will be adding a KatarLance character soon to break monotony much like they released Asuri during the Axe characters.Hopefully a hammer character comes next. They need some love. Not  legends like Lance was... but we are about to hit the th legend since a Hammer release. Im pushing for HammerGauntlet. Maybe a Druidesque design. BMG PLS,Brawlhalla,d2vaexp,2,t5_31c1d

They will continue practicing together and dominating tournaments until big sponsors come around to attach their organization to them probablygt  One of the most if not the  annoying playstyles in the game is throwing weapons having  available every moment. Although it isnt OP it is extremely annoying and make matches incredibly longer will there ever be a rework to that ? Answered elsewhere in this postgt  How will clans affect the worlds ? Not heavily clans will not be a requirement. They will likely only be for brandingmarketingsponsorship purposes.gt  When do you think the FodaQuest app will be available ? LOL well the hotbar is already available. I imagine the Unity version of the hotbar which can run on win mac and mobile would be available by July.gt  Do you think there is a chance even if it is a  that Scarlet will be reworked to use gauntlets ? I dont think so.gt Do you think Stalker is going to be released and when do you think itll happen ? I do think so eventually. I imagine it would happen within a reasonable time before worlds. I could be completely wrong! That is not my department. Also what Stalker?gt Bow has changed from a high pressure weapon to a spacing weapon and its grounded moveset is often ignored do you think this is how it should be ? As a player who does not use bow and rarely encounters it on the battlefield I can not answer this question sufficiently. Of course I would like every weapon to be perfectly viable in both v and v environments ground or air.gt  Do you think old black color will come back and how do you think it will ? I have no idea what the other devs are planning with this it is my prediction that it may come back as an entirely new color available at a certain character level similar to how white and black already work.gt How will the automated tournament system work ? Is it going to be like the single player tournament or more similar to Challonge ? Again I dont know for sure. Im not sure if the other devs have confirmed this feature would ever even exist. It would be very nice though I imagine probably work in a way similar to automated Bloodline Champions tournaments.gt How much time does it took you go answer all this questions ? Like  minutes.

7889094,0,t3_4narwd,As people may have said the key to Ada is learning her weapons spacing in conjunction with her stats. She has  def but that means everything else has a high stat. Using her high speed and dex is essential to playing her well. As for spear learning what you can chase dodge into after landing a hit is pretty essential. Learning how to combo with dlight into moves is pretty important as well. Other than that its learning how to punish bad movements and attacks but that can be said for almost any weapon I suppose. ,Brawlhalla,d42t2fy,1,t5_31c1d

8100489,0,t3_4q4mib,The main problem with spamming is that its illdefined. I dont know if you mean youre basically just standing still using the same attack over and over or if youre playing a high dex char so it makes sense to utilize a high frequency of attacks. Whats the opposite of spamming? To just bait attacks and attack every three seconds so people can dodge them all? Honestly though spamming is a word without meaning some would consider a combo or a string of attacks spamming. If they run into it then spam away when people stop running into it adapt and adjust. If what youre doing raises your elo then go for it until it doesnt. That goes for defensive play evasive play passive play throwing play etc also. If it works do it. Everyone else is using a crutch to get ahead if yours counters theirs then youre doing something right and if it doesnt then you need to figure out what will.,Brawlhalla,d4qkgfj,1,t5_31c1d

8118879,0,t3_4qedoc,To expand on what CharlesDoofus said Teros by design lives and breathes by his ability to read his opponent. If you throw out something punishable you should expect to be punished. If parry is giving you problems then you just have to read when theyre going to dodge and then punish the dodge. If they literally stand still get just outside of their attack range and see what they do.Another thing to consider is that people tend to react consistently to certain events. Pressuring them with an empty approach is an example of seeing how they react but it goes both ways. If katars or other string based weapons are giving you a hard time its probably because youre escapedodging predictably. Pay attention to how you react to your opponents pressure and try to mix it up.,Brawlhalla,d4smv4v,1,t5_31c1d

8142753,0,t1_d4v9ki5,So Brawlhalla gameplay runs at  frames per second. A change of time to hit by  is a difference of  frame. It may not sound like a lot but its amazing how much you can feel the difference when you play. Of course it also matters what the original value was decreasing from  to  would feel more significant than decreasing from  to . Damage is pretty easy as it is just the base damage value of the attack which is then modified by attackers strength targets defense charge time etc. How those relate to health color on the Legends pretty much every  damage is when you reach a new solid color white yellow orange red.The force values are a bit proprietary and you can generally tell by feel but Fixed Force is the base knockback that is always applied and Variable Force is what determines the scaling with damage et al. Easy way to think about it Hammer stomp has moderate to low Fixed Force and very little Variable Force while Signatures tend to have large Variable Force values which is why their knockback increases so greatly as you build damage on the opponent.,Brawlhalla,d4ve1bx,1,t5_31c1d

8344863,0,t3_4ttes0,Alright alright alright alright alrightRNG  The rng in Brawlhalla has no purpose I agree. Its a minor problem in my opinion.Weapon Throws  Weapon throws are probably the biggest problem I have with Brawlhalla right now. Have you considered that a throw based playstyle uses the same attack for half or more than half of their moves? That would be unacceptable balance wise for any other attack.Bombs  I dont get bombs either. Thats it really.Bow  Eh. Its the flavor of the month right now and will  get nerfed soon. Meta weapons will always emerge not much that can be done about that.Passive play  All weapon kits are rewarded by passive play in fact. Several are also rewarded by a more pressuring stringheavy playstyle but you can play passively with every weapon in the game and itll work out. Axe for example has all the tools to rush down and pressure. It also has all the tools to defend and play passively.Passive play will always and should always exist and be viable somewhere in the game it just shouldnt be the running theme between all weapons. diamond for what its worth.,Brawlhalla,d5kntzh,1,t5_31c1d

8528941,0,t3_4whtm0,Tbh I feel that axe attacks are very fast. I think the best way to fight them is to pop in after they swing because although the attack comes out fast each move has a fair amount of recovery time afterwards. If you have a short ranged weapon your best bet is to try and parry their swings rather than be aggressive. And when youre at orangered keep a wary eye out for them going in for a recovery move if youre in the air or a ground pound if youre on the edge. Do your best to maneuver around these as they can easily kill you at any angle. As many people say the best way to learn how to fight a certain weapon is to play it a little.Im not sure what rank you are but I feel these are always good tips to keep in mind when facing axe players at any level.

8636598,0,t3_4y4pny,I think I read something before that plat players are really good and performing strings and combos accurately but diamond players know how to play their opponent much better. Up until I was plat I would perform the same moves depending on how I initiated them. The problem with higher elo diamond gameplay is that  of the time your opponent will know these standard retaliations. The only way to get and maintain diamond elo is to become less predictable. And imo the best way to do this is to learn as many different strings and combos as possible rather than just a  and done type of move each time. Dont approach your opponent in such an obvious way that he is already prepared to counter you. You might have to utilize dodge options and even delay your approaches. Nothing is forcing you to attack immediately. Many diamond players utilize tricky options such as throwing weapons and dodging to suddenly secure their approach. Aside from these ideas it should be apparent that you might not climb elo as easily if you dont use your mains. Its probably impossible to gain elo if youre not confident with your character. All of these are just my opinion so Im not sure exactly how many others would agree but I think most of this seems pretty logical.tldr Find a way to become less predictable high plat and diamond players know everything you know so you need to somehow make things different. Learn as many ways as possible to approach and attack your opponent so that you can become more flexible. Focus on playing your opponent rather than playing the game with the same moves constantly. Try to read your opponent as hard as you can actively.Bonus I really believe in this try different characters! You may be surprised how much you might enjoy a certain character without realizing it. You might even prefer some characters over your mains that youve gotten to like lvl . For instance I was gold  when I started to gain interest in Brynn and got diamond for the first time that afternoon. Regardless its important to play all the characters for the sake of knowing how to play against them anyways. ,Brawlhalla,d6l6l12,3,t5_31c1d

8653264,0,t1_d6m4myq,tech is fine by me. grav cancels ledge cancels all take skill to use they are not unavoidable damage on the opponents part.i do agree on your points about nerfing the move. i was thinking more about nerfing the concept of a true combo thoughim still unsure about exactly the best way to make combos not true im thinking doing another attack has some cool down but not exactly recovery time ie you can dodge and move and jump but cant attack in that time. also i dont mean short true combos should be eradicated if they dont do much damage and dont have much force or killing potential but i do mean that they shouldnt work for a huge range of dmg ie more variable force at higher damage so they dont work and opponent gets a window actually ie katar slight into nilght works only at lower damage as slight pushes farther at higher damage whereas sword dlight into sair works at higher damage as even thought the dlight does push farther away the stun time is still high enough to go into the sair. stun times andor attack cool downs probably the first one would be better as well as just general adition to force according to percentage another ex gauntlet slight into sair not true but slight doesnt push at all pretty much at max percentage but it should imo,Brawlhalla,d6n9svx,1,t5_31c1d

8919256,0,t3_52dbhi,Theres actually a lot of nuance to it. The biggest thing I can tell you that is specific to v and not general Brawlhalla ability is to not get stacked with your teammate. That leads to situations where youre covering less ground threatening fewer options risking getting happy birthdayd and getting in eachothers way. Beyond that a lot of v can focus around getting and taking advantage of vs. If one player wants to be passive you can use that to force a v. Just keep an eye out for when they finally realize that they need to engage and dont get caught off guard. Lastly stay close enough that you can punish if they go for any moves that have extended durations of lockdown. Things like Vraxxs lance nsig and even a lot of nlights and unarmed nair will last long enough that you can react to your buddy getting hit and go and either break him out or damage the enemy. Hope that helps. Cheers.,Brawlhalla,d7jypvp,1,t5_31c1d

Mainly because in one the the relatively recent patches they updated the UI to clearly express how stats have been modified by the current stance.Also I see some players using your argument that stances put too much burden on players to adjust to different versions of a legend yet others dont like stances because they dont make a big enough difference to be worth implementing.

9133212,0,t3_5561ri,After the recent update and as someone who uses the Axe a lot i feel like some small adjustments can be made. Previously it was a bit too strong and BMG went ahead and reworked the hitboxes to make it a bit more... precise i guess. Now however i find myself missing a lot more often even missing while i watch the head of the axe go through my opponent. I feel that the appropriate balance for the axe is if you have smaller hitboxes you should have shorter recovery frames. Being able to swing more to make up for increased whiffs would bring back what the axe should be without overcompensating. It seems like a simple thing to do relative to reworking entire hitboxes again and now with the hitboxes the way they are... i feel like  frames less in recovery most especially grounded side light whould be a godsend. I saw another person in this thread that said the nlight could be reworked to be  and shoot ppl up but tbh i feel like it would just get abused with gcs. The Axes strongsuit has always been huge sweeping attacks with maximum force with the downside of being unwieldy. Now with less sweeping motions i feel it can be a bit more streamlined.

9459921,0,t3_5a9zj3,You play katars? Everytime I beat you in ranked it was on Gnash. And thats all I ever saw you on. And your playstyle usually consisted of throw into unarmed which is probably why youre struggling now.  Anyways I dont think parry or passive is an issue. There was an argument to be made before but not now. The chase dodge changes favor aggressive play. You can approach and mixup way better as well as use the invuln frames to straight up win trades.    I think most people who have issues with passiveparry players are just impatientscared players. So many times a player will dodge just because you walk close to them instead of just swinging.  ,Brawlhalla,d9f41tb,3,t5_31c1d

I can understand that some trans people are self conscious about being trans for many reasons one of them being that it could be illegal to be trans or that their family and friends arent that accepting. I feel that if trans people say that their trans there wont be this stigma of them having to hide it or think that their weird because of the body that theyre in. I just put the fact down that im trans to open up peoples minds and say Hey! The gender of the character doesnt matter for who im cosplaying!

But as with anything its situational. If you use a taunt in a way that is clearly meant to annoy then that is definitely BM.

It really depends on what you like and what you wont rage quit with easily. I personally hate FPSs so if I tried to get competitive at csgo Id end up slitting my wrists a couple hours into playing. Ive always loved SSBB and brawlhalla was like an alternative so I tried it and its way better imo. And about choosing legends. Right now theres  and on wednesday there will be . Its really about the types of weapons you like to use. I mained asuri and I really liked her because I thought I was good with sword and katars. As I played I realized that Im ass with katars and get hit waaaaaaay too much. So I needed a spacing weapon and more defense so I swictehd to Sir Roland. Only  legends are available at a time to play online but you can try all of them out in training mode and really decide who you like there.I personally love the game and if youre into D fighters then you probably will too.,Brawlhalla,da1acn0,2,t5_31c1d

Accepted submissions could be contracted for use and the artist could make royalities based on a percentage of that skins sales.  BMG would need to figure out a fair percentage.

10052351,0,t3_5jmos0,You must further define what the problem is before you complain about it. All that was mentioned was going full retard and giving away stage control garunteed follow ups and punishing punishable stuff. This gameplay doesnt make any sense anytime someone wall hugs they are punished for it. If you put yourself on the edge constantly you die because that is a dangerous position. Why in the fuck wouldnt you go for garunteed follow ups? The chance you might mess it up? Who above a decent enough skill level to demand a change be made is missing BASIC COMBOS?? Further more you provide NO solution how do we fix a flawed system to you? Do you think such a change would benefit you or will you just complain until you realise you cant wait for bmg to make you a top player you have to improve by yourself. This whole Oh i only lose cause passive play is good Circlejerk is seriously out of hand. A MINORITY in brawlhalla the unskilled nonthoughtful playerbase makes such an argument valid for those who normally could think around something this rediculous. Clearly you dont understand a fighting games theory neither does the majority of people who see a flawed post.

10384824,0,t3_5oklnz,I totally understand where youre coming from and Ive definitely noticed the coolness creep with some of the new signatures although I will say that Crosss down and side guns and Vals down sword were the old default heavies when characters only had one unique signature on each weapon. dedsin and draild have been working on making new signatures for a while now and a big part of the new signatures seeming so much cooler is that theyve been getting better at it. Another big factor is that theyre trying to come up with stuff yall havent seen before. Itd be really easy to just keep reskinning the same attacks over and over again but those guys are killing it coming up with all of these new concepts fun fact the active input you see on the scythe kit was originally pitched for Dianas whip signatures. Youd be surprised with how difficult it gets to keep coming up with new ideas while still working within the design limitations weve set for signatures e.g. no true projectiles. One last thing that was working against the old legends is the aforementioned fact they used to only have a single signature per weapon. Teros was the first character we released that always had  unique moves and all the characters before that had their signatures done at a much faster pace than we go at now because going back and redoing old characters slows everything else down. So they were really limited to one or two fancy effectsheavy moves per character. The fact is though that coming out with new characters has been very good for the game. You can look on SteamDB and see a nice uptick in player numbers every time one comes out. Regularly releasing new characters is also a very loud and clear way of saying that this game is under constant development and that your time and money spent with and on Brawlhalla wont be wasted because the playerbase isnt falling off any time soon and BMG isnt going to suddenly shut down the servers on you.Also dont be fooled some of the older characters may not have such flashy signatures but what they lack in flash they often make up for in brutal efficiency. Ill use Bodvars down sword as exhibit A on that one. The flashier a move is the more time you need to sell the animation. Hell I main Barraza and Diana and Id kill to get Cassidy or Vraxxs gun kits on either of them.,Brawlhalla,dcl6myw,2,t5_31c1d

10865858,0,t3_5ucvaa,I use the new legend from the day it came so I think I can say for starters I noticed many people having difficulty playing ax and sword ax is slow with very fast attacks along with a giant range that gets difficult To use scythe sword is very fast with its attacks type dlight exit dair and recovery mainly dair I drew these conclusions by my games and my friends.I really think the new legend balanced has little attack dex and speed are In an OK level and his defense is good I think his sigs are not so strong but we will analyze. Scythes dsig has a great value but not something that should be taken away because every legend has something that stands out more. Its neutral signature of scythe is difficult to use and does not offer much security in relation to the punishment sidesig you need to learn to use your range but the signature itself is not anything so extravagantabout the blaster the neutral signature is really a Surprise I did not think so strong because of its hitbox and also because it is very predictable it is different from the neutral signature of the asuri that aggressive on the opponent that you jump towards the opponent that is much better sidesig is very good to finish Because it is  separate hits so it may be a surprise to the opponent the second hit this signature itself is very good I have nothing to argue about dsig it is really a surprise because of its range it goes up a lot  But it works as follows either you hit or youre punished because of that I think the signature is balanced,Brawlhalla,de0qieb,2,t5_31c1d

Your companys VPN takes a better path than your normal network. Publicly available Gaming VPNs are widely available and a successful industry due to this.gt Seems a bit odd that just about any other multiplayer game ... are fineFighting games require a much more stable connection than any other genre. Most other multiplayer games are asymmetrical meaning every client does not need to be perfectly synced. Assumptions can be made based on many things from a networking aspect and spikesdrops are not as noticable. Brawlhalla is particularly susceptible to unstable connections because we use advanced netcode in a place where most fighting games would use input delay this is why Brawlhalla feels like youre playing locally until your connection is so poor that we force input delay this is noted when you dont have green bars. We are also constantly working on improving this netcode to tolerate unstable connections better and the connection reports players provide to support as you have help with that so thanks sorry if you didnt get the answer you were hoping for.gt especially games with a lot more data going through the stream are fineThroughput is not the issue here stability is. Doesnt matter if you have  mbps  if a packet comes in ms later than the last one you sent or worse yet drops completely the game is going to have some trouble figuring out what input you made. That is not unreasonable or odd.Hope this helps sorry youre having trouble man.,Brawlhalla,de44thw,4,t5_31c1d

10940229,0,t1_de8dbfg,No sir he is landing. Heres the explanation i alredy copypasted  times.gt any attack can ground check if you touch the ground or the edge with any attack you get your jumps back. recoveries have startup frames so they dont pull you up until the startup frames ends. While you are in startup frames gravity affects you so your recovery pull you down due to gravity in the startup frames. If you touch the ground in your start up frames you get your jumps back like a any other attack in the game. After that when the attack starts it pulls you to wherever it should pull you like any other attack. You can test this biy doing a grounded rocket lance sair in the corner of the map. You will get your jumps and recovery back. Edit sorry for my english im practicing it P,Brawlhalla,de8eor7,1,t5_31c1d

11010874,0,t1_deg0yef,The problem with your logic is that most other games dont use GGPO. They use interpolation to smooth out the visuals which allows for significantly smoother gameplay even with higher latency andor packet loss. You experience large amounts of rollbacks because of the way GGPO works. I believe I explained this already but it functions on a prediction and rollback system. A rollback will occur if the prediction fails because the clients have to resynchronize to the correct state.The  packet loss to the cogentco nodes is caused by them blocking ICMP echo requests. It has nothing at all to do with real world packet loss as games and other services  use UDP or TCP to transmit data not ICMP.I have updated my Guide on Checking LatencyPacket Loss You will most likely find that WinMTR or MTR will not have the same  packet loss issue as it uses UDP.,Brawlhalla,deg1von,2,t5_31c1d

I understand the intention to make the game more balanced but I dont know what was wrong with katars for example. Now they feel just ugly and slow  they do way less damage. Like wheres the fast but weak nature of a weapon? Now its either weak AND slow.I think that if you have some weapons in the game that are overpowered give the other ones some advantage too? So it would be a fun game and not so gray and boring and serious and polished where all the weapons are equally dull. Its up to the devs of course Im just saying. Today Ive played a little after the season  came out and its just frustrating the amount of cancer and the way the game generally feels.

In both cases players dont want to move out of an area where theyre favored but I consider being forced to play along offstagein pits more frustrating than being forced to go onstage because of the possibility for a single punish to swing an entire stock of advantage so I side with OP.,Brawlhalla,dfik4tu,3,t5_31c1d

11435947,0,t3_638zgh,I agree with many of your points. I bought the founders pack in April  so I been playing this game for  years now I only have like  hours though cuz I am old and have priorities.The game at first seemed like it just wanted to be a casual party game for fun only had ffa which is where that easy and accessible thing came from. But as time went on Brawlhalla evolved and v became a thing. Now Brawlhalla is full steam ahead in trying to become a competitive esport. So the initial goal of Brawlhalla drastically changed for the better in my opinion. But the mechanics of the game have not really evolved enough to be very competitive by nature as other esport fighters.Combostring potential is weak I agree with you. What they did recently is a step in the right direction but there is still something missing that I cant quite put my finger on. Maybe it needs more gravity so the game feels faster cuz right now it feels very floaty. High level play consists of people jumping then jumping again then air hop then air hop again and punish opponents whiff.Chain dodges to me have always felt clunky. The new chain dodge is better than before but it is extremely clunky still. I was hoping for it to be more of a dash than chaining dodges together. Like hold down the dodge button to dash. So it can perform a normal dodge and if you are holding it down you can dash without invulnerability. And perhaps to encourage aggressive approaches during the dash your attacks can have more damage. The dash could have same limitations chain dodges have like only activated at max speed to stop spot dodgers from taking advantage of the extra dash damage. Something along those lines. And reworking the animation would be great. Chase chain gravity cancels dodges just look way too similar visually that beginners think they are bugs.And yea I agree that the new legends are getting more love. They should go back and add some of that love back to the old legends. Like Lord Vraxx lance dsig I think thats the one that grabs you and whips you back that can be made so it has active input. There are many sigs that can be reworked like this while still keeping most of the sig exactly the same.Gadgets... yea dont know why they have not been removed from ranked yet. They are just silly. If they are not in tournaments they really just have to go from ranked. They can then keep adding more gadgets to all the other queues because many different gadgets exist in the game files.I agree with your wall slip recommendation. I think many people have suggested that already so hopefully they add that in the test features so we can test it out.Overall this is still my favorite game and the only game I have put over k hours. The devs are real cool and attentive I have faith the game will continue to evolve for the better.,Brawlhalla,dfs94qe,3,t5_31c1d

It doesnt add to the post at all unless you genuinely think someone on the internet saying theyre a pixel artist validates their opinion on something.You dont have to say this is shit to give useful criticism makes you seem like you dont actually care about helping the dudegal improve and you just like feeling better than other people HMM,Brawlhalla,dgnctxr,3,t5_31c1d
11719877,0,t1_dgofn7z,I consider it much worse than katars. Katars were annoying af to fight against but at least you could dodge to get away from its strings and counterattack unless read hard. However with scythe there literally no option for counter attacking so youre forced to dodge away in hopes of resetting the neutral assuming they dont read you considering scythe covers almost every single dodge option. This effectively slows down the pace of the game as you have no means to safely approach and are forced to wait for your opponent to fuck up. ,Brawlhalla,dgoh618,2,t5_31c1d
