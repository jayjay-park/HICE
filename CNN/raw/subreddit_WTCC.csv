5185360,0,t1_cv93ce3,I am so glad you had a good time at the race. I was fortunate and arrived on Wednesday morning in Japan and was at the circuit later that day living in HK driving was easy for me as no change of sides!!I am a photographer for the TCSA Touring Car Series of Asia which is a support race at the WTCC so access etc was easy during the weekend however far more challenging at Motegi than at other circuits I attend.  Overall I found the racing was great however due to other commitments I only managed to get on track during qualifying and Race . I feel that the access to drivers is good and similar to BTCC and WEC.Take careKeith,WTCC,cvb0ymn,2,t5_2tdf0
