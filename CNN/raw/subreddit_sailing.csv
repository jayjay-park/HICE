He was the chief technology officer and cofounder of Whisper Systems which was acquired by Twitter for an undisclosed amount in late .Yeah hes not just well off he is VERY rich.

Imagining it the other way they would need to tow from the hull cant think of any good tow points on the bottom while keeping the mast held down. That seems like a more difficult balancing act because the boat on the mast end would have to keep up without pushing but also hold the mast down.Also I would rather have rig damage than hull damage on a boat like that.

1519971,0,t3_2bm03s,I dont think youll get a good seaworthy vessel for  maybe .  Even at  Id expect its largely under equipped for an offshore passage but if you do decide to get a boat hull design should be a big focus.  A fin keel boat with a relatively flat hull like the hull on our Dufour  is becoming increasingly popular and if seas are calm andor waves are on the beam or aft but a flat hull doesnt do as well into the sea.  You probably wouldnt care island hopping around the Caribbean although the draft can be prohibitive it would be quite unpleasant on say a TransAtlantic if you were caught in prolonged bad weather.A full keel is more traditional and a better long term cruising boat.  They dont maneuver as well around the dock and in calm seas are slower but youll be much more comfortable in bigger seas and have less draft making more harbors accessible. I dont know what you plan to use your boat for if its only weekend outings you might have some success with your budget if you find someone desperate to sell.  If youre looking to log a few hundred miles on the ocean I think youre a little optimistic.,sailing,cj6t08x,2,t5_2qiye

1615378,0,t3_2csyc5,There might be a lake somewhere that hosts sailboat races find someone looking for crew ballast and jump on.  Look at boat charters find one with a captain and sail a few Caribbean islands or islands nearby.  If you like it buy an old sturdy boat move to the coast and start practicing in the local bay and outfitting the boat for an ocean crossing.    Youre about as far from a circumnavigation as it goes right now but if you seriously devote yourself to it then possibly in  years.  Id focus on moving to the coast and buying a boat in  years and go from there Florida would be my recommendation because you have an easy first ocean passage over to the Bahamas.

2179451,0,t3_2k0jp4,You can answer this sort of question with engineering. The strength of the materials is well known and there are equations for the bending stress in a tube. Basically for a given length of tube you want to know the rough diameter and wall thickness required to support the load generated by the tack of the spinnaker. Or to look at it another way how much load a particular tube can take before the most stressed part reaches its breaking point.The equations you want will be for where one end cant rotate the front fixing on the deck and the other end can.A structural engineer could work it out easily but anyone who did a engineering degree should be able to its firstyear stuff. Unfortunately it was far too long ago for me and Ive forgotten it all!One thing I can tell you is that the stress goes up with the square of the length and diameter is more important than wall thickness. You could approximate the round tube as a square one and not be too far out.The hard bit here is that youve no idea how much load to work to. What may be fine in a light wind wont stand up to a stronger wind  every step in the Beaufort scale roughly doubles the load. You could look at the breaking load of the tack line. Id guess that on a  boat the amount of force generated by a sail maybe similar to one persons weight.OTOH It maybe easiest to use the totally unscientific method of just leaning against a few different tubes to see how much they bend. I suspect that if you supported both ends of a dinghy spinnaker pole and stood in the middle it would break while a laser boom might not. Thats for a conventional pole. You could reduce the loads a lot if you had two poles in a triangle from either side of the pulpit with a bobstay down to the waterline. Ive also seen a a boat using plank of wood and a bobstay  the plank is very strong sideways and the stay takes the vertical load.Also unless youve got a laser boom lying around it would be cheaper to just order the tube.,sailing,clgv0f6,2,t5_2qiye

The MAIB UKs marine accident investigators  put I think  cargo ship groundings in Uk waters this year to the same problem.Either way navigators need to be aware that all nautical charts are inaccurate  the question is by how much.

Usually this is done with the crew departing on the same ship but shit happens medical and personal emergencies and so the Captain would then be required to pay airfare to repatriate the crew member before the ship was allowed to leave the country.So it does not sound unreasonable to me but ask himher to explain it fully so you can make sure this is the reason.

3496966,0,t1_cppta8l,Some corrections  The house is forward not aft.  Hull girder strength is easy. Finally long aft bodies are fantastic for propulsive efficiency and reducing transom effects and low pressure zones in the aft body.  If you pull the keel away in that picture of the Star of India required to support rudder and long. strength youd see a very similar profile.  Several other things Podded propulsory can be very efficient. The ones typically used in Rig Support boats arent as they are designed for bollard but the ones used on cruise ships and other vessels can be very efficient as you can get them deep out of the turbulent attached hull flow and in a open stream which increases your wake fraction and reduces thrust reduction i.e. good things.  Additionally many pods are electric drive so no gearing losses and minimal shaft losses and can be utilized with a distributed High Voltage distribution system which is not only very efficient but can allow for compact and versatile arrangements of prime movers which can be placed all the way up forward if they so wish or all the way back aft where it appears theyve got casings in their rendering.  So Pods can equal very good. This sites claim about efficiencies are ridiculous.  You know those CSX commercials in the US touting how far they can carry a ton of cargo on one gallon of fuel? Out of curiousity I did that for the Emma Maersk one of the larger container vessels a while ago.The CSX commercial claims  tons travel a mile per gallon of fuel for their trains? The standard road truck you see on the road gets . tons travelling a mile per gallon of fuel. Airline cargo shipping?  tons travel a mile for each gallon of fuel. In contrast the EM transits  tons of cargo a mile per gallon of fuel. Sure it is pumping out comparitively more emissions SOx and NOx especially but new IMO regs have curbed that since I did this calc but it is doing the work of nearly  trucks or   cargo variant jumbo jets at much higher efficiencies. Hey a prius would have to get  ish miles per gallon to match the efficiency of the Emma Maersk think about that!  The best way to improve the worlds shipping efficiency is to increase the amount of cargo they carry and get rid of old ships.  And I did that calc about  years ago...  In general the maritime industry ships  by volume of cargo and only uses  of the fuel...  A forward center of lateral resistance is only an issue if the center of effort in the sails is too far offset. Also given the highly controllable arrangement of sails can be mitigated by trim balanced against rudder forces.  There are bigger issues here.  First loading and unloading.  Those massive rigs would make it nearly impossible for the vessel to be used as a container ship as most ports require the cranes to traverse along their rails to pull the containers and its a pain to have to raise and lower the booms just to do that.  As a tanker or bulk carrier the hull will experience such a range of displacements that it may have stability issues and maximizing the hull efficiency for such a large range of displacements would be difficult.  A RoRo seems silly because it is such a high volume low weight cargo that the ships need to be pretty massive. Port access?  Many ports are limited in overhead draft.  Depending on how large they want to make these things it could become an issue.  Next supply chain issues.  Modern ships are very good at meeting schedules.  This concept which relies on weather routing and luck will be less reliable which is an issue in this Just In Time delivery world.Is there room in shipping for wind assisted ships?  Yes but primarily in local and regional shipping.  Want to get wine from France to Ireland and Whisky south?  A square rigger is a great idea.  Want to get  containers from China to Germany?  A slow speed diesel on a massive ship is your best bet.,sailing,cpqvo4j,1,t5_2qiye

We stopped the survey partial way through and he said you want to stop now I wont charge the  I will just charge you . There was a big stress crack on port side of the keel. I had looked at this boat numerous times and I thought all I was going to have to do to the bottom was sand and repaint it. I cant believe I missed that. There was also a big repaired damage mark on starboard. We are talking a hole a foot wide circle. I didnt see that.  This all came out in that survey. of the boat I rejected and walked away from. My kids me and my wife were in LOVE with that boat and I was getting   foot hunter for about  Now Ive learned that the boat PROBABLY would have been ok. but it had no features. I learned Everyone uses autopilot and this boat didnt have that either. I also used brokers too. Generally that means they start at  foot and up. You cant get a broker to handle a boat smaller from what I saw. Dealing with a broker was just easier. I paid cash for the boat. They did all the title work. The called me when the boat was mine. I put  down.. the boat was HELD.. no one could sell it from under me. It was a MUCH better feeling. The second survey FULL same guy was . that being said. I NOW know I could look at a boat myself and pretty much figure it out. I might get an INSURANCE survey now which is just for someone to insure it. I think it was worth the  to get the boat surveyed.

It was my impression that it would be possible for them to roll they seemed tender.   I think it had to do with the keels being steel and not lead or  It might have been the low quality and small size of the boats as much as the swing keel.   The high PHRF like  made them not fun.    The idea of going out in  waves and  knots was terrifying whereas itd be no problem with a fixed keel even of similar size.  Ive seen  kts and  waves in a  fixed keel and after the initial fear I started to enjoy it.I broached once in a  lift keel a U but I still felt more confident in that boat as it was wider faster and better designed than the  swing keels I was on.   The only other keel boats Ive broached on have been two different J and I still have confidence in them.   Maybe a broach in a swing keel would have changed my feeling on them.     In a dagger board dinghy I just take it as part of the game.Id just rather not sail on a swing keel.   I havent tried the Cal  or the S . which I think are bigger swing keels they may be fine esp. if you intend to be out in shallower water.   Where I sail Im generally in  feet of water and I leave my boat in the water for the season so I like the fin keel.  One of the biggest problems I had with the fixed keel was the expense of the travel lift which I mitigated by going to a J which can be single point lifted by a crane.,sailing,csbjk50,2,t5_2qiye

Not to mention getting out of congested waterways under nothing but sail in anything like a reasonably sized liveaboard would seem to be overly difficult without an engine.  What is surprising to me is that we are still using them to drive the powertrain of the boat! Seems that the new batteries from Tesla for home power plus a generator and a small electric motor which in reverse can generate power as well would be an ideal solution for boats.

4660737,0,t3_3erxta,If I google DampD   then I see quite a few hits. I say this not to tell you you should google it doofus but because thats about the amount of info I might expect especially for an obscure s model.It looks like theres a DampD boat builder in Germany today and there used to be another one in Canada. This guy got no further.Frankly there can be remarkably little information available online even for boats which were built by the hundred. It doesnt really matter  some of them were built like this later in the run they changed to this other method of construction  whats important is how seaworthy it is today.I think these are both listings for the same boat  There are more photos in the Yachtworld listing but you can see the engine is the same in both listings even down to the yellow handle on the oil dipstick and the red label on the white oil filter.This boat as designed is clearly perfectly good for bluewater. To say more would require inspection and a surveyor.I dont think Heart Attack Bob is pricing it cheap because this boat is crap I think hes pricing it that low because hes realistic.Nevertheless I suspect it would be quite a bit of work to get her fully seaworthy.If you look inside this boat you will see little jobs that need doing up and youll think thats nothing a little elbow grease wont fix  Ill sand it down slap on a bit of varnish. These jobs will rapidly multiply beyond your expectations.Do you think Bob will accept as little as ? There may well be someone out there that will pay  for this boat. I would not buy it. I think you could easily spend another  fixing up this boat and end up with one that is not better than those currently offered  or  but whose owners will accept  or  for cash.Looking at these photos again I dislike the rust in this photo  its on the chain in the heads of screws and also seems to be where the two plates have been welded youd want to look at all the standing rigging with a magnifying glass for yourself and then youd want a surveyor or rigger to do the same to spot what you missed. I dislike also the state of the plywood in this photo  observe the water stains in the upper panel and the cracking to the right of the carving where the top surface of the plywood is breaking away. I also notice the name Moonshadow on the transom which confirms its the same boat as in this listing  so its been on the market since .If you have only  in cash and an army pension this could be a good buy. If you have no commitments and the boatyard will let you live on board and do all the work yourself then in  or  months you could have a good vessel.I think that for most people this boat will require  off the starting line k to purchase k in getting it seaworthy and I think that if you have that much cash youd be better off going around all the boats which look minty and well maintained and keep putting in cheeky offers until you find someone desperate. ,sailing,cti1j9z,2,t5_2qiye

At an exceptional price.  If you take reasonable care of the engine you may never see the catastrophic failure. The real bargain in my view is the set of extra sails. Many boats in this price range have blown out of shape sails and missing inventory. Reef before you have to and change down on the jib early rather than late and you too will sell this beauty some day for more than you paid for it.Youve got the right idea about investing elbow grease to renew the interior theres always plenty of that for a guy that loves his boat even if there isnt much money.Its a special feeling that big beautiful boat and the key to that little brass padlock in your hand early on a Sunday morning.

Remember that youre competing against thousands of locals who will work for pennies.In terms of actually learning to sail youll be better off on a racing yacht.

Boats like a laser or hobbie have a timelessness to them since they will always be quick to rig up unforgiving sporty boats. Even when youve got  miles in the open ocean under you you will always get a thrill out of boats like that. If you really want to take people out on a more relaxing day but still get wind in your sails then maybe a small cruiser is the right pick. It would have a cabin and even a berth if you wanted to anchor a night or check out a different marina for a night. The boat you linked will certainly be an good instructional sailboat for you and probably really fun to sail. If youre looking for a boat that is a fun daysailer and want to be able to grab a few friends along but really would never go out for more than a few hours and always return to the same port. It comes down to what do you really want to do with the boat. Dont  think of boats as beginner boats or advanced boats youll get used to and learn any boat you get.,sailing,cuz5wol,1,t5_2qiye

And jib sheets are made from a variety of materials from cotton to polyester and most advanced jib sheets are other forms polyethylene derivatives these days dacron has lost a lot of favor due to its weight characteristics.  If you moor your boat such that line stretch is an important factor youre asking for trouble in my opinion.  the idea is to hold the boat loosely against the pier or dock and let the fenders take most of the impacts never ever the lines.  For tying to a mooring buoy nylon makes sense because it doesnt mind being submerged for extended periods but again I dont think its stretch is that huge a factor.,sailing,cvp1xfu,1,t5_2qiye

We call our inner headsail the jib and the outer the yankee to keep things simple. Were going along nicely in about a  knot wind and I head down below to make up some coffee. I hear the helm call out the tack and we move nicely through the wind and catch it on the other side. Things settle down a bit and I call up someone needs to tack the yankee. And there it was backwinded which may have helped through the tack tbh .Everyone thought I was some sort of savant but it was just the feeling of the boat under my feet.

6026756,0,t1_cy8um0o,Well again a lot of these options come down to preference which only comes with experience...But Folding prop is going to require more maintenance than a fixed prop and is much more expensive.  It will also reduce fuel economy when motoring BUT a fixed prop will slow you down when sailing and has a chance of getting snagged on fishing lines.  Given your inexperience Im pretty sure youre going to run aground at some point.  Go for the less expensive fixed propeller if you make it a year and feel differently invest in the folding prop.  You lose no money doing it this way. Batteries dont buy more batteries until you have a good idea of what your power plan is going to be.  If youre going to be running for long hours without the generator then sure buy more.  But it sounds like you plan to throw on a wind generator or solar panels and quite frankly?  You can pick up new batteries anywhere if you need them and have the money. Bow thruster.  Sigh.  Youll probably need it.  Makes docking much easier.  Maybe if I tell you to buy it youll crash into a few less things... Electric sheet winches nope.  I want you to suffer like the rest of us did.  Sorry getting a bit bitter here.  Let me grab another beer... okay.  Do you plan to be sailing by yourself much?  If thats the case might be nice to have the electric option.  However I might recommend you take on extra hands whenever you can and I could certainly recommend a few young folk to you who would love to teach you what they know about sailing. Seriously fing christ a washing machine?  Ok in all seriousness dont overbuild your electrical system unless youre willing to pay someone who knows what theyre doing to troubleshoot it andor redesign it for you.  Because youre going to have issues. Combi is probably the right choice for you but therere risks involved.  Its one piece of equipment that acts as a battery charger when theres AC power from shore or the generator and acts as an inverter otherwise.  Its risky because a youre going to have pay close attention to make sure its operating in the correct mode b turn it off entirely when trying to save battery power you may wish to invest in a battery voltage alarm on the house bank and c if it fails youve now lost two functions one of which is fairly essential. I dont have much experience with FurlIn masts.  As I understand it you wont be able to effectively reef these sails?  Not to mention if you have to blow the sail in a gale youve lost a lot of time.

For power yachts Fort Lauderdale is the main option.

6413993,0,t3_43jhw6,For annual maintenance the rule of thumb is  of boat value but there are a lot of variables especially with an older boat. I dont do much to my boat because Im a cheapskate and Id rather use it than work on it so some years I dont pay for much more than gas for the outboard. If you care about looks and safety you may be investing more than me.For restoring the cost is proportional to what you want to end up with. Some thoughts... Do you have a place to keep it?  If not you will have to pay rent on the hard boatyard or in the water mooring  dock fees. These vary wildly from place to place and often the harbor Nazis wont simply let you borrow a friends mooring... Anchoring is free but you probably dont want to do that on a long term basis. Will you be paying rent to keep the trailer somewhere and rent to keep the boat somewhere when it is in the water? This will add up annoyingly.  If you already have a free place to keep everything you are way ahead of the game. Congrats.  The trailer is probably the most valuable part of the boat  trailer combo in this agesize range. People always disregard the value of trailers. Take care of your trailer. Make it last. If you need to replace axles springs etc. on this trailer then you might as well buy a new trailer. You can probably get away with an under lb trailer which I think means you will not need brakes  saving you money and maintenance woes. A new trailer will probably run you . In florida you might have better luck with used trailers and parts. You will also have to register the trailer. The outboard. You need one but they are annoying to run on a sailboat of this size so you will use it only when you have to. I have a hp tohatsu on my lb  sailboat. I bought it new for about . I wish I had bought a more powerful outboard. It works but is marginal and can be outright insufficient in heavy winds  currents. I would advise to stick to .hp. Good power for your boats weight plus there is a better resale market there. You can buy used if you are mechanically inclined. An older but functioning  stroke would be cool. New  stroke will cost . Tohatsu pretty much makes all the smaller hp outboard brands so unless you are buying a luxurious honda outboard whatever you are getting is probably really a tohatsu. Depending on where you launch it they will charge you. This can be something like . NBD.  Because you are in Florida you will not have to pay an annual property tax on the boat. Woohoo! You still have to pay title  registration which I would guess would be around . Also NBD.  New canvas would run you    probably but you are good there so awesome... Make sure you are good there... you dont need seams blowing out on your maiden voyage. If you need to replace running rigging the ropes you are probably talking  Im guessing... Standing rigging the cables will run you  Also guessing. Cost will vary depending on vendor but I would try someone who serves commercial fishermen. Rigging is not as critical on your boat as on a boat doing a circumnavigation but you still need to be careful. If the standing rigging hasnt been replaced in    years replace it. You will also need anchor chainline amp dock lines budget . I dont know how well the boat is equipped but all the gizmos and gadgets are the really expensive things... Im talking compass gps blocks winches etc.  to  will probably get you going in this size range. If you need new lights wiring and battery tack on .  PFDs fire extinguisher flares etc. will probably run  Cusions  you dont need them but if you want to be fancy . The rudder. You can probably buy one on ebay craigslist etc... but you can also just make one. Its not that hard. You will need fiberglass and epoxy and a core material. All materials will cost you  if you are cheap and crafty. The important part is having the pintles and gudgeons and installing them correctly. Sorry for the nebulousness of my answer. I didnt add any of that up because its so variable but basically a free  boat with sails like yours has initial costs of between  to . Im not sure you should buy this free boat... but I definitely support you getting a boat. No matter which boat it is it will be a money pit but it will also be an investment in your life.,sailing,czipffj,1,t5_2qiye

6457890,0,t3_44307e,Youre sailing over deep waters with that question. Sail trim has so many variables. But here are some basic differences between a rope boom vang and a rigid boom vang. They essentially work the same. Basically they keep the boom from going too high. You tighten it and lock it into position to prevent your boom from lifting when youre going downwind which causes your main to twist and spill air  and lose power. Their main function is not changed whether theyre rope or rigid. However a rigid boom vang supports the boom when there is nothing else holding it up. If its sized properly you no longer need a topping lift supporting your boom when the sail is down. And it prevents the boom from falling to the deck when you lower the sail to reef. Generally this is needed more when youre going downwind because the boom is further from the centerline which lengthens the main sheet. This allows the boom to move vertically with gusts and shifts. When youre hard on the wind and everything is pretty tight and centered the mainsheet is doing most of the work holding the boom down that you need the boom vang for going downwind. Rigid vangs are definitely a luxury over rope vangs. They wont make much difference in your sail trim. I upgraded to one because the wire rope topping lift that I had was permanently attached to the end of my boom and was constantly snagging at the leech and batten pockets. One year I had over  of main sail repairs caused by that damn topping lift. My rigid boom vang fixed all that. ,sailing,cznaf5d,1,t5_2qiye

6760207,0,t1_d0hzhtv,From my cat sailing I always raced with the main cleated.  As you say the cleat is right on the main block.  The idea is to crank the main on as hard as possible  you cant really keep it in your hand the whole race.  You then use the rudders to control how powered up the boat is.  If you get hit by a gust you just luff up a bit.  If the windward hull starts falling the in water you head down.  Your weight out on trapeze has a lot of leverage so cats also tend to accelerate when a gust comes instead of leaning.Works well but you need to be on your feet.

Ive been on a Buccaneer  had an inboard dieselFrom a racers standpoint they are godawful.From a cruisers standpoint theyre...still not very good.As to your question this is almost certainly NOT an inexpensive way to get into sailing.  If it came with the trailer and you really enjoyed painting and cabinetry work...maybe. But without it forget it!!! The windows are infamous for leaking and that causes all kinds of headaches when left unintended for years. Odds are she needs a full gutting and likely has multiple soft spots on her deck needing to be rebuilt.  Plus cushions gear electronics engine... Lots of  and a lot of sweat blood and tears never mind time. As sailboats they were supposed to be about comfort over form.  Good headroom lots of natural light but yet failed at having a decent layout not much room for sleeping not much access to storage.  A big problem with so much freeboard and the tiny keel means they tend to rock easily and the shoal keel provides a terrible tradeoff when sailing into the wind. Later models reduced the mast height and sail area Im guessing because of inexperienced owners with too much cloth up in rough weather. They were never quality boats but I dont think they were  bottom of the barrel either. I believe they had a lead keel rather then the cheaper iron or worse concrete keels. The gelcoat seemed decent the rigging light but they were never meant for offshore. ,sailing,d0rslde,3,t5_2qiye

7567448,0,t1_d3107yo,First I totally agree with MonsterIt triple check everything on the trailer! That includes always stopping after the first few miles to make sure everything is still properly secured. Make sure your safety chains are on properly.  Ive seen both trailers and other cars totalled from trailers disconnecting.  My mother had to watch a man die from a runaway trailer. Myself I have thousands of miles of trailering sailboats and hundreds of thousands of miles of driving  wheeler once upon a time long ago so Id like to imagine I have some useful experience to add.If youre on back country roads with potholes stop every few miles to check things regardless and also after any amp every major pothole.  Ive had cargo straps winched tight as a guitar string unhook themselves either from the flexing of the trailer or maybe the hull itself. Ive also seen an unstrapped boat hit a pothole at under  mph pulling out of a boat launch and bounce to about a  degree tilt!  As far as trailer would let the keel twist. Would not have believed a sailboat could move on a trailer like that from such a tiny little bump except I was the one towing.  A little faster a bit more of a turn and that trailer could have flipped.  Damn scary! I was just trying to clear the boat launch so the next guy could use it. Previously I use to secure everything properly in the parking lot afterwords.  Luckily I was able to back her back into the water and refloat her properly onto the trailer.  Now? Now I strap every boat down secure before moving any where every time. Not sure I agree with the necessity of a double axle.  Any standard  lbs axle should handle a Catalina .  Obviously a double axle doesnt hurt but I think Ive seen just as many boats on double axles with two wheels blown out from cascade failure as single axles with a flat.  In those cases  will get you  all four tires were worn out.Assuming youre limited by budget Id much rather see two brand new high quality tires then four cheap ones.  Ive lost count of the the number of trailer tires Ive seen that needed replacing but I dont think Ive ever seen a boat trailer with worn out treads. Most cases the tires go from old age not mileage. Ive also helped replace plenty of cracked or broken springs on sailboat trailers.My recommendations would be to have good tires and a spare is wise investment. Always check tire pressure every trip. Make it a habit. Make sure the bearings are in good shape and properly greased. Make sure the trailer tongue is properly weighted. If its welded on know that that is a spot known to crack and give extra scrutiny rarely the weld itself unless done badly but right beside them.  Inspect the springs carefully for any signs of cracks. When in doubt run new wires to any lights solder and shrink wrap all connections and I personally prefer to run a negative wire rather then rely on chassis ground.Most trailers for a Catalina  wont have brakes but if you do know how they work and how to inspect amp maintain them. ,sailing,d32dro9,2,t5_2qiye

Most of the time they just capsize and cant get back without help so check out the rescue facilities where youre renting. However Ive also brought in people with injuries ranging from a bump on the head concussion to missing teeth and even broken limbs. Ive also attended an entrapment and I hope I never have to do that again. Dinghies in strong winds can hurt you or even kill you. Dome people think the best way to learn to swim is jump in at the deep end a figure it out. Im one of those who has seen what happens and had to pick up the pieces.

Last week I took a Ship down from Kemah TX to Freeport through the ICW using both a headsail and a mainsail and we had great winds pretty much everywhere although we did flake the sails towards Freeport as the wind was starting to die out.   Other parts of the ICW down towards Port OConnor do choke off the wind so I can understand why in some areas its faster to go offshore.Most of the reason I did the ICW route the first day was to give some of my Scouts the navigation experience through a narrow channel.      I fully agree though that taking a boat thats needing repair out of the ICW is asking for trouble.

8111511,0,t3_4q9ws6,I had a dog onboard while cruising in the caribbean but had a friend take care of her during my atlantic crossing last year due to not thinking a dog would do great on such a long voyage. Good thing because the trip was brutal. Was planning on flying back to get her but in the end my friend and dog got super attached and I couldnt bare to separate them...Need a dog though so I got a portuguese water dog puppy after the crossing. During the winter we were on land in barcelona and he was scared of the water as I hadnt had a chance to properly introduce him but now that weve started sailing he fucking loves it. Perches on the front of the dinghy jumps in the water hears the engine start sailboat or dinghy and gets excited to go somewhere keeps watch wont let anything come close without a good bark does his business on deck on some fake grass from ikea...This breed is full of energy and needs a good workout everyday but being on a boat doesnt limit him. Theres plenty to do anyways... swim hike walk around amazing places... Sure theres not much we can do on passages but they are short and I think he understands or gets a bit lethargic from the seasickness and doesnt wanna do anything anyways. My style of sailing is a bit more chill though prefer to stay longer in places so its more compatible with a dog. If I were set on going around the world and seeing as much as possible I dont think Id have a dog onboard.As far as paperwork I know that in most of the caribbean youll be fine they wont even care about the dog when youre checking in. Otherwise just some kind of paper that says you have a dog with vaccinations is enough. Ill only been in spain and portugal on this side of the pond so far but dont expect any issues in the med since he has a EU pet passport microchipped etc... As youve come to understand it its just a matter of checking the regulations of each country before going and making sure youre all good and skipping the places that are too strict. Nothing to it. I think the bigger issue is actually making those passages... it can get rough dangerous and boring for the dog and you wont always be able to care for it or give it what it needs.. But if you can figure it out then go for it.,sailing,d4rt27u,1,t5_2qiye

The block was attached to the mast with a snap shackle so when off the wind you would pop it off the mast and move it to an eye on the leeward rail.

8326555,0,t3_4tkkka,There are lots of good ideas on the internet that you can get just by googling something like mast lowering using a gin pole.Techniques that work well enough once a year are a pain when you have to do it every sailing day.  The main thing is to make it easy to free the standing rigging quickly and have a gin pole rig sufficient to carry the mast load.I might use the jib halyard and a snatch block through one of the wenches to raise and lower of the mast.  The gin pole itself could be an adapted spinnaker pole or boat hook with some clip to make it fast to the mast and take the load as well as a padeye at the other end to tye in the baby stays. Id set up the baby stays for the gin pole rig using some small diameter low stretch rope.  Id use a few truckers hitches to get the lengths right to manage the tension. Then after the first few successes I might make the rig more permenent either with cable or eye splices.Youll want to use some kind of easy to remove clevis pin on the standing stays that have to be detached to allow the mast to fall. And it would be nice if both the regular standing rigging and the gin pole rig could both be in place during the mast operation so that you can transfer load without any drama. Good luck.,sailing,d5idhb9,1,t5_2qiye

Could be bias in the fact that no one wants to be out in a storm. The larger marinas Florida more boats seems to attract a higher  of hits by boat. One hypothesis is that the docks are forming land out on the water.  Could also just be bias that said boat owners who dock in large marinas are much more likely to have the right insurance. Followed by at anchor on an all chain rode.  A strike while under sails seems to be very rare Extremely rare in fresh water Again perhaps bias in that far fewer fresh water boats would carry relevant insurance Deaths and injuries also seem extremely rare. Possible bias as relevant information of location may not be recorded  Standing under a tree does seem to be far more dangerous in a lightning storm. Keel stepped mast seem to be more commonly hit Bias as to likely larger boats and therefore taller masts? Possibly hypothesis that it may be better to not be grounding the mast? Most common damage is to electronics then melted aluminium mast head rare then pin prick holes hundreds? all along the water line very rare last exploded carbon fiber mast likely some bias as they wereare rare,sailing,d5no7p6,6,t5_2qiye

8481611,0,t3_4vt28p,I repair sails professionally.  I dont think Ive ever seen damage to a sail as a result of lazy jacks.  Ive also not seen physical damage done by properly flaking a sail although Ive seen quite a bit of wear in the area of luff ropes from hoisting so I dont buy the arguement that removing and rolling your sail every time is best either this does not apply to laminate sails.  I have also seen extensive damage from dutchman systems primarily from sun in the cover cutouts but also from the discs popping off and then the dutchman lines cutting the sail.Your biggest issue with lazy jacks is damage to the sail cover itself.  Sunbrella does not handle chafe.  If you wear holes in the cover and then sunlight gets to the sail thats obviously a problem but thats more of an indirect source of problems.The best lazy jack systems are easily deployable and retractable.  This allows you to guide and capture the sail when dropping it but gets them out of the way for the cover as well as when you are raising the sail.  Systems like the harken jacks are TERRIBLE for this.  I posted a tutorial on DIY lazy jacks in this sub some time ago.  They are inexpensive and easy to use and dont require ability beyond drilling and tapping a few screws as well as being comfortable aloft.,sailing,d61qugy,8,t5_2qiye

Once that is done learning how to sail larger keel boats will be easier.  Another cheaper method is to volunteer to crew there are crew apps and crew email lists etc.  You can find this through google.  When you show up have a small back pack life jacket sunglasses hat and enough food and water for the entire trip.  Protein bars work well if you dont need them you can save them for later.  Be helpful and do what is asked of you and volunteer to do the jobs no one wants to do like spray down the deck and learn how to pump out the holding tank etc.  Where are you located?  ,sailing,d8rstqd,3,t5_2qiye

Surely the drag on the hull of the boat is just as much?Regardless this doesnt compare a Waszp to an entrylevel foilboard but a topend race foil to a moth Check out the video.Or you can look at races like the Ronstan Bridge to Bridge where foilboards crushed boats like a mod  downwind.Theres really nothing faster inshore than a kite foil right now at any price. Maybe an AC.In an event with live tracking like this one you can see that kites are tacking through just about an even  degrees. Sure there are boats that point higher but these guys are tacking through  degrees while doing  knots upwind. Thats  knots VMG upwind.Downwind theyre jibing through like  degrees and doing more like  knots which is about  knots VMG. Yeah these are the top guys in the world but youre going to see the same crowd if you go look at a moth regatta for numbers as well. This is in  knots of wind.Is a moth faster?

9596662,0,t1_d9tug61,Im not clear on the original post but if the solid rivet is through the wood this is a common technique for holding hardware onto wood spars e.g. a wood boom when a bolt or rod with nut on the end would stick out too far or not be smooth enough in the application.  You can sandgrind off the end of the rivet and then pound it out after youve done that yes. There is a method of using solid rod bronze usually and peening the end of that rod over a clench ring these just look like washers that are not constant thickness.  What you end up with is a smooth rivet looking sort of end.  Heres a post I made about  clench rings for some of our bronze drifts Im not sure how helpful this is for you but  you could choose to do it with silicon bronze.  Some hand formed rivets my husband and I have done aboard our boat...some copper ones to reinstall old reinforcing plates onto a new build rudder are here in this post   and heres some little copper ones made up to keep the brake in the brake holder of the windlass are in this post.    It is difficult to find a supplier of clench rings so using an appropriate thickness bronze washer is likely what youll end up doing if you choose to do this with bronze. Again I hope this information is helpful to you or someone else. ,sailing,d9vzghc,1,t5_2qiye

10264155,0,t1_dc6vpww,I did infer from your wording that might be the case but as you say it was not clear. Personally I would probably still favour solar but it depends how much money you want to spend and the size of your batteries how often you use the boat and how much space you have on deck.I dont know how a good mains battery charger compares in price with a solar setup but with the solar setup you also have the advantage of being able to recharge the batteries a bit under sail and at anchor.Cruisers in the Med are able to run their fridge at midday on solar the panels being able to keep up with their consumption throughout the summer. A fridge is the most powerhungry item most cruisers use. From what I have read I think many boats in the   range could be satisfactorily supplied with a moderatesized not overlarge solar setup. Thats larger than you need  Im just giving it as one benchmark Im aware of. Another guy Ive heard of keeps a boat the size of yours I think on the Clyde and he said that solar kept his batteries fully charged for when he arrives to use it of a weekend. I think his solar panel is on the part of the deck that the companionway hatch slides under so not that big and I think he said a weeks charging was adequate even in the winter.The YBW forums are really good for this kind of stuff  read some of these threads The most meaningful answer would depend on your usage the size of your batteries and how much you want to spend.If the boat needs a lot of other expenditure then Id guess a cheap mains smart charger might be more affordable. If youre using the boat regularly in the summer charging phones using laptops and playing music then you might appreciate the solar panels recharging you under sail and at anchor.A consideration is also how the dual starter batteries are connected if there is a splitcharge diode or something between them.,sailing,dc7hxmn,2,t5_2qiye

That makes for a gap  a slot  of a coouple inches.I ran over a floating line which followed the full keel line to the slot where it entered and then ran through to the float which couldnt pass through the slot and jammed right against my prop.  I was with  crew and we hooked the line with a boat hook and tried to tack the boat back towards the direction of the line to get some slack but when the boat slowed in the turn th thing settled and set fast on the bottom anchoring my boat in  foot short period waves with a strong landwards push by the stern.The tension on the line was enormous and while I was able to snag it with a grabbing hook no winch or windlass worked to any effect.Also spent a lot of time messing with along bread knife attached to a boat hook but the rough seas and depth of the line made it impossible to tell if the contact was right and I worked at it until I got seasick from lying on the aft deck leaning over trying to cut the thing.I now have a gizmo I carry aboard I designed in the style of a parachutists hook knife  but larger and droppable on a line like a grapnel with a blade in the hook.,sailing,dcgm7gp,2,t5_2qiye

Ive been using an electric trolling motor for  seasons now with solar charging.I run  deep discharge group  lead acid glass mat batteries in parallel. I have  W panels in parallel on the foredeck charging the batteries through a charge controller in the cabin. When we sail we stow the panels. During the season we sail xweek usually operating the motor for hr each trip. We dont run any other loads lights bilge pump etc.I bought the panels on eBay each panel came with a charge controller. I keep a cheap digital voltmeter to check battery state of charge.The system works very well. Top speed is pretty modest even in flat water with no headwind. We use it mainly to go inout of the harbor and setting anchor on our day sails. Its also handy to reach the dock or chase puffs when were becalmed. Much more dependable and less hassle than a small outboard quiet!.Not sure why youre having problems.

10560615,0,t3_5r4owv,Currently restoring my second old sailboat so I know what your going through. The shallow cracks in your gel coat is called crazing. There are plenty of repair videos on You Tube. As mentioned crazing is very common in old boats and doesnt need repaired except for cosmetic purposes. Depending on how much crazing you have I would skip the kits as they can get expensive. A good plan of attack would be to use a Dremel tool to carve a groove in each and every crack down to the fiber glass and no further. Use fairing sp compound to fill in each groove. Sand smooth when dried. You will have to paint over the repaired area.At the moment Im refinishing my all teak and mahogany. For ease of work In just removed it all sanding it down and refinishing it. Its cold here and I prefer the warmth of my shop. As mentioned you can refinish your teak in place. Be sure to tape off the gelcoat near the teak so as to not damage it as you sand down the wood. If your sanding it down. ,sailing,dd55y6n,1,t5_2qiye

10958123,0,t1_de9roe0,I think the ASA American Sailing Association books give a good framework for learning about sailing. Every book seems to touch on the appropriate level on each element e.g. the boat the sails the engine navigation rules safety etc. The book for  covers those topics at the basic level  same topics on a higher level etc.IIRC they also highlight things that ought to be practiced. I had done a fair bit of sailing before doing the  so much of it was familiar but some things they raised were things Id never thought about or experienced. For example a mandatory part of the  course is practicing Man Overboard and the book describes the technique which is a reminder to practice it.Im sure the sailing associations in New Zealand and UK have similar good books to accompany the sailing courses.Edit I also came to remember that the website  has an overview of books the forum users have recommended.,sailing,dea93i7,1,t5_2qiye

11015876,0,t1_deglrqk,And you are not present if you are not even on board.  Its ridiculous to think a captain could physically supervise a subordinate from an entirely different vessel.  Its equally ridiculous to think a parent can physically supervise a child from a different vessel.  Its all but an oxymoron to the point that its ridiculous were even having this discussion.If the child only needed to be supervised then the term physical would be superfluous. Cornell law will redirect you to the Florida law pages for state statues and only Floridas definition of physical supervision matter when it comes to a Florida statute. ,sailing,degma4a,3,t5_2qiye

11138611,0,t1_deui144,The anchoring thing is about ALL liveaboards. Boaters who like to put certain kinds of liveaboards above others arent listening to the arguments being made by these legislators. Derelict boats are not the problem  laws already exist to combat the that issue and places like west palm Beach have proved its possible to deal with that cheaply with existing legislation. Property owners trying to ban boaters have a problem with anyone anchoring out there. Its about their views and being annoyed at people who dont wear blazers having cheap access to the waterfront they pay so dearly for. Having actually lived aboard in nearly every one of these spots Lauderdale being the only one that actually managed to ban nontransient anchoring it could not be more clear to me that this is a regular old case of scapegoating the poor. Boaters are ALL under attack. We should be drawing together not spouting holierthanthou nonsense. ,sailing,deujtn8,6,t5_2qiye

Thing is I dont think my boat was ever intended to use one of those horseshoe things considering there is a key slot on the bottom of the boom for the vang. I read in a few other random threads that some boom furling systems require at least one wrap to maintain foot tension but that didnt really make sense and that would prevent me from attaching the vang. ,sailing,dfxxtt2,1,t5_2qiye
