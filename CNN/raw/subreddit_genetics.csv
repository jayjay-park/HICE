599628,0,t1_cg8fiwo,ampampamp Lemierres syndrome sfw gtLemierres syndrome or Lemierres disease also known as postanginal shock including sepsis and human necrobacillosis is a form of thrombophlebitis  usually caused by the bacterium Fusobacterium necrophorum and occasionally by other members of the genus Fusobacterium F. nucleatum F. mortiferum and F. varium etc. and usually affects young healthy adults. Lemierres syndrome develops most often after a sore throat caused by some bacterium of the Streptococcus genus has created a peritonsillar abscess a pocket filled with pus and bacteria near the tonsils. Deep in the abscess anaerobic bacteria like Fusobacterium nucleatum can flourish. The bacteria penetrate from the abscess into the neighboring jugular vein in the neck and there they cause an infected clot thrombosis to form from which bacteria are seeded throughout the body by the bloodstream bacteremia. Pieces of the infected clot break off and travel to the lungs as emboli blocking branches of the pulmonary artery bringing deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs. This causes shortness of breath chest pain and severe pneumonia Fusobacteria are a normal part of the oropharyngeal flora.gtInteresting Andr Lemierre | Fusobacterium | Fusobacterium necrophorum | Septic embolism Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcgfjm oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecgfjm.

If you use it as a proxy for chromatin structure then yes it matters because changes in gene expression matter.  If youre using it to mean inducible environmental effects that affect subsequent generations then youre talking about a very very very small minority and in fact many believe that there is no such thing as inducibleandheritable.

1959449,0,t3_2h4em2,Hi! Amendment to your plan Please seriously consider minoring in computer science  when you add a CS minor to a specialized Bio major you are on the way to becoming a bioinformatician in the most pragmatic way. The small pieces that you might miss from a specialized bioinf program are sequence alignment phylogeny microarrays and possibly proteinRNA structure analysis  from the algorithmic perspective. However your practical experience and training in the wet lab from genetics will more than compensate. If you learn your CS well and understand the theory behind it you will be able to later on pick up an intro to bioinf book  intro to genomics book written for CS audience not bio you have bio already  and easily understand what is meant by the running time complexity and jargan like dynamic programming greedy algorithm etc..Pick up your minor no later than within your second year  if your school allows you to try before you buy by having a CS oriented elective  take an intro to programming course not a shitty introduction to MS Office course. Then you can tell how much your brain can adapt to the structured algebras of programming. It will help you think about genetics and biology if you are a good match for this type of thinking.If you decide to go on in academia and get a MS  PhD youll be glad youre not only able to use R like your peers but you can also grab Python or C or Java  and take advantage of all of those analytics tools that have been rapidly building since the s. You can read and understand the code of other researchers and know the conceits and limitations of that code  you can rephrase many of your own research problems into the structured analysis needed for big data. You can not only think in terms of bigger hardware for you analysis but also why an analysis is inefficient or unlikely to yield fruit in its current form and WHY that is. These are things a geneticsonly option will not avail.YMMV but give it a shot because this is where our civilization is going. Employers arent just going to be hiring STEM for genomics  bioinformatics  proteomics  theyll be looking at people that can convert skills and data into knowledge products that a consumer or government can actually use. Our modern techstep is targetting things like protein design personalized medicine and forensics. The demand is there but filling that niche gets tougher since the generalists the allencompassing binf programs have already saturated the lower tiers.Get a head start and hey  it DOES NOT HURT to coldcall and email a potential CEO  CTO in several genetics company and proactively ask Im interested in getting into this field here is my background heres what Ive heard what is your advice? and consolidate a snapshot of the current techstep. The slightly harder part is getting And where are we headed in five to ten years? out of them but giving advice to a highschool graduate is innocuous enough that they may yield some insights.YMMV again but this is the path I took  I was crazy lucky to stumble into a CS minor when I did and I didnt know that this was an option until retrospect.Happy journeys!,genetics,ckpbdnb,12,t5_2qi3y

2492716,0,t1_cmjxjho,Re my epistasis comment.Edwards suggestion was that the correlation between loci might be associated with race. So if you looked locus by locus at correlations with race you would see nothing. Effectively even PCAMDS uses independent SNPs i.e. they are pruned so that there is no linkage disequilibrium between them. Even if they were not pruned I dont think that SNPSNP correlation is explicitly modelled in a PCA. Epistasis is one name for an interaction between loci meaning that is the the joint effect or covariance of two or more loci that influences a trait. Its not a traditional use of the term to apply it to Edwards meaning so maybe I should withdraw it but statistically Epistasis and Edwards multilocus correlation are related concepts.,genetics,cmjxpbk,1,t5_2qi3y

2897433,0,t1_cnx6pvj,I think what people are trying to point out is the difference between emergent properties and properties that evolved. The area you are talking about is so close to the fundamentals physics that what you are pretty much talking about is emergent properties. Consider life we know now numerous number of aspects necessary just so that life can start and exist as we know it just so that evolution can begin. We need magnetic fields water to be in a nice zone around our star a moon helps too in a number of ways. These properties emerge such that when you look for them the conclusion is life should be nearby but no one would say these things evolved such that life could form. They are patterns that emerge out of the system simply do to the vast number of possibilities in the universe and the actions fundamental laws dictate.As such the dominance you are referring to is probably an emergent property which is greater tired to the physical processes than random mutation. So yes you can artificially select for dominance because it is an emergent property once you have created a selective pressure but its not an intrinsic property of enzymes any more so than any other part of the natural world that is these kinds of patterns emergemanifest from a number of objects in the physical world.EDIT Another way to think of emergent properties is to relate it to convergent evolution  by and large most evolution doesnt converge but sometimes evolution picks a similar solution because its a potential well with respect to the physical laws i.e. its the easiestbest solution given the physical world which is why you can artificially create such selective pressures by changing the local environment,genetics,cnxfyn8,2,t5_2qi3y

10875800,0,t1_de1p07x,It depends on the virus used to deliver the therapy. Not all viruses will deliver RNA.I am most familiar with lentiviruses. To produce a lentivirus you need to package the virus in a packaging cell line. You transfect the packaging cells with multiple plasmids one which contains your therapeutic gene aka transgene one for the viral envelope protein and one for the viral capsid integrase and reverse transcriptase proteins. Any cell that picks up all three plasmids will be capable of assembling complete viral particle with the transgene construct within as the viral RNA.  After making virus you can then infect another cell type with the product. In the case of lentivirus the virus enters the cell makes a copy of the viral RNA into DNA with the reverse transcriptase goes to the nucleus then integrates into the host genome. From there the hosts machinery will be able to transcribe and make new RNA to express the therapeutic gene.You can also make nonintegrating lentivirus by instead using a plasmid that makes nonfunctional integrase protein. Instead of integrating in the genome the reversetranscribed DNA remains available in the nucleus to be transcribed but will be lost after cell division.To make a transgene construct you typically want to have an internal promoter expressing the gene of interest. This cassette will sit within native lentiviral elements namely the LTRs and part of the Gag region so that it is recognized during packaging as the element to be packaged. These constructs are often bacterial plasmids which can be easily grown in large quantities.Hope this answers your question!,genetics,de1rf34,1,t5_2qi3y
11309739,0,t3_61enoe,Youre on the right track a lot of diseases youre born with congenital diseases are because you have a mutation in one or more genes. Diseases that are caused by one gene are often very identifiable these days because of the similar symptoms that people have an example of this is huntingtons disease. When a disease is caused by two or more genes acting together this is called a complex disease and can be a bit more complicated to identify however it tends to be each gene contributing a little bit about  each to the overall symptom. Transferring functional genes to people is pretty complicated because DNA is located in a section of the cell called the nucleus and human cells dont have natural machinery to take up DNA molecules like some bacteria can. To this end we use viruses more specifically retroviruses because they put their viral DNA into our nucleus where it stays permanently. To put functional genes into a cell that needs them we take the infectious DNA out of a virus normally from the herpes family or some use a modified HIV virus and put our wanted gene into the virus and let the viral machinery put our gene in for us. However even once this is done there is A no guarantee that the gene would actually turn on and B youve now only got one cell out of potential millions with this gene as the virus cant spread because we have taken the infectious DNA out of it. Current research such as my masters project right now is looking at alternative methods of trafficking genes around the initial cell that got infected so we dont have to use as much virus.
