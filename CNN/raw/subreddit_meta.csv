3613066,0,t1_cq3vmtu,Actually when I think about this idea it seems really better for publicizing and advertising.You could say for example Join the discussion at reddit.commeta instead of reddit.comrmeta. It would look much nicer and if someone who is not familiar with reddit would have to read the link aloud recall the link from hearing or type it in manually the probability of error would be lower.Conversion would probably not be very hard either. Unless its one of predetermined special URLs its a subreddit.The main problem though is what to do if the admins decide to create a new special page and it turns out there is already a subreddit with that name.,meta,cq44659,1,t5_2qh2i

6156539,0,t1_cylhwtk,I made a video about the diss. sorry for the quality. I really do think theres reason to be suspicious. From what I can tell its hard to see who could have rigorously assessed it. I am working on my PhD too so it is kind of unsettling to see these standards at work.,meta,cypfmv2,1,t5_2qh2i
