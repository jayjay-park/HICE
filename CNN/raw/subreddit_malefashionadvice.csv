The low sneakers would be fine for pants and shorts of whatever color but considering theyre  shoes from HampM theyll probably fall apart pretty fast that jacket will be fine if you dont put it through too much abuse.

14215,0,t1_cefr3bo,I guess Im not technically new here but Im just an occasional lurker. Still working out how well this forum suits my needs. Im inclined to defend fitness comments about appearance in principle though I acknowledge they can be tactless in practice. Here are a few arguments Id present My interest in style is more about looking good than about passion for fabrics colors materials cuts etc. Fitness is at least as big a part of looking good as fashion is. The body is the starting point for fashion. If this were a forum for amateur painters and someone asked for comments on their latest work someone critiquing their choice of canvas might be useful.  Fit is rule . Fitness affects fit. Ive been a stable size through most of my adult life but Ive gained about  pounds in the last  months. Its kind of interesting how it affects what looks good on me and what does not. Though Ive been gaining muscle Ive been getting some friendly ribbing lately about the gut that Ive gained. Its kind of useful to me as a reality check  i.e. maybe its time to work on the gut because its getting noticeable. The analogy of unsolicited advice in the gym is not apt. At the gym I do not ask for advice. When someone posts here how does this look they are seeking advice. If they wish to be more specific like how does the color of this shirt look with my skin tone? then thats fine.  Certain looks really do require a limited range of body types to pull off. I look terrible in skinny jeans because of my body type and it probably wouldnt fit my image and personality anyway. Its fine to tell me that if I make the mistake of wearing something so unsuitable. The argument that they may just simply have a different opinion of their ideal figure or have no desire to pursue fitness at all seems weak. If Im happy with my body as is or Im satisfied with my balance of effort vs. improvement then Ill dismiss criticism with no harm done.,malefashionadvice,ceg1woe,9,t5_2r65t
14482,0,t3_1u7ha5,Dress for yourself not for your parents. The type of person you are is not determined by your clothing. But if you like the rugged look it can be done very well. Look for coarse durable materials denim canvas flannel chambray leather. There are lots of stores where you can find such things cheaply but dont compromise on fit if it doesnt flatter your body skip it and find something that fits better. You can find rugged items that draw inspiration from workwear jeans carhartts military field jackets peacoats fatigues camo print lumberjack looks flannels waffleknit thermalshenleys trapper hats biker looks black leather and denim bandannas cowboy looks big belt buckles cowboy boots western shirts gallon hats and even sports baseball caps hunting gear. Maybe take some time to find example images of looks that you like and try to analyze what appeals to you. Also notice when people do that look but look awful  where did they go wrong?Regarding the beard and mustache my advice is not to try to grow it out until its coming in thickly. A wispy teen mustache rarely looks as good as its owner believes. And of course various facial hair patterns look better on some people than others. Layering is good for adding bulk to a slim frame. Try a heavy gauge sweater or hoodie under a jacket?,malefashionadvice,ceg302i,2,t5_2r65t

72547,0,t3_1uxnwp,a few near worthless comments from me just because I really am interested in both these boots no one is going to confuse the chippewas with cowboy boots. thickness of leather is not in any way a determining factor of quality. in fact one could argue that too thick of leather isnt cutting off the parts it should. I think picture  looks great. I compared it to the last few pictures of the chippewas and I think the thorogoods are the better looking boot. I own the chippewas but not the thorogoods. I wonder if the sno seal didnt darken the thorogoods as much because of the cheese treatment. Are thorogoods being a rugged workboot treated with something at the tannery that inhibits it taking in snoseal? Ive seen lots of hate for the bolt shaped eyelets. We should write to chippewa to see about changing that. That aspect I dont mind but it seems to typecast the boots as workwear only. maybe they make more sales that way shrug,malefashionadvice,cemosq0,5,t5_2r65t

Im a fan of deconstructed blazers with stuff like what you were showing but a regular one would work well too.  Most mens brands make something in the blues in terms of sportcoats.  I say look around see what you like on the internet but try not to buy final sale.

110697,0,t3_1vcqwc,I will try to give my advice but if you want to follow through its up to you I personally think you will better with a haircut maybe try making it side swept or get most of it off with a number  all over. You need to pluck your eyebrows they are too dark compared to your facial hair and really stand out.  I personally dont like the belt its just to thick and bulky. If your jeans dont fit you otherwise get a pair which is a bit tighter and if you want go for a leather skinny belt. Honestly your tshirt is fine. Its not stylish but it brings conversation if someone shares the same interest as you. I have a couple myself and even though I know its tacky I keep them as I just like them. I normally put a decent jacket over it and I think I look okay. Just make sure your wardrobe isnt full of graphic tshirts. A nice shirt and jeans combo that fits I cannot stress this enough makes you look a lot better and more your age. You also look like you could rock a decent polo shirt but I dont want to change your entire style. That photo isnt doing you a lot of justice if you were standing up straight it and smiling it would make you look a lot better. Its up to you whether you feel the need to change yourself. It requires a bit of money to change your wardrobe so you need to ask your self if this is a big enough priority to invest in the way you look.,malefashionadvice,cer1amk,1,t5_2r65t

111302,0,t1_cer34io,Its not far off at all I agree with you and I certainly dont think he should ignore that particular article.  Its still incredibly relevant I just think he should read it after first understanding how personal style is achieved.Most people who come in here already have a similar style to the uniform but they just dont know how to wear clothes that fit properly or how to complement accent or colorize properly.  In those cases  that article is a good first read.  Case closed.  They will buy some s tshirts OCBDs blucher mocs and be done with it... but occasionally we get an outlier like the OP or that one guy who also had long hair that wanted to keep his style but dress better... the post was like a year ago so I dont have a link.shrug I dont think theres a solid right answer.

124312,0,t3_1vieum,Peaked lapels are just as appropriate as notch for just about any purpose though they are less minimalist than notch or shawl. Over the last decade or so they have entered back into the suit design vernacular. Depending on the cut of the jacket and overall lapel width the peaks generally tend to widen the upper body and emphasize the shoulders. If you have huge bodybuilder shoulders it is recommended that you stay away from peaks.,malefashionadvice,cesl5qr,2,t5_2r65t

125611,0,t1_cesn4pn,If I may quote at length from the late Paul Fussells Class A Guide through the American Status System gtThe acute student of mens class signals could virtually infer Reagans politics of Midwestern smalltown meanness from his getups just as one might deduce Roosevelts politics of aristocratic magnanimity from such classy accessories as his naval cape pincenez and cigarette holdergtgtIts not just Ronald Reagan who violates all canons of gentlemanly attire.  Its the conspicuous members of his team as well like Al Haig.whose class stigma is the gaping jacket collar always a prole giveaway.  Here the collar of the jacket separates itself from the collar of the shirt and backs off and up an inch or so the effect is that of a man coming apart.What it betrays indeed is less the zealot than the stooge.  Like the poor chap interviewed on TV recently by William F. Buckley.  He was from Texas and wanted to censor school textbooks to repress among other evils promiskitty.And here I will reject the accusations that I am favoring the rich over the poor.  The distinction Im pointing to is not one between the tailored clothes of the fortunate and the store clothes of the others for if you try you can get a perfectly fitting suit off the rack or at least have it altered to fit snugly.,malefashionadvice,cesqhgr,6,t5_2r65t

130428,0,t3_1vk9hh,Probably the best advice would be to make sure your button downs are hemmed properly bottom of the shirt should hit mid back pocket on butt or just slightly above bottom of zipper on front. Also make sure your shirt is slim fitted or not belling out on the side. You dont want it to look like a poncho.Since youre not tucking these shirts in you should never wear a true dress shirt untucked just looks terrible. Stick to OCBDs and other plain color shirts patterns might further accentuate your height  obv youd know better than I do.Youre still never going to look completely put together in certain placessituations if youre constantly wearing untucked shirts so Id say you should put up a few more casual blazers to make you feel more comfortable. Uniqlo has a nice selection of unlined plain blazers for reasonable prices.

I used to have flat feet as a kid but a specialist helped me correct the issue it took a few years of wearing insoles though.If your feet already have a healthy natural arch insoles probably wont do anything.,malefashionadvice,cew3s0v,4,t5_2r65t

His fall collection My Own Private Portland features updated Northwest classics like plaid shirts furlined trapper hats and nubby grungy cardigans. In the spring of  his Lonesome Heroes dudes will be sporting a mishmash of brocades and Navajo patterns...At  Miyashita came to the States and fell in love with Americana.So why are you so quick to deny that claim? gt made an outfit that is good even by your own admission and yet youre criticizing it because I didnt spend enough money basically. Im not sure how you want me to respond. It has nothing to do with how much you spent or what brands youre actually wearing. Im portraying that specificity is hard to accomplish without pieces designed for said specificity. I tried explaining why myself or others used a label to describe it that you didnt agree with. Which at the end of the day your denial of the label makes no sense. It wasnt an attempt to say your fit was bad it was simply an explanation for the alleged misinterpretation. Just because you think your fit shouldnt be labeled doesnt mean it doesnt fall into a category. But honestly I was trying to tell you that you did a good job at achieving what you did without the use of highend brands. It wasnt a passiveaggressive attack.I also have trouble understanding your distaste towards labels as a whole. Labels are just a tongue in cheek tactic to try and define something and they do have a purpose.

231049,0,t1_cf4lyfm,Looks pretty Bay area like. good thing at least to me couple thingsIn . I would also advise getting new shoes for the ones in the first picture. Doesnt have to be anything too fancy but look for something with laces and a front that is neither square toed hopeless or too bulbous kind of like your current ones a little unflattering I think business wear should be more sleek ideally compared to say country  boots which would look natural with a large round toebox I would also recommend buying brown instead of black which is more formal and does not look good with jeans or most any non black pants generally speaking. Black AND brown shoes are nice to have ofc but choosing one brown is definitely the more versitle of the two so thats what I would pick. For . Shirt isnt great in my opinion. Its a little baggy around the waist as you can see. It may be possible to tuck it in tighter by pulling down but its not a great fit. Probably more importantly Im not sure its an ideal business even if bis. casual choice  breast pockets are least formal in menswear first of all  pocket is more formal and no pockets even more so and it is a casual looking fabric as well. This is the kind of shirt that I could see looking good when leisureing outdoors camping hiking just sitting around at a park we but for work wear I would look into cotton shirts Oxford cloth the famous example they should look nice without looking too fancy as long as you dont buy too formal ofc. For the third pic its a bit hard to tell in the photo but is that shirt satiny or silky and smooth? If so I dont think it works great with the knit of your Blazer those type of suit shirts are really made for full suit wear and the more casual and thicker  rougher texture of the jacket while a fine choice to wear doesnt mesh well. I would either wear a less formal rougher material again cotton esp ocbds work here or wear matching suit top and bottom if you want to wear the shirt. My two cents comment if you have any comments or questions cheers. ,malefashionadvice,cf4p2qu,2,t5_2r65t

266000,0,t3_1x3v80,Not the first time Ive made the comment but my WvG overdyed plum. I got it as one of my first expensive clothing purchases. It was far from my most expensive purchase but it was a  shirt instead of my  JCF wardrobe at the time. Even at the sale  price nearly triple what I normally spent on shirts.. Buttonhole on the sleeve came too small to fit the button. No possible way it would. Had to do some DIY tailoring to fix it.. Within  wears and before the nd wash collar button popped off. I luckily found it so I could repair it but wtf? I dont wear or wash my shirts hard very light coldcold and hang dry and my JCGapBRJCF shirts have all held up much better for much longer.. In general the construction Id expect for a shirt of that price wasnt there. Plenty of loose threads and fraying. I can tell theres a difference in materials but Im not looking for casual shirts I have to dry clean because they will fall apart on a super light wash..

A few times a week in the evening because alphahydroxy acids can make you more sun sensitive for a little whole after application I use Paulas Choice AHA pads.

305868,0,t1_cfcgr3q,Im not surprised just disappointed.So later today Im going to post in GD and talk about all this in a friendlier tone but heres the gist of it. SAWCSMs were historically and still are the top of the food chain in every axis of oppression sexism and racism being the most noticeable but also transphobia and classism. Theres no denying this fact.In our country and around the world there is systemic racism and sexism. Societies governments etc. continue oppression against marginalized groups. Whether its explicit voter suppression laws or implicit clutching your belongings a bit closer when a group of black guys approaches its still there and almost everyone is guilty of it.Racismsexismetc. is not the same thing as prejudice. White people and men can experience prejudice but not racism. Racism is essentially prejudice but backed up by the system. Because of this things can fall into the offensive and nonoffensive spheres. Things that continue to marginalize marginalized groups are offensive and things that dont arent. So if I generalize about black people it furthers their marginalization. This is harmful. However generalizing about white people and particularly the most privileged group of all SAWCSMs does not marginalize anyone they are already the top of the food chain.Lets take this one step further it is extremely nonoffensive to say that SAWCSMs are racist and sexist. It is historically true and the vast majority of SAWCSMs are still this way.What do I mean by this? Am I saying that every SAWCSM in this sub is prejudiced? Of course not. However unless they are actively fighting oppression on all axes at every moment and completely dismantling their own privilege then they are indeed benefiting from a racist and sexist system and are racist and sexist. I am racist and sexist I benefit from the system. Almost everyone here does.Its not offensive to call out an oppressing group. You will always get the calls of reverse racism and Hey! Im not racist. Guess what? The worst thing my generalization did was make you uncomfortable. Generalizations against marginalized groups oppress them further stigmatize them and are incredibly harmful. So in closing no SAWCSMs do not have the right to be offended when I single them out and lump them together myself included theyve been doing that to every other group for the last...forever...and continue to do so.,malefashionadvice,cfcgy7m,2,t5_2r65t

Your situation may be different but regardless either program will help build muscle. As for diet its hard it depends what you wanna do to gain weight you have to eat  calories above your TDEE or total daily energy expenditure. which can be calculated at Fitness Frog To lose weight you would eat  calories less than your TDEE sometimes more depending on how much weight you have to lose. As for protein intake the rule of thumb is to eat .g of protein per pound of bodyweight every day. As for gaining protein without eating meat thats a lot tougher fish may be a gray area for you but it is packed with protein nuts are also filled with protein as well as dairy products milk eggs cheese etc. many people will also use protein supplements such as optimum nutrition whey protein powder which can help achieve daily protein goals.

Again another option that Ive liked are the LL Bean Jackman Ranger MocsKeeping with the Nikes Ive had my eye on these for a while and will probably fire on them in a while. Nice clean sneaker heres your alternate option  with a sale!As far as boots go its going to be spring soon so Im not sure how much utility youll get out of those. Usual recommendations here Thorogoods Beckmans Iron Rangers Ks Aldens personal favorite etc. I would recommend a pair of boots as I love wearing them in the winter and I definitely feel they have upped my outfits. But again as its gonna be spring maybe hold off on that for now.In general I feel like I got to where you are  a good set of basics  relatively recently and then started back up from the bottom up  improving on quality and tastes. Probably too much but Im bored and working from home heres what I had shoewise when I felt like I had solid basics and heres what I have now Let me know if you wanna know any specifics. This doesnt include a pair of dress shoes I have.The nice thing about feeling solid with the basics is that I can wait to buy things until theyre on sale so I rarely buy things full price. I expand this to everything else I own  slowly replacing things with higher quality stuff as I come across deals sales etc. For example I recently was able to get a Howlin sweater for cheap  which for me is a great deal and allows me access to nicer things for less.Sorry for the shoe word vomit but hope that all helps! Just my two cents!Edit Im going to add something else  I like to think that I aimed for versatility in my shoes. Each shoe serves its distinct function that allows me to mix and match shoes for different looks and such. Try and keep that in mind  I think having versatile pieces is not only part of smart purchasing but also minimizing how much space your stuff takes up though my mom made fun of me for how many shoes I have when she saw,malefashionadvice,cfdorie,8,t5_2r65t

Im not in the US otherwise Id probably have some model number suggestions for you but Id encourage you to try on quite a few different types.gt I assume you mean the vneck shirts for under the vneck sweaters?Well apart from  yeah it stands out in an unpleasant way to me. Maybe Im just not a fan of that shawl collar  but I think itd look neater when wearing a vneck underneath.The  outfit seems to fit okay to me but yeah the  one is a bit too far off IMO.

While not everyone should be nxt lvl its just so silly that anyone who browses for awhile and gets some basic wardrobe shit going gets comments applauding them for doing easy boring fits.This board needs a lot more diversity so that the people who come here can see what else there is and that the MFA clone fit isnt the endall beall of fashion.

Ill probably borrow some AC fiber from my friend to try it out.,malefashionadvice,cfefr26,1,t5_2r65t
324863,0,t3_1xs1aa,There are some classic pieces that I want. Trench coat dark brown chukkas etc. Because I know what items I want I keep them on a list and actively look for them at a price that Im comfortable paying.For all other items Ill usually see something by browsing a store or looking at a look book that interests me. Ill keep tabs on the item and when it drops down to a price Im comfortable paying Ill go for it.However the biggest test for me is when I try on the item it has to click within the first few minutes of wearing it. Usually this means that it feels like that particular piece of clothing feels like it was made especially for me and that it makes me feel confident. If I dont get that feeling right away I end up returning it. For me theres no point in keeping something that I dont feel comfortable in or think would only work in some scenarios with a particular outfit. I dont compromise at all. Its far more useful for me to returnsell the item to get money back and save that money for something I really want.,malefashionadvice,cfefy0t,2,t5_2r65t

341482,0,t3_1xzn7d,I lived in Japan for a year on an undergrad exchange and in the process got really hooked on a few things at Muji. Their mens clothes have never been extremely appealing to me since they tend to have boxier classic silhouettes appealing to a kind of retro japaneseworkman aesthetic. I tend to be drawn more toward slimfit contoured tailoring personally so clotheswise in Japan I shopped a lot at Uniqlo. Although their reused yarn socks are a big favorite of mine. The fabric holds up well for a long time each pair is entirely unique and the color pallet is great. Household productwise I love their design aesthetic and quality of materials. Timeless but exciting minimalist cube desk lamps soft and well made yet sturdy bed linens beautifully simple kitchenware items. Even the snacks they sell instore are all really tasty.Given that I am somewhat of Japanophile when it comes to industrial design and clothes my opinion is somewhat biased but I really love Muji. ,malefashionadvice,cfg5xdh,3,t5_2r65t

379772,0,t1_cfk4681,No one is saying that this is literally equivalent to rape.  But the objectification of women is actually a very important component of rape culture.  If we as a culture perpetuate the view that people are objects and sex is a thing you acquire that supports rape culture.  There is an explicit statement that comes with an advertisement like this.  Buy our clothes and you will get all the pussy you could dream of.  The only thing holding you back from being assdeep in tang are your shitty clothes.  Attractive men get laid.  A lot.  By beautiful women.  Arent you attractive?  Maybe if you were you would be getting laid.  A lot.  By beautiful women.  This kind of perpetuation puts pressure on men to act in predatory ways.  Think of a fraternity.  If you constantly have men walking around bragging about their conquests putting massive peer pressure on the younger more inexperienced men to imitate that sort of behavior that creates the environment were rape happens.Its the same thing with the media.  If youre constantly seeing ads that promote that same sort of idea it influences you.  Particularly the younger less experienced men.  It creates that impression in your mind that this is the way youre supposed to act.  That this is what attractive successful men look and act like.  Its not as direct or as powerful as peer pressure but is the same idea.  It helps perpetuate a culture where rape occurs.  As an aside I dont think this ad is any worse because the women are naked.   The nakedness is tacky but irrelevant.  And this isnt a problem with Suit Supply specifically its a societal problem.  Double aside  Just because they are European and we are American does not mean that they are enlightened and we are prudish.  European culture and specifically Mediterranean cultures like Southern France Spain and Italy have a massive problem with sexual harassment.  The fact  that we take that shit more seriously than they do is not cause for shame on our part.  ,malefashionadvice,cfk4nb7,20,t5_2r65t

My average mileage was around k miles per year and my Victorinox went through  years and still looks almost new scuffs on the corners only . The key is to get ballistic nylon replaceable wheels and never check it in unless you are forced to. Im a two wheel kind of guy since the s tend to break easier. Also dont go fancy in colors and stick with black or dark colors as it will can get dirty quick. Skip all the super light ones too. Ballistic nylon is heavy and you need something with structure and can take a beating. The  retail range is about where you want to be. Skip samsonite or any of the lower brands or you will be replacing whatever you bought in a few years. My current bag is going on  years now and is still newish looking.

418147,0,t3_1yv8hp,Oh hell yes this is like my favorite thing from LLBean.Ive got the one from the signature line and absolutely love it. It was great during the Polar Vortex thing earlier this winter and I wear it as an overshirt on chilly days or with a lighter jacket if its not absolutely freezing out.Dont worry about keeping it presentable I wash mine cold and hang dry and just wear it from there. Its a really really casual shirt that you can wear really hard and itll look better with age.I like a bit looser fit on it personally but you could go slim if you wanted.Id say its definitely a fallwinter piece because of its weight. I cant wait for fall to roll around again since I got mine in the middle of winter.Depends on how you like the fit and the piece overall. Id wear it like you wear your flannels most likely or open over a wafflethermal cream henley with denim or as an overshirt over most other casual tops.I think its a great shirt although you might want to get the sides taken in slightly since the cuts on the regular line LLBean stuff is more boxy. I fucking love mine.

My solution has been to take a Buf Puf Back Scrub wrap the sponge in a piece of saran wrap twist the excess on the back and tape it down with a small piece of clear packing tape the saran wrap should be taught.

475778,0,t1_cfu6or6,Whats your budget? You can spend anywhere from  to  on fragrance so like clothing this determines a lot. I have tons of recommendations but if youre looking to stay below  youre gonna be disappointed. Definitely go sample some Nordstroms fragrance department is usually tops if you dont get an ultrapushy salesperson.My personal recsCreed GIT Recommended everywhere but its versatile and classic. Cool Water is its cheaper ripoff but I think it smells like PineSol with a disgusting opening note GIT and the Bond No.  equivalent Chez Bond smell much better. GIT has more wood Chez Bond has more of a cleanlaundry musk freshness.Bond No.  Riverside Drive Basil herb and pineapple with some aquatic notes. Refreshing but stays away from the boring citrusaquaticwoodyfresh combo that  of cheaper colognes use. Very herbacious.YSL LHomme Libre  I think most of YSLs wildly popular fragrances are too feminine but this is an original masculine take on a spring fragrance. Similar to Riverside Drive I describe above but sweeter because of the pink pepper and nutmeg in it.Cheaper designers Chanel Allure Homme Sport and Issey Miyake LEau DIssey If you DO want the citrusfresh fragrances these are two of the best in the cheaper designer tier IMO. Last VERY long for citruses most dont last long at all and they combine some nice pepper and spice elements to make them interesting.Jo Malone  they have awesome eau de colognes but they dont last long just as colognes are meant to. Lime Basil amp Mandarin and Oud amp Bergamot are some of my favorites.If you want more recs let me know especially if you have a budget or any preferences re notes.,malefashionadvice,cfuck9m,3,t5_2r65t

482793,0,t1_cfv2ch6,Pant colors usually depend on the rest of your outfit unless youre a denimhead or something. It also depends on your style. Lots of MFAers go really preppy for ss meaning the sepia pants you linked wouldnt work but the navy ones would be much easier to incorporate. Id be wary of classic fit though  usually people here like slim since its more flattering.For the STFs I can imagine outfits that would work with every color in both links. Once again what will work for you depends on your personal aesthetic. I think metal bordeaux olive silver and taupe would work in preppy fits whereas black or black black is basically the epitome of streetwear although not necessarily for ss and usually its  instead of . Theres also lots of places you can get pants that arent Levis Dockers is owned by them if you didnt know. I like J. Crews pants and they have quite a few classic options as well that should work for ss. Other options are Brooks Bros Gap  Banana Republic Nordstrom etc. Just try to avoid getting oz raw denim or anything heavy like that because it will heat you up.

The orange details and the chronograph make it more casual while the traditional design and metal bracelet ground it toward the middle of the road a leather band andor a very clean design would move it toward dressiness.I would say the ideal dress would be the spectrum from dress shirtdress pantsno tie to vneckchinos. It might look silly with the most casual of fits but not if youre dont the brash streetwear thing. It would not work with a suit unless youre going with a brash again GQ photoshoot look.A big factor in the casualness of a watch is its size both objectively and relative to your hand and wrist.

550502,0,t1_cg2syce,These were pretty close to s in sizing though uniqlo sizing usually runs large. I had a weird experience with sizing but I dont know if it was typical of raw denim.Betting on my experience I sized down and I could hardly button them up. I wanted to return them but I accidentally broke a tag thus voiding the return policy. I figured i was stuck with them so I only wore them alone in the house for like a week or so until my thighs didnt look like marshmallows.First time I wore them out they fit like skinnies and from there they loosened into a shape that was more like slim. Now that Ive been wearing them for a few weeks theyre quite comfortable.In short i sized down and though they were very uncomfortable out of the box they currently fit perfectly after investing a whole lot of wear into them. I have little experience with raw denim and i dont know if I would have been happier had I bought one size up.,malefashionadvice,cg2ujvp,2,t5_2r65t

Whereas outfits with more contrast are more casual ranging from businesscasual to everyday wear. So brown shoes and blue or grey suit blazers are much more casual than black suit and black shoes. Personally I believe it is this contrast which is seen as more casual rather than the stark contrast or black suitshoestie and white shirt.Businesscasual as a term is pretty wide in itself nowadays.,malefashionadvice,cg8j14v,1,t5_2r65t

Ive never owned any outlier products but I can speak to their reputation Outlier team members themselves are in this thread too.Outliers clothes are made from literally the best technical durable fabrics they can find at trade shows and mills. They are designed with a mind heavily focused on making beautiful designs functional Will changing this armhole a few millimeters change the functionality without obviously changing the form?Theyre ludicrously high quality and no one to my knowledge has ever posted here about any customer service or QC issues. Outlier members are present on Reddit and I imagine the other major fashion fora and have their own subreddit routlier.Their clothes are sewn inaround NYC and in case you didnt notice from their website theyre really transparent about where the materials come from They listed the thread cloth zipper and buttons sourcing info on their website. Theyre transparent because theyre proud of what they make and test it rigorously. They have nothing to hide.TLDR Outlier makes their clothes in America using the highest quality materials they can find run a transparent business with really good or at least popular QC and customer support.

There is undeniably aggression in the way that sentence or variations of it are often said. Put yourself in someone elses shoes. If you havent had to deal with something firsthand how could you genuinely understand the perspective? If you agree with nothing else then at least you can agree on that fraternity members are easy to hate on because they are a recognizable group. You dont say I hate regular people theres nothing there to work with. Saying I hate fraternity members who are easily recognizable and have a strong negative social stigma attached to them in the eyes of many people is much easier.

660713,0,t1_cgfc9ii,You give off vibes based on how youre dressed just as much as how you act. You salt the food you dont consider the house wine you may offend people. You come in dressed like a casual American they may treat you as such...as someone who doesnt appreciate the intricacies of being in Italy. You come in as someone who is clearly a tourist but who is embracing what makes Italy different who tries to learn phrases who dresses more Italian you get treated as someone out for the experience. That was how it seemed to me at least. You go into a restaurant they think maybe you dont just want to order off the English menu. They send you a waiter who interacts with you helps build a meal for your tastes but that gives you opportunity to sample what makes their particular restaurant unique. The best meal I had while I was there was on a day where we were being treated differently from the tourists in their shorts and sandals where we were prepared chefs choice but fit to our restrictions a couple of the people with me were vegetarian and they were happily accommodating making something fresh just for them. Theyre excited to share their culture with you but they need to see that you want that not just the generic tourist experience.So dressing isnt really about fitting in its about giving off certain vibes of what youre in Italy for. And theres nothing wrong with coming in looking like an American doing the Vatican and the Colosseum etc. etc...I did that a couple days too and it was awesome. But if youre out for more than that your clothes can go a long way towards telling that story. ,malefashionadvice,cgfdfkd,2,t5_2r65t

713601,0,t3_22c964,A few quick impressions. Pants a little too long Collar gap on the suit jacket  probably because the jacket is one size too big  also corroborated by the shoulders looking a bit big. Pull that tie tighter. I assume you actually did that for the event you went to. Sleeve length is good Not a fan of the piping on it but at least its subtle.  Pocket square is decent but you should definitely tuck it in farther and personally I like either unkempt folds or the standard TV fold.  I actually like the vest but I think the navy vest with the black tie I think its black is a bit clashy to me. Ive always been fine with navy suit and black shoes brown shoes are too bright for a navy suit to me and I like the British style of it but with fabrics it will be more obvious. You could easily get more color out of the tie too since you dont have any real color out of the tie or pocket square. It doesnt have to be bright but it doesnt have to feel like grayscale.

729190,0,t3_22hd85,If you actually dress gay without being a gay then maybe theyre offering good advice. I mean OP to be honest youre not even contributing a fit we cant even see whether or not theyre making sense. Like if you dress gay without actually being gay then its perfect advice to not dress gay you know? Being fashionable is one thing but highly dependant on the area you live in being fashionable in a non gay way is really relative. You cant do all the dresses you see in London or Paris if youre not actually living there you know people will perceive you as gay whether you like it or not and age doesnt even matter. I consider myself very fashionable for example and it was a complete shock to visit London for a week. Everyone looked gay to me urban male like your  mother would say. Were they really gay though? I dont know I guess not but they can wear these kinds of things in London without other Londoners perceiving them as gay. They know its fashion theyre not as sensitive as small town kids like me regarding that. Depending where you live and how you actually dress your parents may very well offer you really good advice. Its probably a good idea to post fit at this point. ,malefashionadvice,cgn5v1u,-5,t5_2r65t

Most People in our age look silly with them but if you skim through the topWAYWT threads of the last few months youll always find some great fits that feature boots. Here an inspiration album I found there you can see what kind of clothes go with Red Wings. Another thing is the quality. Nikes and Jordans tend to go to shit after  years and while that can have a certain aesthetic appeal the quality is just not comparable to boots like shown above which will look good for many many years.

For breakfast we met friends at Maxs Diner bagels at Cherry St. more Top Pot and yogurt from the market and we drove out to Ballard to eat at the Walrus And The Carpenter a bigdeal restaurant evidently. Awesome awesome food. Finally grabbed a breakfast sandwich at Dahlias and headed home.Did the usual touristy things went to the Market rode the wheel wandered around downtown. Shopped a bunch but didnt buy much. J. Gilbert was awesome their Alden shell plaintoe boot with commando sole is a great makeup. Ian was cool not much for me though.

863337,0,t3_23z6dj,I am athletic build. I wear suits to work every day. If you buy a slim fit suit in america it is not actually a slim fit suit very few exceptions apply... Very few.. Slim fit is almost the new athletic fit. Give it a try. Its not the same as slim fit jeans.  I have trouble finding jeans that fit my waist but can be pulled up past my thighs and I wear slim fit suits. If he left it as vague as buy a black suit I would look for the following Two buttons on the front  Notch lapel Double vented two slits in the ass area of the jacket flat front especially with your build no cuff unless you had to buy  pleated pants then you must cuff to make the pants fall correctly.  look for athletic or slim cut. Seriously... Everything else is too boxy on a guy who is husky or up.  convertible jacket pockets or pockets with flaps.  Texture!  Black suits SUCK. They show EVERYTHING that ever touche them. Texture will buy you a little forgiveness here. It will also make the fabric look less cheap.  Inexpensive black suits always look cheap. This is a fact. Anyone who tells you otherwise probably just bought a cheap black suit and is trying to convince himself that he looks amazing in his suit.  If a vest is an option go for it. You can dress it up for fancy potentially even black tie events in the future. I have really good much with slim fit DKNY suits.  Build in money for tailoring.

914272,0,t3_24l6ot,I hate to be negative. But well frankly youre screwed.  If you can find a quality reweaver near you they might be able to help you. But this wont be cheap. Look into it I guess. Reweavers prices vary a lot by fabric type and size of the tear. But they are never cheap. Look online for reviews so you dont waste your time.If you want new pants buying the custom route from suitsupply is probably the best option better and less frustrating than having a tailor try to match the fabric for sure. I believe that Suitsupply uses the same piece of cloth for the pants and the jacket for a particular suit so they are not sold separately at all since if they did sell you the pants the jacket would no longer be sellable in their eyes has no exact match ergo they must sell both at once or neither. sucks but that is life.You might just have an expensive blazer on your hands.,malefashionadvice,ch87ivm,13,t5_2r65t

In general the salespeople at stores like Macys and Mens Wearhouse are idiots who will say anything to get the sale.

For example theyre not located an hour away from the city because the retailers are worried about stealing business away from their regular stores. Its because driving an hour or two  makes you more mentally invested in the trip and more likely to buy more to justify it and  tricks you into believing the the sales must be really good.  After all why would I go all this way if I wasnt getting a great deal?  Obviously the logic of that breaks down under even the smallest bit of selfscrutiny.,malefashionadvice,chluk4l,47,t5_2r65t

Throw in a cup or two of vinegar directly onto jeans do not use a separate detergent area. Hang dryI wear dark washed Levis and they still look great.  The vinegar is often used by people to set the dye after the first wash but I have made a habit of using it for each wash.,malefashionadvice,chnu6yt,1,t5_2r65t

I have a problem with the vocal judgments and an important part has been learning to bite my tongue when someone isnt actively looking for advice. But thats because for most people dressing up is really personal and a message is conveyed consciously about themselves in how they dress I would say not caring is still trying to convey something. There is a social component to dressing.So some people read I dont wash my jeans and assume this is I am dirty and Im fine with my filth. The stubbornness is the most annoying part and the assumption that they people washing their jeans only a few times a year dont know what theyre doing even when they are given an explanation.

I think theres value in getting some stuff right now so you start to gain some practical experience.Theres no need to get into creative outfits and experiment with styles until you have an understanding of the basics and at this stage you want to look like youre a college student who knows how to pick the right clothes not a college student who thinks hes an Italian aristocrat or a lumberjack etc. Theres nothing wrong with other styles but they make you stand out and unless youre really confident and know what youre doing you wont stand out in a good way.Go to Kohls or Macys and find some Levis on sale. There are a few different cuts  leaning towards tapered  or slimskinny  is more current but it depends on your leg size. Try them on and find something that fits well and has a look you feel comfortable with.No need for expensive shoes at this point  just get some nice white lowtop sneakers Vans Converse Adidas etc. Again maybe you can score some sales and youll want to try a few on to see how they fit. Either plan on going sockless or pick up some navy blue socks too.Go to Target or Uniqlo if you can or the Gap if necessary and try on some shirts  at first plain white pocket tshirts and light blue oxfordcloth buttondowns are plenty to work with. Consider some linen and madras if its really hot out. Use the fit guide go in the dressing room and figure it out.If you do this now youll be betterdressed than  of the students at your college and youll have some experience in shopping and trying clothes on. Then you can start getting more deeply into the guides here which are really invaluable you can start to look for deals online to expand your selection and you can construct a more personal style.,malefashionadvice,chu4eug,9,t5_2r65t

1115804,0,t1_chv473s,I mean yeah super slim stuff isnt good if youre carrying a lot of extra weight but you still want things to be fitted. The first shirt has extra fabric in the arms and chest mostly. The henley looks a bit big in the shoulders and the sleeves could be a bit higher and tighter. And you dont look at all fat to me but if you are planning on hitting the gym dont worry too much about how these fit theyre good my points are more nitpicky than anything. The shorts for sure though should be slimmed especially at the opening and those are a bit long look for something just above the knee at the longest.I hear you on the shoes. I would give all white jack purcells rod lavers stan smiths and supergas a try if you want to stay in that price range. White sneaks would be very good in both of these fits so if you can find some in your size I say grab them they are very versatile.For the henley its the pattern. Solids are better especially if you are starting out. The shorts are a good color and a navy gray or white solid henley would look great with them. And they are great for layering you can put them under most any coat or jacket.Sure thing man just keep reading and contributing and things will become clear before you know it. For now just stick to the basics your sense of fit looks good which is the most important thing.,malefashionadvice,chv4jxk,1,t5_2r65t

PUAHATE is very well known to be a site full of trash hatred and men who have given up and place the blame on everything and everyone but themselves. They have no relation to any PUA community. It is simply a community of hatred and if Elliot was a member then I had no idea of this so thank you for bringing it to my attention. I do believe that they contribute but do you really believe that he would have shot people and stabbed other men solely due to his hatred for women? Its not a normal thing to do not even for an abnormal person. They both contribute but I dont believe that he would have done this if he had not had a mental disorder and if he had actually been taking his meds. Can you really place the full blame on these communities? They have thousands of members. Why arent the rest of these guys raping and killing such as Elliot? ,malefashionadvice,chveu5r,0,t5_2r65t

1152365,0,t3_27bayq,Well depending on her formality of the dinner you can do a tee shirt and blazer. But its really iffy since there is a chance that some may show up in very casual wear tee shirt and jeans and youll appear over dressed sporting a jacket and tee or button up and jacket. My advice is that you figure out what everyone else is wearing and defines what informal is. On a more general topic I find that sporting a tee shirt and jacket is doable and just depends on the once again formality of the occasion. If I recall someone on MFA is doing a blazer challenge where they attempt to wear a jacket everyday regardless of the event in an attempt to learn how to control the formality of his outfit surrounding the blazer. Dressing down and dressing up for walks on the beach and business dinners. Im not sure if he is constantly posting about his experience but I did find the idea interesting and perhaps helpful in answering your question. ,malefashionadvice,chz97p9,3,t5_2r65t

1345155,0,t1_cikljs8,Youre getting down voted for this comment because the accepted economic theory is that capitalism rewards the the strongest player in a given field. Yes its true the global economy introduces foreign competitors to a local marketplace and arguably provides the consumers with more selection because of the availability of products coming from all over the world. In theory its a great idea but eventually what will and has happened is that you lose the manufacturers that produce products with any individuality. Homogenization is inevitable in such a marketplace. I do not believe globalization is necessarily a good thing in many industries such as fashionclothing mainly because individuality is a cornerstone to style. It also reflects the community it is produced by and for which gets lost when you buy things made in a far away land with very different needswantsgoals. This may be falling on deaf ears but I think its what we all need to consider when we purchase anything.

Theyre  but I believe you can get factory seconds from the sierra trading post for around . However they have a leather sole which I really wouldnt recommend in bad weather.The red wing beckmans are quite a nice option too. They have a lugged rubber sole and are made from very hardwearing leather  so theyll be fine in bad weather. Theyre pretty casual though theyd look weird with anything more than chinos and a button down imo. They are about  at retail and can be had on sale or as seconds for around .If budget is your main concern than you can get chippewa apaches for . Theyre ok boots and sturdy enough. But theyre casual work boots so I dunno if thats what you want.Or if you really like the english styling then brands like grenson and herring make cheaper options. But theyre not as good quality of course.,malefashionadvice,cilnwkq,2,t5_2r65t

I think some colors and patterns have been modernized but fits styles and form are timeless and have been around forever.this is completely wrong and inaccurate. suits fit way differently clothes in general fit way differently. timeless is a joke.gtDenim styles have changed considerably Boot Cut is almost completely unheard of now. Doc Martins were huge in the s so denim that didnt make you look like you had clown feet was really popular.boot cut didnt get popular until the late searly s. in the s people like relaxed fit denim. Doc Martens are still extremely popular today. So are Redwings which are way bulkier than Docs despite that most people on fashion boards still wear skinny jeans.gtA good example of the prime MFA candidate from the s would be Carlton from Fresh Prince. his clothes were modern well fitted stylish and had an added touch of trends from that era. He didnt dress like a grunge or any of these other ridiculous fads people are claiming. He dressed exactly what this sub is about with the added s flair.carlton did not dress modern he simply dressed preppy. he also wore a fair amount of ridiculous things.if you genuinely believe that our current modern style is timeless and that it has barely changed youre very delusional.,malefashionadvice,cj0cgff,11,t5_2r65t

1489262,0,t3_2b8zni,I believe this happens due to the difference in the material of fabric versus the thread. If you wash it the thread might be shrinking more than the fabric so it gets all bunched up like that. This tends to happen with the zipper flap on pants also on pants of poorer construction and materials. Of course thats what Ive been told. This can be prevented by buying things of better construction or perhaps through air drying to prevent shrinkage.I know you didnt ask for fashion opinion but because this is a thread dedicated to advice I suggest not wearing cargo shorts with a pattern.

For shirts As long as his current Ts fit theyll work plain right?.  You could add in an OCBD or two in blue or white for either class wear or for drinksdressier stuff as this seems to fit your not too dressy request.  Uniqlo would be a good option there ish bucks and they have measurements in the fit guide you can compare to clothing he already has that fits.  Some polos as well would be good probably in plain colors.  Uniqlo also a good options gap probably too.  Maybe a PRL sale.  Shoesthe black converse could be worn sockless or with no show socks.  boat shoes could be added also sockless or no show socks.  For something thatll transition better to being worn with socks you could get bluchers  mocs e.g. sebago campsides or campcanoe mocs e.g. ll bean.  Those might work for the sortofbutnotreally dressy stuff with pants or with shorts and a tshirt.  other good sneaker options include jack purcells vans authentics low chucks all are good with shorts if sockless or no show socks.For the dressier pair not sure if you mean full on dress shoes or still something more casual.  Loafers perhaps?  Wingtips?  You could get him measured on the brannock device try on a few pairs fo different brands and set up an ebay alert to find like new or new shoes in his size from allen edmonds or the like.  Id avoid anything that isnt new or like new from ebay as it can be a huge gamble especially on a limited budget.PantsShortsyou could get a pair of lightweight chinos and some chino shorts.  just steer clear of the athletic shorts to class even for a  y.o. it makes you look like you gave up on life so not a good look for a  y.o.edit rearranged paragraphs.,malefashionadvice,cj3n9ta,1,t5_2r65t

Period. Its a pretty slowburn show so give it a few episodes to really get going. If you like Breaking Bad youll love this.Heroes Season  only.

1532673,0,t3_2bsb14,I posted this yesterday but Im posting it again so I can receive a few more opinions. For those of you who dont want to read the wall of text this is the set of clothing Im looking to purchase guide  visualI am currently looking to update my wardrobe. I have a relative idea of the direction Id like to move it in but I want to run it by all of you before I go ahead spend my money. To begin I will explain my current situation. I am  years old and will be attending college soon. My current wardrobe consists of the following  pairs of khaki shorts  pairs of gray shorts a few pairs of levis a great number of tshirts with generic designs and popular logos on them some illfitting and billowy button downs and a number of hoodies which I have grown to despise wearing. My usual outfit is a pair of shorts and one of the many tshirts I continue to cycle through. While I understand that my current wardrobe is probably similar to most incoming college freshman I am unhappy with it. I feel I could improve the fit of my clothes the quality and also add some variance to my current selection. I was planning on purchasing the basic wardrobe described in this post Here is the visual of all the products assembled. I feel like this selection of clothing would add a lot of versatility to my current wardrobe and also give me a place to start and build from. I understand that a number of the sidebar guides advise people to buy  product at a time and slowly incorporate them into what they already wear but I dont really want to do that. I am unhappy with the way that I dress and want change now. However I do acknowledge that I am a novice when it comes to fashion and welcome your advice. Are there things I have not considered? Am I making any mistakes? Please let me know. Thanks for reading!,malefashionadvice,cj8eb0m,3,t5_2r65t

TK Maxx are a bit hit and miss sometimes you can find really nice clothes in there at a great price but other days you wouldnt see anything.

1575030,0,t3_2ca1d9,I really dont recall how much my suits cost but I think its at least double if not triple your budget unfortunately. Over the course of  years Ive ordered about  suits and countless shirts from Ash Samtani in Kowloon on Nathan Road Tsim Sha Tsui area. Theyve been doing business in Hong Kong since  their fabric selection leans toward classic conservativemany Italian labels. Theyre not pushy and they stand by their work. Ive lost weight over the years and have had jackets taken in for no cost possibly because Ive referred friends to them and am a repeat customer. Luke Samtani the owners son travels frequently to major cities so if you have a problem with the suit eventually theyre easy to contact.You CAN get a sub  suit in HK but trust me you dont want it. Ive seen them Ive had friends order them. Things will look good for  wearing but it wont be long before the shortcuts become obvious. Glued panels cheap thread etc.Now the first question is why you want a bespoke suit.  I need one because nothing off the rack fits me well. If your body is fairly average try a department store sale and see if theyll alter for free or low cost. If you have some bulky muscle try Hugo Boss. ,malefashionadvice,cjdpehl,1,t5_2r65t

I bought a few longsleeves and henleys which were rather thin and a few of them got holes after the first or second wash so thats something Im definitely buying elsewhereif I can afford to. Basic tees on the other hand last me quite a while at least in relation to their price. I bought a few in JanuaryFebruary and the first two are starting to lose their form right nowout of  or  I bought back then.

YMMV I guess but I just dont see the point in going with the piece.  Do you need a suit for work or are you just buying in anticipation?

My best suggestion would be to go ahead take the items to a tailor you  find or seek one out based on reviewword of mouth that you know does quality work on your items these individuals usually know exactly what they are doing as they have worked on numerous items for some time now. Most importantly once you find a tailor that does your items justice stick to them they will begin to know what it is you are seeking and it makes it easier for them as well as you to get alterations down pin point so that there is less room for mistake.,malefashionadvice,cjytgcy,1,t5_2r65t

Of course there are always exceptions like needing a suit but for the most part  should get you where you are going. I guess I should note that I keep clothing  separate from a lot of my other categories that some might lump together. For example occasionally I will use my clothing budget to buy stuff for my hikingcamping excursions. But most times I will fund hiking clothes from my hobbies fund. Ive noticed that over the years of budgetingthat when I spend  or less on clothes I end up with a couple months of very high spending to make up for it later in the year. So I try to make sure I am diligent and buying something that I know I need each month. ,malefashionadvice,ck0kctr,1,t5_2r65t

Its worth going to Goodwill because they dont discriminate. If its donated its sold for a low price though some goodwills price individual pieces more than others.As far as what to look for?

They were rugged clothes which were worn as part of country attire which made them more casual in the realm of menswear.Sweatshirts and this is a sweatshirt so that there is no mistaking what were talking about and the like wereare worn as warmup clothing. Saying a sweatshirt can go over an oxford and that an oxford is fine with a suit is saying you can wear a sweatshirt over an ocbd  with a suit  and nothing will be wrong. Both are not acceptable. The sweatshirt inhabits the lowest level of knitwear and as such it is fine to go over tshirts but much more and its extending beyond their boundaries. Past tshirts casual buttonups shetland and lambswool sweaters are the next step up from sweatshirts. Their rough texture of the wool sweater is complimentary with the country feel of the other more casual suiting fabrics and looser weave cotton shirts.A wool sweater even a cotton sweater looking to emulate a wool sweater will look better over a buttonup buttondown whatever than a simple sweatshirt. The formality difference is minute but crucial.,malefashionadvice,ck7tzyj,1,t5_2r65t

1819884,0,t3_2fe781,I have a pair of these pants from Swrve. The main reason I purchased them was how they fit  especially in the quads. These jeans are a little larger in the quads to accommodate those cycling muscles but still form fitting for me. I bike everyday and I have found these jeans to be helpful  I can definitely notice a difference. Sure there are a couple of extra things that seem gimmicky but I find them useful. The knee seam makes a world of difference. These jeans are infinitely more comfortable to ride in than my Levis or Bonobos jeans. Ive never ripped a crotch on any pants from my bike so I cant comment on the usefulness of the gusseted crotch. They are a little waterproof which is perfect for those mornings when the weather is fickle and decides to sprinkle just a few drops on my commute. But when the clouds really open up these wont keep you dry. The fabric feels like it stretches some which I find extremely comfortable. I typically dont wear my jeans super tight so the stretch doesnt bother me. I wear them often and they have held up for about  years. If youre interested you should try on a pair. If you live by a good bike store that sells apparel they will probably have something like this or similar. Or if you live innear a big city there is probably even a store that sells only apparel for this sort of thing. I know there are a few in Seattle Portland and SF.,malefashionadvice,ck8hcc7,3,t5_2r65t

I deal with this by putting two short laces on each shoe one for the bottom four eyelets and one for the top four this allows me to tension the top and bottom separately.

1950222,0,t1_cko738o,No you need to change the size on the Leeds on the Shoe Bank. I just looked and they have them in . Theres a selection at the top. Youll need to get sized both length and width for Allen Edmonds. Each shoe is built on a different shape and there are slightly differences but many people find that they need a different size than casual shoes in their first decentquality shoe. Stop in to a Nordstrom they usually carry AE and can size you. Width is REALLY important. Totally changes how the shoe feels on your foot. Also the shoe you linked is too formal for jeanschinoscasual wear. Notice how the laces are closed in a vshape over the throat? Thats more formal. Its called an oxford or a balmoral. The Leeds I linked you to have a different shape go look and see what I mean. See how the laces are open and there are two flaps of leather that sit on top of the tongue? That is called a derby or a blucher. Heres a graphic that will help you understand the difference. Bluchers are more casual whereas oxfords are more formal. I find that I cant really pull off oxfords with jeanscasual pants whereas bluchers are much easier to wear with jeans and chinos. The Leeds will look much better than the other shoe you linked they are simple classic wellmade and can be resoled if you wear through the leather sole. The Leeds ALSO have a double leather sole which makes the shoe slightly heavier but much more durable. Youll be able to go longer before you wear through the leather sole and need a resole job. ,malefashionadvice,cko7f38,1,t5_2r65t

They make a  cottonnylon stretch one that seems more waterproof and durable and a more lightweight nylon one that seems to be lighter and more summery.A cheaper alternative may be a cotton blazer it wont be wrinklefree but itll be infinitely more durable than a worsted wool blazer and likely cheaper too and pretty casual.

So I took her to where I bought it and we looked around.  She told me they wouldnt have any.  None on the womens side as she said.  We found some similar ones but they were fashion oriented and very flimsy.Apparently womens clothing is very cheap and flimsy.  I found some similar looking wool shirts and flannels on the womens side of the store but they all sucked.  Even the jackets by the same manufacturers look like they wouldnt survive anything but a walk down the street.  Now Im trying to find a Pendleton in XXS to fit her small frame but no dice.

2023271,0,t3_2hx6ox,Listen up guys this isnt a guide unless you understand what youre actually buying. Super quick and dirty breakdownNot all but much of the down in jackets are a byproduct of the food industry. Not all downs are created equal. Typically Goose down is of higher quality than duck down. Quality matters! And what is quality? Usually its the warmthtoweight ratio of the down. There should be a power fill number associated with the garment a good quality jacket will advertise it prominently on the sleeve for instance. Usually ranges from about . A low quality down say  will have a poor warmthtoweight ratio meaning it takes a whole lot of crappy down to keep you warm which makes the jacket also heavier. A  power fill jacket might do just as good a job or better at keeping you warm but will be much much lighter because it uses less down to do the same job and more pleasurable to wear. A high power fill down will also be more compressible for when you need a layer that can pack down small. Be careful  dont leave it compressed any longer than you have to and dont store it compressed. Consider your climate if you live in a place with wet winters consider a quality synthetic option or a pricier waterproof down jacket. If your down gets wet through it is going to turn to mush until you can dry it properly  not always easy. ,malefashionadvice,ckx01es,12,t5_2r65t
2023586,0,t1_ckx18lj,That definitely makes sense.  The Gios can do a little double duty as a casual chino amp a dressier chino. I wear them with a tee sometimes amp wear them with an OCBD tucked in other times. The Rgt have a more strictly casual look.  I dont think you can go wrong with either.  It just boils down to which makes more sense for you.  ,malefashionadvice,ckx1h6w,1,t5_2r65t
2023590,0,t3_2hxk33,Ditch all shirts except for the plain white one. Shirts for suiting should be either white or light blue preferably with minimal patterns acceptable. Other pastel colors can work but absolutely no to saturated dress shirts.The ties are better I think most of them can actually work with a suit. However if youre getting a gray one for interviewsbusiness the gray tie would be too close in color the orangeblue green stripe the dark bluegreen stripe and the orange patterned one seem a bit too casual for that kind of suit. Also you have too many stripedpatterned ties. I think I would go for a nice grenadine tie maybe a navy pindot solid navyblack etc.Gray suit recommendationsSuitsupply not sure if the Napoli comes in gray but they have great quality and inhouse tailoring for the price.J Crew Thomson often recommended here. However I have heard that for the qualityprice ratio there are other suits in the similar price bracket that deliver better.Macys Bar III. Recommended pretty often praised for their slim fit and solid price.Combatant Gentlemen. Newer brand that popped up recently. Quality seems to be great but their suit pants seem to be extremely baggy. This is the cheapest suit I would ever recommend and theres a bit of risk in buying CG quality concerns with earlier suit seem to be mostly addressed but you never know.Also read the suit guide in the sidebar. ,malefashionadvice,ckx1hul,2,t5_2r65t

2111950,0,t3_2j4bk7,Before I start a reminder every single one of us should be spending within our means. Now buy it for life really means Im looking for something of high quality. You are absolutely correct that in some cases buying the higher quality item is not mathematically more practical than buying multiple cheaper alternatives. In some cases it is. It has to be done on a casebycase basis. And now concerning the underlying missing aspect of your argument. People on the BIFL subreddit only consider value. And by value I mean price vs. quality. If that is all you care about then yes you are probably right in many cases the cheaper version is more frugal. On this subreddit there are many more considerations that go into a products price. Fit details feel etc. People who are very particular are willing to pay more to get exactly what they want. Also there are ethical environmental economical considerations that factor into the price of a lot of more expensive items.Is this stuff really worth? is asked all the time around here. And the answer is not a simple one. For some it is for some it isnt. This needs to be in the sidebar if it isnt already.

Chunky clothing up top like jackets or hoodies or thick knitted jumpers would also probably reduce the dichotomous waist to hip ratio. Youre probably over thinking it massively as when we have something we find on ourselves unappealing we seem to think the rest of the world finds it as bad which is definitely not the case. If you work out I spose you could add a lot more corework into your routine focusing on your obliques to make your midriff a bit thicker to again try to make the difference between hipswaist a lot less noticeable.Thats all I can think of right now.,malefashionadvice,clefehg,3,t5_2r65t

2171687,0,t1_clfs1lo,Shampoo strips all the oils away from your scalp.  Your scalp freaks out because its all dry and nasty and starts maxing out its oil production... leading to oily hair.  Shampoo rinse and repeat the vicious cycle.So basically by making sure your scalphair is moisturized your body will in turn produce less oil.  And since your not in that constant wash away the oil  produce replacement oil battle your hair ends up being more consistent.Play around with things and figure out what works for you.  I probably use shampoo about  of the time and conditioner about  of the time.Edit  I just realized I didnt answer your real questions.  When you go conditioner only it actually washes away some of the oils just like shampoo would.  Just not nearly as much.,malefashionadvice,clfvfha,1,t5_2r65t

2208941,0,t3_2kdkqc,I got myself my first suit yesterday a Ludlow tuxedo. Im trying to work through some expected fit issues and one of them is concerning me. The white spreadcollar shirt that I purchased in small fits just about everywhere except for the collar. When buttoned its just slightly too tight and thats not really okay given that this is a choir tux and its important to have unimpeded breathing. My initial thought was just to loosen the collar at the tailor but an email to JCrew has informed me that loosening the collar is not a common tailoring practice and may not even be possible. Is this true? If it is Ill have to size up and slim everything down. But even then Im worried about the shoulders which will definitely not line up with my actual shoulders and that isnt something that can be fixed with tailoring either right? Id greatly appreciate any advice!,malefashionadvice,clklzgn,1,t5_2r65t

2211291,0,t1_clbh1yw,Thanks for the input!I didnt want to reply until I had the chance to actually try on a R. I went today and tried out two R suits and as it turns out the shoulders are STILL about an inch too wide. The chest was snug meaning that if I grow at all I lift so I will I will need to have it let out. But . sounds like it would last for a very long time. I dont expect to grow THAT fast. Everything else fits reasonably well. The sleeves are of proper length perhaps a cm too short which I understand can be fixed and the waist is wider than it needs to be I understand that taking in the waist is also a somewhat simpler tailoring job.The issue of the shoulders still stands but after trying on the R I feel that offtherack suits just wont work for my poor . shoulders. It seems that MtM is the only way for me to get a truly wellfitted suit.Is anything Ive said so far terribly wrong? I think at this point I have to get an estimate on price and tailoring costs of a R suit and compare it to the costs of a MtM suit and figure out which is best for me.,malefashionadvice,clkwq3j,1,t5_2r65t

Yohji and Bierendonck closed down years ago as well sadly. Renaissance well worth a look in.Raf doesnt normally have a store in town but has a wonderful popup shop for his current collection with Sterling Ruby that I think is still open. At Lange Gasthuisstraat . Excellent space.The Ann Demeulemeester shop is a bit further away but in a lovely area right opposite a beautiful museum sadly closed for renovation. The shop itself is amazing. Check out the wasbar if youre there  its a laundrettecumcaf thats pretty chill.Amazing second hand designer shopping to be had on Aalmoezenierstraat and Rosier. Score loads of bargs there.For lesser known designer stuff try RA For cheaper stuff theres COS Morrison Filipa K and all the regular high street stuff on the Meir. If you like streetwear theres Fish and Chips or scandi stuff theres Moose In The City.The Fashion museum and MAS are well worth the visit. Normo and Caffnation highly recommended by my Antwerp friends. Best thing to do though is just wander around get lost and soak up the art shops the streets the cafs the harbour and the vibe there.gt Also is most stuff closed on Sunday?Yeah welcome to Belgium.,malefashionadvice,clpfho6,6,t5_2r65t

2266316,0,t1_clrt92d,Lets both understand that I work at the Department of Computer Science at Stanford so I have the mental faculties requisite to understanding the distinction between minimalism and liking small things.That established we might have enjoyed a constructive conversation. I am sorry that I was unclear or that I somewhere implied that I was a unintelligent doorstop. You seem to have jumped into a long winding paragraph of assumptions about the contents of my iPhone. In fact I am very meticulous about the applications that I allow into my life. I am also meticulous about the kinds of activities that I expend mental energy on so I should be frank about stating that I do not see value in continuing this conversation. If you too value a minimalist approach to the expenditures of human mental energy and take pains not to waste your own valuable time then I strongly recommend that you do not take the time to respond. Your words may provide you a kind of relief but I no longer believe we can share an empathic connection on this particular thread.That said reddit is a long and winding space.

2326947,0,t1_clz5gpm,many factors to consider. Id say most biologists would agree that pheromones factor very little if at all into human sexual attraction. I go to an Ivy League medical school and in our lecture about the olfactory nervebulb pheromone detection was listed as a potential biological function with the aside ...but probably not.. In principle pheromones will attract members of the opposite sex...assuming you actually have superior geneticshealth. Unfortunately that cant be said for most males. So yeah if you are Tom Brady then fucking go for it as you probably smell like a Greek god. But the average redditor probably smells like Kevin from The Office so good luck on that front..

If your shirt is so short doesnt reach midfly Tall or Long.Its not so much about a specific height as it is proportions. If you have a longer torso or arms youll need a specialty size.

If youre altering everything on a suit the costs add up quickly. It seems like you should have bought a smaller suit. Some things cant be altered. The tailor can likley adjust your shoulders a bit for example but any significant alterations will either be incredibly expensive or physically impossible.Also we need a pic  we can tell you whether it can be tailored and salvaged or whether you should just return it.

Underneath is a Banana Republic Slim fit flannelish dress shirt.Bottom half.  Jeans are True Religion Jack style.  Purchased from Winners last year.  Boots are Red Wing Iron Rangers in Amber Harness.  Found at The Bay on clearance.I can take a full shot later if anybody cares to see it.  I was just at work and bored so I decided to share when I saw this thread.  What are you wearing today?Edit Here is the full fit.  Full fit side.

2511943,0,t1_cmmfqas,If youre not going to splash out bigtime for the Alden shell cordovan longwings Id go with the Allen Edmonds. Aldens shoes are wickedly overpriced at the moment based on constrained supply and a superthirsty overseas market esp. Japan. I have several pairs of Aldens in shell cordovan and they are great but I dont think Id have gone with Alden if I were buying nonshell cordovan. While Aldens calfskin they make the longwings in both calf and shell are undoubtedly phenomenal the Allen Edmonds are also excellent and are just a much better value right now. If you buy first quality Allen Edmonds and care for them well youll get more than your moneys worth. Plus I think the Allen Edmonds footbed is more comfortable than the Alden one.

Also this camel colour is what Ive been hoping and praying for!!  Brand new these go for  and even used on ebay I see them around     The jacket was too big so I got it quoted for taking it in around the sides and sleeves.  Quotes were all around  for a good job.  So....I tailored it my damn self!!  Now I have a perfectly fitting custom fit Gloverall!!  Sorry for rambling guys...I just...damn...this has made me so happy.

2605435,0,t1_cmykzsf,Grey is an awful color for a jacket as it doesnt pair with trousers as well as navy or brown. To avoid a navy blazer looking preppy just change the buttons for horn or motherofpearl or even silver metal buttons. Its plenty versatile in any form which is why its so consistently recommended. Structure has nothing to do with whether or not a jacket is a sports coat blazer or suit jacket. All three can be very structured or unstructured. ,malefashionadvice,cmyo1vs,-1,t5_2r65t

2645428,0,t3_2q7bdb,I went from business casual to suit and tie full time about  years ago.  These are my tipsInventory If you are wearing a suit  days a week I would recommend  suits initially navy charcoal and a navy pattern or lighter gray.  Eventually I would work your way up to  suits.  This will allow you to wear a different suit every day and have  or  suits in for cleaning or repair without wearing the same suit  times a week. Shoot for  or so dress shirts you can start with .  My job sucks up a huge amount of my time so if I am lazy and dont bring my dress shirts for laundering for two weeks I still have a full week ready to wear.  The majority of the shirts should be whitelight blue with subtle patterns.  Maybe grab a pinkpurpleyellow one to add something interesting to the mix. Get  pairs of good quality leather soled dress shoes with close match belts.  This will allow you to let your shoes rest for  hours in shoe trees even if a pair is in for repair.  I would recommend a cap toe wingtips and loafers for variety. Pick up a handful of ties and then buy a new one every now and again to change things up.  Care As soon as you get home immediately remove and hang your suit. Buy a suit brush and lightly brush down the jacket and pants to remove surface dust.  Lightly steam the suit if necessary to remove deep set wrinkles and light odors. Always put shoe trees in your dress shoes at night.  Let the shoes rest for  hours at least before wearing them again. Do not dry clean your suits unless they smell or are visibly stained.  Same goes for ties.  I dry clean my suits about  times a year and they get worn once every  weeks. Get dress shirts professionally laundered after each wearing with lowno starch.  Starch sucks and so does washingironing your own shirts. Purchase a jacket hanger and bring it to work with you.  When you are sitting down at your desk take your suit jacket off put it on the hanger and leave it there unless you are going to meetings or walking around.  This will prevent wear wrinkles and perspiration.If you have any additional questions just let me know.,malefashionadvice,cn3w1l5,1,t5_2r65t

Weightlifting is great because it will broaden your chest and shoulders and make your stomach look smaller by comparison but cardio in my experience just burns away the pounds like nothing elseB I havent seen anyone say this yet but theres a big guy inspiration album floating around  its a great place for looksC For now you may want to go for more layers as best as you can manage in CA without going for slim fit. Big dudes actually look better with more layersD In terms of buying clothes buy shirts before pants.

But from an operational standpoint when interacting inside the social contract there is an objective right and wrong. Its ok to assume that someone who is participating in society accepts the social contract. Likewise it is appropriate in a sub about fashion to assume that people dont want to dress like goobers.  Therefore there are rules to fashion. I know its chic to act like everything is subjective but from within the perspective of a consensus objective its really not. ,malefashionadvice,cn94yfb,-1,t5_2r65t

2730634,0,t3_2rb7ik,Im trying to build up a wardrobe that isnt just baggy jeans and tshirts and Im running into a problem I cant find any clothing that fits me the way it is supposed to fit according to the sidebar guide. The problem is the same with both shirts and pants. If it fits my chestbuttthighs then it is baggy at my waist. I went ahead and took some pictures and measurements because Im not good at describing my body.  This is one of my better fitting work shirts. I know that I could have ironed it or tucked it in more before taking the picture but it usually ends up looking this way around the midsection by lunch time anyway. Here is a side view its even harder keeping it tucked in the back. For reference the shirt is a Calvin Klein medium slim fit. I tried to try on the small size one at the store and I couldnt get it to button around my chest. Also the belt is not tight at all I could tighten it down two notches but then things look even sillier and it doesnt help with the shirt untucking itself. These next two are slightly NSFW underwear pics so click at your own risk. Frontchest legthigh area. The light in my bathroom combined with my phone does not lead to a flattering picture but I promise that I do not look quite so doughy in real life.  Im  years old   lbs  around my chest  waist and  around my butt. Is there a brand of pants that wont look baggy or skin tight on mountain climber legscalves? Is there a brand of buttonup shirts that will work better on my frame? If I cant buy something off the rack that will fit what do I need to look for when buying something to take to a tailor?,malefashionadvice,cnegmji,5,t5_2r65t

2746738,0,t1_cngajf1,For users new to MFA Welcome! What is WAYWT?  WAYWT stands for What Are You Wearing Today an autoposted recurring thread where users in MFA post their outfits. This album is a collection of fits the community has liked. Theres a script written by the awesome uthomaspaine that collects the images that have exceeded  upvotes and it all gets compiled into this thread. You can find the code on glithub here. Threads from earlier months.Those shoes on the dude in picture X are dope what are they? To quickly find out what an item of clothing is check the full listing of links to the individual posts below and usually the post will list the items worn andor you can PM wearer and ask them to tell you what they are wearing.Why so few larger dudes in this album?  MFAs a place that helps users regardless of their body type which is why some of our users have put together an album of heavier guys looking good and a guide to dressing well. As to the lack of heavier guys in the album its a fair question. MFAs not purposefully excluding them for sure.Why are there more blurred faces on here than rgonewild? Users choose to blur their face for many reasons.  Anonymity is one of the main reasons.  Weve already had one known case where a users face was taken and used to hit on underaged girls on another site.  Another reason is to put the focus on the clothes and not what the person looks like.  We suggest to most users to block out their face for those reasons but its up to the individual user.  Honest question  are most of you gay?  It may be an honest question and youre not the first to wonder but as uSyeknom outlines in this comment which was quickly posted to rbestof its a poor question that rests on some shallow assumptions about gender and sexuality.  If youre really curious according to the  community census about  of MFA subscribers identify themselves as something other than heterosexual.Side note to MFA regulars Read urjbmans comment from way back.  ampampampgtguys can we please not have any negative rall comments? People are genuinely curious and ragging on them is not the way to make a good impression. Granted there might be a few people actually negative but its easier to just assume everyone is curious. Upvoting this was an effort to show off the diversity of the community  lets also make it clear how welcoming we can be to folks just getting started.Also want to see all the top posts at once without waiting for this to post every month? unc our fearless dressed.so creator made this page which compiles all the top posts at any given time.,malefashionadvice,cngajo9,41,t5_2r65t

2789543,0,t3_2ryorm,Hey OP I work as an assistant buyer at a womens fashion retail chain targeted mostly towards Jrs. I didnt go to any fashion schools but I know some of my coworkers did. I got my degree in business marketing. I got my job because my mom is the VP of merchandise. So I was very fortunate. Its not too hard to get into the industry but unless you have the connections you are definitely having to work from bottom up because experience really out plays any education. My days usually consist of a lot of size and color analysis since I work in the basics department. So I use a lot of excel and you need to be good with math. This was supposed to be my stepping stone to a mens company and after my year of being here I just got hit up on LinkedIn by a mens retail chain so Im pretty excited. Let me know if you have any specific questions that I could help you with. If youre in the orange county area I can definitely help you out with an internship. ,malefashionadvice,cnl5tcd,3,t5_2r65t

2793882,0,t1_cnlmee8,No I had to work it out myself but here is what I didAll told I used about a gallon of bleach. I got some dishwashing gloves and used an industrial sink that we had. I filled the sink with enough water so it was over the jeans warm water but not hot. The hardest part about the whole process is that the jeans want to float to the top so you are constantly either holding them down or I have seen some people use rocks to keep the jeans submerged but I was worried about those areas not getting coated with the bleach. Once the jeans are wet and you have everything ready I poured about  of the gallon in and would flip the jeans about every five minutes or so and keep them moving to get even coverage. About every  minutes I would empty the sink after it had gotten murky but I imagine this wasnt necessary. Then repeated it and let them soak until the color was where I wanted it. It probably took  cycles of putting them in the waser by themselves afterwards to get rid of the smell of bleach and it shrunk them a bit so keep that in mind.,malefashionadvice,cnlnjv3,2,t5_2r65t

2814067,0,t1_cnnxbk5,The idea isnt to put the company out of business. The idea is to motivate them to to better the conditions of their factories and the treatment of their workers. Your perspective is just a little too simple. In a lot of ways youre right and its a nowin game. If the company isnt making as much money theyre going to have less of an ability to better the very things the consumer has a problem with. On the other hand if they keep making money its financial reinforcement that what theyre doing is okay. In the long term the best thing is probably for the perpetrating retailers to lose business thereby reducing the amount of goods produced in China or Malaysia or Bangladesh and forcing those countries to get the message tighten and enforce their legal restrictions and better the factories. It certainly doesnt solve the problem in the short term and in a lot of ways it makes it worse for the individual employees but theres not a great answer. ,malefashionadvice,cnny9t1,3,t5_2r65t

Quartz movements battery operated  while reliable are pretty uninteresting cheap and dont take the workmanship of an automatic or handwind movement. Next you want to pay attention to the crystal. Mineral glass is the cheapest option and will likely break  quartz will scratch but can be buffed out easily and is commonly used and sapphire is the top tier in terms of hardness and wont scratch but could possibly crack if banged on the edge hard enough. Lastly  a major component is heritage.

People dont just look at your crotch all day searching for some fold or bulge. Secondly I think this may be something that changes with the quality of denimpants. I only have one pair of zippered flys NampF oz and it doesnt happen with them but that isnt really a good comparison. Someone else can probably chime in on that. It may just be that your zipper needs to break in and loosen up a tad.Thirdly I believe button flys flies? do eradicate this problem. The fabric in between the buttons allows for more flexibility. I dont have this problem with any of my button fly jeans either. But again that might be a quality thing. ,malefashionadvice,cnu3pxg,8,t5_2r65t

2873333,0,t1_cnuo713,Beeswax is natural but paraffin is a petroleum product and therefore not natural in the way most people use the word. I could have gone with soy wax or used a different type of recipe altogether so that all the ingredients would be natural such as one with boiled linseed oil or turpentine made from pine resin but I also wanted it to be simple. I may try a more complex recipe in the future on something else just to see what the results would be like.But mainly I went this route because of the success I saw when other people tried it out on jackets bags etc. and also because its less expensive. I used about oz of wax to do my jacket with oz left over for touchups or to wax my girlfriends canvas sneakers and still have the materials to make another  oz batches.

Depending on if your trip was Pacific to Atlantic or the other way it could be right or left. Still something in my small community is status amongst those paying attention. Today it isnt an easy task by any means but  years ago it was only attempted by very accomplished sailors and many still perished.   So moral is that if you see a grizzled old man rocking one or more hoops in his ear ask him when he rounded and sit back to hear some great stories. ,malefashionadvice,coahv1k,6,t5_2r65t

Injection molds for custom soles are thousands of dollars each and you need one for each size.Stitched construction is not some labor intensive highend process. Its just stitching a cup sole to the shoe as opposed to gluing it. Most  cupsole skate shoes have stitched construction.What you get for your dramatically bigger budget is nicer leather and design which is a luxury given the relatively short lifespan of rubber soled shoes.,malefashionadvice,cob5tgq,4,t5_2r65t

3097870,0,t3_2vmp56,In terms of formality generally the more simple the item is the more formal. So a wholecut shoe is super formal while a busy decorative design is more complex so it is considered more casual.Basically formality in mens fashion is based on self expression. The most formal dress codes restrict you to having almost no personaly expression that is everything is wearing basically the same thing with no details that seperate you. Wingtips are kind of meant to be flashy and draw attention basically to express your personal style which is a no no is terms of formality.However this not really always true. A lot of other factors more important than the upper design is taken into account when judging the formality of the shoe.,malefashionadvice,coj3d4y,1,t5_2r65t

3177126,0,t3_2v88m5,Im in the same boat here.Just bought a pair the other day and the spacing at the top of the boot just doesnt feel right. When I walk theres no real weight or anything carried or supported by the top of the boot all of my motion is focused  speed hooks down the boot. I can fit  fingers in the empty space when Im standing up straight. When I try to walk down the steps the boots have a hard time flexing against the laces since my leg is already so far forward in the boot.   Im debating returning them because of this. Its just odd and not what I remember my Beckman  s feeling like before I had to return them.  The rubber sole on my Beckman kept splitting away from the wooden layers for some reason.Also to me the straight back of the boot just seems too straight. Which is what I really think causes this excess space.  My irish setter boots on the bottom for comparison. Sound about right OP?Cheers,malefashionadvice,corb3f0,1,t5_2r65t

When if you really cared about people you would pay them a living wage adjusted to their cost of living that is fair and offer them the benefits and safe working conditions that are standardized for people at home. The companies are in it to increase their profit margins not because they care about the labourers abroad. Furthermore our government should be putting pressure on governments to create andor enforce laws that protect workers rights before we allow trade with them.

3275619,0,t3_2xnbxd,I think that its great that youre embracing individuality in the way you dress. Good for you!However high school students dont always have the maturity to accept people who are different whether if its due to the way they act the things theyre interested in or even the way they dress themselves. Unfortunately a common theme is fitting in by excluding others but I think that might just be reality.As I said before its great that you can think for yourself and later you will find people who will both admire and accept that but if you feel that the way you dress right now makes you a target for isolation then you may want to ask yourself Does that bother me?Dont sweat it if it does because thats completely normal  we all want to fit in. If this is the case you might want to look into changing your style. Id never truly suggest doing a  and completely changing your preferences just to fit in but try to be creative! Think of ways how you can keep your style true to yourself while perhaps toning it down a little. Maybe you can pair a few of your more casual shirts with nicer dark denim to have a more approachable look while still dressing smart. Or maybe you have another jacket you like that doesnt stand out as much. Just because youre dressing down a bit doesnt mean youre any less tasteful!High schoolers can be really mean when it comes to sticking out and its definitely a big blow on your confidence if you think people are judging you behind your back but people will change and mature with time the ones who dont arent really worth caring about!I can imagine that its tough but hang in there! Things are gonna get better but in the meantime try to think about ways you can change your dress without really changing you if you know what I mean.Sorry that this isnt fashion advice  if you want that post some pictures of what you normally wear!,malefashionadvice,cp1nb63,6,t5_2r65t

I like how you answered this question and can attest its a tricky supply chain youre buying into so Im unsurprised there are problems and its nice to see the steps you are taking to solve for it too there definitely is no end to the optimisation or challenges it can throw up!My question is if your stock suits have a fixed price and do not change does this not mean you should be able to buy a reasonable base quantity up front to alleviate this supply chain issue? That way you can hold a basic stock level designed to sustain average sales and then buy in additional flows for periods with surges such as ahead of the summer weddings and ahead of Christmas parties.I know first hand how hard this is I worked on products with a  month lead time and a hell of sensitivity to trend lol. As my CEO used to say you cant sell apples from an empty cart anyone in the industry has just figured out where I used to work based off that quote and always advocated the concept of overbuying slightly rather than having nothing to sell.

Ancient Asia thought tiny feet were beautiful the Greeks loved perfect proportional symmetry in the s and s the most beautiful women were curvy. If beauty was anything more than a societal construct than it wouldnt change so much between cultures. When you realize something is only beautiful because a majority of people say so adjectives like beautiful and ugly lose all meaning. Therefore things no longer are thought of as beautiful or ugly they just are what they are clunky or sleek fitted or loose nothing is good or bad it all comes down to taste.

But to answer ur question I think with more mainline stores like j crew doing collabs new balancevansNike etc regular dudes if you will have gotten easier access to comfy shoes and have had an even easier time incorporating them into fashion. things are also just getting progressively more casual not to say the suit is dead and formality is dying but in the age of do whatever you want because you can some people simply dont have time or reason to invest in nice shoes for daily wear. take a guy like Mark Zuckerburg for example he owns one of the biggest companies in the entire world and traditionally speaking he would be dressed really formally nice shoes suit etc every day... But he doesnt have to be because he can wear jeans and a hoodie and sneakers and do his job the exact same way.

3461424,0,t3_2zw3di,Youve come to the right place! From guides inspiration albums reviews outfit feedback answering questions weve got them all.Leather just needs a wipe down with a wet cloth and a cleaning with a horsehair brush. If the leather is very dry you could use a tiny bit of conditioner. Just put some on leave for a few minutes for the leather to take it in then wipe off. A common recommendation is Lexol which you can find on Amazon just make sure you buy the correct one Amazons sells Lexol conditioner and a cleaner. Cleaners get rid of dirt and grime in the leather but as a consequence dries it out which may lead to cracking.For canvas you can put some soap in warm water and clean the canvas with a toothbrush. Or if the canvas is particularly dirty a small amount of oxiclean. Clean leave to dry then repeat if necessary.,malefashionadvice,cpmtsvd,3,t5_2r65t

3591874,0,t3_31h85c,Thats a really terrible suit and youd be much better served by a number of others. Id really really encourage you to spend the extra  to get a J Crew Factory Thompson suit as its something you can actually wear in professional contexts is wool and will last for longer than  wears. Frankly youre burning  on that zara suit its garbage. You dont need to spend  on a suit supply suit.If you want to go that cheap apparently combatant gent makes a decent suit at around the same price point their slims are wool and Ive heard good things from friends. Theyre currently out of most sizes of the basics but are supposed to be restocking in the next couple of weeks. Go with their navy slim gray is also acceptable in professional and casual settings. I think black looks kind of out of place outside of a funeral but thats an opinion plenty of guys wear black suits to work daily.As far as shoes go your best bet is getting some used allen edmonds off of ebay easily had for under  and shoe trees I wish someone had told me how important spending  on cedar trees was itll keep them in much better shape. Florsheim also makes some decent dress shoes for around  if you dont want to buy used.,malefashionadvice,cq1p8zi,8,t5_2r65t

3665468,0,t1_cqa2mvg,gtim just amazed at what people will wear to stand outIts a little more than standing out. Im from Michigan which is the farthest thing from a fashion capital. Ive had a total of zero people recognize anything Ive ever worn. I have no interest in what they think of what Im wearing and I have no interest in what theyre wearing. I just like what I like and wear it. gt I mean to me its same as  year old dyeing their hair red and wearing edgy clothing the only difference is  the kid will probably outgrown it.And I say this as someone who really thinks most hair dyes look very bad on people. There is more to gtlike rick owens sneakers that look like transformers dressing like ninjas etc.than just the odd looks. There is another level of construction in many designers with things that just cant be replicated by cheaper materialsworkers. A unique fabric or leather that stands out is much more interesting than being like Hey man your Uniqlo oxford is really nice! I own two for reference The smaller details of buttons closures and stitching run deeper than just being edgy. Your hot topic tripp pants arent anywhere near the same level. There are hundreds of posts about the same topic. Google it sometime youll either enjoy it or hate it and continue to feel superior. Plus pretty much everything you like comes from the result of standing out and being edgy.,malefashionadvice,cqa36l1,3,t5_2r65t

As thorough as you are in filling out their website the fit will never be perfect. I had to get some of the items tailored which kind of defeats the purpose because youre spending more money and leaving the house anyway. Plus places like this often try some unconventional styles  sometimes you might score a gem but more often than not you end up with clothes that arent your look at all. At the end of the day buying clothes in store just makes more sense.

The shirts that have ripped thus far are JCPenny and Costco brand so hopefully the Banana shirts last. I only purchased four of them all the same type in different colors but if they become a problem or suffer the same issue as the others I will definitely be taking it up with their customer service line. Keeping all the receipts this time around!

3756886,0,t3_33dm04,I think people just should stop getting MTM not bespoke!! HK doesnt really actually do bespoke... well not at  of the places unless they are spending over  .k per suit.  of the time for most people your RTW is going to offer way better value for money and generally most people arent truly that weirdly shaped nor do they truly value great fit. Nor would they really even notice. Worse of all they dont have a good idea of what features styles etc. go together and what doesnt. The suits end up being a hodgepodge of different design elements and sizing decisions that just dont look perfect. And it doesnt usually even fit well. Too tight etc.Now  if you know enough about suits to really have enough knowledge base to go into a MTM shop and get good quality  HK is OK. Its good for a certain style of suit. Good quality is not cheap there. Yeah its cheaper then europe but that isnt really saying all that much. Most of the cheaper price points are actually all made in shenzhen across the border by multiple people. If you insist on one cutter and handmake work itll cost over k .k. And you should insist on that if youre going to invest in multiple fittings over weeks cost of flights to HK etc.Obv at that price point you should also consider US based MTM programs that offer in person first and second fittings as well as offerings at the higher price point in Seoul and Japan. This is coming from someone who bought  suits in BKK then a bunch of suits and jackets from the same maker in HK over  years now once a year every year and then just this year a jacket from a tailor in JP and one in Seoul.Overall I wear my HK jackets quite a bit but IMHO they have a certain style that screams HK  british influenced but not exactly saville row inspired. Well for someone who has an eye for this kind of stuff I guess. Im pleased with the price  performance  quality price point and at this point Ive worked with the tailor enough to get almost exactly what I want by first fitting so I continue to use him every year for one or two commissions whether jackets or pants ec.But I prefer both JP and SKs softer shoulders and house style for my causaler wear and I think I will start shifting over my spend to those guys although they are significantly? more expensive.But  the guy who said shirts? yes. All the yes. I get all my shirts that dont have interesting patterns from shirt makers in HK best priceperformancequality point ever. Love it.,malefashionadvice,cqkigud,4,t5_2r65t

3953934,0,t1_cr6tmkc,OK so a while ago I went to the doctor because I was having lower back pain.  He had me take my shoes off and when I did he actually started laughing.  Said my feet look like pancakes with toes on the end.  He recommended I go to the Good Feet Store Once there a salesperson did some smoke and mirrors thing where she had me stand without shoes and lock my hands together in front of my waist.  She then put all her weight on my hands and I tipped over.  Then she had me put the insoles under my feet but without shoes on.  She did the same thing and I magically could support her weight.  Im a sceptic so I didnt really believe it could make such a big difference.  But I wanted to listen to my doc so I bought the inserts.  I cant say what version these are but they are very hard plastic and have little to no give.  I dont see the same ones on their site but it looks like they are the Maintainer Arch Supports   I used to valet park so I was on my feet  hours a week.  They immediately made a difference.  Not only did my back pain get better but I was able to stand on my feet for hours on end while guys  years younger than me were constantly having to sit or lean on a wall after a while...

3958624,0,t3_35rhaa,For  a couple of things i can think of A good casual cotton blazer for anything. Youre officially an adult and you never know when a blazer occasion might arise or maybe you might want to stand out from the frat bros at the bars. Never know. Right now im in the market for the Trashness cotton blazer. Its cotton unlined unstructured patch pockets and peak lapeled. Its everything ive ever wanted and more. Raw denim. IMHO APC has gotten ridiculously overpriced. A couple of years ago it was a great starter denim for around ish iirc. Youre better off going with a different pair from a different brand . A couple of brands sixteen Momotaro on sale NampF is alright imo Ive owned a pair of sams xx so pretty much anything after that is kinda meh to me lol etc. If you live somewhere cold you can never go wrong with a good coat. I plan to take my dock peacoat with me to the grave so...Or even a barbour jacket on sale.  Stocks. If you know what youre doing you can turn that  into something more someday.  Stock up on basics tees socks boxers etc. Can never have enough of those. Nike Romaleo IIs or Adipowers. Best. Investment. Ive ever. Made. Period. If youre a bodybuilderpowerlifterweightlifter i cannot express how great these shoes are. If you already know how to squat correctly read ass to grass this will only take you to the next level. If you have mobility issues the raised heel is great. If not for me being able to squat from a stable surface is such a big help. Hope this kind of helps you out.

4052117,0,t3_36wxvu,What others have said about the elbows on the desk thing but also dont dry them in a dryer. Hang dry them. The dryer basically chews away at your cloths and weakens them. All that lint in the lint trap is just scrapings from your clothes as they slowly wear down.,malefashionadvice,cri68fa,1,t5_2r65t
4052611,0,t3_36ybyx,Okay I dunno how intensive your hiking is going to be but if its anything serious then I would recommend against that Icebreaker shirt as well as everything else suggested in this thread so far. Linen is breathable sure but I cant think of any outdoor clothing companies that use it.For a shirt if you want a button down look at Rail Riders. Their stuff is made specifically for hot weather hiking. If RR is too expensive Columbia and other companies make fishing shirts that are similar but less costly.Personally I would go with a knit long sleeve crew over a woven button down. I just find them more comfortable. I know you say not tight but you want it to touch as much skin as possible in order to wick sweat so it has to be pretty form fitting. Lightweight Polartec Power Dry is a great fabric for this sort of thing. Itll keep you comfortable. Patagonia uses it in their Capilene  line.Also I dont know why you want black clothing but thats a terrible idea and you shouldnt do it. Youll overheat much more easily in the sun. Stick with lighter colors.For pants any quick drying nylon pant should be fine. Columbia makes inexpensive ones.Lots of options for underwear. Uniqlo actually makes pretty good Tencel boxer briefs or so Ive heard. Exofficio makes good boxers.Socks go with lightweight merino wool. Brand doesnt matter too much.Youll probably also want a hat and sunglasses but Im assuming you already have them.,malefashionadvice,cri898w,1,t5_2r65t

The quilted style may be a bit too warm depending where you live but the wool and cotton styles you could get away with as a layering piece in the winter under a bigger jacket or even through the summer heat over a t shirt polo button down etc.I personally wear two different cotton blazers almost every day to work very casual business casual setting and theyre incredibly versatile and look great in so many setting outside of work.

4159364,0,t3_385x98,I would suggest adding color variety to your shirts within your comfort tones. For example I personally enjoy brighter shirts like the lavender peach light green etc.For shoes I found a few I would recommend.. Stacy Adams has very reasonably priced dress shoes with styles I enjoy. I really like the straps instead of just slip on shoes.. Massimo Matteo has one with a lighter brown which I personally like more than the darker browns since they are easy to wear with a wider variety of shirt colors.. Aldo has some laced brown dress shoes with a darker brown tint around the stitching if you were looking for laced shoes.. Massimo Matteo also has some nice black wingtips if you want a more conservative look.Now for socks there is a lot you can do. I am all about dress socks but you have to be sure you arent doing too much. I like to match my socks with my tie or shirt for colors and go for the designs that arent too over the top.. These Argyle socks are fun but not too busy for a minimalist look.. These socks are dark enough to not allow the pattern to draw too much attention.Those are my suggestions.,malefashionadvice,crudmez,2,t5_2r65t

The two rules I live by that make this hobby possible are . fuck brand names. If its what Im looking for I buy it. I dont care who made it. I also avoid brand logos on my clothing. Pick a specific piece of clothing you want set a hard line seemingly unachievable budget and go find that piece of clothing. It doesnt matter if you wouldnt wear one other piece of clothing in the store that you find it in. My one downfall in this category is vans love their campls wont buy any kind of replicas. . thrift stores.

The first page of chapter one is all about their DNA formula of style which is STYLE  KNOWLEDGE  FUNORIGINALITY.This is great! Hahaha. Proves that anyone can publish a book on the internet and get at least some people to buy it.EDIT To my disappointment the rest of the book isnt all that bad. I was hoping for some more good comedy. The writing is pretty mediocre but their advice is surprisingly decent. Its a fairly comprehensive manual too. In my opinion its a waste of money since you can get all the same information from just browsing MFA or Styleforum but it might be useful to someone.

4323425,0,t1_cscyxd4,Of those two the first one I think a full gold watch is tacky.But to be honest neither of those watches is what I would choose for myself in that price range you can actually get a real watch an automatic instead of a quartz movement. An automatic is what all watches used to be mechanical watches they never need to be charged and can last a lifetime. Today most are Quartz including the two you linked which is a battery powered watch. The movement of the hands itself is also different between the two a quartz ticks while a automatic watch have a smoother sliding motion of the second hand. I would recommend you get yourself a seiko  or any other automatic seiko for that matter Orient is another watchbrand similar to seiko  Or if you really like the style of the Invicta I would recommend you either get an automatic one with a more stainless look If you prefer to have some  plated gold on your watch consider the two tone gold versionAlso check our rwatches,malefashionadvice,cscz92z,40,t5_2r65t

Taking in sides shortening length AND shortening sleeves on one item can really be difficult but mostly time consuming.  That being said I think I do a better job than many tailors solely based on the fact that I take my time to do things right. I would start simple and maybe hem and taper some pants first. Then maybe add some darts shorten sleeves and take in the sides at the seams. For shortening length of a shirt it also helps to have a foot designed to stitch and fold the seam all at once. ,malefashionadvice,cshtzaf,0,t5_2r65t

4404193,0,t1_csm1qzp,From what Ive learned being around rfragrance and other fragrance places theres nothign wrong with applying to clothes and a lot of people suggest it. It usually helps increase longevity.The only issues are that the scent will not really evolve the same way it does on your skin and some colored fragrances could stain shirts though Ive yet to experience that having tried  fragrances. I personally usually do a spray on each wrist and one on the chest of my shirt. Sometimes one spray on my wrist and then dabbed on the other if the fragrance is stronger than others sometimes one more spray on my shirt or neck if its a weaker one.,malefashionadvice,csm35q7,4,t5_2r65t
4405127,0,t3_3bha75, Sort through ALL your clothes at once and determine which ones actually make you happy to hold and wear and which fit well. Think about each piece for a few moments before deciding and dont be afraid to let go. Give what you dont want to charity or discard it. You probably dont love every single one of those tshirts so why waste space storing something you dont love? If you dont have enough space either discard until you do or buy some plastic drawers Sterilite or something and NOT tubs with tops on them. Sterilite drawers are stackable if you remove the tops. Stick them in your closet if theyll fit. Fold your clothes tightly enough so that they stand vertically like this then store them in drawers so that you can flip through them like records at a record store. Itll be harder to lose shirts this way and you dont have the pull one from the bottom and fuck up all the rest problem. Fold all wornbutwillrewear clothes and put them back in your drawers before you go to bed every night. Pants in the pants drawer shirts in the shirts drawer underwear in the...actually just wash your damn underwear. And theres no reason to differentiate between these clothes and your perfectly clean clothes since youll be combining them into one outfit when you wear them anyway. Do you have a large suitcase? Large suitcases are perfect for dirty laundry. Just leave it open with the top leaning against the wall and toss your dirty clothes in there. When its laundry time zip it up and wheel it to the laundromat. Fucking genius. If you dont have a large suitcase buy a laundry hamper or some shit.

4409788,0,t1_csmjpc0,Well we disagree. Around here I see a lot of bike messengers who take the approach Ive described  milsurpathletic wearmaybe some outdoor technical stuff  in a blackdrabcamo pallete to create a distinct look that is also practical for their athletic use and potential adverse weather. The silhouettes and utility wind up distinctly in the techwear category though they may not be runway ready. EDIT examples   On one hand this is akin to telling someone that the entry point for Rick Owens is to get some black Jordans and then buy black gym shorts and an oversized wifebeater from Target. Sure its not gonna be the same league but youre still recreating the foundational look that inspired the designer to elevate it to runway levels. On the other hand if someones interest in techwear is largely practical the less avantgarde replacements do fine.No doubt issues of perfectionism and values come into play in this discussion. If you have a specific vision and are comfortable paying very high prices to achieve it then lowerend substitutes are not gonna cut it for you. But if youre less of a perfectionist or grailseeker and more interested in riffing on interesting aesthetics but at a more accessible level you can still do some really cool stuff here. ,malefashionadvice,csmput2,4,t5_2r65t

You may want more dress shirts in a wardrobe is not too uncommon.As for suit pants check the care tag. If it says dry clean only adhere to that.

If you are looking to go a bit more up market you can find John Lewis Zara and All Saints in Liverpool One. I would also recommend before you try any of these going down Bold Street.

4468178,0,t1_cstw0kv,Continued from Part Timeless G Parka  Penfield Shirt  Banana Republic Chinos  Jcrew Tie  Berg amp Berg Belt  Jcrew Shoes  Allen EdmondsFor those just starting out or looking to rebuild your wardrobes I cant stress enough how important it is to forego trendy infashion purchases and stick to the classics. That rule applies to raincoats as well. Pictured here are a number of items thatll never go out of style. Cornflower blue dress shirt navy blue flatfront chinos brown leather oxfords seasonal striped tie and a nofrills yellow parka. These wont look out of place in a month or even  years from now. Once youve built up a good and versatile wardrobe then Id say its OK to follow trends.Just Doing It H Anorak  Penfield Shirt  Under Armour Long Underwear  Hanes Sweat Pants  Jcrew Shoes  Nike x JcrewHeres another practical use for an anorak. On training days where its a little dewymisty itd be nice to keep from getting totally soaked through. Again look for one thats not going to bog you down  it should feel as though its barely there. Id also think it a good idea to get one in a color thatll grab drivers attention if youre running beside the street. Finally this one has a kangaroo pocket where the jacket can fold into itself  very portable. Keep it in your gym bag.Knocking the Wind Out I Raincoat  Penfield Sweater  Banana Republic OCBD  JCPenney Jeans  Gustin Belt  Brooks Brothers Boots  Johnston amp MurphyHeres one for those blustery days where the wind feels like it could cut right through you. A weatherresistant jacket is also windproof what with the material being so tightly woven together. I should warn against wearing suede shoes in the rain though. Ive had the damnedest time scrubbing out water marks picked up from unexpected showers  learn from my mistakes folks. When the skies look menacing maybe tuck your suedes away for another day. BONUS J Parka  Penfield Shirt  Jcrew Cardigan  Jcrew Pants  Levis Boots  ClarksConsider this one a bit of a bonus  I brought the Vassan here back for a fourth fit because its my latest purchase and Ive had fun finding ways to wear it. Ive been pleasantly surprised by how useful its been...especially since I figured itd be a bit tough to work with. Im finding that yellow is friendly with white a bunch of blues several shades of green and all kinds of grays seen above. Its also completely unlined and though a little stiff at first very breathable. Id think it perfect for those of you living on the northern coasts.

The shirt is too shiny at least appears that way in the photos and doesnt really go that well with your ties tie should always be noticeably darker than the shirt.  A plain white shirt would work much better.  Red ties are supposed to suggest dominance so they can strike the wrong tone in a job interview.  Brown belts and shoes are not as appropriate as black but you will probably get away with it fine as you are not in finance or law.  Finally a round toe is usually better than a square one.

Heres a copypasta which I paste about always when Im talking about suede. How to care for your suede  Get a suede brush and nano sprays. Every WalMartTargetmall should have these. And maybe colored nano sprays if your suede starts to loose some color. If suede gets scuffed you just need to brush the scuffs away. The nap cant get scuffed permanently unless you like have a very deep scuff but thats going to need some knives or something. If you completely trashed your shoes no worries! Wash them. Really.

Take yourself to any store that sells suiting and get yourself measured to find your XX x XX size then buy a proper dress shirt there or online.  Most brands then have fitment lines in that size for skinny fit slim fit and normal fit and this mainly deals with how full the chest area is.  Try each fitment line on in your XX x XX size then sally forth.  This will have to occur with each maker or you can do like I do and stick to a major label and once you have your size nailed down you can order shirts willy nilly as the need and sales strike you.,malefashionadvice,ctut0gj,1,t5_2r65t

4807293,0,t1_cu0981m,Yeah as much as I think band tshirts are boring its preferable to being dressed by your girlfriend.I used wear band tshirt and skinny jeans every day. Most of us on MFA started with little to no personal style. In my early s I had a girlfriend complain about my band tshirts. I reacted stubbornly. It wasnt until after we broke up that it really sunk in and I tried to improve my style. And I wasnt improving to win her back  shes long gone. I was improving for me. Men in the West though especially in America are raised to think of fashion as something only for women. Culture has started to come around in recent years to change that but its still embedded in many if not most men. When I finally saw that fashion can be something masculine as well I had a lot of catching up to do. Lapel width should match tie width? What the fuck is a lapel?It took a while to figure things out. But its more than learning the basics. Dressing well is not that complicated. It just took me a while to change my perception of self  that I could be someone who was seen as stylish and fashionable.  It also took me a while to get out of my comfort zone. Changing what you wear changes what you externally say about yourself to the world. Perhaps Im overthinking it but I think thats part of what makes changing difficult for some people. It feels like because youre changing you have to leave some part of you behind. That youre changing because youre deficient in some way. And to have someone suggest you should improve  that can make someone extremely defensive. It can take a while to see that it isnt like that at all. Improving your style doesnt mean changing who you are. It means better expressing who you are. Sure music will always be important to you but you are more than a walking advertisement for your favorite bands. Your favorite music becomes something people can unravel about you as they get to know you like all of your other interests. Youre no longer that dude wearing an Animal Collective shirt. You are your own person. You can be mysterious. You can be straightforward. You can be whatever you want. Developing your personal style helps you discover yourself and better express that self.So OP I wouldnt press your boyfriend too hard. It might make him defensive and stubborn. Hes going to have to come around on his own. Patience helps. Maybe direct him over here to start though...,malefashionadvice,cu0hywf,9,t5_2r65t

4859719,0,t3_3hg6dl,Chances are you got a faulty pair from Gap as construction wise most pants that have similar seams are going to be roughly equally as durable.  Either way sounds like you want a different brandfit.Besides Jomers which isnt readily available Id have to say my favorite chinos for work are from Gustin.  The price quality of fabric overall construction design styledetails and fit are all spot on IMO.  It may take some time to get them and if you arent familiar with your measurements in terms of numbers it could be tough to order from them.  You can always email them and ask them for some samples to try on.  Out of all the chino brands Ive owned they were the best bang for the buck besides Jomers.  Other than that I really enjoyed the Dockers Alpha chinos I had.  They are a tapered slim cut and were pretty well constructed.  Came in a variety of colors too.Epaulet was nice but I think they have a rather large premium on their pants.

Most likely theyre more expereinced in setting up their supply chains from factories of developing countries making sure that the quality is up to their standards. However for the king of dress shirts especially plain ones Id have to say Brooks Brothers  The link is only showing solids in their Milano extra slim fit change it to Regent if you need a slightly looser fitting. Generally their shirts are amazing especially these However Ive been hearing a few complaints over quality after repeated usage.To avoid that I would recommend spending a few more for their  ply Royal Oxford shirts that I hear are another level.If you really want to splurge but theyre only in the Regent fit slim you can try their Golden Fleece shirts as their  dollar ones are of noniron Egyptian cotton and their  are Sea Island cotton from Switzerland and made in Italy ,malefashionadvice,cuial5o,3,t5_2r65t

Shirt around the waist is definitely something used in streetwear more than anywhere else recently but its been done before too still not classic tho. Guy on the left has a streetwear aesthetic going but the other  are definitely going with a more classic style.

You should cuff the pants and see what that looks like but not with those shoes they have too many unnecessary details and the laces look very sloppy combined with the extra pant leg length. They look cheap. If they are cheap and you cant afford anything else right now try to save up and get a pair of chunkier classic footwear like a Timberland boot in brown leather.

I guess I wouldve liked darker jeans and maybe some brownbased bootschukkas. but I dont know if that wouldve worked well with the shirt. like I said I think Im alone in not feeling the shirt kind of busy for me so Im a little biased. not a knock against you and your style just a preference.

If you rarely will wear it cause you dont really get that cold then the vneck is probably going to be a more versatile piece in your wardrobe. I personally would much rather have a chunky shawl cardigan than almost any vneck mostly because I like the way they look better but I also get cold easier than some people and so that thickness helps.,malefashionadvice,cvhuv8d,1,t5_2r65t

5256554,0,t3_3mzzb8,There are some rules but those mainly apply to formalwear. I.e you shouldnt be wearing brown shoes and black suit.Mainly black shoes clothing or accessories get a lot of flack in casualwear because black is a very dominant colour. Its dark has historical connotations of being worn in formal setting and can overpower the colours of other pieces of clothing you are wearing.In casualwear you dont really have hardset rules just a few guidelines.  Black works with a few colours well whites greys burgundy olives at the most simplest. But to answer your specific last question wearing brown boots with a black tshirt would be fine. However an outfit without pants is going to look silly. So for a holistic does this look good youd best be wearing grey jeans or olive chinos for example. Also in casualwear you dont really need to match leathers. People like to but you can be a shade or two out of the exact colour of brown because ultimately youre not wearing a suit youve got some more leeway.If youre interested in more have a look at the sidebar under Getting Started The Most Basic Advice.

Seems like it occurs to all of their shirts. Its like the manufacturer asked Want this to be slimfit? and their reply was EWW HELL NO. But to be fair it is otherwise quite fine. Comfortable enough and fit was okay from shoulders down to chest.Normal cotton tee White. Pleasantly surprised actually quite comfortable and fit was ok but not perfect. Only thing is that it may be a bit too long for some but otherwise I am satisfied.Premium cotton tee Got it in grey. Premium my ass I would say. Fit way worse than the normal one at a US premium. Sleeve longer than necessary almost reaching elbow. Material is slightly thicker and stiffer less soft on the skin hence less comfortable as well that is all. Advise do not buy.Backpack looks like what the pictures promised. Havent used it yet but it looks good. Would have to witness it withstand the test of time to make an accurate judgment on its quality.Overall More disappointed than pleased with the quality of Everlanes products generally but that disappointment was fortunately ? cushioned by reading those other negative reviews albeit after I paid and ordered lol. Would I buy again? Maybe only the tee read the nonpremium one. The bag seems good but I wont be needing another one anytime soon. Honestly I would jump for another shirt linen ocbd or whatever if only you fixed that hideous flare Everlane.Edit thinking again they might have swapped the colours of my premium and normal tees by accident... the quality of the material of the white one trumps the grey one by quite a far measure.,malefashionadvice,cvmhdvv,1,t5_2r65t

5358204,0,t3_3oef2q,I think I have about  items from ASOS. I live in Canada and have never had any issues with deliveries or ordering. I personally love ASOS its great for a small budget. It stays on point in the fashion game but cuts the quality so the pieces wont last forever but they let you experiment with your style without breaking the bank or having to resell. The nonhouse brand stuff is marked up quite a bit so I generally avoid it unless theres a fat sale going on. The house brand is on sale quite often and I believe the quality matches approx. half of the MSRPs on the site. Im more into streetwear and ASOS caters to that style most streetwear essentials like elongated tees bomber jackets and chelsea boots are quite expensive but are made affordable but also lacking in quality by ASOS. The biggest thing to note is that the majority of their stuff has a very slim fit which is difficult to find in a lot of brands at this price range so size accordingly.,malefashionadvice,cvwkki7,2,t5_2r65t

5395865,0,t1_cw18hy9,The problem with that is that there are a lot of trends going on right now some of which are conflicting with each other. Workwear and Americana are still a thing even if theyre winding down and the SLP kind of look skinny jeans chelseas slightly oversized top is playing with silhouettes in the opposite way of other trends where you have loose drapier tops combined with wide pleated pants. Youll also get a lot of conflicting advice. I was just reading an article where they suggested wearing a slim top to balance out those wide pants but you can see a lot of collections where the top is just as loose to really amp up the whole relaxed look. So heres this whole reaction to what was originally the norm slim fitting pants with slim tops but this reaction is just all over the place. Some people are exaggerating the slimness some are going to the other end of the spectrum. Look at Chelsea boots and how theyve been adopted by streetwear and compare it to how menswear took minimalist sneakers and boots and added it to more formal clothing. Fashion is taking influences from a whole lot of ideas and its hard to say whats in when theres so much going on.,malefashionadvice,cw1dr71,1,t5_2r65t

5455574,0,t1_cw8xj1u,Very good info.  They seemed to last a little less than that but its within the margin of error for variation in usage.  Its been maybe  and a half years of  days wear per week and a resole every year or so.  I guess I had unrealistic expectations but I dont mind being shown where Im wrong.  Just ordered a pair of Dr. Martens for cheaper backup boots and will likely get these resoled and refinished in the next month or two.  At least then Ill be able to spread the wear out a bit and also have the lowerend boots for anything that will put more wear on them.  I did keep cedar shoe trees in them when not in use but sometimes that was just overnight if I wore them  days in a row.  Like you said multiple pairs of boots will make it a lot easier to give all of them proper treatment.  What usually happened was that Id intend to wear the boots some days and alternate with other shoes.The problem was that lots of times circumstances would require I wear boots instead of sneakers or dress shoes so Id grab the RWs.

5473422,0,t1_cwb5eed,i... WHAT??? Bend light all kinds of ways? Im sorry but i dont think you have any idea what youre talking about. First UV light is damaging to your eyes in the long run if you are an outdoorsy type of person and you never use sunglasses its not uncommon to have eye problems in your s if not earlier its even more important in ages before your  years old while your eyes are still developing. Secondly Sunglasses dont bend light not to any noticeable degree at least. they filter it. Light travels in waves the frequency of these waves determine what color light we see. any other bending that happened to the light would just change their direction which wont do anything different to your eyes. NOTE this is not talking about filtering color thats entirely different. Educate yourself. Note that BAD sunglasses are very bad for you because they darken your vision making your eyes dilate but dont block out UV light. You then take in more UV light that way. ,malefashionadvice,cwba4lm,5,t5_2r65t

5486141,0,t3_3q7s0b,other than calling navy pants black and spouting a lot of mfa gospel black is hard to wear etc this is pretty good.  I dont like most of that korean fashion it looks like a j.crew whitewashing of contemporary or last years street style but thats just me.if i were you id stop going on mfa for the forseeable future.  look at the clothes people around you have and how they put them together.  focus on the emotion of the clothing and the message it sends.  hedi slimane does this really well and hes one of the biggest designers in the world for it.  john elliott too and hes gaining traction for it.  Stop listening to what mfa tells you man.  once you hit a certain point rules dont apply.  You shit on buffalo check.  Why?  Its incredibly versatile you can essentially wear it with any pair of jeans that arent faded to hell or light wash.  Black doesnt not match with many colors.  It just doesnt match well with the specific shades mfa prefers of the specific colors mfa prefers.  Black jeans have far more emotion than blue denim or any kind of chinos.  And can anchor a very loud piece very strongly.  If youre wearing a yellow raincoat you should either be wearing black denim or at sea.  You made a huge amount of comments about that trash fit with the camel coat but didnt mention brand synergy whatsoever.  the reason why it looks ridiculous apart from nothing fitting and the colors being off as well as the texture of the coat only really being appropriate for a suit or at least a jacket is that hes wearing motherfucking stan smiths with a business casual ensemble.  people tried to do that shit in  and it looked stupid then.  Stans arent loud theyre one of the most basic and inoffensive sneakers you can buy.  but you cant wear them with trousers and a camel chesterfield coat without looking like you went on fashionbeans for the first time this morning.,malefashionadvice,cwcwlq8,10,t5_2r65t

Dresses accentuate breasts and hips mens tshirts accentuate pegs and biceps for instance. Howeverstyle has advanced to the point where what is considered the standard for either sex is different than it was even twenty years ago. So who knows? Young thug wearing a dress certainly looks odd as the dress is not designed for his body. But odd is fashionable now fashion is an art form that is sometimes way fucking out there so who knows.

Merino wool jumper   Woolblend speckled jumper   Padded fishtail parka   Black jeans because thats what all the kids wear these days   ANDOR Dark denim jeans if you dont want black   Beanie  this one is only a  wool blend. Ideally youd have a  wool one but that would be pricier.   Scarf  just about the only one I could find which is wool. Will keep you warm though.   Gloves  Total Its from HampM because theyre widely available and the cheapest for the sort of price point Im aiming at and I dont like Zara. It also means that you can get mostly kitted out at one place. Obviously this is very neutral and should not be any kind of gospel.Topman is a bit more expensive usually  or so but is sometimes slightly better made. If youre in London or dont mind ordering online many of these items can be found for a similar price from Uniqlo for notably better quality. Higher budget and more fashionforward items can also be found at places like Cos. If your budget is lower than what I mentioned look at Primark. Their stuff is very low quality for a very low price but might work.Shoes depend on your taste. Im tons older than you but as far as I can tell most teenagers dont wear boots usually trainers. I wouldnt normally recommend shoes from budget clothes retailers like HampM as theyre usually cheaply made but they might work for your needs. Main places to look for trainers are shops like Size Offspring JD Sports Office Schuh. The latter two will have normal shoes too.Id also recommend an umbrella. If you are going to have a Muji near you this foldable umbrella is really good. Ive had one for  years and its survived some really strong winds as its designed to fold backwards. Otherwise any fairly cheap umbrella will do.,malefashionadvice,cwqnt6t,8,t5_2r65t
5596255,0,t1_cwql2iz,It varies depending on how much you deviate from his stock pattern and the extra options you request.  I went with american bison which was around a  upgrade from regular steerhides added a few inches in length slimmed the body and added that nd pocket on the chest.  It still came out cheaper than the Taylor Stitch jacket and the price was comparable to Falcon Garments... but now I was able to get it from a place that actually has a physical presence which is a big thing to me after being scammed by Drew from TOJ.  Heres his web site  I know his web site looks horrible and seems like its from the s but dont let that turn you off.  I would say call Golden Bear first and get a quick quote.

Its all just there. Not really sure how to describe it. When I see other peoples postings theres usually something that has the right combo of their body shapeclothingetc that is attractive. Looking back on it maybe its the jeans youre wearing? They all seem pretty bland. I think what the other poster mentioned is accurate. Change the jeans youre wearing to a pair of slim darker non distressed jeans and that will probably make your overall look much better.

My wolverines have this look in the daylight but not as pronounced. IMO the factory installed burnished look is overly fake at this price point and throws the look off. I have seen some shoes at higher price points where it does look really good though albeit more subtle.I think we are in agreement with the over all look.

They have been on my grailed list of denim for about  years now and i figured I would never find a pair. Needless to say I am stoked! They have around a month of wear and a hem and a taper but that just made them fit even better. Its also a nice break from my oz since they arent as heavy since I have put ion a little weight. Beams Plus Crazy Aran  full price but its damn sexy Barbour Bedale olive  Ordered a while ago but just arrived. Still need the hood too. Nigel Carboun Canadian Jacket  cheap used but good condition. I cant decide if I want to keep it or not. Its a tad on the large side but most of my summer clothes are baggier. Ill post fit pics at some point to get some feedback. Danner ML  Found these on ebay for   after shipping. At that price I was willing to settle on teh colorway.Still on my to buy list are a pair of color  cordovan boots a pair of olive pants I am thinking orslow slim fatigue but I am not sure Black speckled sweater and posible this battenwear sweater for SS nights.

5655336,0,t1_cwy391h,Hey this is actually something I know a bit about! So for our mainline and outlet stores the max tolerance for sizing is . while the tolerance for the signature collection is somewhere around . Too many times Ive had a customer walk into my store wearing a  and end up walking out with a  or equivalent difference that fits exactly the same as the jeans they wore in. While yes the fit is going to be generally the same for the different cuts   etc its the consistent sizing of our mainline thats very reliable comparatively. Also the standard cuts are present in both our signature and mainline collection so just seeing a  isnt an assurance of quality. Were also told in training that the quality control for both stitching and general denim quality is much lower something I can confirm pretty much every time I walk into a department store. In our training manual it says that the Levis signature collection was introduced in order to attract the value shopper that frequents major department stores. However I have less knowledge on the sourcing of the denim that goes into both our mainline and signature collections I only know for sure that the LVC collection has been using Cone Mills denim.,malefashionadvice,cwy3lid,16,t5_2r65t

6031814,0,t3_3y3vcz,I have a suit that I got on clearance from their website. Its higher end Tommy Hilfiger and the price was right even if I wasnt  happy with it. Its actually a pretty nice suit. I had a credit to take it in and get it finished there and thats where my only complaint is. The pants came unhemmed and the waist was a little tight but with plenty of extra fabric. I asked them to adjust the waist about  which they did and to hem the pants with no break add a slight taper. When I picked them up they had a full break and no taper. I wasnt happy about that but it is what it is. Theyll redo them if I decide to bring them back there for no charge.If you go with the knowledge you have from here and dont necessarily listen to the sales people who may or may not be knowledgeable you can get a suit thats just as nice as a suit supply one for the same price. Theyll offer to tailor it for you too but as my experience shows you may not get what you ask for.

Obviously the lower your social class the less true this was but everybody dressed as much like the nobility as they were able.So today we just have long traditions about what men and women wear.

6118792,0,t1_cykbr5x,The average person wont know why something looks more or less expensive but they can definitely tell. A suit from Zara is usually made from polyester or viscose as far as I know and have very strange fits imo. However you can take a suit from Charles Tyrwhitt which costs a little more and looks a world away because its made from wool with a viscose lining obviously and is structured to look like a real suit. Zara suits are fused whereas CT suits are halfcanvassed for example. Your average person wont know that but they do know that there is a difference.A lot of the time the key variable is the fit. A standard Hanes tshirt will look cheaper than a slim fit Uniqlo tshirt which will also look cheaper than a Sunspel tshirt. However the difference between the Hanes and Uniqlo is much larger than the Uniqlo and Sunspel because the latter will have similar fits. I have a polo shirt from Sunspel you can probably guess which and several polo shirts from Uniqlo and even though the Sunspel looks noticeably more expensive the Uniqlo polo shirts still hold their own because again they fit well.As far as materials go a lot of people wont notice the difference between super s and super s wool on a suit but they will notice the difference between wool and polyester. Especially after its been drycleaned a few times. Woolblend knitwear doesnt hold its own as well as merino or cashmere does as far as the eyes are concerned. And as for your example with watches. Im a watch person albeit a young one and from my experience you typically cant fool watch people. We can almost always spot fake Rolexes and Omegas especially the newer models and watch people will know what watches they should be impressed by and what they shouldnt be. That doesnt mean that they only respect  watches  I myself wear a  Orient  but it means that they wont be impressed if its a Submariner knock off or even a Fossil made Emporio Armani. Essentially if you can say why your watch is special then theyll be impressed. Even at the high end of the spectrum people buying k Patek Phillipes will still have a Speedmaster in their collection or even a Swatch.The things Ill usually look for are shoes watch colours and fit. Your shoes should be your highest quality item your watch should be your investment and colours and fit will give an example of your taste. Unfortunately people wrongly associate taste with money.,malefashionadvice,cyl5611,3,t5_2r65t

However normally they dont get to claim a foreign colony the victor needs  to win because as you said the game would move super fast. Of course if these are homebrew rules that work for your group then play them! I think one ought to always prioritize fun.,malefashionadvice,cz0i258,1,t5_2r65t

6263055,1,t3_41dp9d,Its not offensive or anything but certainly lacks interest. Theres no contrast or interplay in the outfit just a mass of one shade and dark to boot which makes it more dull and depressing.Whats hanging from your waist? It sticks out. The eye is drawn there as if that little accessory is more important than anything else. What should be most important is you which means attention should naturally be drawn to the face.You have some nice pieces but they could be combined in a more interesting way by providing tonal contrast between upper and lower. When wearing dark jeans a medium or light sweater offers the contrast that begins to move the eye between elements rather than leaving it stagnant as it takes in one unified mass.Besides contrasting shade level of darkness you can also contrast color. Rather than pairing blues together start venturing into blue and brown or blue and grey... or all three to create a very interesting way interplay that is very easy to combine. From there you can start practicing with colors beyond the neutrals and with patterns.Also brown boots or shoes would offer quite a bit more character than black and if they were light enough to provide contrast themselves could lift even the present outfit into something of note.Usually a monochrome look depends on more subtle and sophisticated interplay. Its often a mix of similar not same tones and soft ones where the unification and the quality of the colors both contribute to a very calm and subtle feeling. Further interest is added with texture line and drape which are also lacking here or at least not at all unique and these style elements show up better in mid tones and light tones. Grey and greybased colors like taupe soft brown and buff work well for monotone looks.The final note here is that close mismatch is often quite annoying to the eye. Dark blues or blacks or whatever that almost match but dont quite can come off as an offputting style faux pas.,malefashionadvice,cz1jfu7,0,t5_2r65t

The good thing about mens fashion is that were on the positive end of the double standard  its unlikely people will judge you as much for what you wear and the size of your wardrobe as a man compared to before you transitioned. Therefore I recommend keeping your wardrobe down to the staples and then branching out.And of course congratulations!!! ,malefashionadvice,czfjyfd,20,t5_2r65t

6444431,0,t3_43ue2q,I reject trends that dont conform with the clothing principles that Ive adopted in my early s which is the time when I started dressing like an adult who doesnt look sloppy.  wear what works with my body shape. Im a tall slim guy at  and  lbs. It just so happens that slimmer clothing works. Rather than wearing looser clothing to try to expand my volume so I look less slim which will make me look  sloppier this has been mathematically proven. An addendum to be attached I will wear clothes that fit which just so happens to be whats popular now.  follow the principle of less is more or the principle of subtlety. Ive had a few years to refine my choice of style and this is what I found works for me. For example when it comes to dress shirts I might look for something in a solid colour with a subtle weave pattern instead of a shirt with stripes.  building on the less is more principle I avoid loud colours or excessive ornamentation. A light pink button up shirt is OK. One in hot pink is not. Shirts with French cuffs are fun as cuff links allow for an extra level of accessorising but too many of these shirts become excessive as it becomes too flashy. I wouldnt want to be the French cuff guy in an office meeting.  wear clothing that build on my complement my existing wardrobe to maintain versatility in an article of clothing. I wouldnt want to limit the outfits in which a shirt can be used.  my casual wear follows the same principles and since I prefer button up shirts jeans and chukkas its really not that different from my work wear.

6471829,0,t3_449t7c,Alright man Im gonna lay something out that isnt what you want to hear.  Im straight but I do a lot of work with the gay community and live in a major US city.For a straight guy I dress really gay.  One of my favorite outfits is a pink and lavender gingham shirt my rainbowweft raw jeans and my cream and purple sneakers.  Honestly I think it just looks good on me and I feel it.Our closest friend is very openly gay but he dresses really straight.  Slim blue jeans brown work boots white crew neck tshirt and a fleece halfzipup from his favorite NHL team are his goto casual outfits when we go out to very obviously gayfriendly restaurantsbars.Every time I ask him Do I look too gay? his response is always Honey no one is going to think youre gayeven if you said you were.Why?  Because its all about how you carry yourself and confidence in who you are.  Aside from doing work with the gay community I also do a lot of work in prisons.  You always know the truly scary guysthe guys who have killed one or more timesbecause they arent loud and boisterous like most of the punks in there.  Theyll speak normally theyre polite and when they tell others to shut the fuck up those people listen immediately.  Even if they dont tell you what they did you still know.I mention all this to say it has nothing to do with your clothes or your look and mannerisms and almost if not all about how you carry yourself and knowingtruly knowingwho you are as a person.  You have nothing to prove to anyone else because you know who you are and what youre about and when others see you know what youre about theyll know exactly the kind of person you are.The bad news is this cant really be taught from my experience.  It develops as you get older and you endure hardships that stem from the nature of who you are persevering through them and remaining unrepentant for who you are when you come out the other side.  When youve done that you know exactly who the fuck you are and so does everyone elsewhether they agree with it or not.Hope that helps.,malefashionadvice,czoqdzm,151,t5_2r65t

6497093,0,t1_czrb2sl,I have a TNF in and dont disagree with this advice.  Its a nice jacket but it wasnt that warm so I purchased a down jacket to zip in it.  Its been very handy but if I had to do it over Id just buy the pieces individually so I could get exactly what I want from both.  Its nice how the in jackets zip together but its not really necessary.However I will say that Ive also purchased additional pieces from other brand names that will also zip in it.  I probably wear my outer layer the most with a Cabelas down vest inside because that works best with temperatures around where I live and its just easier then the other options.  I can even zip my Barbour Pioneer jacket inside although its metal zipper might be harsh on the plastic zipper with the TNF in.

6514717,0,t3_44rhuc,Threads like these always end up annoying me because of the number of armchair pundits from developed nations with no actual experience whove read an article or two and think they know whats up.  . Developing countries do have ethical factories and manufacturing plants. Just because it isnt made locally for the buyer or in some first world country doesnt mean its unethical. By not buying just because of origin you are hurting legitimate manufacturers as much as unethical manufacturers. This once again all comes down to transparency from brands. Its a complicated situation that cant be solved with dont buy from X country but dont buy from X manufacturer might be too difficult to achieve due to said transparency reasons. . Not all Chinese manufacturersfactories are run unethically. A majority likely would be considered unethical for people from developing nations with higher standards of living but would be considered a grey area for local people. The majority is still run poorly of course. Conditions have improved in a lot of places though there is still a lot of progress to be made.  . Now that China is getting more expensive because conditions have been improving slowly a lot of international brands have moved their production to Bangladesh and Vietnam. I suspect those places have it much worse but its a chicken and egg dilemma. By supporting their economy textiles employ a big chunk of Bangladeshs population you give them hope of improving conditions over time but end up supporting ugly conditions in the present. If their economy is impacted negatively due to a collapse in textile demand it would take the country much longer to recover and improve. With or without poor factory conditions Bangladeshs people have it rough. Unless youve actually lived in these conditions I dont think you can understand the concept that some people would rather have shitty work than no work at all or slightly less shitty work than slightly worse work. You cant snap your fingers and then expect the whole world to be a nice place. Progress takes time and a lot of growing pains. Its a complex issue.  Source My family owns factories in a developing nation I visit Chinese factories including ones that would and would not be considered sweatshops often I have a lot of friends who also own manufacturing businesses.,malefashionadvice,czt689h,8,t5_2r65t

6794874,1,t3_48tbxb,Ive lived in a few European countries and never wore shorts.  I had shorts and wore them once and everybody thought I was walking around in my underwear.  So I wouldnt recommend shorts  a number of brands make summer weight chinos I have a pair from j.crew factory that are really great but wrinkly.Id definitely bring a pair of dark new denim the germans and austrians were very weird about denim that didnt look brand new and fancy summerweight chinos or linen pants instead of shorts probably  pairs of pants total.  Two fancier dress shirts two linen button down or popover shirts definitely go with some nice pastel colors or floral prints.  Definitely an unlined blazer that matches the denim and at least one other pair of pants. Id probably just take two pairs of good walking shoes that doubled as dress shoes maybe a pair of boots if I was going to be in a region with hiking or biking shoes if I was going to do biking.  Id probably leave room to pick up one or two pieces of clothing while I was over there and saw something that fit in well that I really liked a certain style of sweater for example. This is also assuming youre in a warmer area  you could obviously be in Europe and somewhere much farther north in which case youd probably want to carry more springtype pieces.Edit TIL one more way the Austrians messed with me.,malefashionadvice,d0mhmfm,2,t5_2r65t

I go every year to Europe and from my experience things tend to be more expensive for different reasonsA International brands Zara HampM etc tend to just swap out the  sign for the EuroPound sign and keep the same number so more expensive.B Brands you cant find in the US tend to be slightly pricier than similar styles in the US but they will almost always fit very differently. And although they may be slightly more than similar styles in the US the quality tends to be better AND now you own a rare article of clothing rare because unfindable in US. C In general the clothing options tend to just be better. Men in Europe in general care much more about how they look from personal experience so theres more demand therefore more options and therefore more cost. All in all if you really like the Harrington go for it. If you want something you cant find in the US wait til you get to Europe.

I do constructionrelated stuff and slimmermodern jeans tend to inhibit you from cleanly squatting down all the way lifting your knee up to you chest or taking long strides. Everyone else can get away with wearing skinny jeans if they so desire for fashion reasons but for freedom of movement you need some baggyness. What sucks is stores including official Levis stores seem to be pushingout  and baggier variants forcing you to order online. What also sucks is you now see spandex invading from female fashion and its deemed more comfortable... yes more comfortable if you are buying skintight clothing and you need some freedom of movement. Otherwise spandex doesnt feel as good IMHO. Besides all spandex pants for men all seem to make a stupid elastic clapping sound from your back when you walk. Females dont notice this because their pants cling to their butt ... no flapping. In general my view is the entire industry and society is too much in the Ying and needs to go back into Yang.

Makes a huge difference! Belt price really doesnt matter you can get a  one from TJ Maxx easily and still look fly. Leather or fake leather is always a good way to go. If you really want to get a bang for your buck look for a reversible belt that is brown on one side and black on the other. Two for one! Plus if youre feeling frisky you can change it up throughout the day. Ties depend on the design if youre willing to shop online Amazon has a great selection for reasonable prices!Shoes are whats hard. A good pair that will last and look fresh should be around  minimum.

7177979,0,t3_4drbwd,I started thinking about what I try to express with my clothes very early on. Because I have a very average body most things look good on me. I like different styles aswell so theres a lot of choice. So instead of going for a certain styles I look at keywords and abstract themes that help me dress and shop. Therefore I often think about what Im trying to express with my clothing instead of just what looks good. In general its as little and neutral as possible. I dont want to show people who I am through my clothes I want people to think I look good and giving me a chance to show who I am on my own. To allow people to look beyond my clothes with the least prejudice as possible. This comes with the job Internet journalist as with who I am. I have lots of different interests so why would I put myself in a corner so to speak. And so far thats going pretty nicely. Of course its not always like that and I still wear band shirts more expressive stuff and things like that from time to time if I feel like it. And of course people will always have preconceived notions but still I try to minimize this. Generally people dont really know what kind of person I am based on my clothes. I very often hear people say that they didnt think Id like a certain thing or be a certain way and when I ask what they did expect they dont know. And I like it that way. Im expressing myself with my clothes by expressing myself as little as possible.EDIT Now that I read it back it might not be the most coherent thing but it makes sense in my head. EDIT Now that I come to think of it some of you might think that I dress very boring. But for me its more about minimalism and neutrality without sacrificing interesting clothes. I look at details fabrics and textures. For instance no ones going to have preconceived notions about a navy wool sweater. But I can make it special for me by getting one with a beautiful shetland fabric andor raglan sleeves etc. Or a regular tshirt that has a different neck or a certain drape. You know still different then normal people but nonexpressive. If that makes sense its kinda hard to explain.,malefashionadvice,d1u2kmf,2,t5_2r65t

7321916,0,t1_d2admbv,This is a problem I ran into when I started dressing more prep. Polos are hard to pull off without being country club chic. A perfectly fitting polo looks phenomenal but you have to put in the foot work to find the perfect polo for your body. A polo even slightly ill fitting will give you the country club old man look. It can be done though. Every polo Ive tried on from different retailers all fit very different. Im positive theres a polo out there for everyone.As long as you look at a polo as the prep version of a tee shirt youll find it isnt near as bad as people tend to think. Sure theres always something that will look better. A button up would look better. But then a blazer would look even better. Now a pocket square would make it look even better. Having a better option is an endless cycle that I dont necessarily agree with.,malefashionadvice,d2ag9l5,64,t5_2r65t

At least for me trying to find something in between can be difficult.Also Im a slim guy so I mostly wear slim shirts but I often have to wear regular fits today because everythings so slim.,malefashionadvice,d2dt09a,3,t5_2r65t

7366665,0,t3_4g8ztc,So the real difference between the Havana Napoli and Sienna is pretty much slight formality differences.  Havana  most casual unstructured shoulders half lined patch pockets.  Napoli  Slightly more structured shoulders fully lined so more structure through the body flap pockets.  Sienna  most formal of the  also fully lined and flap pockets  ticket pocket. A couple of my personal thoughts The Havana has great details for a blazer as a suit it is rather casual. The Napoli is a standard for the contemporary business suit it is praised here for a reason. Sorry I dont have any experience with the Sienna but if the salesperson recommended it I would trust them. Last thought dont go with J. Crew. Suitsupply suits are nicer is pretty much every aspect in my opinion.  ,malefashionadvice,d2fjeuh,1,t5_2r65t

Have a white linen from mainline and everything is top notch. Returned a navy factory polo because of contrast thread on the top button when it folded out you could see the back with loose white  threads and again looked cheap. I remember thinking This looks like Target stuff. I bet full J Crew doesnt have this problem about to find out next week when one arrives. I do like some stuff though. Just got a factory slim pocket tee that fits and looks so good Im going to buy several. I have one factory button down that Ive worn a ton in the last year. It looks great.

Crew styling. Its possible ties will be worn but you can always bring one just in case. Doesnt have to be those brands but that is the typical dress.

General rule of thumb  if a storebrandlabel is known for their price and price point whether that be high medium low theyre not going to magically have cheap shit laying around.  That said if J.Crew is your jam  just get their Factory squares  If you know anyone with a sewing machine or have a tailor or are handy enough to handroll and stitch just make them yourself out of whatever pattern youd like.  If youre cheaphave a budget Im sure places like Target sell packs of cotton squares. Generally youre not going to find silklinen squares in a budget environment.  You can also check out your local secondchanceconsignment shops.  Its not rocket science. If you want cheap shit shop in cheap storesbuy from budget brands.

7557563,0,t1_d318noc,gt Almost any dress shirt can be worn tucked in or out I would highly advocate against wearing dress shirts untucked regardless of the pants. Obviously the hem plays a big part in this you dont want it to be so long it looks like pajamas which is typical for shirts that are meant to be tucked in. Almost more than that though is the material. Most dress shirts have a finer broadcloth fabric which is smooth and often has some sheen. This creates kind of a mixed media look with jeans and most chinos.  If you want a casual collared shirt thats meant to be worn untucked get something with a shorter hem with a collar thats meant to be worn open a button down one in a more rugged weave like Oxford cotton or chambray.,malefashionadvice,d319bc4,18,t5_2r65t

7688905,0,t1_d3g4ky9,I dont think its stupid because its subjective and personal.  Your friends may think they look better or they may prefer their look for some other reason.  Or they may just not care enough to dress nice.  Im watching Bob Marley perform on TV right now and while we may not think hes dressed nicely what Im wearing wouldnt match his style.  But if I just saw him in the grocery store I might think he looks like a bum.It could also be that youve grown apart from your friends if you have no interest in dressing like them and they have none in dressing like you.  It happens.Like you Im comfortable wearing clothing that fits well.  I dont mind wearing some illfitting clothing but if everyones wearing illfitting shorts and tees Im usually okay wearing shorts and tees that do fit well.  It sounds like you may have a philosophical difference with your friends that entails more then just clothing though.Anyway I think you brought up an interesting topic.  I wasnt really trying to give you advice so much but rather just ponder the possibilities because I face the same thing all the time.  Im a pretty casual dresser most of the time but even so I constantly feel the need to dress down to fit in.  My extended family likes to regularly hold events that I enjoy attending but theyre so casual that I have to work to find clothing to wear so I wont stand out like a black sheep.  Of course I dont have to do it but I dont want them thinking of me as different even if its in what Id consider a good way.Ill also mention that I once dated a girl who dressed like a slob.  We met through a close friend who was also a slob and we started dating soon after.  Wed dated for about  months when she came over dressed to the nines one day.  I mentioned that she looked great and should dress like that more often.  She told me if was just how she usually dressed but that she dressed down when we went out because I dressed like a slob.  Ironically I was dressing down for her and she was doing the same for me.  Turns out that she was a great dresser and I just never knew before then.,malefashionadvice,d3g6h6l,1,t5_2r65t

They might be a bit short for taller skinny dudes. The large is too long so I have to tuck it. Shrinkage was more than expected compared to my regular Denver Haynes. The threading isnt uptopar. On both samples I bought the bottom hem is coming apart after only  wears.

An OCBD by virtue of its texture thickness and collar is a more casual shirting choice appropriate for wearing with other casual clothing like denim or casual chinos. If youre looking for something for business meetings and what you refer to as formal its pushing it a bit as you usually want to dress up for clients or meeting with senior staffmanagement. Those thinner white shirts are more in line with what is more appropriate fabric and thickness wise with what you want.

Dont buy shoes like these and then try to mitigate their effect.Personally I think it comes down to the same thing it always comes down to with advanced pieces you have to have the confidence to wear them like you think theyre sweet and you dont mind having spent so much money on such ridiculous shoes.

Dark jeans chinos in khakigraynavy solidcolored tshirts blackwhitegray a simple buttondown shirt a white or light blue OCBD is classic some brown dress shoes and black Chucks or whatever sneakers you like.You can mix and match pretty much any of that shit and outside of a funeral it should cover you for like  of all situations. You want something a little nicer than jeans and a tshirt? Pair the jeans with an OCBD or wear a tshirt with your chinos. OCBD  chinos is as dressed up as anyone will likely expect you to get. Eventually youll need a tie for graduations and shit.Anyway as you get comfortable with that look you can branch out into other colors or patterns but for now play it conservatively Dont get anything with crazy patterns or unnecessary buttons or zippers or frills or anything. Make sure everything fits you well and you feel comfortable in it before buying.

8006420,0,t3_4ovgj4,use collar stays metal not plastic. I hardly think your jacket sleeves need to be shortened at all rather you should get longer shirts. The sleeves are hitting right at your wrist bone and your shirts can hit just below that to make for a conservative look.You might even get the sleeves slimmed as well because it looks like theres some twist in it that could be addressed. If youre adventurous try a full spread instead of a semi spread. The wider spread will help give a broader shoulder appearance as well as appear as if your shoulders are pulled slightly back. Also your pants could to be hemmed and slimmed from thigh down. The slimmer lapel begs for a slim frame and tailoring your pants to follow your natural lines will aid in that. As far as hemming you already have a full break without shoes with shoes it would puddle up. All in all your frame is very wide your lapels are small and button stance is low.

Most people are kinda fat so at the proper chest size the torso will have enough fabric to accommodate some pudge.  They can now sell that shirt to the standard larger person who has that chest size and to fitterthinner people at that chest size who are not informed of better fitting alternatives and to people who are willing to get the waist taken in.When most people are wearing shirts that are pulling at the chest they have sacrificed fit in the chest for fit through the rest of the shirt likely from lack of knowledge of alternatives or lack of knowledge of correct fit.

8046402,0,t3_4petph,Like cvand said it is ideal to have a jacket and suit pant that match in both color and material as that is what looks best in a formal setting.Its not that wearing black to an interview isnt acceptable its just that it might look a little out of place. However a navy or charcoal suit is more appropriate to wear as it is not as formal as a black suit. While all three are formal a black suit has a higher level of formality sotospeak as black is usually worn for occasions such as a funeral or  church while navy and charcoal can be worn for many occasions.Like others have said you will most likely find a suit that will fit you much better if you go somewhere that can provide individual attention when it comes to buying a suit as they be of better help such as Suit supply. However if you do decide to go by yourself I highly recommend taking a look at this guide as it has many good pointers when it comes to wearing suits well. In your case I think you should focus the most on s      and . To find a jacket that will fit you well I also recommend taking a look at the first three steps in this guide as it can also help you find a better fitting suit jacket. One thing that you should look out for when trying on a suit is if it makes an X in the fabric in the chest area when it is buttoned up. If it makes an X its too small.If you have any more questions or need help feel free to send me a message.,malefashionadvice,d4khpma,1,t5_2r65t

In one brand you might find that a  is your best fit and in a different brand  or even a different style from the same brand  you best fit might be tagged as a  or even .  There is no real standardization here.  When possible check for size charts provided by the manufacturer or vendor and compare with your actual waistthigh measurements or to measurements of your bestfitting pair of jeans.Regarding inch large or small.

Of course there are many who dress well but its all very european  skinny jeans and tight fits. Dont reccomend trying to blend in. I dont know what dress american means.  Personally for pants I wore slim jeans and looser chinos I wore a mix of oxford button downs shirts with bandmandarin collars and tshirts. For shoes brought some leather sneakers a pair of boots and a plain oxford shoe with minimal detailing. Brought a few sweaters and light jackets for december. I didnt look like anyone else there but I didnt stick out either. Jeans and chinos are good khakis are pretty American prep for spain stick to dark grey olive green black or navy chinos. I wouldnt say nobody wears shorts but its rare. If you are on a budget  get some dark slim fitting pants plain tshirts in grey black and navy and a few oxfords. you should be set.

At the time it was an expensive outfitter all of the clothes were geared towards hiking camping hunting and other outdoorsy type of activity. Absolutely nothing douchbag or hipster about the place. The only thing I would buy from them were winter jackets. Damn they were nice and I still have one of my favorites. I suppose it would be considered somewhat vintage now.There was a  year gap between my last visit to the old Seattle store and an AampF store in some mall and wow was I stunned at the change. Looked more like a cross between Ralph Lauren and Banana Republic with an obvious aim at a much younger demographic.

Back then all the other kids were SUPER judgmental of each other. If your jeans werent tight enough or if you had the wrong haircut they would look down on you. Even as a  year old I used to hate how superficial they all were. No doubt most of those kids are really regretting their stretched earlobes these days. Unless you legitimately ARE a crusty old punk in a spiked leather jacket there isnt really an authentic way to pull it all off. Even successful poppunk bands today dont really look like punk bands.

Acqua di Gio has been the  Mens Fragrance many times in the past and with that being said my top recommendation would be Creed Aventus. Among the fragrance community its very hyped but for a good reason. Aventus is a pricey fragrance but on Fragrancenet the .oz will run you right at .   If you want something more complex and intriguing then Tom Ford is the way to go. My recommendations would be Mandarino di Amalfi Cafe Rose Tuscan Leather or Tabacco Vanille. Not all of these are categorized as SS fragrances though. As for a cheaper fragrance which can unfortunately? be found at Sephora I would recommend Chanel Bleu de Chanel.    I do not recommend blind buying an expensive fragrance but instead try a few samples from eBay or a site like DecantShop Also read about the listed fragrances on basenotes or fragrantica for their scents and reviews! ,malefashionadvice,d5mvqpv,1,t5_2r65t

If you cant do that either take it to a dry cleaner and ask them to help get the wrinkles out. When it needs it. And to be clear you should never wash a suit like in a washing machine or even by hand in a bucket of water etc.always always always get suits and jackets dry cleaned. You dont want to do this too often because the chemicals used in dry cleaning can break down the fibers in the wool so take it in if theres an obvious issue a stain a funky smell etc. or maybe no more than a couple times a year.

8461850,0,t3_4vkuxg,Id stay away from any watch that looks like gold that everyone knows from a glance isnt actually gold like that GShock for example. It makes you look silly and poseury. If you want something that looks gold go for a nondigital watch. There are many to choose from. You may want to go for something with a gold colored bracelet if youre feeling really flashy but I personally I like leather bands or NATOs on almost everything. Go for something from one of the timetested pun intended brands of the lowend watch world because you can be sure on quality  Seiko Timex Casio Citizen etc. something youve heard of.Though the first step in finding an analog watch is defining what style you want. There are many different types with varying different aesthetics used historically for very different purposes. Though Id argue most watches have been made obsolete by the cell phone the styles still live on. I dont want to just suggest a watch to you because I dont want you to buy something that I like I want you to buy something that you like. Ill happily give you my opinion though. If you want a rundown of the different watch styles just let me know. I just dont want to waste my time explaining anymore if it will fall on deaf ears but Id love to help if you are willing to listen!,malefashionadvice,d5z9mv9,3,t5_2r65t

While driving  speed manual I pulled my foot up and scratchedscuffed the toe on a piece of plastic above the clutch. I went home and used a little Dr. Martins wonder balm to see if they would just condition out. But theyre still visible. You can barely feel them with your fingers but in very particular about my stuff being pristine especially when new. Is there anything I can do or that a cobbler might be able to do that could possibly buff these out? Im willing to pay if a cobbler has the means and tools necessary to fix these.

8768956,0,t1_d71mjmz,The shoes seem to be imported with the Euro prices on there and then the US prices are stickied on top.  Have you ever been to a bookstore in Canada? Have you ever looked in a jacket of a book and seen the US and CDN prices side by side?  I live in Canada and it pisses off every Canadian but no one is stupid enough to stand there demanding to pay in US dollars because REASONS!!!  IT is more than likely an issue with lazy employees not putting stickers on everything like they should.   A minimum pay employee will make some mistakes once in a while.  If they already lost a class action suit then you would hope they would be more careful but i just saw a guy finding some prices in Euros and then showing the same item riced in US.  But again it is completely ignoring the myriad of reasons why the price is higher. Taxes import duties etc   I see the noob in your username so i will assume you just arent aware of stuff like this.,malefashionadvice,d71s818,10,t5_2r65t

8803131,0,t3_50psl9,For short trips less than  weeks I usually take two pairs of jeans or a pair of jeans and two pairs of shorts if its hot a couple quick drying tshirts I can wash in the bathroom a casual button up or two and a light sweater even in warm weather. If you dealt with air conditioning on Thai tourist busses youd know. If its cooler Ill take an extra sweater and a lined jacket I can use to layer. A bunch of quick drying underwear and socks duh.Then an outfit for sleeping that no one will see unless its an emergency its totally fine in USA to go to breakfast or walk around the hotel in pjs but frowned on outside of the country. For shoes I have a pair of casual Timberlands that are great for walking all day and look fine dressed up at night. If its longer than  a few days Ill take a pair of sneakers for walking around during the day. And I have travel slippers because most hotels dont provide them.Accessory wise I use a regular belt and keep a money belt under my pants. I keep most of my money and credit card inside of it. This has helped against pick pockets which are a common problem in Barcelona side note you may want to keep your phone inside of it too because those go missing all the time at common tourist areas in Barcelona. I also carry a Timbuk backpack because ballistic nylon is a pain for people that slice open bags.Ive done the whole travel pants thing and it is so overrated. Unless you are living out of  a L backpack for  months dont bother. Travel jeans seem cool but Id rather put that money to more traveling.,malefashionadvice,d760m5d,3,t5_2r65t

The  last from AE is narrow and not very tall and you wouldnt be the first person that it never fit right on. You might want to look at shoes in the  last such as the rogue you previously tried. It is a wider and taller last and you will probably find that it fits better overall.

Lot C was quickly relisted after the end of the auction. By looking at the winning bidder for Lot C I noticed that he only bids on items listed by one seller. On ebay both seller and buyer are anonymized but you can see whether a buyer is bidding on different sellers or just one. Then I looked at the other lots and saw that Mr. Bidder raised the price on lots A and D as well. Clearly shill bidding. Should I report it? Thing is Id still like to win relisted lot C and Id like to receive my items A and B. I dont want to report this seller if it will result in my not getting my items.

There are definitely styles that cater to certain body types like SLPs Heroin Chic Rick Owens Working out is modern couture Techwears hyperathleticism and so on. Theres an inspiration album in the sidebar for Big Boys that displays a wide amount of styles. The WAYWT threads have a diverse amount of posters. But theres also a recurring thread about fitness hair care and skincare. If fashion was exclusively about clothing why would we have this thread?

Kind of gnarly and I dont want to walk around like that for the week since I have to shave my head for a preop.Second issue is that Ive never been bald I was born a ton of hair. Not only that Im going to end up with some big scars and I was hoping to wear a hat for a while after surgery until my hair regrows. And it it being winter I am fairly certain Im going to get a cold head.

It was this Burgundy flannel It was more like an OCBD in versatility and warmth than a thick casual flannel.gtToo bad to hear about the flannel though. Maybe I should not buy the slim and instead buy the tailored to adjust for shrinking? How much did your LE shirt shrink?You only need to do that if you plan on tumble drying it specifically on warm or high. I accidentally did it when my the flannel was already tight fitting so it became unwearable. Im not sure how much but maybe only half an inch in places.Ive been looking at lower end flannels too but too worried about fit to buy any to try. Im inbetween sizes at L.L. Bean based on the measurements they gave me and worried itll be the same with other traditional flannels.

9278036,0,t3_57heev,Hi there Your subscription model is certainly unique and I can see where it would provide an interesting service. As a longtime thrifter who is really fascinated by the thrift ecosystem eg. What is currently available in thrift stores what is the price difference between used and new and how did it get there? I assume your small size limits your ability to expand too much after all you can only have as many customers as you have thrifted items in the right sizes. I have been an avid thrifter started a blog about it which I maintained for a few years and have essentially been doing the same thing except Ive flipped on eBay or more often just put together for boxes or Reddit friends. While vintage items are obviously in vogue within a certain customer base since you are already scouring the thrifts what about the newer highend items you come across? For example there are tons of Brooks Brothers shirts out there waiting to be thrifted. Some are vintage which I love and some are basically new with tags which I also love. I will usually buy them in my size or on proxy if I know a friend would fit them. Do you pick up this stuff as well for your inventory or are you strictly focusing on vintage and rare items? As I write this I have a literal giant stack of high end clothes on my dresser destined for sale to others. Things like ties are genius because they are so plentiful and there are tons of vintage ones to be found. Ties have been one of the main things Ive collected heres a little album with some pics of my thrifted tie collection which is probably  vintage What I find hard for your concept though is something like a tweed jacket or a blazer which is an AMAZING item but hard to hook someone up with if you dont know their exact size and even then there is variance between brands cuts subjectivity etc.Perhaps Im ranting a little bit here but I just thought it would be interesting to pick your brain a little bit as we seem to share an interest with thrifting. ,malefashionadvice,d8s23hm,4,t5_2r65t

Navy is hard to beat amp easy to just throw on with almost any color slacks to dress it up a notch for more formal meetings.For accounting style work wear  Lands End is hard to beat.  I get a lot of my shirts there focusing on the Hyde Park OCBDs.  If you want to step up in quality try Brooks Brothers.  Ive worn LE chinos in the past and they were high quality.

9314334,0,t1_d8wn83v,Order of my personal preference for the XS sizesJCF gt J. Crew Mainline gt Uniqlo gt Old Navy gt Charles Tyrwhitt gt GAPJCF is unequivocally my favorite. For approximately  you get a very slim and soft OCBD in pleasing colors. The sleeves are a bit large and long on me though. I tend to get the sleeves shortened and back darts put in by a tailor to achieve the streamlined look that I love. So the total price ends up being about  per shirt but thats like the cheapest price Ive found for a perfect fitting and good feeling shirt.GAP is amazingly terrible! Their slim has SO much fabric in the back that I could have sworn it was a small sized regular fit shirt and the quality is on par with Uniqlo to boot. Seriously avoid GAP at all costs for shirts.If youd like to know about the middle tiered brands just let me know. Old Navy is surprisingly good by the way but it is longer than the others and requires the same tailoring as JCFs.Edit I switched my ranking of J. Crew Mainline from behind Old Navy to just behind JCF. I had a bad memory of Mainline not working for me but I just tried on the Oxford I have and it fits super well. I posted fit pics on another comment here so if anyone is curious check those out.,malefashionadvice,d8wnsmw,3,t5_2r65t

Im in my midtwenties and sometimes I wear chukkas and button downs sometimes I wear heavy boots and a waxed field jacket and sometimes I wear joggers and a tech bomber all depending on the weather and the days activities. My dad on the other hand is in his s and he almost exclusively wears fitted tshirts dark jeans chucks and a zip hoodie in his free time and looks great doing it. I dont think theres any reason to dress your age outside of a professional environment.

9810211,0,t1_damb5nl,Most raw denim is stiff when it arrives as it hasnt been excessively washed at the factory. When you start wearing new jeans youll have to break them in a little so they start stretching and flexing around your specific body shape. Over time they become stupidly comfortable. Ive literally slept in my Gustins and Iron Hearts because I forgot I was wearing jeans. gt I dont see how denim molds.Take a piece of cardboard and bend it around your leg. Keep doing this until it takes the shape of your leg. This is essentially how raw denim molds around you. Your standard Levis do the same thing but because theyve been washed a bunch theyre a lot softer when theyre new so you dont notice it as much.,malefashionadvice,dambhc1,6,t5_2r65t

The downside is exactly what you see in your photos any wrinkles that get pressed in are really pressed in.   How much starch to use is your own personal preference. The cleaners should be able to give you a finished shirt thats anywhere from zero starch to cardboard. They should ask you how you like your shirts but it seems like yours didnt. If youre not sure experimentget no starch in one batch then try heavy starch then back off until you find what you like. If youre not in a formal business like banking legal military or law enforcement you probably dont need anything more than light starch. ,malefashionadvice,dap7oyl,2,t5_2r65t

The not so good Id reckon thats a suit jacket and pairing it with chinos particularly brown khaki is a weird mix of formality levels. Most of the time a navy jacket designed to be worn separate is going to have gold buttons like your blazer or other details such as a less formal fabric. While its not the absolute worst thing you can do it is very beginner to wear a suit jacket as a cheap substitute for a sport coat.  In order words it will immediately jump out to anyone in the know as a rookie move.  Personally I am going to recommend a four in hand knot always instead of the knot you are using. This might seem like a minor thing but for the look you are going for Four in hand is the way to go. Especially for younger guys  large tie knots just come off as cringey. The smaller knots allow you to wear the tie without as much pretension. To explain it a different way I see tie large knots as a way of visually shouting HEY EVERYONE LOOK WHOSE WEARING A TIE!!! ARENT YOU ALL IMPRESSED!!?    On the contrary a smaller tie knot is less obnoxious and just blends into everything else without drawing undue attention. The shoes are meh here... Avoid anything that looks like square toe like the plague. Again  you are wearing black captoes with khakis  while these might look fine with a full navy suit job interview attire they look odd with the combo you have jarring formality problemLastly French cuffs  Only wear them with a suit if at all. They are the most formal type of shirt and just look out of place with anything short of a suit and in my opinion anything short of a tuxedo really. That is a nice shirt and will look great for formal wear in the future  but in terms of casual fits this would be vastly improved with an oxford shirt. Sunday  Overall much better  although would be TWICE as good with the four in hand tie knot instead of the larger half? windsor. Your blazer looks a bit on the boxy side and the shoulders look a little wide. You probably need to go down a size for a better fit. Sleeves are also about . too long.  Interesting tie... DNA?? But if you slapped a repp tie on this it would be very much up my alley.  Again  Spread collar shirt is on the very formal side.  Are you wearing this to work? Special events? A button down collar with a blazer is a fire combo so give some more of them a try to turn the formality down a notch. Again those are some pretty casual shoes to be wearing with a spread collar shirt and tie although I like the colorMonday  So  the formality clash here is the fleece vest combined with a very obviously dressy af shirt. Im also willing to bet at this point the tie isnt a requirement. Its a cool vest but would look a ton better with a casual buttondown like a tatersall or university stripe OXFORD cloth. Key word is oxford cause that sonofabitch better not be shiny if its a casual shirt. Pretty much in all cases is you are wearing casual stuff matte fabricsfinishes  are doing to be your friend.  Shoes arent bad but Id invest in some more casual shoes compared to captoes as captoes are some of the more formal shoes you can wear and it doesnt seem like you necesarially need them.General advice Since you are going to start wearing some button down collars make sure you dont get the kind that are too skimpy to wear with a tie. A solid pair of Penny loafers Bass Weejun Allen Edmonds in brown or burgundy will take you far. If you tell me more about your specific circumstances where you are wearing the stuff to work? school? shopping at Target? what you haveneed to add to your wardrobe I can probably give more specific advice tailored to your situation AND budget.  The good news is your trouser fits all seem pretty good and J crew is a great baseline level of quality to build nice combos around. Im really only trying to be constructive here in my feedback  these are all things that took me a long time to figure out for myself and as a result I feel so much more comfortable every time I walk out the door. Ill invite you to check out rNavyblazer Im a mod there  as I think it might be a good source of inspo for the look you are going for.

On the other hand in japanese sentences i like how the more complicated kanji are intertwined with simpler kana making the sentence have visual points of weight and interest. It is not only easier on the eyes but it also seems to me like it makes information flow into your head easier when reading since the kana are mostly particles conjunctions conjugation suffixes and so on whereas kanji are mostly nouns verbs and adjectives. Thus your eyes are naturally drawn to the most meaningful parts of the sentence.,malefashionadvice,dbli9vd,19,t5_2r65t

In that same example you could also wear pajamassweats to class and everyone would accept that. But when you remove the context and just look at the people in question the contrast is established.Its also important to remember that in certain environments what the majority wears is irrelevant to how appropriately dressed you are. If you go to a medical school interview and see  dudes all wearing a blazer boat shoes and their frattiest bowtie youre gonna look out of place in a suit but theyre gonna but underdressed for an occasion that calls for professional attire.Dont concern yourself with others.

I would recommend going to a local store that sells reasonably priced clothes  like Stein Mart if youre in US and get  simple dress shirts and a pair of black pants should be about  total. Explore the formal clothes. Get a feel for how shirts fit and the right sizes. Usually the employees there or other shoppers can help. You cant go wrong with some colors like white blue or simple stripes. Try some matches and see what looks good on you. I wont recommend going to a thrift store. New clothes have a certain feel to them and you dont have to knowledge to know whats worth nd hand and whats not. Wear those clothes for a week or two then come back and explore more.

10357002,0,t3_5ob3ql,The issue you usually run into with doing this is suit jackets tend to be made of a highgloss smooth texture and doesnt mesh with other clothes when orphaned. What I mean is that technically theres no difference between a sports coat and a suit jacket but in practise youll have a hard time wearing a suit jacket like a sports coat because it will usually be an oddly shiny formal looking piece of clothing next to your chinos. Two of the examples you posted would work well because theyre more casually textured tweed etc. Not so sure about the second example though. Happy to be corrected on the above. I know I cant wear my suit jackets with other clothes because it tends to look out of place.

That I dont have to take it off at all not even when I go to bed. I wear a watch a ring and a bracelet that I never remove. If I take it off for a reason Ill most likely forget to put it on that day and leave the house without it. Then again since yours is supposed to mean something and be about being mindfull of progress that may not apply. Actually having to put it on every morning before leaving the house might be what you are looking for. . That it is as flat as possible. Since I wear my watch on my left Ill wear bracelets on my right which is the hand I use to write. Admitedly I dont write much in my day to day life but having bracelets with portruding things like your previous design makes it unconformtable for things like typing into my computer. . That it is discrete. I dont want my bracelet to be the most flashy thing in my outfit. Id suggest one of the options you offered didnt have the red circle thingy or that it was black or grey instead of reddark red. Congrats on your entrepreneurship. I like your idea overall.

Clark investigated the shoes and learned that they had originally been commissioned to Cairo cobblers by South African soldiers whose oldmilitary issue boots had failed them out on the desert terrain. They wanted something that was both lightweight and grippy which led to creation of a boot with a suede upper on a crepe sole.    Jake Gallagher GQ August  ,malefashionadvice,dcryzog,126,t5_2r65t
10445905,0,t3_5pk5r5,Mostly a great post!There is a big difference here you dont address. Dressing up and dressing well are not the same thing. Ive found people mostly push back when one dresses up and not when people dress well at a particular level of formality.One other point  in the workplace it very much does matter what you wear and what people think about it. If youre that guy that always overdresses it will make you seem weird. If your style uses all the latest trends you may seem out of touch. Your outfit should rarely rarely be an object of conversation or note  chose those times well. It shouldnt matter but why invite the risk? ,malefashionadvice,dcs4nwz,5,t5_2r65t

I decided this year to get a decent wardrobe and doing so requires a lot of research and education as there is a lot of overpriced crap out there. Im on quite a steep learning curve.  Ive bought some things and returned even more. I found Peter Jackson to be quite good. Am I wrong?

Id say for up to around k for outerwear there will be a noticeable increase in quality as you go up in price range of course with diminishing returns towards the end.  People buy from brands that sell past that price range for a lot of reasons.  Luxury brands offer designs that are very recognizable and less subtle because they can get away with just selling a couple hundred of an item rather than thousands for someone like BR or Levis and often have a lot of heritage and prestige associated with the name.

10569281,0,t1_dd64ccj,It might have been hyperbolic on my end to call him a dick I get that hes a really busy guy. When I was in seventh or eighth grade I met him when he was promoting one of the books in the Percy Jackson series this was a couple years before the movie. I wanted well still want though Im older now and realize its a pipe dream to be a writer and asked if hed read one of my stories. Had it printed out and everything. He looked down at the story then back at me and said No I wont be able to do that. Then he turned and talked to another kid. I was crushed. But I realize that just because you write for kids talking with kids might not come easy. Weirdly enough two years back I ended up writing a pitch for a childrens series. I was given five weeks to prepare it by the publishing company and I missed the deadline but Im hoping to try again soon. So I guess the lesson learned is dont be discouraged and understand that your heroes are human even if they write about demigods. ,malefashionadvice,dd64zau,31,t5_2r65t

The ultra slims are the tightest pants I would ever wear yet somehow they are still comfy and feel good. The slim ones are way more fitting for an office sitting I would describe it as close to a pair of s but like x more comfortable.

Instead we would wear girl pants. If you got the right fit you wouldnt even be able to tell the difference.

10678839,0,t3_5sqhvg,On the most part the suit fits you quite well. Theres a nice but not generous drape on the body maybe the chest is a little too full and the taper is subtle which lends a masculine silhouette. A lot of suits nowadays are like muscle shirts and that totally compromises the structure of the garment. The taper is sharper on such suits as well which also leads to pulling at the button which is not a good sign at all. But yeah the divots look pretty bad. The shoulders of the suit extend your natural shoulder line and are noticeably higher as well cause of the padding. Im athletic as well and I stick to unpadded shoulders on suits as often as I can. Cause my traps add to the padding and raise my suit shoulders to the point where it looks unnatural.,malefashionadvice,ddhfwf1,1,t5_2r65t

10694202,0,t1_ddic95b,I did a write up on this in the What you probably shouldnt wear guide.Heres the excerpt. Black shirt and red tie.Dont be black shirt and red tie guy or red shirt and black tie guy. Understand that the issue isnt some intrinsic relationship between red and black that should be avoided. There are a lot of ways an outfit can use these colours to great effect. The issue is all those extremely saturated bold colours covering your entire body its eyewatering to behold. And often both the shirt and tie are high gloss or silk which makes it even more distracting. This is what that looks like one and twoIf you were really deadset on being black shirt red tie guy or vice versa you need to really think about the level of contrast here. Youd be better off with less bold solidcolour patterns. Try not to wear things where you have two or more colours fighting for visual dominance. Here is how you might do that See how it doesnt make you want to put on sunglasses like the other examples? The collective textured feel of the suit shirt and tie help break up the saturation so you dont have these pieces clashing against each other. Balance is important.,malefashionadvice,ddj104q,7,t5_2r65t

I only have  other hobby that requires a steady investment to maintain. I live with a roommate and have relatively low expenses. I eat in all but  nights per month and I try to avoid drinking as much as possible. I make sure to put money into savingsretirementinvestment accounts at the beginning of the month so Im able to spend the rest of my money haphazardly without going into debtmissing payment deadlines.I highly recommend the save firstspend second mentality. If youre going through the month spending then saving whatever remains youre going about saving money the wrong way. ,malefashionadvice,devoe54,4,t5_2r65t

11161788,0,t1_dex586o,Youre absolutely right  this line of thinking will be outdated especially as people in general have to work like actual physical toil far less than previous generations find did. Its the same thing with cowboys. I hate how flippantly that term is thrown around and I hate seeing little city girls running around in cowboy boots and people like Kid Rock calling themselves cowboys. I grew up on a cattle ranch and its fucking hard. Its all day every day hard work. You earn the term cowboy. Putting on a pair of boots and going to Western night at your local TGIFridays does not make you worthy of it. So its similar to me with appropriating the looks of people who bleed and sweat in that look to feed their families. Yes at the end of the day its just clothes and it doesnt take away from the hard work people do. I get that. But the lumberjack and workwear stuff on college kids and city people is just a costume.

For example if all of your peers wear sweatpants and hoodies then wearing leather boots slacks and an OCBD would be overdressed because youd look unfitting to your role.

11416196,0,t3_62w712,Do NOT go out and buy all of this stuff at once. If you purchase decent quality pieces and realize this isnt a style that you actually like then youve just wasted  on clothes you will hate wearing. Get a few basics like navy and tan chinos and a white and light blue OCBD and see if you like the style. Theres no point in going all out only to realize you hate your clothes and dont have the money to build a wardrobe you actually like. Just because this look is popular on MFA does not mean its how you should strive to dress.Check out the inspiration albums in the wiki and save pictures of outfits that you like. Use this to compile a personalized inspiration album and build your wardrobe based on the looks that you personally like the way you want to portray yourself and what is appropriate for your social situation I.e. Are you a student how should you dress at the office are you on the dating scene and hoping to attract certain kinds of people etc..Dont be afraid to be a little picky. Go shopping and try stuff on. A lot of stuff. Get used to the way different cuts of pants and shirts look on your body and the way they fit together. Keep in mind the way the clothes fit and how their colors work together in the album you put together. If you just grab a bunch of items off a list someone else gives you then you most likely wont end up happy with them.,malefashionadvice,dfq0j0r,5,t5_2r65t

11484854,0,t1_dfxo99w,Dont be condescending. Im taking issue with the idea that theres a universally agreedupon idea of what an adult dresses like. Style is dependent on so many factors as to render that sort of claim absolutely useless. A yearold male working as a tradesperson in the Midwest has a peer group and a culturallyacceptable style very different from a recent MBA grad working at the office of a bulgebracket firm in NYLondonetc. Both are adults. Both wear clothes. Both have different ideas of what constitutes adult dress what their budget might be for clothes what cultural role clothing plays etc. You cant pretend theres such a thing as a universal dress like an adult standard let alone what some might consider classic menswear. Classic menswear as a term reflects distinct class levels and cultural touchpoints. You cant pretend otherwise if you want to have a reasonable conversation. So when youre saying that someone should learn to dress like an adult whats really being said is dressing like an upper middle class to upper class white man. So yes I have a problem with the idea that classic menswear which is itself a pointlessly vague term reflects adult style cues because it carries with it significant cultural and class assumptions. OP is  and predominantly wears jeans and a tshirt. We know nothing about his line of work geographic location social scene etc. We have no idea what his needs are. Suggesting that he approach taking an interest in style as being about classic menswear is utterly absurd as we have no context for what OP is even interested in. Telling someone to get into classic menswear without enough information is as bad as telling someone who wants to dress better that they should just wear suits or blazers. ,malefashionadvice,dfxt1i6,3,t5_2r65t

11608188,0,t3_65m581,I wouldnt say one is better than the other. Its more about what youre going for.Personally I like the variety of cuts colors materials etc that owning clothes from many drifferent brands affords. I find that it allows me to put together more interesting combinations for outfits while still letting me have those goto outfits I wear most often.Now if I was going for a very basic uniformlike wardrobe I think going for all the same brand is a way to go. You could pretty easily make sure everything goes together and if you invested the money into it you could make sure all of your clothes are ethically produced or whatever other features matter to you that a certain brand offers. As for me dressing that way would get boring and possibly expensive. You also have to keep in mind that while a company may do one thing really well it probably falls flat in others. ,malefashionadvice,dgbsqrf,1,t5_2r65t

Get some dress shoes with minimal styling in brown or black that look like this and try to find a belt that approximately matches the colorNext get some dress pants with a non monochrome material in an off black sometimes called charcoal like thisThen get a dress shirt in any sort of blue patterned or not anything that speaks to youBoom. Youve got a conservative job interview friendly outfit. Just make sure it isnt super baggy and you should be good. Try not to spend a lot of money on it because it sounds like you dont know how much use youll get out of it. Maybe go to marshalls or tj maxx or whatever its called where you live But more to the point why are you so worried about this? Is it the spending money aspect of it? Or is it the getting out and dealing with people part? If its the first doing some reading and getting expertise will slowly help you gain confidence in your spending. If its the second just know that no one is going to watch you and keenly judge you as much as you think. And retail people are going to be helpful and nice because its their job. All you have to do is look a bit confused for a second and someone will be on it. Then all you have to do is ask for a changeroom. Easy peasy,malefashionadvice,dgfbc65,8,t5_2r65t

People are either mad because of capitalism or mad that they dont have the money to spend on that sort of thing or just mad at its existence and that people buy it. Things like bags from unfamiliar brands are seen as particularly frivolous compared to say a Rolex submariner. People are less aware of this history or simply dont care.

11715577,0,t1_dgnv0ru,. Do you mean the seam that goes around the arm? If so the shoulder seam should sit atop the shoulder bone. It should not pucker. Image. A little. Some suits have some fabric that can be let out in the stomach but only about an inch or two. Cheaper suits usually have none. The fit in the shoulders and chest effectively cannot be tailored. It would cost more than the suit itself and most tailors wont do it because at that point it makes more sense to just make you a whole new suit from scratch.. I dont know this one.. Zara and other fast fashion places just make terrible fitting suits. They try to get all trendy but it just looks bad. A suit should fit like a suit plain and simple. That said I cannot make a knowledgeable recommendation in that price range. Ive heard of Combatent Gentlemen and Indocihino but have no experience and little knowledge of either company.. Uniqlo has great price to quality ratio but their fits tend to be for short and slim guys. ,malefashionadvice,dgnzn5r,1,t5_2r65t

Shoes have a low vamp i.e. they dont sit too high on your foot loafers have a low vamp compared to formal oxfords . Colours complement in the instance of salmon shots you want want something toned down and not much colour to counterbalance a relatively colourful short id probably recommend a white button down untucked with shorts or t shirt. Also be aware of the preppy connotations of salmon shorts. Also dont let people like your GFs friend knock your confidence clothing doesnt really matter unless its an interview or a funeral and you mustnt like nasty remarks get to you best just to ignore them. Im the kind of person that cares a lot about clothes but id never judge someone and insult them for how they dressed after all literally the only thing you can tell about someone from their clothes is how they dress which is very much a minor thing in the grand scheme of life. ,malefashionadvice,dgwr92y,8,t5_2r65t
