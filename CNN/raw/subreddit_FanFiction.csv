145527,0,t1_cemeqi9,I agree that a lot of it also depends on personal preference especially the shows and movies that one likes.  Thatll ultimately determine whether or not someone will even try to read a crossover fanfic or bypass it all together.One crossover that Ive been in the process of writing is A Twist In Time which blends Quantum Leap with the ATeam.  Sam Leaps into a member of the ATeam and has to prevent a terrible tragedy from taking place while also trying to keep a former team member safe who has returned to enlist their help.,FanFiction,cev08yl,2,t5_2r5kb

1110163,0,t3_26qulv,I was totally hoping Chrono from Chronotrigger was going to be time would have fit really well. This is a really cool idea and great for a crossover. There would have to be an overall theme to the story though like everyone must be from a Nintendo game or a certain style of gaming in order for it to work properly. I hate crossovers where the characters would literally have no reason to interact with one another even if their worlds were just suddenly thrown together. Then again thats just me.Link Kirby or MegamanX would be my vote for Unity. I mean Link and Kirby can talk they dont have to be silent the whole time...or they could be silent and that would add charm to the storychallenge the writer. All three characters have a means to travel between worlds and would be good as the hero. They all have access to different elements including time through one mean or another.Spyro could be the fire element although I havent played one of his games in a long long time. Tidus from FFX could be good for the water element. Water plays a huge part in Final Fantasy X which would allow him to be in charge of that. He is sort of used to being thrown into different worlds. Yuna would also work as well her aeons would add a certain flair to the story. Could even copy Kingdom hearts a bit and allow her to summon people from different worlds.Edit added extra elemental ideas,FanFiction,chuhf6m,2,t5_2r5kb

2084803,0,t3_2irgyd,My fave is the one that almost everyone in my fandom hates. At least judging by the kudoshit ratio which is comically terrible. The story is my version of omega!verse which came about after having a discussionargument with a friend over how ABO is both appealing and appalling. The thing that bugged me about most ABO stories is how the omega males are clearly standins for females complete with pregnancy supposed biological drive to breedtake care of children weepy emotions societal discrimination etc. But nobody will just come out and say theyve turned their male characters into females because genderbending is weird and psychologically icky. So in my story I made up this whole alternative biology where everyone is a hermaphrodite with the same genitalia and theres a slight difference in bonding between the omegas female pronouns and alphas male pronouns but most of the gender difference is constructed by culture.So theres a lot to dislike here. The story is pretty AU to the point of practically being original fiction. The genderbent pronouns for multiple characters are hard to wrap your brain around. Theres a BDSM element to both squick the vanilla readers and annoy the kinksters since there are major consent issues imbedded in this society. Lets just say I think AUBDSM will inevitably result in a harsh and fundamentally horrible culture because true consent becomes impossible. But I still LOVE the story. I love having made up a brandnew internally consistent biology and alternate Earth. This is the longest story Ive planned out in advance and stuck to my plan which has benefited the structure of the story and developing characterization I think. Its about  done but I WILL complete it in the next month or so to the enjoyment of the  or so people who like it lol.Switch Rated ENC READ THE TAGS,FanFiction,cl4toib,5,t5_2r5kb

2243364,0,t3_2kuyhd,I can tell you what I have in my app which is in progress for almost huh... eight months now.  it can store stories offline for later reading it can update stories stored it has browser for ff.net categoriesstoriesauthor you can read the story inside app. It keeps track of where you are in story my favorite feature you can export story as epub to read it out of the appTo be honest every time I get back to developing something on it I just fiddle with little things and end up not doing anything. It all comes back to the way I show the story inside app. I just cant find good way to present story for reading.I have it in webview with paged scrolling with jumping between chapters and page count and stuff but with longer stories k words it starts to get slow  sec when opening story for reading. I had high hopes for wkwebview when they announced it for ios but it didnt speed up the loading process at all.Since then every time I get to it I just get to the reader view and it just cant compare with what iBooks have and I just give up on it again.Dont get me wrong I have been using the app almost daily since I finished the epub exporting part. When I get update I find the story in app update it and depending on chapter length I read it in it or export it to iBooks.I have been working on login and wanted to do some stuff with following  favoriting and stuff but I dont have time right now. I also wanted to figure out a way to get push notifications on story update. I have created a mailservice that you can forward mails from ff.net and it will send you push notification with story update details. I also built something that check Just In section and can notify you if update is there. Both of these works but it just isnt solid solution for production app as I would have to host them somewhere for other people.I would also like night mode in the future.I can get you some screenshots if you are interested but it is far from finished.,FanFiction,clozgao,8,t5_2r5kb
2329928,0,t1_clzmob9,Well no response yet.Some new site would be great but if you check some threads around here about which page people prefer ff.net or ao the opinions differ. And you cant even take what people like from both of them because some people like some features that others hate.Im not the one for reviews or commenting but I always thought it would be cool if there would be fanart section for fanfics right there by the story. But that would make it extremely expensive relative to only hosting text.I dont know about taking comments offline that seems a bit counterproductive.When I thought about new site it wasnt place to create communities but rather a place to publish a story in neat clean format. Focus would be on the reading experience first community and feedback second.Each story would have its own page. Author could not customize it see what they do when they can on tumblr P. People would break the reading experience. More like give story a title image maybe pick your storys main color or some kind of color scheme and leave the rest to us. The story page then would be customized by readers preferences such as font font size line spacing darklight theme column width etc. Pretty much what ff.net allows.Stories would be marked by rating and there would be some system flags for sexviolence differentiation of why story is rated M.I would love a search by characters based on ! notation. Such as you could select character first and then select the attribute if you want. Also stories would have type mark for AU mAU or such. Again it could be done with modern!AU or vampire!AU or whatever. But for this I would need to consult people who read fiction longer than me.It would have social features in the form of links to authors tumblr or facebook or whatever. They could even link to ff.net and ao profiles. But there would be no comments on the site itself. Maybe reviews but not the style of ff.net but real reviews like when you read review about a book. Longer and redacted by story author or staff. Maybe reviews only on complete stories?As I mentioned there would be galleries for fanart with links to original author or some place to write who the author is. It would probably not be a one gallery but images would somehow be linked to parts of stories so authors can show relevant images in the text. Then when you are reading the story you would get these images there in the text if you would like to see images inline. Maybe it could be not limited to images only there could be relevant music linked to certain parts of the story. Or just link to a song per chapter I dont know.There would probably be categories and search and tagging or something. There would be updates feed etc. There would probably be some kind of story promotion on frontpage. Something along the lines Picked by staff or Popular this week.Of course there would be option to download story as ebook or plain text. There would probably be mobile apps for reading offline.Oh and there would be option for authors to join stories into series like when there is sequel or prequel or side stories. These series would have their own pages with some short info or something.Overall it would be place for stories or dribbles where author gave a bit more thought to it and want to display it just a little bit nicer then on pastebin for people to read.Oh well. It would be so amazing. It all sounds amazing in my head P Now I only need someone to create such thing.Edit sorry for that spam I kind of got carried away P,FanFiction,clzox66,2,t5_2r5kb

2838329,0,t1_cnqmxl4,Wait...You mean you actually LIKED my last message?You actually thought what I wrote made sense.To say Im surprised would be an understatement.I really do feel like I was pulling that whole message from my ass.You know how sometimes you talk to people and you try to sound like you know what the hell youre talking about but you really dont? Basically youre just pretending like you do so you wont look like a dumbass?Yeah that was my whole message in a nutshell.I didnt know how to answer the questions so I made up bullshit and tried to make it sound like I knew what I was talking about.  PI wasnt proud of it thats why I confessed it at the end of the message.I cant believe I faked it so much I actually sold it to you!Thats kinda scary....Kinda makes me feel like I manipulated you or something lolI hope thats not what I did. You do sound like you genuinely liked what I wrote. I mean I guess making up bullshit is something that I can do because well...Im a writer? P But everytime I read my last message it just sounds so pretentious and fake because I KNOW I made it up on the spot and pulled my answers out of my ass.And you really think what I wrote not only makes sense but is an integral part of their characters?Wow...I really dont get that. Anyway I have a few concerns. You didnt answer any of the questions I asked in the BDSM section. I understand if you have to research it but just reminding you that the BDSM questions are still unanswered. You asked if Harry were to be trying to keep Hermione say would he not be defiant towards Tom? I think Tom would try and make this a thing. Like if you want  to set up in BDSM style he would be convinced that because Harry wants to keep his friend safe...Tom would try to make him into a sex slave. He would have rules on ok Im going to see you at this time of night or meet me here and well have sex or you will allow me into the dorm room without making a fuss...you know Tom would take advantage of the situation with all this. And I think Harry is too independent. He hates Toms guts and having to obey him would be too much. AN d maybe that would result in punishment. in BDSM style Just a random I idea I admit I pulled that out of my ass again...so sorry if it doesnt make sense just trying to answer your question.. You asked about wouldnt Slug Horn know about the Love Potion? Im thinking maybe Slughorn knows Harry is under a Love Potion but he doesnt believe Tom did it? And it could be a prime example of how stupidly loyal he is to his star student Tom that a  year old boy could be under a love potion calling tom riddle name every second and Slughorn still stays loyal to his star student refusing to accept that he could be a pedophile. And of course Tom would be there with every excuse in the book on why he didnt give  year old boy a love potion and why its a clear mistake etc. if he can even make it convincing it would be a testament of him being a Master at Manipulation. In my mind Im thinking it could be a battle of wits between Tom and Hermione...Hermione gives reason why Tom did give Harry a love potion then Tom completely destroys all of them and Slughorn dubs him the winner. Well there it is Miss Granger Tom did not poison your friend with Love Potion. I daresay youre too bright of a witch to defame the reputation of a prefect. . I was wondering if you could tell me how to author of Words Fail established her setting? You seem to be a lot more insightful about this. Frankly I have no clue what you mean by  setting because there isnt much of a setting in my story anyway...I mean its Hogwarts... everything mainly just takes place in a school. Thats the setting. lol. But what I noticed about Words Fail is that even though the setting is a  Hogwarts you really believed it was  and I dont know HOW she did that. I asked you to tell me because you said you were into history and such. I thought you would be able to pick apart what she did for .. Good point. Dumbledore would not stand for the prejudice at Hogwarts. Maybe he would be the only teacher who is trying to help the situation? And Harry and Hermione desperately wish everyone will listen to him and stop bullying Hermione. But even if its Dumbledore he is still only one teacher. I reckon most of the students will only obey him when hes near. Like a class only keeps quiet when until the teacher leaves the room. Then anything could take place.We both know Hogwarts is wild with prejudice. And in  prejudice probably went a lot deeper than simply calling someone a Mudblood. Tom himself actually killed Myrtle and was planning to kill even more Mudbloods. The prejudice ran that deep for a lot of students. I dont think even Dumbledore can stop it. Much like he didnt stop Malfoy form bullying Hermione...the problem Im having is ways to portray the Mudblood prejudice. Any ideas on how bad it could get? I want to parallel it to almost when people for being a certain race were often tortured nearly to death and barely make it out alive. Im also wondering would all of the students doing this be Slytherin? or other houses? I really need your help with all that. So if you can provide some historical references or wizard references to Mudblood prejudice or whatever or just ideas...that answer my concerns that would be greatAnyway um...yeah I can try to research who people were at  at Hogwarts. You can research BDSM.In the meantime...can you please start another different topic? Im still trying to look at this fanfic with new eyes. And even though I managed to make up bullshit and get away with it..I dont really see the fanfic with new eyes. Unless you count the BDSM part. But as far as the story...it all seems the same to me. Its weird but even though I can come up with new ideas on the spot like in my last message I dont really believe anything I wrote. I really want to discuss this in a way that will help me to look at this whole thing in new eyes. So if you have any different topics or different aspects of the story that would be great. And if you have any more questions Ill try and answer them without making bullshit up. Frankly Im not satisfied with any of the answers I gave you before.While well researching Id like to keep this discussion moving. So new topic new questions...all different material. ,FanFiction,cnqpqct,1,t5_2r5kb
2841017,0,t3_2sljzq,I think its really annoying to read a highly reviewedrated fic and realize theres no beginning middle and end. Its just like their story is a garden thats growing and expanding. And the author has nothing heshe is really pushing the characters towards ... there was no planning on the front end. I think the author doesnt understand that they have to conclude the story one day. And then that this mess theyve created will not be so fun to tie neatly up. So they tend to abandon the fic write a shitty ending or end up writing blog post after blog post of A and Bs adventures. ,FanFiction,cnr0rgt,2,t5_2r5kb
2850721,0,t3_2sljzq,Huge unnecessary ANs especially those ones where the author writes a conversation between themselves and a character or two characters.I only know of one author that does this NeonZangetsu but when the same AN is used every chapter and the new things he wants to write are just added to the end after what he added for the previous chapter. When authors that write animemanga stories use common Japanese words for that fandom incorrectly. Most Japanese should be left out because obviously were not reading in Japanese but some just really fit in well with how popular they are and its really jarring when theyre left out or not used at all.When children speak like adults.ANs in the middle of a chapter.When sequels are given summaries. Because of the way fanfiction is its pretty common to come across a sequel first read the summary and have the story completely spoiled. The worst thing is that its not necessary or something difficult to avoid. People arent going to read a sequel if they havent read the first one and if they liked the first well enough to read the second they dont need a summary to entice them. If the author really feels they need a summary its not difficult to write Sequel to such and such. Summary inside.When authors put the names or links to songs they want you to listen to while reading in the middle of a chapter. Aragon Potter does this and it makes his already horrible story worse.Short chapters under k words. I dont think Ive ever read a story with such short chapters that I could really get in to.Over a month between updates. I can understand why some authors do this they just dont have time but its a rare story that sticks out enough that I can maintain any enthusiasm for it and really differentiate it from all the other stories after a month. Its especially annoying when authors post super long chapters because if they had split that up and posted in sections they would have been able to write fast enough to keep the story interesting.,FanFiction,cns4kfp,2,t5_2r5kb

4013427,0,t3_36ergp,Just out of curiosity I looked up how many fics on AO are greater than k. Its currently  out of  works or . of fics. Only  works are over a million. Im sure there are more magnum opuses over on FFN but still only a minority get up to novel length. A commercial novel is usually at least K btw.You should write whatever length you feel comfortable writing. Some people are naturally more verbiose. Some people enjoy writing meandering epics that may or may not have much of an internal structure. But there are other factors at play  what sort of stories do you want to tell? A lot of them dont require K to competently tell at all. How much time do you have to write or how fast a writer are you? Im slow for instance and K represents an entire months worth of output. So I could spend months doing nothing but a single story or I could break it up over different fandoms characters etc. If I were super obsessed with a single story stuck in my head I might be willing to do the former but right now its more fun to do fic exchanges and kink meme prompts and slowly chip off some novellas in the time left over.So if your natural length is say K and you have full plotlines and complete story arcs Id say thats great! Nothing wrong with that. To go for longer fics try stringing together multiple of the shorter fics each expanding on the story told in the last. For example my longest story currently at K is four consecutive novellas each focusing on different characters and with different themes and plot arcs. Or take one of your standard story arcs and make it more complicated  set your characters someplace that requires a lot of worldbuilding or tackle multiple relationships or plots in the same story. Or when you come to the place that seems like the logical stopping part ask yourself what next? and indeed keep going.,FanFiction,crdrfh8,5,t5_2r5kb

4967132,0,t3_3iv170,Gaaaaaaaah my favourite one is probably a crossover idea I had for Professor Layton and Lyrical Nanoha crossover idea I had a few years back. I got as far as establishing main conflict and coming up with backstories for all the main characters but before I could figure out the plot the final Professor Layton game happened and retconned the entire basis I was working the story off of. I took most of the plot elements that I liked and transferred them over to a TorikoLyrical Nanoha crossover in the end but Im still sad I never got to write mage Layton with a rapier for a Device Im usually very good at making ideas fit into stories like... usually Ill just expand the story until I have everything lining up and maybe change the order of stuff to make it make sense. The one time I remember not being able to do was in one of my Basara fics where the main and secondary antagonist switch priorities when the main antagonist gets seduced into pursuing a villain vs villain with another antagonist. I just... couldnt get it to gel it wouldve required for me to rewrite the conclusion the main antagonist eventually switches sides or ignore some really nice character development Id already given him and essentially destroy the positive relationship he was building with one of the protagonists.,FanFiction,cukn80d,2,t5_2r5kb

5687146,0,t3_3ssy63, Would anyone have any tips on how to remain motivated and push through this Writers block?Start small perhaps? Dont dive straight into the Lord of the Rings . epic thats dancing around in your head.Write a small selfcontained story only a few pages long. You can build up your own little metauniverse by stringing together dozens of shorter stories that can either be read as individual or a prequelsequel to stories youve written in the past.Alternatively whenever you run into the writers block give that idiot my regards BTW write down what WILL NOT happen next. Will they not get attacked by hippos with lightsabers? Alright write it down and move on to the next item on your list. Failing that I am also curious if anyone here would be willing to take requests and write fics for me?It depends largely on the fandom but generally speaking yeah Id like to give it a try  assuming Im familiar with the fandom.

Feeling threatened by it or wanting to quit because I am not at that level yet? Heck no!      That is what has gotten me into writing in the first place. Hearing  Reading great stories that leave a lasting impression and are just so wonderfully written. Those ones that still up all kinds of emotions in the reader and that linger long after youve finished... I love reading those and I want to write those as well. I want to send my readers on a roalercoster of emotions and I want to be able to have other writers take something from my work with them on their own writing path.       If anything those stories are what inspire me to write. Especially in FanFiction. I love them and I want to read more of them. And if no one else is telling that one story that I really want to read then that just means that I have to write it and tell it as best as I can.       One of my all tiem favourite books Die Stadt der Trumenden Bcher cant remember what the title was translated into in the english version actually adressed this and its really well done.

Is it intentional on their part or are they being imprisoned somehow? You could reveal this backstory and how it continues to impede the present plot over the course of this story.The inciting event for this story perhaps the nonpowered characters encounter some kind of Big Bad or amorphous universeending threat that humanity cant solve quickly enough on its own although it is developing countermeasures which will introduce plot complications later yummy! so the various nonpowered characters band together to try to track down the League members and convince them to help?These nonpowered characters each have different sorts of relationships with the missing League members interpersonal feuds perhaps stemming from the event in the past that scattered the League members across the universe? and perhaps reasons to make it difficult to find the League members that they each have connections to.All kinds of great drama possible with this premise!So if its your premise why not try writing it yourself?

Yeah and what of it? Is it off the charts? Yup. At least the first draft... I mean holy shit and the one I published can also need some work so much that I consider doing a revised edition once Im done. Best counter argument to Mary Sue is to make the character compelling At the end of the day though what matters is a simple question am I having fun?

6956727,0,t3_4aznj4,I write an expanded universe Divergent Veronica Roth. I really didnt buy her plot too much but there were so many aspects of the society politically speaking that was just... untapped potential. Using the faction systems and basis for the aptitudes as well as a few other canon details like a walled city last survivors after the collapse of civilization. If anyone is interested in it its called MUTINY! and right now Im putting it on tumblr as I write but edited versions will be on FFN in order I write out of order so I put up my early versions on tumblr until theres enough to string together into a coherent order. I have an outline too so theres that. My story takes place in Washington DC instead of Chicago and it has a different origin story than the series i.e its not canon Allegiant. Harry Potter is another expanded universe that works well. Magical schools in other locations. I used to write a lot of Triwizard fanfic that had nothing to do with the main characters  all original characters. Fleshed out the details of Durmstrang Beauxbatons. I even found Durmstrang a map. Not to mention American versions of magical schools for the Potterverse. Twilight surprising lends itself well to an expanded universe. Vampires who feed on animal blood is an interesting touch even if sparkling was a bad one. But thats not the EU part  each of the Cullens have an interesting backstory if its known. Alice in a mental institution maybe I made that up Jaspers Confederate vampire days Id totally read some Confederate vampire stories Edward was turned at the the turn of the th century. Rosalies stories. Theres a lot of history from the vampire side. The Volturi are interesting and untapped in the universe. And then the tribe that can shapeshift? What if there are other tribes that shapeshift in different animals in response to vampires? Native american shapeshifter lore gimme. Are there any current fanfiction out there that meets these? Yeah but its going be tough. Look for fanfics with original characters to start with. Its touch and go though and I personally enjoy expanded universe type fanfiction myself  the least amount of canon characters save for like some obvious fixtures like professors in the HP world or Cullens if youre not replacing them.,FanFiction,d14vncy,8,t5_2r5kb

7530037,0,t3_4igys4,I try to write in all person perspectives I can try but the easiest for me is the overtheshoulder rd person angle. This takes the form of me sticking to one character for a chapter and following mostly what he sees and his thoughts about it while giving the audience the full  degrees of the world. With this perspective I tend to be a lot more descriptive of actions and reactions the small details in people actions along with some sort possible explanation onto why said action was taken. Its not very well done but my writing still tends to rely a lot on action and description of said actions as I am a firm practitioner of the Actions gt Words which is actually a lot harder t pull in writing. I wish I could have a more fluid writing style. When I reread my own work most of the time it feels jilted and choppy.

Since much of the story is set immediately before during and after WWI I couldnt exactly change the main timeline no matter what the characters do with their personal lives WWI is a massive fixed point and its going to go down the way it goes down.But keep the story fresh perhaps by showing the events from different perspectives.

Its one screen. No doc manager. No pic manager. Just a rich text box and a few options at the top. It is SO easy to the point where when I tried cross posting to FF.net I was instantly put off.The other is along the lines of what you mentioned. The interaction is so much easier in that it has a comments section. You get comments delivered to your inbox and you can reply and they can reply and it all accumulates at the bottom of each chapter. Its my favorite thing about AO.BUT you only get out what you put in. I reply to every single comment I get and Ive had some amazing and touching and fun conversations with readers. My fic will wind up pushing a thousand comments by the time its done because I am super encouraging of everyone who replies and the readers just wanna talk! So its not guaranteed to be any better standard of comment but you can definitely create your own culture of replies by being active in your own comments section. I love it. So much better than FF.nets review system.

Im not sure what this has to do with the topic though.See this is why youre wrong.You can also kill a man for being straight and it would be a hate crime just the same. And these actions are equally repugnant. Claiming otherwise would diminish the value of the life of the straight person. They should be equal.Does this happen a lot? No but that is not the point.

All must be equal for better or worse.If people want to turn gay characters straight in their stories you get to criticize it and people get to be offended but nobody gets to make them stop.

Had him tell a joke and her laugh about it and him feeling a little better about himself.Ive had characters bond because she was so messed up she couldnt move. He wrapped her wounds he washed her. He clothed her and fed her. That intimacy brought them a lot closer than any amount of talking would have ever. Its really all rather individual.Pretty sure Sherlock wouldnt bond easily with someone during some nonsensical raucous festivities. For him itd take time and patience with his person much like Watson seeing him for the human that he is.,FanFiction,d4ge846,3,t5_2r5kb

Even when Im not so confident with my writing I know the write up is going to be more exciting than that vague idea I had at the beginning. I can have this idea down so I can later read or improve on it. If its not something personal the excitement of posting it for others to read drives me too.I know what you mean about having so many things to do. I try not to stress myself too much on finishing something by a certain time because then its no longer fun. Going back to write something when Ive missed it is much more satisfying.,FanFiction,d4hob44,5,t5_2r5kb

Ive spent hours reading through letters. Research doesnt bother me. and everything to do with plausibility with characters people want to write. If I want to write something with say Angelica Schuyler and Hercules Mulligan my options are limited because they have no direct interaction in the musical and historically theres no direct link either. And so long as people consider how the setting changes a character there are enough people who want to read both modern and canon era things.

8506046,0,t1_d648h6e,gt legally they are obligated to do in order to maintain said copyrightThats a fairly common misconception but incorrect. There is absolutely no legal obligation. Being lenient with regards to protecting it could result in lower damages being awarded if the copyright holder ever decided to go after an infringer but there is literally no way that the copyright holder would outright lose the copyright through any failure to protect it. A trademark could technically be lost if it isnt protected but even so there are very few instances of that sort of thing actually happening either.gt So while the work may have been plagarised even taken wholesale from another writers work the original content is copyrighted to the original creator. Thus legally as the fic wasnt intended to infringe the original copyright the fanfic writer has no legal standing honestly I am surprised a lawyer took the case but then again grey area.gtIs it possible the author still plagarised without infringing on an existing copyright? Absolutely. Is that a case for a court? No. Plagarism in and of itself is not a crime but a moral failing kinda like adultury.Plagiarism on the massive scale described here   words in one book  is absolutely copyright infringement. If it was possible for the socalled author to pull an E.L. James of that scale while essentially just changing the fandomrelated names when necessary the real author had obviously written a large amount of original copyrighted work that could stand alone outside the fandom for which it was initially written. If it was legal for E.L. James to remove the Twilight references from her fanfics and publish them as widely released books then its illegal for someone to remove the references from someone elses fanfic and publish it as a widely released book without permission anyway.,FanFiction,d64t6xm,3,t5_2r5kb
8506448,0,t1_d64uhob,gt My HP fic is fair use and tranformative work of said copyright. But as it is someone elses intellectual property I dont have a copyright on it.I dont know what fics youve written so I cant make any sort of statement as to the likelihood of them being considered fair use and so on but these statements are mutually exclusive. Either the fic isnt fair use  transformative not all fanfics would probably be considered to meet the criteria or you do have the copyright on it. Depending on the circumstances you dont necessarily have to have the copyright to all elements of a work devoid of context in order to have a copyright on a full work that includes these elements in a specific context. It isnt really the best analogy since its a different type of fair use but for example a documentary is legally allowed to directly use copyrighted clips from a news source or a movie for educational  informative purposes and while the documentary creators dont own the copyright to the clips out of context they do own the copyright on the film as a whole which includes the clips in context. Similarly and if fair use requirements are otherwise satisfied a fanfic author could theoretically have the copyright on his or her fanfic itself including all of the characters and so on without having the copyrights to the fandomrelated characters out of the specific context in which he or she has written them. And that sort of leads me into the point that Im actually trying to make...gt Her characters and setting had to be able to exist outside the Twilight world when she sought to make a profit from it.This is exactly what Im saying about the case described in the article. If  words could be lifted from the fic and used in a published work the characters and setting obviously were original and able to exist outside Harry Potters world. It was significantly transformative to be its own work  the fact that some of the characters had the names of characters from Harry Potter was just a technicality and the fanfic author did own the copyright to the work  a copyright that could thus be infringed by the published author who changed the character names and released the book himself without the permission of the real author. gt in order to determine if they infringed a copyright the original owner would have to sue... and if they are published their book likely stands on its own outside the original work...regardless of where the actual words were stolen from.Im assuming that by both uses of they you mean the author who plagiarized the fanfic authors work and that by original work you mean the Harry Potter series in this case but it wouldnt make sense for J.K. Rowling to go after the published author as the judge who dismissed the case suggested because there arent any explicitly HarryPotterrelated elements left  the fanfic author is the only one whose work was infringed and the only way that Rowling could make any connection between the published book and the Harry Potter series at all would be by pointing to the fanfic authors work which presumably aside from certain names and perhaps minor references could stand on its own. If Rowling pressed the case for some reason anyway and lost as I believe would be pretty much guaranteed to happen it would only confirm that the fanfic author was indeed the one who owned the copyright to the plagiarized work.TLDR If you can change minor things in a fanfic such as names and otherwise have an original work then you own the copyright to that work regardless of the fact that its a fanfic...and that copyright can be infringed.,FanFiction,d64v0cv,3,t5_2r5kb

Its always hard for me to ship Superman with anyone because of Lois I may not think shes a very interesting choice for him but shes there nonetheless.Hmmm I have to plug Unprettys Sorrowful and Immaculate Hearts oneshots. The author has them organized as a series on AO but all stand alone. Christmas in Kansas is BatmanWonder Woman one WW makes a few appearances in other ones and Empty Graves is one of the most remarkable fics I have ever read. Its just incredible. If you like DCU you can DEVOUR these fics.An Unusual Mission is an oldie  I see yowza where does the time go?! but goodie. It just satisfies if you like the characters of Bruce and Diana and want to see how two people so oddly unsuited to romance could become romantic.And right now I am reading Lazaretto and enjoying it. It does not have that breathtaking quality of Unprettys work but it keeps the spirit of the animated series while also hitting an interesting plot idea. Its working for me.Sadly one of my favorite authors just pulled a straight up vanishing act. I loved their work  even did Wonder Woman meta. But it is totally gone.

9005873,0,t3_53m2lg,I think what you are talking about here is what most people call head hopping. Youre not maintaining a single POV but moving between the different characters in the scene and that can be incredibly frustrating to try and keep up with. Personally Im not a big fan of seeing it done. I believe in rd Person Limited being contained to one POV by section with clear indication on where we are moving into the next POV.And usually I prefer the individual sections to be fairly long and in my own writing try to pick whichever I believe gives the most value to a particular scene preferably with only one or two POV changes by chapter.  That is totally personal taste though. Ive tried to do quicker changes as well in particular in my latest chapter so you can see an example on how Id do POV changes to get into two characters heads at around the same time.

I mean I GET IT you like putting yourself into a story by making an OC based off of yourself but when you give your OC superpowers and the ability to transform into Satima from OPM in every battle with no character to back it up you failed as a writer.The whole purpose of writing is to captivate a writers imagination with the sheer ability to provoke expression through the power of words. The evil spork as powerful as it may be doesnt have any power to move an audience the way a protagonist should.

10008332,0,t1_dbbwjte,linkffnDeath Game? by Tigersight is pretty good. It doesnt focus on Kirito at all instead starring some pretty decent OCs Fraternal twins who due to a combination of the sisters good luck and the PoV brothers bad luck won copies of SAO were busy for several hours before they could actually log on didnt see any news broadcasts at all during that time and logged in to find everyone freaking out for some reason. Also they both hit random during character creation due to being overwhelmed by the options neither of them have ever really played video games before and wind up looking like identical twin girls. Since they logged in after the tutorial this is not reverted and its an actual issue the brother deals with. Has wellwritten characters with dynamic relationships.linkffnFairy Dance of Death by Catsy is alright. ALO is launched first and becomes a death game and only the first race to reach the top of Yggdrasil and two other races of their choice will be able to log out. Thus factions and PvP are much much more of a factor than in SAO.linkffnBand of Brothers by Stormbreaker is another that doesnt focus on Kirito. The premise isnt as interesting as Death Game? but from what I remember it was pretty good.linkffnNeon Rain by Shinobi no Ryu is another differentdeathgame fic. This time GGO is the death game and its the winners of a tournament with randomly determined teams that goes free. This means the players cant really form a unified front but nor can they form distinct alliances since anyone could be forced to fight anyone.linkffnSwords of the Living Dead by nanaya features an entirely new death game. SLD is set in a sprawling city filled with the undead and fallen players spawn undead mobs that share their appearance stats and gear. The general structure is more similar to SAO than the other differentdeathgame fics I mentioned since all players have the unifying goal of clearing districts without some twist to force them to compete. Still the games undead horror theme feels very different from SAOs fantasy theme.,FanFiction,dbc44c5,1,t5_2r5kb

If this guy went to engineering college there is now way he didnt know this.This goes for the whole argument. If anyone publishes anything online they cant just go I changed my mind please everyone delete the stuff. It just doesnt work like that.Sure it is a dick move to rehost something but you cant blame anyone for archiving public stuff.

After EL James a lot of fans have wisened up more to exploitative behavior as well and are less likely to throw their support behind a book they know to be PP certainly not without some sort of longstanding involvement with the fandom on the part of the author.

10547108,0,t3_5r15bz,My first and pretty much only advise is going to be By having fun.There are a few people here who write for small fandoms wheras small means the source material hasnt spawned a lot of fan works. Some of them draw from a great deal of background and lore while others might be based on a barebone concept.And then comes a fan or maybe a handful and pick up on that and make it more. Thats basically what you are doing  Pick your story line. You seem to have an idea for that already or have at least decided to create your own. This is likely going to be the biggest effort dependend on how easy it is for you to plot out your content. After youve plotted you can start dividing it into arcs and chapters and youll figure out how long your story might be. Is it just going to be a oneshot? Or will it be multichapter? Dont worry about how many words youll stick together though Id suggest to start breaking it into chapters once you break past the k mark. Mostly because for reader comforts. And those chapters can k each or k each or k plus k theres no rule. Post! Cross Post! Advertise! Fan Fiction.Net is a good choice. Ao Archive of our Own as well. Theres also WattPad but I know nothing about it. Use Tumblr? Advertise there if you want.  Stay in touch D Were decent. ,FanFiction,dd3ms89,1,t5_2r5kb

10778392,0,t3_5u6dlx,Im actually fairly new at writing sustained stories usually I go for short little drabbles. So far Ive found that planning everything has really helped me stay on track.I start by just writing down everything that I want to happen as it comes to me as well as taking notes about certain events and characters. I find I have better ideas if I just let it flow rather than trying to make it come out in chronological order. I then make a list of  key events that I want to happen in a separate section. Then I can start slotting in my first round of ideas between the key points. An optional final step is to roughly divide the ideas into chapters so you then have a goal for each chapter as you write them. This isnt always necessary though. I think if you have a clear aim written down then you can always be working towards it and the storyline is consistent.,FanFiction,ddrpoj0,3,t5_2r5kb

I thought I was missing something like a reference to the books or something so I looked it up and good god the queerbaiting shitstorm. I have no idea how people can deny it. Either they plan on Sherlock and John ending up together later on or theyve been joking about the idea of two men being in a relationship. I hate the argument were people say that theyre just friends and that people are just sexualizing or romanticizing a close male brotherfriendship.

11256815,0,t1_df7v0cc, smooth going! I do occasionally get a little stalled but I usually take that as a sign that Im writing the wrong thing  not approaching an event in the right way not being true to the characters personality introducing a side plot that just doesnt belong there stuff like that. Whenever that happens I remove the section Im struggling with and if I think some of it is salvageable  like if it has some nice dialogue or descriptions  then I store it in a deleted scenes file which itself is over k words long. I then rewrite the section in a way that fits better and that generally gets me going again. I can write up to k words a day when Im really going for it.Because theres so much of it I have to regularly go back and reread it so as to fix the unintentional continuity errors. Usually every  weeks I go back through the whole thing to do minor edits. At the moment Im rewriting the first three chapters because the next part of the plot deals heavily with the main characters backstory which Ive fleshed out a lot since I first started writing. So the first few chapters have needed complete rewrites. The extra k I just added to the story happened because chapters  are going to end up more like chapters .

11386559,0,t1_dfmhaq6,Archive is probably more immersive.  Sounds good to me! Between you and I...I totally didnt mark it as a crossover.  I mean its listed in the Fallout  fandom with a Titanfall photo but its not tagged as a crossover.  I broke the rules I know.  sobs Ive been in the discord once or twice pretty much just to say hi a few times and then I get off.  I have it linked with my WoW guilds discord and I cant get on without getting a thousand messages to heal a raid.  l  Maybe Ill make a new one.  But thank you! Ill make sure to say hi if I get on D My name is the same as on here.  How exciting! ,FanFiction,dfmnb2f,1,t5_2r5kb

11500604,0,t3_645goa,Theres a few ways you could set this scene up for it not to only be cohesive but powerful as well. Like you said you want the Pokemon to come to terms with itself and thats all well and good but the problem is with how?Perhaps its trainer has a bit of a breakdown and it realizes how important hisher feelings and input is giving it closure if you would and allowing it to evolve. Perhaps it doesnt come out until the very last second and the sight or I guess rather the implication the K.Od Pokemon would be in their Poke Balls wouldnt they? riles it up into an uncontrollable rage. At that point  either the trainer could help it get its head back together allowing it to evolve or it evolves in its rage then the trainer helps it. Of course that would be more coming to terms because of evolution but I digress. Hell you could even have it get its rear utterly handed to it then after a bit of Pokesulking the trainer andor the other Pokemon on the team helps cheer it up and evolve Going back and getting revenge on Steelix optional.As for other things you could look at to draw inspiration...you kinda got me there. Im sure theres plenty of moments in the anime that would help you out but none come to mind immediately although I havent watched it in years so that could be why. As a reader I would only call it rushed if there was absolutely no build up or foreshadowing to it whatsoever. As long as it feels like there was enough lead up whatever you decide to go with should suffice.Hope I could help at least a little bit.,FanFiction,dfzlddb,1,t5_2r5kb

11572360,0,t3_653tfm,gtfanfictions are all twisted love tales written by teenagers.Im going to step in and defend twisted love tales written by teenagers.  The implication is that writing noromo adventure and wishfulfillment stories based on videogames are just fine even if the writer is a teen.Teenagers write fics for all sorts of reasons but self  wishfulfillment romance is one of them.  Theres nothing wrong with that.  They do it for selfactualization for exploring their own sexuality.  Virtually everyone is a crap writer when they start out especially inexperienced people who havent had years of academic writing or personal journaling under their belt.  Teens are learning and educational psychology will tell you that people learn way faster and more thoroughly when they use subject matter they care about.If some teens care about twisted love tales and romance thats what motivates them.  Theres nothing wrong with twisted stories or love or romance and writers dont have to apologize for it.,FanFiction,dg7qecm,7,t5_2r5kb
11587779,0,t3_657lxr,I think RPF can turn into a huge fucked up mess but it doesnt have to. I only read one RPF fic and the writer managed to make it feel right by basically turning them into characters. I dont know how to explain it properly it felt more like characters heavily based on real people instead of a fantasy about real people. And I think you should keep RPF as far away from the people involved as possible. Especially if there are children involved. ,FanFiction,dg9hd2x,1,t5_2r5kb

11728013,0,t3_67a3x4,Im kind of lazy with planning. I go chapter by chapter bullet points about the main scenesaction under each. If its a longer fic I separate it into main parts where theres a bigger arc. I dont have all of the story planned out when I outline I just know the basics of how I want to it to end. Normally Ill plan ahead one section at a time. If there are canon elements I need to work in and add to future chapters Ill put a note about them in the chapters where I think theyre most likely to end up since I often have to shift things around as I write. Its not the greatest method and I feel my writing has definitely suffered from not sitting down to make a really thorough outline but its just kinda how I roll.,FanFiction,dgpefvy,1,t5_2r5kb

11768446,0,t1_dgtw211,gt It might be that she feels like she doesnt have anyone except you to talk with about her writing. Tumblr is one of the main fandom hubs online currently but theres a backlash against underage relationship fics going on in many fandoms right now that has even gone so far as doxxing some people who write them. She might feel unsafe talking about it in her online life and want to discuss it with somebody she trusts. If thats the case encourage her to find a more supportive community. Fantastic advice. Fans who have interests that most consider to be problematic often find themselves the victims of harassment bullying abuse etc. It makes fandom an incredibly uncomfortable and unsafe space for lots of people. Your wife might be seeking something from yousuch as acceptancethat she isnt able to get from fandom. And perhaps thats why she persists in talking about her interests with you despite how they personally make you feel. She might be hoping that shell be able to talk you around and make you interested in what shes interested in so you can be for her what fandom currently isnt. The only way to get to the bottom of it all is by having a long inthorough discussion with her. ,FanFiction,dgtzft3,9,t5_2r5kb
