8123912,0,t1_d4s64wa,With The Walking Dead items sold by the same company if some things dont sell out Skybound releases them on their website after a couple of weeks. But Im not sure yet how many of these for SAGA are available for sale at SDCC. If the number available is too little then they will sell out during SDCC. I go to SDCC and it is an extremely competitive environment for getting exclusives. And this will be a HIGHLY DESIRABLE item!!! They might be gone very quickly. What I dont like is that they are bought by resellers who are NOT fans and NOT collectors just so they can scam us by doubling or tripling the price. Both the OP here and I are being down voted over on the comic con sub for even talking about trying to bring some of these out and passing them on to fans. So trying for exclusives can be brutal. Whether or not there will be any left to be sold to the general public on the Skybound website is hard to tell.,SAGAcomic,d4t78aj,3,t5_2vehh

Because what we really need is to have another awesome female character experience some kind of brutal sexual assault.
