But remember its volumetric flow rate so you could take the crosssection of the boat tail and multiply by the vehicle speed to get a rough estimate of the flow rate needed to fill in the wake. ,ThermalPerformance,cmkbp2d,2,t5_30vu0
5880806,0,t3_3vfuuj,You may have some luck starting with a classic head loss model but inputting the correct steam conditions with the two  degree turns for the k values. Since the conditions are variable with pressure they wont be exact but it will give you a ball park range. You can then take the output conditions and a steam table to find the temperature loss related to the pipe loss. Regarding the general rules to follow I dont know if Ive seen anything to consider but I may not be as well versed in this area as I should be. Hope this helps.,ThermalPerformance,cxqi8h6,1,t5_30vu0
