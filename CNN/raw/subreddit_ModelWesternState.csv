We have no desire to hide our intention and I apologize if it appeared otherwise to you.We believe that it is important to ensure that our own voice is heard loudest in the State Supreme Court as the voters delivered us a clear mandate to do so but we also believe that it is important to allow other voices to be heard as they often have valuable input a conference room you see is much more valuable than an echo chamber which is why the Governor in his wisdom is offering one seat to our conservative friends in the Republican Party and one seat to our friends across the aisle in the Democratic Party.,ModelWesternState,cu5pg7f,3,t5_37x1l

5963736,0,t1_cy1d6mp, is a majority.  Western State shouldnt take the votes of other states into account when assigning electors.  Also the idea of doing this with state level bills that can be reneged on by a state rather than a national amendment wasnt very brilliant.Instead of trying to convince states to voluntarily agree to give up their power unless they go back on ityou might find that trying to get a constitutional amendment where states would assign electors based on the proportion of votes for each canidate in their state might be easier for people to agree to.,ModelWesternState,cy1dki1,1,t5_37x1l

At the very least it would seem to beg having the condition of permanence.That issue is simply one illustration of what I find disturbing in legislation like this.  Life does not lose its inviolability once it is touched by pain or disability.

8402098,0,t1_d5rd5ul,What this amendment does is it allows for very selective use of affirmative action to allow for some more diversity where universities in particular are lacking. The state of California is only  white nonhispanic yet UCBerkeley has  of people from otherwise underrepresented groups.The aims are not for total affirmative action or forced state affirmative action but when we are seeing that we dont have enough diversity in education and certain employment and the place diagnoses that as a problem we should be able to alleviate that. Current constitution does not do that.And there is no reinstatement of affirmative action it is not forced in any way it just allows for a limited use of it. When all else is equal and the place has affirmative action they should be able to have a policy of deciding who gets in in that instance.,ModelWesternState,d5rt47f,1,t5_37x1l
