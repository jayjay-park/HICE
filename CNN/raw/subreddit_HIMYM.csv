Hes almost lost several serious girlfriends including Robin in part  of the proposal episode because of his schemes.

209421,0,t1_cf2a7uq,It also attributes this to the fact that Ted is actually just as unavailable as Robin right now. Hes been in love with her since he first saw her at MacLarens in  and thats why he wasnt able to MARRY VICTORIA she was the only reason remember that he was all up for it except for Robin and Ted has to earn his happy ending by letting go of ALL of the feelings he has for Robin. Just like Florentino should have let go of his obsession with Fermina from Love in the Time of Cholera or Ted and Robin will have to wait until the end of their days to forgive themselves for screwing Robin over. Literally everything falls apart if TedRobin end up together.At the same time The Mother is also at the same problem with her life right now because she has to let go of Max. If she cant do this then she and Ted will never end up together.Everything has to go right and the beautiful thing about the way the writers wrote this show is that we already know it will. Its a show about destiny and we know what will happen. Just like the old episode The Window Ted and The Mother will both be open at the right place and the right time. While Maggies love was old love that was the second best love story because as Barney says new love is always better.Ted and The Mother will have to build their new love and by doing so theyre going to help each other get over their exes because the most important fact is that they wont be able to do it alone just like they think they have to right now.Thats why Robin was so important to introduce in Season  and why it was important to have Max introduced in HYMMM.Just like Stella said I know that you are tired of waiting and you may have to wait a little while more but shes on her way Ted. And shes getting here as fast as she can.,HIMYM,cf2ap0g,34,t5_2rcqy

They will talk about it and Ted will move on right as the sun rises.,HIMYM,cf2f4bh,5,t5_2rcqy

Screw the fans. Its an injustice to the entire story in terms of how the characters have progressed.Character development is important when telling a story especially when the story spans a long period of time and focuses predominantly on a specific characters emotional journey. Who you are at the beginning of your story is never who you are at the end of it.Ted going back to Robin basically goes against how much his character has developed since the beginning of the series.

568788,0,t3_20i20e,Okay. I dont really have a guess for the Barney picture but heres what my gut told me about the TedRobin picture.I almost feel like the TedRobin picture takes place at the same timeish as Vesuvius so around . I dont really remember what clothes Ted is wearing in Vesuvius but it looks like it could be taking place the same dayweekend. Maybe CampC will give us more details or clues as to what is going on during Vesuvius such as why Ted and the mother are there what that conversation was about etc. Its possible that in the case that Barney and Robin divorce not saying I think that will happen just exploring all possibilitiescommon theories she runs into Ted or makes plans to catch up with him and possibly Marshall Lily and the mother and breaks the news. In that case Teds concerned look can be explained by the love he has for both Robin AND Barney and that he is worried about his lifelong friends. The other way around Ted could also be bringing bad news to Robin and she isnt sure what to expect yet. TLDR I just think that the TedRobin scene is going to take place around the same time as  and will give us a little more insight into the mystery of itmake this sub go even more crazy.,HIMYM,cg4xd1s,1,t5_2rcqy
569796,0,t3_20ieqc,If the mother dies AND Ted ends up with Robin. When I started watching the show I wanted Ted to end up with Robin for some reason. But as the show progressed I accepted the fact that it wasnt going to happen and eventually got over it much like Ted got over Robin after she floated awayhaha. Now I dont even like them together and would be really pissed off if that was end game. The Ted and Robin thing really taught me a lesson about one of my relationships and the whole point of it is about letting people go and he did. You cant just let a person go and then go back to them after your wife dies. It wouldnt ruin the show if the mother died though. Dont get me wrong. I dont want that to happen and would be really depressed but I would have a lot of respect for the writers if they did do that. People really want a perfect ending but the writers would be showing us that life doesnt work that way and stuff happens. I dont think theyll kill her off though.,HIMYM,cg51hd2,5,t5_2rcqy

572463,0,t1_cg581si,I sometimes feel that way about the show. But what helps me and has helped me for the past few years is that all of my past failed relationships are kind of like Teds. Not everyone is like MarshallLily and gets it right on the first round.Ted went through some crazy shit being left at the alter cheating on a girl with who he thought was the girl of his dreams seeing said girl marry one of this best friends being so lonely on many nights like robots vs wrestlers.I think the most valuable thing the show has given me is perspective. Almost everyone goes through dating years in their adult life and things go wrong. Things can even go wrong after you think you found the one. Its a hard knocks life. But this all was secondary to the story of Ted living his life. Not every epiosde was about Teds relationships. Thats not how life really is. Most nights of the week I am just with my friends and not even worrying about my last relationship or even my future one.So I guess my point is that the show has given me the value of persistance dedication laughter and knowledge that no matter how down and out you are you may just be  seasons away from the love of your life ,HIMYM,cg5ce41,8,t5_2rcqy

I dont know if he says anything to her at the wedding or not but I dont expect he will. She arrives there before he notices her. Hes reading a book. Im half expecting a delay of the trains arrival allowing him to have time to get to know her. Either that or they sit together on the train.

Theyve established with Symphony of Illumination that talking with your imaginary kids is a metaphor for selfreflection and Ted is a bit more...loquacious...that Robin when telling stories as it is. If this is true then the show really is about the very moment where Ted reflects on his journey and becomes ready to meet The Mother. He only just proved he really had moved on from Robin in the last episode. The discussion with his imaginary kids and the entire series is when everything finally clicks into place for him. Poetic and utterly beautiful. ,HIMYM,cgfj4k7,8,t5_2rcqy

Go marry Aunt Robin and make her our new mother!What the fuck?! I may warm up to it a bit more but my initial reaction was that the ending fucking blew. The whole show kind of seems a bit pointless now that we know it ends that way. Some of my favorite endings were the one where Ted walks out of the bar and into the sea of yellow umbrellas. Thats pointless now. The ending where we see the mothers face for the first time and Simple Song is playing. Thats pointless now. The  days speech is pointless now.Wow. Fuck that shit. I was one of the people who thought that the show completely fell off the rails over the past couple of seasons and I actually enjoyed this season for the most part and thought it was redeeming but now thats all for naught.EDIT Not to mention the  episodes of buildup to Barney and Robins wedding and they get divorced in ten fucking minutes and Robin ends up with Ted in the end. ,HIMYM,cggys23,4,t5_2rcqy

Thats what was so great about the ideaand the promiseof the Mother.  Thats what made this a hopeful show.  Ted knew and viewers knew that we has going to find his one.  As much as I hate it I can accept the fact that maybe Barney and Robin didnt make it to forever.  I can even accept that the Mother dies.  But to put Ted right back where he started  seasons agoliterally outside Robins door with a blue french hornit invalidates everything that the characters believed and worked for and everything that we as viewers were promised. ,HIMYM,cgh0us6,73,t5_2rcqy

The scene was set in  and she dies in . So it could have been that he was crying because he knew she would never see their daughters wedding rather than that the conversation never really happened.

676932,0,t3_21vp62,So basically the final episode was the TLDR?,HIMYM,cgh7u7w,1,t5_2rcqy
676989,1,t1_cgh2vwx,you need to calm down and stop dealing in absolutes.. just because they choose to break up one couple or use a relationship dynamic in one location doesnt mean they have to use it everywhere. different people have different thoughts and perspectives and in virtue of that love and express that love differently and have differing values and actions which are produced from the changing points in their lives in relation to the person with which they are in a relationship with. I mean it sounds like an obvious concept it is but you have to understand that there are in fact real relationships like lily and marshalls as well as there are events such as barney and robins and ted and robins. Watch When harry met sally its a GREAT movie I like to call it A Guys chickflick because its so counter to the broad picture of Romcoms and you see a kind of example of what they were going for in the sense of real world relationship possibilities. We can also further this discussion by going back to your point about ted and robin not being as compatible as ted and tracy... if you do any love research you see that opinions are really split on birds of a feather fly together which suggests similar people fall in love or are great friendscompanion love and Opposites attract which suggests what it says different people can appreciate each other for how unique their point of view is from their own. My own response to the shows ending stems from the fact that ted and robin never got together because robin wasnt ready to commit and ted was. Fast forward years later and Ted has the kids he always wanted and robin is accomplished in her career. they both achieved the things they wanted and by the end it seems there are no issues in their love. of course you can say that I am here just suggesting that Tracy is then just a baby factory on the road to robin but if you think about the show as a whole and as love itself it doesnt really seem to matter... Love is love. noone knows how long love lasts or will stay. this video helps a little explain  Although WE see the show as oh this should have happened or this or this you have to see the show in the way the writers are trying to present their work. In the show according to the last episode since episode  Ted was telling this story because he wanted to date robin so you have to see the entirety as an awkward way in which he is attempting to honor tracy but also suggest this new life for himself in a way that his kids will be okay with it seeing that now she is the love of his life. I mean theres a lot to the ending and I can see why people hate it but I actually felt very satisfied with it. ,HIMYM,cgh82mc,-1,t5_2rcqy

677090,0,t1_cgh740g,I feel like I want to add Lawyered to the end of your argument lol.  Im not the guy you were responding to but that was solid reasoning good sir and exactly how I feel as well about this finale. You just said it a little more eloquently than I might have. You know I think about the episode How Your Mother Met Me and how we saw her perspective over the years of their key moments together and I just want to bask in how amazing that episode turned out. For me that was the standout episode of the season. The writers were able to create a full episode from Tracys eyes and I was so happy about where the season was going at that point. Theres a reason that is the highest ranked imdb episode of the season. We finally were approaching that coveted moment where we had our two main characters come together. I havent been this frustrated over a finale since Dexter. Dexter was kinda doomed already at that point though. Here they had all the time in the world to wrap things up in a way we could totally connect with. I havent connected with TedRobin in years why would they come back to this! Is it because they filmed those scenes so far in advance with the kids and needed to stick with it? Could they not have brought those actors back? Lyndsey was on Nikita but that is over now she would have had time. I wouldnt have cared if they had aged a bit since we only get brief glimpses of them anyway. Im going to bed feeling jipped and frustrated but maybe after a couple days Ill calm down and move on. ,HIMYM,cgh8hii,4,t5_2rcqy

I am not saying youre just complaining because you bring up some valid points that I do tend to agree with but still. Everyone wants their own perfect ending and if it had ended with and that kids is how I met your mother I think people would have been all Wah why didnt they do anything with the ending they just dropped it off the way we exactly expected it to with its fairytale ending!I agree the BarneyRobin wedding was totally drawn out and unnecessary. Maybe their marriage shouldnt have happened. I certainly never thought their relationship seemed very natural.

680534,0,t1_cghlfis,If they wanted to sell us that hes grieved and got past and that Robin changed and is ready they needed to delve deeper into that  years between   .  They never did.  What they DID do is constantly bang our head with the message Robin and Ted are incompatible you dunces!  Theyre tots over each other.And the kids are an extension of the audience.  Its a simple plot device to move the story along without breaking the fourth wall.  Its the reason why they stop having their own dialogue after season . Its why they wear the same clothes everytime save the pilot where they had something different on.  If you were to believe its a man telling his kids all these stories he should be brought up on child endangerment charges.  The show even did a spoof of them bringing in the  actors who portrayed the children for the season  premier announcement.

685487,0,t1_cgi58hi,gt ever ever a fan of Ted and Robin together at all I hated all the scenes where their romance came back and i absolutly frekin love Tracy. But given what happened to Ted and Tracy. I belive Robin is the perfect girl for Ted in  because noone else can understand exatly what Ted have been through as well as her.gt Robin showed many signs that she actually rather wanted Ted than Barney I think she channged ALOT for barney and she ended up becoming someone she was not which probably made her subcounciously choose work over Barney.I get that she wants Ted through signs but most of the story up to that point showed that just cause you want someone doesnt mean you are right for someone. It takes hardwork and compromise. I just dont buy that she would change for Ted. How did she changed for barney? I cannot recall such moments  it might help me process the ending. same for hints of wanting Ted. In No Tomorrow it seemed that Robin didnt take the chance given. She only ends up loving him in a fragile emotional state which doesnt seem all that great. I dont think Ted needs to end up with anyone to not live in the past.

But the pacing of the finale was so bad that it made it incredibly difficult to appreciate the story. We really needed A little more time to soak in the moment when Ted meets the mother this is the best thing I like about the recut ending thats quite popular Something a little earlier in the finale or season reminding us why Ted and Robin might work Something to dispel the notion that Ted didnt truly lovejust settled for Tracy andor was always pining for Robin Something to ease in the idea that Ted has grieved and is ready to move on from the love of his life to something newTheres no doubt in my mind that Ted loved Tracy and grieved for her the series really shows that. But this did not come across in the finale. And likewise the show has tried so hard since the end of season  to crush the idea of Ted and Robin being together that its almost impossible to imagine them being good together. Its not enough for the kids to remark that they connect well over dinner every week we need to see that connection and it just didnt come across in the finale.

698496,0,t1_cgjn0ii,There are two interpretations of the purpose of these scenes. They were meant to show that Ted and Robin still had a connection and should have ended up together all along. They were meant to show that Ted really needed to put Robin behind him and that until he did he could never have been ready to meet and truly love TracyI personally think  is by far the likelier and better interpretation but because of the finales hamhanded editing it seems like a lot of people both finale haters and finale lovers are going for interpretation .,HIMYM,cgjo6or,28,t5_2rcqy

763383,0,t1_cgqqafu,Im sorry I just dont think writing a show which conforms to a preset ending with hints literally sprinkled over nine years to get us to that ending is what Id call lazy.And I certainly wouldnt call it predictable at least not until after Vesuvius when they damn near hit us over the head with it. Ill be interested to hear the DVD commentary about why they made it so obvious. Even Radnor said its not like the fans cracked some code that it was supposed to be easy to pick up on. But prior to that and Time Travelers nobody was really predicting the mother would be dead.And you and I will have to disagree on the quality of the show over the past couple of years. I hated that it basically became the Barney and Robin show. But Im willing to accept that those seasons may play differently now knowing what happens in the end.,HIMYM,cgr1wjx,3,t5_2rcqy

779556,0,t3_232whl,Raining symbolizes relationships in the show. Ted had to make it rain to get together with Robin he had to force it it was never natural kind of like how the Blue French Horn was never theirs it was the restaurants. It was already raining when Ted and Tracy met their romance bloomed immediately and even though Ted was moving to Chicago and Tracy wasnt quite over Max their connection was perfect and they just knew it was time to say to hell with everything working against them lets give this relationship a shot it was the most natural thing in the world. and their meeting was completely intertwined with the Yellow Umbrella which is created for rain and naturally pops into Teds life when he needs it. For Barney and Robin its a little trickier. It only rains when the two characters are not together but theres always this huge romantic tension between them. They keep fighting their love for each other but the rain tells them to just give in to stop fighting and just be in love with each other like we all know they are. In HIMYM the universe is always controlling rain as a way to fuel their relationships it kind of represents love itself its very beautiful when you think about it.TLDR I dont have a damn clue what rain symbolizes in HIMYM,HIMYM,cgsw13h,17,t5_2rcqy

Season  seemed like it was just reinforcing everything and that they were truly working together and were in a great relationship.

S i thought they were going to shift gears and bring it back oldschool where its actually Ted on a journey at Barney amp Robins wedding.  Instead its mopey Ted in the background while Barney and Robin are shoved down our throats about how perfect the are for each other finished their sentences at the same time awwwwwwwwww.  Even the damned finale...i said it in another post but...gtthe whole explanation of the mother dying takes less time than Barneys initial announcement that he knocked up some girl.

1837474,0,t3_2fluaa,Okay so obviously the original ending put me into a rage and this is much nicerfluffy and Im happy.But hold on what are we supposed to make of the Time Travelers scene and the scene with Ted and Tracy at dinner?I originally accepted that Tracy can die because it was emotional and brought so much fucking life to those scenes and you feel this sense of love and crushed at the same time would have appreciated some kind of montage or something but Im trying to compromise here. Its good to feel. Obviously thats where I wanted it to end though. The writers would have gotten what they wanted and we would be sadappreciative but not pissed.But anyways back to my question... Now that she didnt die what do those scenes mean now?,HIMYM,ckam1g0,8,t5_2rcqy

1844566,0,t1_ckar276,Id just like to throw in to the anecdotal observation you put in in the end Ive been with my partner since i was  now  i loved the original ending. You see in these  years weve had way more shit than most people would get thrown at us from  years old my partner shattered her ankle and was unable to work for two years the places i worked kept going bust we just couldnt get a break to start a life together outside of our parents houses. All we talked about was getting out and starting a family two kids of our own and a dog that was the only plan we needed.  A few months after my partner did her ankle we had a miscarriage possibly through the stress of the ankle we dont know but it takes everything i have to not let her blame herself. Cut forward about six months Ive got a nice high paying job things are looking up we have a second miscarriage this time the only possible reason is Fuck us thats why a month later job goes to shit and Im back out of work. Not much longer after that my partner was pregnant again two months later miscarriage. We went to the doctors who began doing tests who all the same said to keep trying this went on until about a year ago no pregnancy during this time we finally found out that there is now absolutely no chance for us to get pregnant naturally its impossible our only choice is IVF something that only has a  chance at a live birth we now have a better chance of never having a baby then we do actually having one and its the only thing we wanted. Due to problems with the mail we didnt get a letter we needed to reply to we got discharged from the IVF clinic which means its now going to be damn near impossible to get back in. Cut to May this year were both working we finally have the money to get our own place which at  is far too fucking late as Im concerned i dont care if the government says thats when you should so we find a nice little house in an ideal location and we move in just us and our little Jack Russell Stormageddon i got to name him everything is finally looking up. I had a pain in my hip for a while turns out a disc in my spine is fucked its crushing nerves in my back and Im in constant agony i cant work cant even get out of bed with out my pain killers we barely have the money for the house anymore and were not entitled to any help Im having to slowly sell everything i own just to afford the tablets i need to walk more than ten feet at a time this is in England where we have free health care so luckily it will get sorted eventually but wont be until next year. The way i see it lifes fucked you dont always get what you want what your ideal journey and end is going to be instead you take whats thrown at you and just carry on thats what the original ending showed. I think with your observation it points out more of each persons view on life the ones in a relationship are feeling pretty good and want a nice happy ending for everything while the ones who are single probably want a happy ending with someone and are thinking it isnt going to happen theyre the ones who dont see everything as sugar and unicorn farts and can relate more to the original. Thats how i see it my life has had a lot of shit and the original seems more true to life than the alternative and i prefer it that way. ,HIMYM,ckbgsex,2,t5_2rcqy

I watched that whole damn thing and imagined what it would look like if they actually showed just that. Despite a few lines of dialogue that Im glad they changed and Tracys last name which Im also glad they changed this has to be the perfect finale.I liked the one that they aired and the alternate ending was actually very well done.

2951545,0,t3_2txl9a,I still agree with these review of Sepinwall of the finale the bottom line of which is if this was the ending they had in mind for such a long time they did an incredibly poor job of setting it up properly.The whole episode felt rushed after spending an entire season on a weekend they crammed  years in  minutes undoing things they took entire season to develop.Also my favorite jokeTo be fair How I Ignored Several Years of Character Development Because I Was Completely Tied to a NowNonsensical Ending We Filmed Years Ago Before Any of Said Character Development Occurred is a really long name for a TV show.,HIMYM,co3lrq7,10,t5_2rcqy
2952210,0,t1_co3it5l,What about the kids drawings or Ted mentioning to the kids that you know how your aunt Robin loves Halloween always dressing up in crazy costumes? Stuff like that is peppered throughout the show. We never see those scenes firsthand but it more than implies that Robin spends more time with Ted and the kids than what we see. It would be nice to see these scenes but we dont need to see them.The deleted scene gives us insight into Robins state of mind but I wouldnt label it as miserable. Lonely maybe. But not miserable.Family vs career has been a running theme for Robins character. It may not be brought up every season but the conflict was always there. Part of the reason she and Barney divorced was because she thought she could have both but their relationship was doomed from the start. Again we have to read between the lines here. Despite Barneys newfound honesty with her at the wedding its clear that both of them keep things to themselves. They still lie maybe not to each other but to themselves. Barney in particular thinks hes cool with not having kids with Robin but the show practically smashed us in the face with a hammer telling us how much he loves them. Theres no way that wasnt bothering him deep down and it probably played a factor in their divorce. Thats why it didnt seem contrived to me at all.It comes down to examining what we know about the characters from nine seasons and using what we know to guide us through what little we get to see in the last two episodes. I would liked to have seen more. I wanted like twelve more seasons. But those years are not part of Teds story. Its unsatisfying yes but thats part of what makes it a beautiful ending to me.,HIMYM,co3ohsr,3,t5_2rcqy

3394171,0,t1_cpeswy0,Oh theres an article floating around that mentions a lot of the stuff you said  and I definitely agree there are similarities. I just feel that a lot of it boils down to sitcom cliches as opposed to being a rip off. Both shows ran for slightly too long and the characters boiled into parodies of themselves to some extent. So once these characters are developed theres not many options for them to go. We either get off episodes that arent referenced again or go in circles person loses job gets new job person A goes back to person B for a while etc.The context is so radically different between the shows probably to make up for the fact that they have similar dynamics. Like Ross is a guy who married young and is proud of his PHD  accomplishments whereas Ted played the field and was more average. Both have passion in their field which isnt unique or nerdy  ChandlerMarshall got mocked when they talked about work stuff too. Ross is reuniting with someone hes had a crush on for years so his first love. Ted is trying to chase the one and get a fairy tale ending. Ted winds up with Robin as an afterthought when hes a widow whereas RossRachel had a baby together and clear feelings throughout the show. Even that initial breakup is totally different  jealousy  sex with another woman as opposed to a semi amiable breakup bc they were two people who wanted different things. Another thing that falls into the category is RossTed both start off as teachers in the relationship as well  Ross teaches Rachel how to survive on her own like do laundry etc and Ted teaches Robin how to be in her first serious relationship.Marshall makes puns and is very lovable but hes nowhere near as cynical or sarcastic as Chandler. They both had polar opposite upbringings and dilemmas. Its totally opposite sides of the spectrum in terms of humor. And Chandler can flirt whereas Marshall and Ross cant. Eh Lily baked and made Thanksgiving dinners but that was just bc they needed someone to get the gang together for holiday dinners and stuff. Its not something unique to her character whereas Monica is literally a chef. She got really disciplined after losing weight and became super organized and is super competitive something Lily always thought was immature.Also Friends was much more on point with recurring charactersguest stars. HIMYM was smaller and a more self contained universe.Basically I feel like sit coms are very formulaic and theyre the same show bc the base elements dont change much. You have the funny guy the party guy nerdy guy or unique guy. You have the career girl or quirky girl or super nice girl. Once you pick out careerssituations you can only do so much to keep things realistic yet different.Overall I think Friends was much lighter show than HIMYM I liked both and that toneunderlying themes keep the two apart. Think about the breakups in Friends  most were comical. Guy was too young or guy was too friendly with his sister or guy shot a bird girl is too immature girl is annoying. We had very few serious breakupslosses maybe Richard David actor girl who moved with Joey Kathy for Chandler etc. Didnt really touch upon deathgrieving. Phoebe met her dad but that wasnt explored. Ross had  divorces and  illegitimate children and that was hilarious we never once saw him depressed about it. Whereas HIMYM dove into it with death grieving loss hard break ups etc. I mean they ended with the main character being a widow. They always tried to be much more bittersweet when it came to their scenarios which allowed their show to resonate more with viewers.Sorry I definitely rambled on for way too long. Friends was a hit not because it was the first sit com but because they had a great cast  used the building blocks in a refreshing way. Same with HIMYM. ,HIMYM,cpf5umw,2,t5_2rcqy

You change it up whenever people point out what a disgraceful excuse for a human being you are and youre too stupid to realize that nobody is going to buy it. ...also similar to how you change your microdicks measurements whenever someone asks how hilariously tiny your penis is but thats another conversation entirely. Face it you are a rapist a pedophile and the only way to make everyone get over it would be to waddle down to your local police department and turn yourself in for raping a little girl for three years.

Ive since rewatched the show once and I just skipped the last scene. The reason I cant rewatch it again is because I keep picturing the last few scenes and it ruins the episode Im watching. Like if an episode shows how Barney is good for Robin how Robin is choosing relationships over her career or how Ted is finally getting over Robin I think of the finale and feel irritated. So Im not upset over the finale anymore but Im over the entire show. I can rewatch the fun episodes like the pineapple incident but steer clear of the character development ones because the finale messed with a lot of it. I honestly would have been ok with the finale if it had been executed well. Like giving us a real reason for Barney and Robin divorcing rather than what we were given. I think the story would have been great and I would have bought everything they were selling had it not been squished into the last episode for shock value. OP try watching some of the fun episodes.

11532532,0,t1_dg22mzy,When I started rewatching I realized Season  is horrible so I cant watch it...After going from season one to season eight... I realized something. Heres something most anime dont have my preferred medium  your love for characters. No I am not saying that you dont not love the characters but you watch an Anime for the storyline... even sliceoflife anime do not have the same homely feeling of HIMYM.Sure enough when season s turn cam just a few hours ago I finished it  I was glad to watch it. Heck I would watch another season I do not care how shitty it is. Thats the thing about the series... even though HIMYM was dragged it came at such a point in my life that I needed fictional friends.HIMYM is just more realistic than FRIENDS since it has its feel moments. SE rings to mind where Ted is alone... Yes maybe HIMYM was dragged. But its either a draggedon TV show or a show that ended too early. Thats just the fans though for people just going through it it might be different.,HIMYM,dg37qko,2,t5_2rcqy
