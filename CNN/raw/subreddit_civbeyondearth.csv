We of course welcome discussion comparing BE to other games in the genre and Id be shocked if some SMACBE comparison threads didnt pop up after the game launches And of course there will be some threads comparing and contrasting BE and Civ V. Talking about BEs mechanics in relation to other games is still talking about BE.If theres a post talking exclusively about SMAC or Civ or Pandora most likely the mod who sees it will redirect the OP to the appropriate subreddit.The main intent behind the rule is to prevent totally unrelated posts which weve been having to remove in higher and higher quantities.

2084278,0,t1_cl4pt33,Heh I actually bought SMAC because of BE it only confirmed my Purity views.  I bet youre right though.  I have my own theory too  take SMAC veterans and see who they mostly played in the game.  I would bet money youd see the following trends.University Hive and Consciousness players favor SupremacyBeliever Spartan and Morganite players favor Purity.Gaian and Cult of Planet players favor Harmony.Peacekeeper players would be evenly split between Harmony and Purity.The other factions arent ideological enough to actually fit in IMHO.I love tg because of that kind of thing they can be surprisingly insightful when they want to.

2085617,0,t1_cl4wpfn,Ah I think I see part of where we disagree.  I never said we shouldnt care for other life or even alien life and I dont think Purity does either.  My contention is that if it comes down to a choice between preserving nonhuman life or preserving human life human life comes out on top every single time no exception.  That is all I meant.Incidentally Im probably going to end up with at least a couple of points in Harmony because my idea of Purity is domesticating the hostile alien life rather than exterminating it.

2278266,0,t3_2l8ghr,Reposting from another thread.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp  After seeing the Holy See on the workshop it got me to thinking about other potential sponsors and what I would like to see.  This led to me coming up with the Nauvoo Initiative and The Egyptian Revival sponsors.  I felt that these would be interesting groups both storywise and mechanics wise but Im wanting to get your opinions.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp  TLDR The Nauvoo Initiative gets  speed towards colonist construction and  health for each city connected to the capitol by road or coastal trade route.  AI Affinity Harmonyampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp  The Egyptian Revival gets  speed towards tile improvements.  AI Affinity Supremacyampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp  The Nauvoo Initiative During and after the Great Mistake the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints were quick to respond to the natural and economic disasters that plagued the world.  LDS humanitarian efforts provided food clothing and shelter to many refugees while the LDS faith grew as more people turned to God in their hour of need.  However the Church has faced more and more opposition in an increasingly secular and disillusioned world.  ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp  Because of this many members of the Mormon church have begun to look at the Seeding projects as a way to escape increasing persecution on Earth and have begun banding together to raise money for their own colonizing ventures.  The Nauvoo Initiative led by LDS member and former Colorado politician Oliver Grant is one example.  ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp  It has taken this venture longer to set out due to it having no official government or corporation sponsor but what it lacks in size and money it makes up for in determination and optimism.  The colony charter of the Nauvoo Initiative focuses on strong independent communities working together much like their pioneer ancestors who settled the Rocky Mountains.  Only time will tell if they will be able to make their own Eden in the stars.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp  The Nauvoo Initiative gets  speed towards colonist construction and  health for each city connected to the capitol by road or coastal trade route.  AI Affinity Harmonyampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp  The Egyptian Revival While other continents were hit hard by the melting of the ice caps Africa was largely unaffected.  This led to the rise of Peoples African union who would go on to become one of the original  sponsors in the Seeding.  Egypt however once a powerful Republic was hit hard by the melting ice caps resulting in a complete flooding of the Nile River delta and the sinking of both Cairo and Alexandria below the waves.  This and the growing poverty of fellow Arab countries due to diminishing oil and gas reserves led to a severe humanitarian crisis in the large nation as waves of refugees flooded in looking for food and shelter that was no longer available.  ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp  When the democratic process and the government fell apart the military took control under the leadership of General Ismail AlMaliki.  Only through the use of a severe surveillance state was Egypt able to control the unrest caused by extremists anarchists and refugee camps.  Knowing that idle minds lead to unrest General Ismail set about finding a project to unite the Egyptian people.  The flooding of the Nile River Delta had been the doom of the old Egyptian order but now it would be its salvation.  Under General Ismail the enormous Department of Land and Water Development was created dedicated to developing the thousands of miles of desert Egypt owned into a new paradise by creating an interlocking network of canals and irrigation ditches.  These expanded waterways now connect the center of the African continent with Europe and the Slavic Federation leading to a trading boom in the region.  With the canal network complete and facing severe layoffs and unemployment General Ismail now points his nations skyward towards new worlds.  Long dismissed and slow to recover from the Great Mistake Egypt is eager to join the Seeding project and continue its growth among the stars.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp  The Egyptian Revival gets  speed towards tile improvements.  AI Affinity Purityampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp  So there you have it.  To be honest I expect some people to get butthurt about the Mormon group considering the drama the Holy See generated on the Steam Workshop so Id appreciate any criticism to be divided into two groups Mechanics and Story.  Thank you.,civbeyondearth,cltb959,3,t5_31brl

So for every alien that ANY player killed all the aliens would get more hostile to humanity in general. I dont know exactly how its been toned down since but you can imagine how the early game would be different if alien aggression levels were basically multiplied by the number of players.It was a deliberate design choice there was a diplomacy option similar to Dont settle new cities near us that basically said Hey quit killing aliens youre making them angry and theyre going to start attacking all of us if you dont slow down.

A city on flat ground surrounded by hills  is absolute hell to take if you lack units that can fire over obstacles.  A turtled enemy capitol on flat terrain surrounded by hills on the attacking side assuming techs are equal  will take  units to capture.  Sometimes it will even be impossible.  building on a hill but have forests on hills next to it also works to kill LOS.  Yes I have run into terrain setups that defeated  unit armies EVEN WHEN their defensive units were nullified.

Switching diplomatic traits saves the tier you were at so if you had level II or III in something switch to something else and switch back youll still have level II or III. However switching still permanently increases the diplomatic cost of getting a new trait so not super likely youll switch much. The Nanohive deploys to do area damage to everything up to two tiles away. It cant deploy if it has moved at all this turn. One of the artifact unique buildings is called a Frontier Stadium and grants a free promotion to all units built in the city.  The primordial biomes marvel quest gives a  turn global production bonus that increases in duration for every new marvel node you explore after completing the quest. The AI gets how to fortify now and knows how to properly use Golems to block ranged attacks. Enemy AIs still gainlose respect for stuff you do while youre at war with them.

5372226,0,t1_cvx0ior,The list has been updated with bugs people have submitted and its a lot longer now. Its too long for a single post. As of Oct Major Diplomacy Issues AIs wont accept some agreements even if respect is maxed and you are allied with them. AIs wont accept white peace even if they are outnumbered or have a lower war score even after more than  turns have passed on standard speed. The player may be forced by war score to demand peace terms AIs will not accept. The player may be forced by war score to demand an AIs current capital if the AI has lost their original capital which appears to prevent the AI from accepting. PATCHED  Allied AIs will not always be dragged into war if you declare war or are attacked. If one of your allies declares war on another of your allies you will declare war on one of them or sometimes both. via Deon This will cause a decrease in respect from other leaders for breaking your alliance andor for warmongering. AIs may declare war on you the turn after accepting a peace deal. When playing on a team in multiplayer if one teammember makes peace with an AI both players receive their respective War Score benefits. So if one teammate makes white peace the other teammate may spontaneously receive cities if they had a higher war score its also possible the second teammate may have to give up cities. via CelJadedMinor Diplomacy issues The player still receives change in respect communications during a war with an AI even though the AIs respect score is hidden. However the respect score does not appear to affect the AIs decision to make peace. Making white peace after  turns or so of refusals may reveal the AI has high or even maxed respect for the player. The Reusable Vehicles agreement increases the production cost of orbitals rather than decreasing the cost as stated in the tooltip. via Deon War score terms only include surrendering cities not onetime yields or yields per turn. not clear if this is intended AI fear levels remain low even when your army is much larger andor technologically advanced than theirs. This may be affected by difficulty setting. The dialog box for declaring war on a station now says Do you wish to declare war on Alien? and a DoW notification will appear that says Player has declared war on Alien! When leaders communicate with you to stop forward settling or move your troops away from their borders there is no explicit statement of what they want just the leader text which is not always easy to interpret. ARC says something about breaching interstellar law it took a long time to realize she was annoyed I had units in her territory. Allies may demand you move your army away from their borders when you have units in their territory I think see point above on unclear demands. The AI will take agreements that buff aquatic cities even when on they have no aquatic cities e.g. on an allland map. via Emptiness Advisors often suggest the same agreements multiple times from the same AI. Players do not get a fullscreen notification when an AI declares war on them. via Greasy DaveAquatic Cities Moving cities causes several issues for units stationed in them. In some cases units such as boats aircraft or trade units will not move with the city. Aircraft will disappear entirely via Emptiness trade units will stay frozen on the map and unusable. Via legalizefreedom When an aquatic city moves if you had established a spy network there the the visible area does not move with it. If you began the mission before the city moved the visible area will appear in the citys original position. Via Deon In order to connect aquatic cities to your capital you have to build a road on the city tile. Im not sure if the road has to be built again when the city is moved someone confirm and Ill edit this in. Aquatic cities cant move into tiles vacated by previous aquatic cities. via Deon Disembarking onto an aquatic city tile does not consume any extra movement but embarking out of it does. This means ranged units can move out of water into an aquatic city and still fire this may be intentional but it also results in weird pathing behaviours where workers will attempt to move through cities rather than around them. The turn counter on movement out of Aquatic cities is wrong as a result of embarking weirdness. via Barathor When an aquatic city moves out of workable range of an improved resource it still registers having that resource locally for building requirements. via Emptiness When built on water Supremacys Emancipation Gate uses the embarked strength of nonhovering land units rather than their base strength. Via subversiveasset on Reddit When built on water Puritys Exodus Gate will create embarked settlers so even if the Gate is next to a land tile with a magrail on it moving out of the Gate will consume all movement.Buildings improvements other city issues In some playthroughs city conquering does not bring up the annexpuppetraze dialog. Instead the city is automatically annexed with no resistance. You may build or buy in it immediately and use the city attack in the same turn it was taken. When this happens you cant raze any conquered cities. Im not clear on what gives rise to this bug only that its happened to me in some playthroughs and not others and it completely breaks the game because taking cities becomes super powerful. The bug persists on saving and loading the game. Improvements that do not have restrictions on land vs. water may be built anywhere on any feature or resource. This includes farms academies domes and Biowells. Manufactories do not appear affected because they cant be built on water. Buildings that require improved resources like the Observatory can be built in cities that are receiving the resource via an external trade route. The tooltip still says they require an improved local resource. Via Amrunril TheMarshmallowBear Forests are not removed when building improvements. Build times are increased but not an amount equal to clearing the forest as with biowellxenomass in Vanilla for instance building a farm on a forest takes  turns on standard rather than  turns on grassland but clearing the forest also takes  turns. Cities that become a civs capital once its original capital is taken cant be razed. via Deon Al Falah gets a  bonus to city processes not  as her description states. Via Idleray Faraday Gyre  upkeep cost to buildings and improvements in this city does not decrease cost of Terrascapes. via ggmoyang Spies travelling to cities cant be aborted even though the abort button is visible and clickable. via ptossUnits You cant see allied or neutral submarines even when you have a unit next to them. When an enemy sub attacks your unit or city from two tiles away the unit model will stay visible on your turn but the icon disappears and the sub wont be targetable unless you have a unit next to it. Hovering units are slowed by some terrain obstacles specifically difficult terrain that has a road or magrail built on it. via Deon Emptiness Some naval attack perks dont seem to work against enemy submarines. Submarines attacking other submarines on coastal tiles dont get the  attack perk if this was taken and patrol boats that take the  versus ranged naval units also dont do extra damage to subs. via Lucius larknok on Reddit When you try to tell one of your units to move onto a tile with an invisible unit on it the cursor will turn red as though the tile is impassible even if you cant see the unit there. This can be used to spot enemy invisible units. Invisible units using the move command will generate eyeballs to mark tiles where they will become visible around units that are out of sight range or are invisible to the player moving them. This can also be used to spot enemy invisible units. Subs can attack melee units from under ice where they cannot be retaliated against. The AI will not retreat melee units out of range if this happens. This was likely inherited from Civ  however in BE the maps more often extend to ice caps. The Aquilon cant fire over terrain obstacles which makes no sense because its a FRIGGING FLYING CARRIER. via EmptinessMaps Players and AIs can start on onetile islands partially or completely surrounded by ice. This appears to be most common on the new allwater maps and is due to a map script error that creates a grassland tile when none is available. via Barathor Distribution of strategic resources on land does not appear to take into account distribution on nearby coast and vice versa. As a result it is relatively common to get  titanium deposits within range of a single city. This maybe affected by biome type. The same strategic resource will spawn on consecutive tiles. For example two firaxite deposits or two titanium deposits will appear immediately next to each other. This contributes to being able to being able to get  titanium deposits near one city.,civbeyondearth,cvyd20t,3,t5_31brl

5822194,0,t1_cxikzvb,It took me almost a minute to understand that you were referring to Civ vs Civ. I played hundreds of hours between the two but its just plain bad form and practice to refer to two different things with abbreviations with the same exact spelling with capitalization of a single letter showing the difference between them. Also no one uses Roman numerals for practical purposes.,civbeyondearth,cxitc7a,-1,t5_31brl

6073918,0,t1_cyfjgrf,Apple tends to drop support for older versions of OSX.I used to have a Macbook that only ran up to . and had to sell it on eBay. Nothing modern would run on it. At the time . was out and you needed a certain CPU to upgrade to it. Which is why I dont use Macs anymore. I use GNULinux instead where the OS upgrades are free and dont require newer hardware to do.,civbeyondearth,cyfrzvo,2,t5_31brl

6393959,0,t3_438n35,Copypasting from my post there for this subs benefitI would also heartily recommend Awesome Loadout Awesome Sponsors and Awesome Wonders. Awesome Sponsors in particular is absolutely fantastic.This particular modder Ryika has a lot of quality content and I would without hesitation recommend nearly anything they put out at least in regards to the quality of the mod. While I dont personally care for the Awesome Affinities mod it takes Terrascapes away from Purity and that makes me sad its still very welldone.,civbeyondearth,czgfdlh,3,t5_31brl

6677402,0,t1_d07ckkv,I think space ships should hold off let planetarylevel play be its own game.Instead use the orbital layer for missiles system exploration asteroid capture and deep space science. Allow cities in space as space stations. They have no culture area only their city tile matters. The population may utilize surrounding satellites to provide bonuses to culture science and health. Space stations dont grow. Their colonists must be shipped from surface cities. They dont produce everything they use must be launched and they starve without an active trade route.Definitely keep orbital transport. Its stationtostation teleporting with a price in energy that varies by distance. Have orbital units that point outward such as telescopes and gravity wave detectors. Asteroid capture missions could provide production bonuses to cities space farms could improve health allowing larger population for the nearby base.Notably missing from this is combat. I think space combat is extremely deadly. Space colonies can be taken out with rockets from the ground but to do so is an atrocity to take a mechanic from SMAC. This keeps the action focused on whats happening on the planet which between seacraft and land units theres plenty to follow but it still opens up a new avenue of play. Rockets can also be used on satellites and ballistic missiles allow attacks on terrestrial targets such as cities or an approaching military.Rocket trucks gain a new ability they take orbital units as payloads. They can launch a satellite directly above them or fire a rocket presuming they are deployed this is required even if the unit doesnt deploy to attack.,civbeyondearth,d0a02dp,5,t5_31brl

7492837,0,t3_4hwj2y,Rising Tide definitely improved the game but if funds are a concern definitely wait until it is less than  on steam sales.

7729648,0,t1_d3jp2fx,Its criticized because it really just felt like a Civ mod rather than a standalone game in its own right. For example its strange there would still be a melee and ranged dynamic but not strange if you realize its just a reskinned Warrior and Archer.
