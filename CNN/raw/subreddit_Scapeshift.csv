6554106,0,t3_45ccnq,a Keep a basic mountain in your deck. If they hit Valakut with the triggers on the stack it doesnt do anything. If you cant keep a mountain in your deck then you need to go off with  lands  Valakut  Mountains.b Yes you also have to do the math if they can pay for some of those activation. Your Valakut triggers are shocks at this point.c This comes up a lot in Affinity amp Fish youre basically down to a staring contest. If you want to guarantee that everything is taken care of then bounce the manland given there is no Ravenger on the field to fizzle CC. That is the upside to playing manlands so youre at a disadvantage here.,Scapeshift,czx8xps,1,t5_37n4l
6937563,0,t1_d12oyse,I think I confused myself. I thought Vision is great with Bloodbraid! gt thought of old RG versions that have Kitchen Finks and stuff then realized its bad with your Remands.In short Bloodbraid is pretty good in a nonblue version that is built a bit differently.,Scapeshift,d12p87t,1,t5_37n4l

7052495,0,t1_d1fj5ne,Thanks for the input.  Ive tried out Electorlyze main but its surprisingly bad in my meta since most of the xs I face are either bogles or backed up by anthem effects.  There are few Bobs and Birds to shoot and I generally prefer the more timely response my bolts allow. Soul Sisters is a rather niche deck but since there are two copies in my person meta I figured I might as well fill a spare sideboard slot with something to give them headaches.  I could just be playing the matchup wrong though Ill test it out a bit.,Scapeshift,d1frbzo,1,t5_37n4l
7150040,0,t3_4dgaiv,Cant really help with items  or  except just to be careful. For  theres no hot key F which puts multiple triggers on the stack randomly doesnt work since you need to choose a target it does help with two Delvers or Pyros but you can right click the Valakut trigger on the stack and select auto yes and auto yield to save a few seconds.,Scapeshift,d1qvy00,1,t5_37n4l

8581622,0,t1_d6e8ems,He played it and passed with  white mana up. I cast scapeshift and before even resolving it he said something to the effect of good game I was hoping the story circle would throw you off enough to where you wouldnt go for it.Seems like a very high opportunity cost bluff to me as well.,Scapeshift,d6eadyp,1,t5_37n4l
8638357,0,t3_4y4n7n,Personally I like the breachless version better.  Ive always had just terrible luck with the deck always getting through the breach then never anything to put into play with it.  That said more titans the better imo.  Also I like Rec Sage over Krosan Grip because of the fact that the deck has Summoners Pact.  Getting to be able to play  rec sage and have summoners pact be able to tutor it if needed is way more convenient than hoping to draw the krosan grip in a deck without card draw,Scapeshift,d6leipg,1,t5_37n4l
8837943,0,t1_d7a6rjz,Well I went from Electrolyze to Bolts for some obvious reasons. I think against decks like Burn Suicide Zoo its so much better. I board out Electrolyze there but Bolt is just awesome. Also bolts are often times better than Electrolyze in matchups like Affinity or Infect because those are decks that kill you on turn  and Electrolyze is often not enough. Theres a big difference in bolting the Infect Elf turn  instead of Electrolyzing the Agent and the Elf on turn . Also it just goes better with your curve. Search is the only spell that can be cast on turn  and on Turn  you have multiple choices like leaving up a cryptic command or playing hunting wilds or maybe leave up snapcasterRemand etc.    Also the  off Snappy is a lot better with Bolt. Was considering removing him from the deck but now with Bolt hes a lot better tbh. Last PPTQ I was rdth and another BTL player won and we talked about the same thing. He ran bolts I ran Electrolyze. Now at the World Championship Lukas Blohon also said that you need Bolts otherwise youll just lose the the fast decks and I finally gave it a try and I think it is really better.    My argument before was that decks like Jund want Bolts because they have to control the board. They win by handling threats and overcome on the board which BTL Scapeshift doenst have to do. Scapeshift can stall with Cryptics or take some hits and just buy time until you can combo off. Also if you play Jund against control decks bolt has at least SOME use since you can bolt them in the face and bringing them down to  in the traditional way is what Jund has to do. Scapeshift only needs to bring the opponent down to  for the fastest combo kill but can do  if necessary so the bolt doesnt fill this role either. That being said a  mana removal spell is worth a lot in the right matchups and when its dead its super dead but then you usually have a good MU anyways.,Scapeshift,d7a728c,2,t5_37n4l
8952088,0,t1_d7nbei0,This is a very stock list and a pretty good one.  Lately though ive been trying out  Cryptic  Electrolyze and  Scapeshift for some reaons a  split to me always feels right and adding  Engineered Explosives to the main.  I really like it over trying to add bolts and it gives game vs Infect and Suicide Zoo game .  Im also jamming some Chalices in the side to help beat the fast decks.Its been running ok in leagues so far.  I have a few s but mostly s and s.  I plan to run this  or something very close this weekend at a PPTQ.How i do in leagues seems to be entirely tied to how many Burn decks i see.  Even with a Chalice on  that deck can beat you.  Its annoying that Burn used to be a deck that if you didnt prepare for it youd lose now it is so strong that i basically dont prepare for it at all because ill lose regardless.,Scapeshift,d7nwop4,1,t5_37n4l
8961051,0,t1_d7owbue,I have only played once competitively and won but as reported it was fluke. You just cant really do anything about their creatures other than anger of the gods and buying one turn with a cryptic doesnt really save you  and banking on drawing more than one is nuts. I think its bad because so many of the cards are just totally dead but it may well be that its not as bad as Im saying as the deck seems quite inconsistent.,Scapeshift,d7ozf7b,1,t5_37n4l

11402522,0,t1_dfnolb8,Main board Maelstrom Pulse. Its so great in a pinch. I find that I mostly like it against BGx decks to blow up a liliana or multiples of their haymaker creatures.,Scapeshift,dfogmmn,1,t5_37n4l
11674546,0,t1_dgjb3qt,Thanks. I just got a damnation now that its cheaper. I think maelstrom pulse will be a lot more valuable than timely reinforcements which never seems better than baloth for me anyways.,Scapeshift,dgjbqwq,1,t5_37n4l
