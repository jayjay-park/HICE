6343624,0,t1_cz9yagf,Yeah and then the food is wasted because it rots if its a fruit or veggie.,slimerancher,czap7an,1,t5_3bg75
6353887,0,t1_czbqw2j,Hmm... it would be hard to show a lot of the information because its attached to the current selling price of the plorts. That being said I can see where adding that Boom slimes blow up and damage you and honey slime plorts attract other slimes would bee good.I will look into making another chart and putting names and maybe a little description of the slimes on it. ,slimerancher,czbv7mj,2,t5_3bg75

6462633,0,t3_41w1v0,OMG the anime one is so funny. Imagine it Having ONE slime in all game sometimes following you around hiding behind corners watching you but when you look it hides. There are rare chances where you can see it and captured it and then it means Senpai noticed Kawaii Slime.,slimerancher,czns3qs,2,t5_3bg75

6586904,0,t3_44ma2t,In my opinion I think it is worth it I get very bored with games and I am not easy to please as I am not very good at most games tbh but I got the game and I have played about  in games days so far and I am still finding new things to do. Trying to breed only certain slimes breeding certain largos certain hens and so on and so forth. As well as just roaming around and such... Much worth it in my opinion but that being said... I did wait until I had the extra money to get it.,slimerancher,d00n1ai,2,t5_3bg75

6637177,0,t3_46dop4,I like to think that puddle slimes may be adapted pink slimes. Due to the huge amount of loss to the tarr slime pink slimes  adopted living in ponds to ward off the tar not always effective. After spending too much time in the water they eventually adapted to their new environment. Science?,slimerancher,d05ua5f,2,t5_3bg75

10140780,0,t3_5l61qp,Largos are harder to manage in my opinion because you simply cant keep as many in the same pen but are neccesary to keep income off all the different plort types. I have pink mixed with most honey boom cat and hunter then a pen of radphosphor and crystalrock. Then a pen with like  pink for that hungry science.  You should find out like  crops to grow and try to base your largos off of those favorites. for the longest time I had honey largos so I could just grow mint melons all day. But how you set up is up to you and what you want to grow. You will probably swich things up as you start to fill your refinery.,slimerancher,dbtcjdv,1,t5_3bg75
