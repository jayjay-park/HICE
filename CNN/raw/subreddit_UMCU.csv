9543535,0,t1_d9pfq1c,Not what I took. The original Mad Max trilogy is dated. Fury Road was a soft reboot. It basically told a new story and while it was a Mad Max movie they could have called it Furiosa Fury Road. I think Van Helsing may not be the main character in his own film. If you look at how he works in the Bram Stoker novel its really a mentor type role he plays. I think he may be in his on film as the mentor. I dont know.  Just speculating. The comparison caught my attention. ,UMCU,d9pfshe,2,t5_3e19m

10612248,0,t3_5p3a35,I would love Michael Fassbender to be part of the Universe but Im not sure Van Helsing would be right for him. I would like someone a little bit older.,UMCU,ddakmab,2,t5_3e19m
10921655,0,t1_de5xou1,Yeah. I think they might not contain much hoof or which sucks! If you want to make a political or social comment or go meta then horror is an amazing tool. That would suck for universal yo miss that trick and play it safe. I hope theyre willing to make their films frightening and disturbing. ,UMCU,de6hqmz,2,t5_3e19m
11132773,0,t3_5yygti,I will be disappointed if Luke Evans is not Dracula. I thought Dracula Untold was fantastic. Im looking forward to seeing The Mummy but would have been a lot more invested if DU had been the lead in. ,UMCU,detw164,4,t5_3e19m
11421467,0,t1_dfqk4d0,But... it theyre going to do a big universe crossover. And the Mummy is the villain in this... Doesnt it tend to follow that the protagonist lives and the villain The Mummy dies?I have a hunch that Tom Cruise will end up with Mummy powers by the end of the movie.,UMCU,dfqm16c,2,t5_3e19m
