428642,0,t3_1yxbui,How ignorant.    Devils advocateAlthough what caused the sudden lockdown before his car was randomly selected to be searched? Someone must have seen it or he knew about it in passing.I cannot imagine schools just randomly go into lockdown to search random cars. When I was in CMCSS and walking  miles uphill all the random searches were done by drug dogs walking the hallway while you were in class. There was no random lockdowns to search a car.,Clarksville,cfp6zpv,1,t5_2s5xv

1467770,0,t3_2av6zl,Local business doesnt really thrive here unfortunately. Wilma Rudolph near Exit  is where youll find the mall along with dozens of chain restaurants you could find in any mediumtolarge city in the US. Exit   Sango area is where the wealthier people live. People will tell you that Ft. Campbell Blvd.  New Providence is dangerous but I work in that part of town and it seems more just poor than actually shady. There are a few public pools around the Beachhaven Pool off Madison Street being the nicest. The downtown area has local bars and our one stable local restaurant  brewery The Blackhorse. There is just not a whole lot to do here. Youre better off going to Nashville for the nightlife.,Clarksville,cj09dr0,1,t5_2s5xv

9336558,0,t3_582avw,NOTE I banned a user for expressing the idea that Clarksville is a worthless place that isnt even worth stopping for gas. I dont intend to stifle opinions but this users history was overwhelmingly negative and I just dont want to support that tone here. Please let me know if you feel that this was a mistake.,Clarksville,d8zh6ng,2,t5_2s5xv
