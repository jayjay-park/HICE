4924004,0,t1_cuf4360,There is the possibility that at the very beginning not every dead person came back. The beginning of the outbreak was never shown in TWD so we have no way of knowing if all the dead started reanimating at  AM on a specific date.Another explanation could be that in the beginning the time it took for a dead person to reanimate could have been a much longer time. In TWD they figured that the dead would come back after just a minute up to  hours after dying. What if at the beginning most of them didnt come back for    hours? That would explain the lag time.Its more likely that it ramped up and that a week or so into the outbreak every dead person started to reanimate.

5099492,0,t1_cv0o1ha,In another thread someone said it makes sense if you look a real wide scale blackouts in the recent past. What causes massive black outs is a cascading effect. There are different sections of the power grid which individually are stable. But when certain areas loose power it puts greater and greater strain on the system causing cascading black outs you see in the show. It keeps going down because at some power plant somewhere the people operating it have fled to find their families or are being eaten alive. It goes back up because other main control areas workers are making a valiant effort to put everything back online. But they know that if other areas of the grid are not fixed the whole thing is going to go off eventually. So at some point the whole thing is going to go off for the last time because too much of the system is compromised OR the humans trying to keep it up finally realize its a lost cause.

If you venture next door you grab weapons first even a shovel would do before you enter the house. You close the door once youre in.  If you venture next door to get gunbullets you stash the bullets in your pocket as soon as you find them so you dont forget them if you suddenly rush out. If you suddenly rush out because you see your boyfriend about to enter your house with a zombie in it because you didnt shut the back door when you left you dont exit the back door and go back through the garden maze at snails pace you run screaming out the front door so he and his family dont get killed. ,FearTheWalkingDead,cv12b12,51,t5_35zlz

Madison and Travis are HS teachers so Travis was expecting at best some drugged out hermits not flesheating zombies.I was confused by it also at first until I realized its sort of the central trope of the show.

5185145,0,t1_cvazcnf,The thing is the most powerful episodes involving zombies have nothing to do with zombies being killed but people being killed by zombies. Its about the threat they pose and how that changes the characters behavior in the short term and the long term. TWD strikes a balance because its had time to do that and the writers have the experience to hone it. Season  and  were very lopsided on the one hand you have unqualified zombie killing with near zero substance and on the other hand you end up with a lot of character conflict that frequently had little substance though as time passed the conflicts became increasingly more relevant.  FTWD hasnt gotten to that point where there is a balance because the whole point of it is that its about the fear of the walking dead.

As for it being a complete losing situation. Its very very dire but in all pandemics there are people who are immune. There are people who never get infected with HIV despite being exposes to it routinely people who never get ebola or who get it and survive. The blood of people such as this was one of the first treatments for ebola etc. My money having some background in infectious disease is that some of the children born during this are immune. And perhaps there are people who contracted the insinuated flu and did not die who are immune. Possible also people who were bitten but did not die? Assuming there are people who are immune the trick for them is simply to outlast the zombie and the other people  not exactly easy.  ,FearTheWalkingDead,cvfhjlf,1,t5_35zlz

There would be just as much backlash for having too much heroism as too little. It is more realistic to see people that managed to hide out and get away from it. Those would be specific reasons they are a rarity. Most criticism is simply I dont like it a criticism without reason typically points to a gut instinct and the natural gut instinct for humanity is change is bad.I have to agree with you on the points made about WWZ. I feel like the socialpolitical context made in that book is a rarity and really a gem for the subject genre. The Redeker Plan and in later chapters the personal consequence of it is something rarely seen in these sorts of stories. I would go so far as to say WWZ is some of the best storytelling in genre and its a shame it was lost on the film adaptation. I also agree that the Battle of Yonkers was amazing even though it doesnt fall within the context of this discussion however also that the combat tactics learned from it are another amazing part of the story.In the end though I still enjoy FTWD and I still feel like its unfairly judged.,FearTheWalkingDead,d2j0pjp,4,t5_35zlz

7405498,0,t1_d2jwbfp,gt Just because you cant understand a TV show doesnt mean its bad writing.I understood it just fine which is sort of the point of this thread it was horrendous writing.gt You are saying that the writers intent was to suggest the plane just crashed. Thats bullshitI and others have covered this ground pretty thoroughly by now. It was  days between the plane crash and our heroes coming upon the wreckage. In that time Annoying Kid is still wearing the same filthy clothes he was during the cold opening of the epthose awful wounds havent even been cleaned yet. There were two outcomes for AK after that crashhed be dead or hed be getting significant care and showing a great deal of improvement. Instead hes still in exactly the same shape as he was right after the crash. The only logical conclusion open to us The crash only just recently happened.Later Charlie tells him its worse now than it will ever be. The only logical conclusion open to us His wounds have only just happened.The spine of the fellow in the section of plane is sticking out his back implying massive internal injuries yet hes still alive. The only logical conclusion open to us The crash has only just happened.And so on.gt It seems as though people who bitch about TV shows cant comprehend narrative time relative to screen time. The episode opens shortly after the plane crash AlexCharlie is in the water and looking for survivors. All the luggage and plane debris are floating in the water. She gets on the lifeboat and then get this TIME PASSES. When our crew make it to the island they are sailing through the area where the plane crashed hence the filter getting clogged up Travis even pulls out a hat that was seen floating in the water in the first scene of the episode.None of which makes any case for I or anyone else having failed to comprehend narrative time relative to screen time.gt Also note that it has been maybe  hours since our crew left Stands houseThey find the wreckage   days after they left Strands house.gt and the plane crashed  days before that.The plane crashed  days before that. Sounds like you have a real problem following narrative time.gt Since the plane crashed the tides have washed much of the crash debris onto the islet. All that baggage and debris that is spread all over the islet didnt just land there during the crash it seems pretty obvious that it was washed ashore.The problem with that the stuff that was ashore was way way over the line of the tide and the fellow in the section Chis found would have drowned in short order if that section had been in the water before washing ashore. I dont really care about the mechanics of the crash but what we were shown precludes your interpretation.gt So Chris finds this man who is damn near dead. Its pretty unlikely hed be alive but not impossible. People have survived for  days without water.This one had been there for  days with severe internal injuries. So again your interpretation is absolutely precluded by what we weve been shown.,FearTheWalkingDead,d2jyg7i,4,t5_35zlz

7454667,0,t3_4hdw6y,Lol theres always one asshole...gt One criticism I have about this whole franchise that I havent seen people talking about is the OVERWHELMING presence of interracialhomosexual relationships.Perhaps because most people dont give a shit? Youve really sat there wondering for  seasons of TWD and  and a half of Fear why barely anyone has a problem with something that isnt even a problem the way you do? Ever consider that might make you the minority on that particular subject? I have to wonder what sheltered backwards country town you live in to even see this as overwhelming. Welcome to real life in . gt I feel like the writers are trying waaaay too hard to show these types of relationships to make a point that they really are for equality but honestly its to the point where these types of relationships are far overrepresented throughout the shows.This makes me so fucking mad honestly. Try growing up as a completely confused bisexual woman trying desperately to convince myself Im straight so I could feel normal and literally never seeing any bisexual people represented in media. Oh wait I did once there was a biphobic episode of Sex and The City where they acted like bisexuality was the worst thing in the world. GREAT. That made me feel super awesome about myself. I also grew up with gay friends and only ever saw them represented in films as complete jokes stereotypes existing solely for comedy. Never the hero never anything except someone for the straight people to laugh at. Dont get me started on the reactions Ive gotten for being in interracial relationships. If TWD or any other TV show has decided they want to help normalise different types of people and relationships I applaud them. I applaud them for making close minded fools like you uncomfortable because I spent appproximately  years uncomfortable in my own skin thinking of ways to fit in with what people and media promoted as normal. Now its much easier to find proper accurate representation and I honestly LOVE if it unsettles you. People are different to you get over it.What does overrepresented even mean? Like according to you the combination racisthomophobe extraordinaire the show can only have a set limit of people pairing off? Friendly reminder these shows are set in an apocalypse and not only is there barely any time or space to worry about being racist but theres also a rather short supply of people going around. As crazy as it sounds these people dont really have the luxury of being bigoted in their romantic choices. Whoever you get to love you love them because they or you could be gone tomorrow. I would actually love if a character said something like The way the world is now made me realise what a piece of shit I was to people not like me before.gt It just seems obvious to me that they are going WAY out of the way to purposely show as many unconventional relationships as they can fit. Does this seem excessive to anyone else?Unconventional. You actually typed that word and hit send. There is NO SUCH THING as a conventional relationship you fucking bigot. gt So many people did not read what I said.Nah youre just an immature little shit with some serious issues to sort out. We all read what you said consider why it made people mad. Hint its the same reason no one is criticising the interracialhomosexual relationships. gt  Didnt realize this forum was full of butthurt SJWs who dont know how to discuss a differing opinion without getting offended.Calling people unconventional is not a fucking opinion thats discrimination.

He had them all measured up and was looking for his exit strategy from that place gets one bad dream and looses it.Horrible writing i would have settle for a fightshoot out. Not just burn the place down.Plot hole he is suppose to be half crazy but manages to head butt the guard I was like yes he is back! seems to have a plan goes and gets a lighter AND THE KEYS! Not to mention fuel finds the correct key fast pours gasoline and then he hallucinates. Was hopping for a little chat with the dead wife and then remembers he has a daughter!!!
