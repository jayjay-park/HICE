She didnt have the best childhood but that didnt stop her two sisters from being sweet people with happy families plus she tended to exaggerate abuse for attention purposes maybe she has HPD. My post isnt really about what this persons diagnosis is. Call it whatever you want but I do know what I saw. I found evil relics in her possession drawings of a woman that looked like her killing and dismembering other women and homemade jewelry made of animal bones. I didnt want to post this information for fear of feeding into the bad energy but I felt pure evil once I began challenging her and I havent been the same since . Many have questioned why I didnt see the red flags my mother is empathic as well. she did see the flags from the moment she walked through our door but she felt it was my choicemy own lesson to learn and well I think its because we met when we were  and she was the first outcast Ive ever met and I related to that as a loner. I believe every being has a soul and I saw that in her as well. My first warning sign however was when we were at a party in high school and she gave me the keys to my car so I could leave when I was severely intoxicated and upset in a snowstorm. I didnt talk to her for sometime after that but in  I needed a place to live desperatley so I moved in with her.  ,empathetic,db4y6up,2,t5_2xorg
