4490525,0,t3_3ck5y0,What browser are you using?  We had a bug in our pushState code with Firefox that would break certain things like passwords that I pushed a fix for a few minutes ago.  If you arent using Firefox can you tell me the steps that you use to reproduce the bug what you didwhat you expectedwhat happened?  When you said look at them do you mean click on them or do you mean youre getting the wrong set of results?  When you say repeating a search do you mean clicking on the search button twice or modifying the search?,BetterFap,cswowvm,1,t5_368u8
4739752,0,t1_ctry5wk,gt The desktop doesnt default to the mobile site.  is this the desktop site? it looks like a mobile site to megtWhat features are missing?I dont have the old version to compare but here are some immediate complaints The thumbnails are a weird aspect ratio. Why not keep it roughly the ratio of videos  or square? This is pretty standard Instead of easy to use big buttons for filters you have to click on a tiny button then choose them. The filters are now which ones you dont want instead of which ones you do want The big DiscoverFavoritesetc tabs are gone from the top The icons for format are tiny especially compared to the not really important percentage it thinks youll like it Requires a bunch of clicks on unlabeled icons to see things like tags when it used to be on the page unobtrusively No related videosimages around like before Cant open videosimages in a new tab you could before but not with middle mouse buttonOverall Im just baffled by pretty much all of the changes,BetterFap,ctrznkh,12,t5_368u8

10552331,0,t1_dd47334,Ah let me clarify a bit.  The confusion recommender doesnt necessarily expect the opposite signal it just cant classify the current signal youve sent it or it conflicts with the other signals youve sent.  So if you have a dislike and it cant classify it or it conflicts then it may help your recommendations to either remove that dislike or super dislike it.  You dont have to like it though.Pretty much it could possibly be one of the following... Did you click the wrong button? Fix the signal This conflicts with the other signals you have sent Remove the signal We dont have enough information to use this properly Maybe its new?  Maybe its super niche?  Its safe to leave in this caseIf all of the above are okay then eventually it will be correctly incorporated into the model when we get more signals.Its a bit vague but thats why we source it to you to try to figure out.Ill try to write some better docs on how to use it.  I originally threw it up as an experiment for people to play with and to see if it would make a difference and it looks like it has been making a difference for some people ,BetterFap,dd484i0,2,t5_368u8

11707772,0,t3_65tsj1,Id like a hotkey that directly labels the current post as favourite. Having to manually wait for my lists to load and then navigate to the favouriteslist every time I want to fave something takes up a lot of time.Also in Chrome ... bit Im getting an issue where if I ctrlclick a post the view jumps up a bit and I have to scroll back down again to get to where I was.,BetterFap,dgn3tmb,2,t5_368u8
