YOU are the reason people have a negative outlook towards religion. YOU are what gives christianity a bad name. We must uproot and destroy wherever it tries to spread. How about having a logical conversation. You seem like a very close minded person that isnt open to new ways of thinking.

4830040,0,t3_3gf8xx,To me I think there is a cultural values gap between us and the people who lived thousands of years ago. It doesnt make much sense for me that someone could take a punishment in you place. Criminal law isnt like a credit card debt where someone can offer to cover it for you. We wouldnt see it as just if a millionaire could pay some poor person to serve time for a murder he committed. But for people of that time it did make sense. So we have to look at it in a different way. The death of Jesus is a model it was an act of love that he was willing to take all that God so loved the world that he was willing to give up his only son and when Jesus came back it was an illustration that there is more to the world that material reality that there is a higher reality that can conquer the crude limits of matter. ,Christian,cu3d7c2,1,t5_2qjy5

So for example all four Gospel accounts are blended together and positioned in the order that they happened in Jesus ministry. So during Chronicles Kings is sprinkled in there and the other prophesy books. It made the overview of the bible much easier to follow than if you read the Bible straight through going from book to book. Youre kind of right with the NIV to ESV.

If you want real answers I suggest going to salvationbygrace.org Pastor Jim McClarty has breakdowns of all the important questions you could ever have and all his teachings stems from just the biblical teachings. No outside views or interpretations. Hes studied the original translations and breaks down alot of the time word by word. Giving original meanings. He has a listen section I suggest starting with law vs grace. I was the common Christian most of my life. Believing there was this thing that I just had to do. I had to make Christ my Lord and Savior. I had to obey the ten commandments to a t or I wouldnt gain admittance to heaven. And that makes Christianity all about me instead of about Christ. We are all depraved sinners that have no chance of ever doing anything that will build up enough credit in the eyes of God. Our works are like filthy bloody rags. But through Gods grace he sent his Son to redeem us. Christ bought and paid for the elect few. The work is finished through Christ. Nothing left for us to do but just continue our faith.

8598379,0,t1_d6ekw7m,Yeah I understand. The Rapture is like the brand new marketing campaign. A brand new flashy idea marketed by America. Full of flash and plays to everyones hope that there is a better life waiting. Like The Rapture is a new way of being entertained. People are so overstimulated with constant entertainment that its getting harder to entertain people so the entertainment value has to go up. Therefore talk of end of the world is interesting. Because its stimulating and entertaining. Yeah I think maybe sometimes people are too fixated on the Rapture.

I never condemn people or point and say what they are doing is wrong. I just show them biblical answers. Its up to God if he wants that clear message to reach them. Its up to God if they are or arent saved. I feel no guilt or sorrow and I shouldnt. Im not the judge and Im not trying to be. And I dont waste my time on people who clearly dont want to or cant hear. Ive posted this to people who are confused or have knowledge but just not enough. Which is why I titled it to people having issues. It might be a good issue like them just missing a small part somewhere and needing some gaps filled in. While some other people might have very bad issues against it. And in me posting this they will have a lot to explain for first before going off on a tirade. So essentially I did this to cover basics. To have a starting point for this topic in this subreddit.

11654786,0,t3_66b1r5,It is a good question!First I would answer that the Council of Nicea was NOT a product of the Catholic Church! The RCC didnt really exist at that point because there was no Roman primacy and so no Pope. That means that neither the Trinity the canon nor the Nicene Creed belogn to the Catholic Church. Additionally the Eastern Orthodox Church claims about as well as the RCC to be the original church and also claims ownership over these elements. The Reformation was not a rejection of historical Christianity but a rejection of perceived perversions of historical Christianity by the Renaissance Catholic Church. In many ways Protestants claim that it was the Catholic Church that abandoned Nicea and that they are reclaiming it. Does that make sense?,Christian,dgh31vz,3,t5_2qjy5
