I havent had one single stability or performance issue on my v.  Rather my performance has increased.  Everything is quite noticeably snappier and slicker than my Vs factory installation of ...As well and I suppose this would go without saying there is literally no preinstalled bloatware...actually it gets even better than that... there are literally no preinstalled apps AT ALL except for the generic Android OSstandard apps IE Clock Calender Camera.
