2819417,0,t1_cnohlmt,If you plan on going to a CSU school definitely check with that schools advisor as to which classes readily transfer. Even though BC says that the classes will transfer I know plenty of people who got and had to take the same class again in the CSU system. The UC system tends to play better with junior college courses but its still in your best interests to call before you get enrolled and take classes that wont transfer without a lot of hassle.When you talk to someone at your destination school make sure you get their name and contact info. Let them know what youre planning and then crosscommunicate between that person and BC. Its better to have everything organized before you start doing anything.CSUB has Extended University available for many classes. This allows you to enroll in classes without actually applying for proper enrollment. Here you pay by the unit as opposed to paying one amount for up to  units and a higher amount for more than  units. Each class is usually  units at CSUB.If you want to enroll as a regular student at CSUB in the summer start your application process now. You have plenty of time but sometimes there are delays in processing all the paperwork.Again if you take classes at CSUB but are planning to go to a UC or some nonCSU school check with both schools to see that what youre taking is transferable.,Bakersfield,cnok6zp,2,t5_2s581

4738250,0,t3_3fbnia,Worked there for a couple of months.    First off you will be working for Xerox which is contracted out to do customer support for Boost Sprint Virgin also Sprint and student loans at least thats the three last I worked there. The pay is minimum wage.        Personally I loved the job. You sit down for a couple of weeks for training which is honestly pretty strenuous. LOTS of technical information that should be well above your pay grade. Luckily most of that wont come up. After training you get some trail by fire guided by more experienced reps. And then youre assigned to a team and on the floor about a month from starting.    Did I mention its still minimum wage yet?        The job itself is handling customers. Some would call for outages I see your zip code is out of service right now. Should be back in x days. I can credit your account for day. I know youre charged day. Sorry cant do anything about it.. Others would call for switching over accounts from another carrier which was EXTREMELY maddening to do from retailers because theyd set up temporary numbers and wed have to spend several minutes flipping accounts. And then theres always the person with a sob story needing another day of service day services when I was there. Lots of my baby is in the hospital and I just need to call once today type lies. Better after you check on the account and find out theyve called a dozen times the last two days. I would red flag accounts like this and they would sometimes get closed for abusing the system. Like I said I enjoyed the job though. Back to back calls would make the time pass quickly and it was nice to help people.        My gripes? Minimum wage of course. Even with that I had issues with coworkers. Had my lunch stolen twice prompting me to carry it with me. Then my water bottle was stolen from my desk desks are whatever is available. Youre not assigned. Because the standards are very low beyond what OP said when I went in for interview I was the only one wearing something nice. Jeans and a ratty tshirt are plenty there you will find some really trashy people there. The computers were PAINFULLY slow and we were advised in training about sitting off the clock for our computer to boot up all the way which is illegal in the state of California and I think federal. Most do it that way although the floor manager told me when I mentioned this issue were supposed to clock in you clock in through your phone turn on the computer and stall the first call while it boots up. The supervisors were generally terrible. When you need something supervisors are hard to find. And when you do find them theyre trying to send you off to someone else to handle your issue many things require a supervisor. All the while a customer is waiting and its looking bad on you racking up time on the call.        Id never work there again but if you can handle the annoying coworkers then the clients should be simple to take care of too. But then at that rate why would you bother working there when you can share your talent at better places?,Bakersfield,ctrstc5,1,t5_2s581

5355665,0,t3_3ocn7s,Ive lived in the Southwest and the North East and as a white guy have always felt safe. But you do need a car in Bakersfield so maybe if start with looking near bus routes and cross those with dispensaries. I know that NE bakersfield has its grocery stores in less desirable areas and want to be walking distance kinda makes it hard so take a look at that. But to be really honest you want a car with working AC in Bakersfield and a car at the very least. You probably need to allocate at least  power bills for AC and a car with AC in your budget probably close to  per month for a sq foot house i know thats bigger than you were thinking but thats the last house i lived in in Bakersfield so thats the only reference i have. I have a cousin who has been living in two seperate apartments in the NE with her  kids for less than  a month so its do able and she has always been safe even if she lived in less desirable areas. ,Bakersfield,cvw8w9d,2,t5_2s581

8664614,0,t3_4xq6p9,I recently bought a used car Mercedes ML Diesel from an online website called SHIFT.  I paid k for a car the dealers were selling for k.  They are based in Los Angeles and basically help private sellers sell their vehicles.  I met them in Valencia to test drive the car.  The only tedious was my local credit union AltaOne wouldnt work with them so I had to use their financing but I got a similar rate from them.  Really really good customer service really good prices.  You are paying private seller prices without the hassle of dealing with a private seller.,Bakersfield,d6op1d9,1,t5_2s581
