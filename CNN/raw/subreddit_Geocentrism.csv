2825778,0,t1_cnogd2g,Lol Ive read lots of noncreationist sources.  Ive had to in order to be informed enough to debate it as Ive done with others.  And theres nothing inherently unscientific about creationist sources anyways so where did that come from?  Creationists founded science.gtits rather quick of you to propose a massive conspiracy orchestrated by the entire geology community just everyone wants to prove some religion wrong.Its easy to prove.  Lyells writings including his correspondence with Darwin is damning evidence that he intended to destroy faith in Genesis with his rocklayers theory.  Encyclopedia Britannica confirms that modern geology is founded on Lyells principles even though geologists arent aware of it.  Now I dont mean geologists are aware they are keeping an ageold conspiracy alive.  But that doesnt change the fact that they are.,Geocentrism,cnpaaqy,1,t5_34gwm

Unicorn is an old term that has been redefined in contemporary times.

3270894,0,t1_cp0ykv6,I was being somewhat facetious the point is that if thats truly what uSquareHimself meant by his comment then you lose. Youre purporting to offer an explanation that is consistent with what we observe testable and youve even claimed simpler in the Occams Razor sense than the competing theories. But if you have to posit a god to fill in the holes then youre making another claim that you have to  provide evidence for and  provide evidence that this god can and does act in the way that you claim it does.,Geocentrism,cp13ww3,3,t5_34gwm
3404232,0,t1_cpfe3vp,LOL. So really bad explanations that were discredited a century ago are better than no explanations at all?

3406836,0,t1_cpga5w2,Newtons equations accurately described the phenomenon he observed and also accurately predicted other phenomenon we would come to observe. He couldnt have been aware of some of the future discoveries about regimes where his descriptions would fall apart so its not surprising that he would perhaps mistakenly call his law universal though I wonder did Newton actually call it that?. But again his laws did apply to the regimes he was addressing and so in that sense I would say he was correct.,Geocentrism,cpglrps,1,t5_34gwm

3565683,0,t1_cpxobhg,Im amused that your definition of approximation is so broad that it encompasses turning a circularlightpath experiment into a linearlightpath experiment especially since the point of contention was that SR cant explain the circular experiment but only linear ones.So to prove SR can handle a circular path as well as a linear one you make the path linear. If only I had your amazing powers I could claim that my car can drive without gas just as well as with a full tank and to prove it I drive on a full tank and then approximate the tank as being empty.,Geocentrism,cpypq4t,0,t5_34gwm
3631160,0,t1_cq44jjw,gtHow the hell is this relevant to the situation with the motion of the stars?Because you have an insatiable desire for maths which will never be satisfied.  But heres your numbers apparent motion reversals of stars every  year due to their annual orbit around their proper lumps of Dark Matter their daily revolution notwithstanding.   reversals times  years makes  apparent stellar velocity vector inversions every  years.  Is that enough numbers and math and technical jargon for my hypothesis to pass your math test?,Geocentrism,cq66i3s,0,t5_34gwm
3786337,0,t1_cqn3tg8,gtThe challenge was to find a paper that seriously challenges relativity. No more no less.The paper was designed by the authors own admission to challenge the constancy of light postulate of Relativity.  Thats what you asked for thats what I gave you... in fact more.gtEven with this conveyor the fiber is rotating and the sagnac effect is the same old sagnac effect that has been known and understood for nearly a century and can be used to measure relative motion. Wrong.  Did you even read the papers you told me you did? Another interesting arrangement is a figure  suggested by Whitney.  There the effective enclosed area of the light path is zero.  Therefore any time difference appearing in the arrangement is not related to the classic Sagnac effect the traveltime difference between two counterpropagating lightbeams in the moving optic fiber was clearly observed in all different configurations of FOCs INCLUDING THE FIGURE  CONFIGURATION. The phase shift  and therefore the traveltime difference are proportional  to  both  the  total  length  and  the  speed of  the  moving  fiber  whether  the  motion  is  circular or uniformMaybe you should go over those papers again and then get back to me once you are confident you can demonstrate you possess the most basic comprehension of the concepts involved.P.S. Your credibility can still be salvaged by posting these papers in your subreddit.,Geocentrism,cqnvesm,0,t5_34gwm

4753049,0,t1_ctt87r1,I dont know but the papers abstract is VERY thought provoking.gt Evidence suggests that this feature is the projection of a shell onto the plane of the sky. Voids and stringlike formations are common outcomes of largescale structure. However these structures have maximum sizes of  Mpc which are an order of magnitude smaller than the observed GRB ring diameter. Evidence in support of the shell interpretation requires that temporal information of the transient GRBs be included in the analysis.gtgtgt This ringshaped feature is large enough to contradict the cosmological principle. The physical mechanism responsible for causing it is unknown.,Geocentrism,ctto0y4,1,t5_34gwm
