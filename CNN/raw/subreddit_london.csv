37784,0,t1_ceiq05u,I guess it was more a pop at the schemes the government dreams up to continually inflate the bubble.  It feels like it should be meanstested.   I.e. Maybe you could feasibly buy somewhere to live without the scheme yet the government allows you to take advantage of a taxpayerbacked mortgage and build up a portfolio of rooms admittedly in only  property which is larger than your living needs.   That to me seems outwith the spirit of the scheme.  Is it to live in or is it to start amassing assets that you dont currently need?Sorry not a fan of where these schemes put the country but cant fault an individual.  Well all pay for it somewhere down the line anyway.  Id jump in quick tbh take advantage all you can.Anyway heres a link to a solicitor that says lodgers are probably ok,london,ceiqe7a,4,t5_2qkog

137764,0,t3_1vlzpr,I moved here about  years back before that I was out in the countryside In Dorset and its weird but there definitely seems to be two types of people who move to London Not sure how that applies to people born here. Theres people like me whove always enjoyed it and really like living here and theres people who spend every weekend going back to there hometowns and cant wait to leave which does occasionally make me think   you should go it would mean cheaper rents if less people wanted to live here  I agree that bits of it are a bit dodgy and growing up here I can see how that would affect your view  and yeah a few places are just a bit shit but as you get into work and start moving about the city a bit  especially if like me you are from somewhere fairly quiet then you also realise how nice a lot of it is and how much opportunity there is. I do think that a lot of the best London stuff is aimed at older people though theres a definite lack of stuff for kids Not saying youre a kid btw but youre closer to  than I am! to do so I can see how it would get a bit boring and yeah it is a bit grim in winter but to be honest its still got more going on than pretty much anywhere else in the UK so maybe a matter of perception I guess. ,london,ceu4dnr,3,t5_2qkog

490780,0,t3_1ratdq,Hello normally I dont post on Reddit but your message is perfectly mirrors how Ive felt since coming to the UK. Im originally from the US and transferred to an undergrad program in central London for graphic design. Ive lived in several different cities and this is the first time that Ive really struggled with meeting nice people and creating friendships. Its been six months so far and Ive had bouts of depression during my time here making it even harder to go out and meet people. I have people I occasionally talk to in my classes but no real connections. It definitely doesnt help that I go to an arts and design school where everyone is pretentious and wealthy. I also have the same problem with lack of funds isolating living situation living with two Chinese girls who only speak in Mandarin and feeling even worse when I go out by myself. I was wondering if you had had any success so far and what you did to change your circumstances?

984458,0,t1_chg6f9e,edit Eh its the Guardian but i just quickly looked for an article that pretty much talks about what i think but clearer and more detail.LinkBy like  i think that the majority of cars will be self driving which would make them essentially like trains but they go to and from anywhere. Get a self driving car and itll go anywhere you want instead of going to a train station getting to near where you want and then getting to the final destination another way.So instead of upgrading rail networks which is just mainly  line where trains run every  mins and where the each route can easily cost billion to build i think it makes more sense to start focusing much more on roads soon. They go anywhere can get to the destination just as fast and they wont be much worse environmentally at all since cars would be electric.So lets say by  nearly all cars are self driving what would be the point in long distance rail at that time? Getting a car would be more comfortable more convenient most likely cheapercan rent a car for like day as it is youd probably just have to pay for electricity on top of that environmentally friendlythey wont use petrol and a bunch of other reasons.HS could be worth it now but any other huge future projects wont be done until like .,london,chg6vim,2,t5_2qkog

You can stock up on bulk buys and still eat well. This one thing will probably make the biggest difference to your finances. For example you can spend a few pounds on pasta and fresh fruitveg and have lunches for a week or longer or you can spend the same money and get lunch for one day from Pret a Manger...The biggest other cost will be going out for drinks youre looking at  a drink in most places. Hard to avoid unless you opt for carring a hip flask Id also consider budgeting money for other activities because there is lots to see and do.

So rent increases are clearly now divorced from property price increases which have gone up dramatically faster than that. This means that the return from owning property is becoming increasingly bad over time and therefore the only reason to keep owning property is because you think it will continue to go up in price.

I understand that music is subjective I like plenty of obscure dance music that would never get near day time radio or the charts but Kanye is never less than interesting because he always has something to get off his chest and usually does it in a highly entertaining way.

Other sections of mixeduse such as retail having their own entrances is besides the point.I think all of the hoopla is about a specific building where the differences between entrances are extreme.Who knows? Maybe a new requirement in architecture is to create an obvious visual extreme between entrances based on income. Maybe theres a market for that?Where does it end?

In the UK where meat prices are perhaps double what they are in the US that means any attempt to recreate a genuine US diner menu ends up with dishes that are around  each. Otherwise youre going to literally be paying people to eat your food.So suddenly youre no longer in the lowpriced laidback relaxed meals sector of the market and youre pushing at the door of the lets go out for a special meal market. And if someones going out for a special meal theyll usually want surroundings a bit more impressive than those of a typical diner.Incidentally our higher food prices are one of the main reasons why eating out in general is far less common in the UK than over in the States.,london,ckalx7t,16,t5_2qkog

Many of these places are getting quite expensive now though.Further afield Barking Stratford Forest Gate Chigwell Streatham Crystal Palace Deptford Forest Hill Mitcham Lewisham are all up and coming but generally youll need to go further into town for the more fun stuff. You also find lots of students in places like Kingston or New Malden or Brentwood.And yes Croydon which once famously tried to market itself as the new Barcelona Its safe to say Croydon divides opinion but it has a lot of amenities and good transport into London.As a general rule south and east are cheaper than north and west. Similarly rents will be cheaper if you are more than mins walk from a tube station.Also if you live in council i.e. social or excouncil housing it will generally be cheaper than living in normal housing. The quality of them varies somewhat. Some council estates have a lot of private owners in them and are ugly but nice places to live. Others are ugly and unpleasant to live in. Choose wisely. For music  Camden is an obvious place to go but perhaps not to live and has a lot of live music venues like Koko and the Roundhouse.

The point of that towpath is to share it with pedestrians and too few bikeusers respect that.The approach this petition is taking though is a bit halfarsed. The reason cyclists use the towpath is because alternative routes are unsafe. Improving one junction isnt going to make the roads safer than the canal there are hundreds more unsafe roads and junctions along that route. Im a hundred times less stressed commuting by bike since I started riding on that towpath as the chance of having an accident has decreased hugely. Until an alternative endtoend route via road thats entirely segregated from motor traffic is provided then Ill continue to use the canal as will other people on bikes. One junction isnt the endtoend route and there are plenty more opportunities for an accident.Sogt We will say to them whats wrong with the road? and they wont be able to use that junction as an excuse.isnt really true.Andgt ... we can use peer pressure and other tactics to lure them off it once the alternative routes are fitter for purpose.isnt fair.

For example the British Museum usually closes at  but on Fridays its open till . Also you didnt give the exact dates youre here but the Science Museum has a late opening until about pm on the last Wednesday of each month it also has bars a DJ and loads of other cool stuff on on that particular evening and is well worth it if youre in town then.   You can still do sightseeing in the evenings. It might be a bit dark in January but most of the big attractions are lit up. Also you could try some of the evening walks or ghost tours which tend to go past some famous landmarks whilst teaching you a bit about Londons history.  If you enjoy the cinema then London has a few quirky ones such as the Rooftop Cinema Club the Underground Cinema Club at Waterloo and the Everyman Cinemas which are more normal but you do get to sit on comfy sofas and theres waiter service to your seat.

The job I worked alongside my degree wasnt particularly engaging and I felt like I was better than that. Im sexy young and smart! I deserve more! So I started doing cam work. Because everyone knows how much you can make!gt But then you think to the times you degrade yourself or jump to their commands to get that tip to earn a little more to fund that party you want to hit up this weekend. To buy this dress. To get those shoes. To cover your rent because you blew way too much last night.The problem with the above portions of your diatribe against voluntary sex work is that they were poor decisions on your part.  I know two women who currently cam one has been at it for three years the other for about a decade.  Sure they have their bad nights where one or more assholes ruin it for the rest of the crowd.  But they dont do anything they arent comfortable with and one of them even said Im going to masturbate before going to bed anyway so I might as well get paid for it!.  Like my friends no one forced you to start doing it no one coerced you and by your own admission you didnt really need to do it.  The difference between you and them are that you project the degrading things that you have done for the sake of money clothing etc or at least the things that you didnt enjoy on the rest of the sex worker populace when it certainly isnt the case for all of them.  I get that youre not explicitly stating that this is the case but the implication is there.gt By having men label you demand you dance to their wallet and sate their lust.You allow them well us as I am a man to label you because you had already labeled yourself.  When you did a little search to see what the most profitable site to join was and created your username you instantly labeled yourself as a cam girl cam slut cam whore or whatever other term the profession is referred to as.  By performing specific acts and also by declining to do others you are inherently labeling yourself by which acts you do or do not do and men see this and mimic it.  No anal?  Ok theres a tag for that.  Big titties sure theres a tag for that also.  My point is you act like men label you because we are nothing more than base animals filled with lust throwing cash at you like we would any common whore but you set yourself up into that position and you allowed them to do this to you.

3949410,0,t1_cr6gdyq,Because salaries are higher in the championship and the football is better.  In fact MLS wages other than for the top few players across the whole league are uniformly terrible What you tend to get going to the MLS  from England is the occasional end of career journeymen who cant get a game for a club in England plus the odd very faded star like Beckham and now Lampard and Gerrard out for a final payday.So for example looking just at the very poor quality Championship team I follow Lloyd Sam who couldnt get a game in a poor Leeds United Championship side  years ago currently getting games and standing out as one of the better players for New York Red Bull.Or Darren ODea  a terrible defender who struggled to make any impact at Leeds United in  and widely derided as one of our worst signings ever moving on to play a full season for Toronto the following season.  Hes back in England now as part of a terrible Blackpool side that got relegated from the Championship after a season blighted by them being unable to sign any decent players at all.As a guide MLS is probably equivalent in quality to better teams in League  our third tier or maybe the majority of sides in the Scottish Premier Division a truly terrible league.Another guide to relative player quality  Liam Ridgewell was a designated player for Portland and was selected for the MLS All Star team in .

4161255,0,t3_38e4pw,Background of this regulation This new regulation whereby new lettings are capped at  above the Mietspiegel is no new news for Germany it has been in discussions for over  years with both major parties pushing for it during the general election in Sep. Despite that investment demand for Berlin has been very strong and even increased with Berlin accounting for as much as a third of all German residential portfolio transaction volumes in the last  years although it accounts for less than  of Germanys housing stocks.Various legal experts have spoken out that this new regulation is inconsistent with the German constitution and violates the right of the owner of an asset to market it to the highest willing buyer tenant. There are various lawsuits ongoing about this.The validity of the Mietspiegel as basis for this regulation is being questioned by legal experts and landlord associations. A court in Berlin recently overturned the  Mietspiegel and a few days later the local government of Hamburg announced it no longer intended to introduce the new market rental caps at all although it has previously announced that it would introduce them. Deutsche Wohnen is taking legal action against basing this regulation on the Mietspiegel.The need for housing in key cities such as Berlin likely outweighs the need for regulation particularly given salary growth which in Berlin is above the German average.The long term impact on rents should this regulation really stay in place would be that were heading towards very stable rents. I think before that happens were likely to see a reversal of that regulation. The Netherlands and Sweden have recently deregulated their resi rental markets again because the regulations did not have the impact they were intended to have. Germanys market rental caps are unlikely going to help low income earners as intended because landlords will simply have a larger selection of betterearning potential.,london,crulcuf,9,t5_2qkog

Its just going to make that congestion worse unless we build a new A scale road leading up to it. Something down by the Woolwich ferry might work at least that would use different roads in and out.The big problem in East London though is the lack of public transport across the river. Guess how many bus services run across the river? One  the  from Lewisham to Stratford. Extending some of the routes that terminate at North Greenwich across the river and on to other useful destinations would cut the number of people who need to drive across.

I am slightly concerned that the end result will not match the pictures and wish someone would measure the widths of the lanes I am too far away.  The Lambeth Bridge design has a flaw.  It gives priority to the cycle lane over the traffic leaving the roundabout which will result in stationary traffic this will result in gridlock. Give the cycle lane priority over traffic joining the roundabout but not traffic leaving and the whole system will flow better.  The Bank junction is a mess I  dont go near it these days but remember it well. Does a redesign come under Boris  or his successor  or does it come under the other London Mayor.  The City has already introduced a blanket mph speed limit  which should be everywhere from Bow to White City and may be more open to suggestions.

This followed from the work of Willebrord Snell in  who showed how a point could be located from the angles subtended from three known points but measured at the new unknown point rather than the previously fixed points a problem called resectioning Surveying error is minimized if a mesh of triangles at the largest appropriate scale is established first. Points inside the triangles can all then be accurately located with reference to it.

I care about my tube line I want it to have a service and Im not shortermist in my goals so they can approach that as a this is why it benefits users of our service.  Instead they dont.  These safety issues are never explained but always solved with money or holiday such as that case I linked previously.  Sure it might not have been the only issue.  But it doesnt sound as if its the important one based on their actions.  Its like the will they wont they of the NYE tube.  Safety fears I remember radio interviews of the late RMT leader speaking of drunken revelers falling into the tracks.  Well tripple pay solved that safety issue didnt it?This is why the cynicism is endemic. gt These arent the arguments of someone actually listening to what someone is saying these are the arguments of someone who is hearing but not actually being open minded enough to listen and consider another point of view.Explain to me why as a user the demands of the unions will benefit me?  Why are they so unfair?  Shift patterns that are already antisocial being shifted to end at say am not am?  What is the issue?  The RMT make it very clear its about reduction of ticket office staff in that previously linked statement.  I dont give a shit about that.  Ive never used one and certainly dont need one at my local station nor does any resident when a problem is call the oyster card people and process it there when the card just beeped bad at the ticket barrier.  If the unions cared about providing a good service to customers played the long game of keeping their staff relevant theyd be pressuring TFL to allow their station staff access to the computer systems to instantly fix that rather than telling them to use a call centre.  Identifying the productive growth rather than fighting against innovation such as oyster or contactless.gt Honestly if you think that someone asking you for guarantees on shift patterns and you responding with money is a negotiation then it probably explains why you founded a company and you earn less than a tube driver.But thats it.  What can they do?  How can they provide more than TFL have offered?  The transition period they need to know that they will have staff you cant switch to such a system without time.  TFL have offered to do so until then bonus money to make up for any extra costs such as child care.  What more could realistically be done?  One of my previous jobs a death resulted in me having to come back rather swiftly from holiday its not a good situation but it had to be done it was the only viable option.  So I got bunged a few k and some first class flights to the nearest office the money was enough to redo that bit of the holiday.gt But then of course I will say HA! See? All he wanted was the money all along! Says he wanted the  tube but he is happy to accept more money. This is why I dont trust what he says. He should be shot. Hope that sounds familiar.No because there is a difference in wanting a longer service and a safety issue.Are we really equating the two?  If I ever saw any kind of safety matter that was ignored by the appropriate channels i wouldnt settle my conscious unless it was a seriously large sum of money and even then I doubt Id live with the first tragedy after my inaction.Safety issues are immutable lines they cant not be crossed they are infungible.  Preferences and desires are not they are completely fungible and transient.,london,cu0qusu,1,t5_2qkog

It would be inapropriate for a Chairman of a company to intervene in operational issues and it would be innapropriate of Boris to have done the same.

4996619,0,t3_3jcyjo,I can picture the scene. Man at bar sees lady at bar they get talking and after a little while they seem to really be into each other this is mainly because they are drinking a copious amount of vodka redbulls at  a pop because they are in a shit club lets say Cargo because only an idiot would go there. It actually turns out to be  a round because neither have cash and minimum spend in there on card is . At the end of the night she agrees to go back to his place and she nods at the idea whilst she puts away her receipts from Cargo which she will regret tomorrow. As they pull up the man looks nervously at her because she doesnt know shes going to be sleeping in a shed inside a living room. As they go in hes relived because shes exhausted and doesnt really care about the room situation and they end up probably being tools in the shed. The next day this poor woman wakes up to the sound of a familiar voice in the background yes the TV is on and its Bill Turnbull presenting BBC breakfast. As she tries to sneak off she ends up kicking the bloke in the head because there isnt any standing up height in this shed and so she has to crawl out like Steve Mcqueen trying to escape a prison. As she gets up she sees these  other people flatmates all laughing and having bants over the shit Bill Turnbull is saying because the topic is on the rising cost of living in the UK most notably in London and they couldnt believe anyone would be so stupid to live in small flats for extortionate prices...The woman leaves with shame and now has a tale that she slept in some blokes room which turned out to be a shed inside a communal living space shared by  other house mates.

There are a ton of resources to help you run a game yourself  even tables to help set up random encounters or help you build your town and dungeon without having to work it all out yourself so you can focus on the things you really want like the characters or the storyline or the big monsters. The current version of DampD Fifth Edition is pretty userfriendly for people with relatively little experience. You can also look at other systems like the Chaosium d system pretty simple to learn first game I ever ran used it.If you want to run your own a pub can be a good venue as long its one you know  so you can reliably get a booth quiet enough that you can all hear each other properly and so the management understand you might drink slowly if you get particularly caught up in something.

5527363,0,t1_cwi51a0,All right here goes. Its not gonna be as good as last time because rewriting is never as good but Ill give it a shot.First off Im an American and I have been to exactly  of those places. No one in my family has either. A few of my close friends have been to a few of those places but none have been to all and some have been to none. Other than close friends I can say with confidence but I would assume based on what I know about them that they have not been to many. So theres some anecdotal evidence using my group of friends from the Twin Cites MN.In your list theres  places that could conceivably be combined in a big New England trip Ground Zero The Statue of Liberty The Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. The rest all need a separate trip so thats  trips in all. Each of those trips is going to be several hundred dollars in gas or plane tickets for each person. There is gonna be accommodation costs too and food is gonna be more expensive plus admittance to some places souvenirs any other fun things you do on the trip etc. Then of course theres the time off from work when you or your parent are not getting paid that needs to be factored in because most people dont have many or any paid vacation days. This will negate the savings from driving instead of flying because it will take longer and therefore be more time off from work.This is all to say that youre gonna be spending a lot to make it to all these spots. Or even half to qualify for most of them. I really dont see that as being practical when the average family is in debt  and only  have at least  in a savings account.And this is assuming you even want to. I dont want to do that when I get plenty of fun going  hours up north and hiking Lake Superior and using my friends cabin or camping. Or like last weekend when I drove to Illinois to see a friend at college. Maybe Ill go to one or two of those by the time I die but its not likely Ill do too much more. And every region is gonna have local or semilocal stuff thats way more practical than going all the way to Pearl Harbor. Or heading to the east coast to see a green lady and broken bell. Or a tiny portion of a cave that the guide tells you is very big. Its just not worth it. If Im going to spend tons on a trip Im going to go visit my friends in Israel or my ancestral village of Fenyeslitke Hungary. Or literally any of the dozens of remote and exotic places Ive seen pictures of around the world. Or visit my cousins in Alabama or Arizona. These are personal examples of course but almost everyone has friends and family around the country or the world that theyd rather see than a tall tower with a disc around the top. Just replace my examples with theirs and you get the same result.The links I gave you are statistics on how many Americans have actually visited some of the places you listed and most of them are in the  range. I recommend you actually click on sources when you ask for them instead of flippantly disregarding them when someone actually delivers. Here they are againThey arent comprehensive but they show that a good chunk of Americans dont actually visit landmarks.So yeah I think I covered pretty well now why its safe to say that most Americans have only seen a few at most of your listed locations.Im not certain why you started rambling about autofellatio and futa furries and trying to make me feel like I wasted my time by actually responding to your comments. Ill assume it falls under my previous prediction that youd have some stupid retort so this was probably not worth it.And youre right. Its probably not worth it. I know that this kind of gesture makes no difference and youll just go be a jackass in another thread. But hey I like pointless internet arguments. They give me a chance to write persuasively and I dont get much chance to do so in other places. And I like arguments. So to me it wasnt a waste of time. I enjoyed it. And I hope you actually read this whole thing because you said you seriously wanted it and I put a lot of work into rewriting my other comment. It actually ended up maybe  longer this time.If you want further argumentation on this topic I can go into further detail and pull some more sources for you just let me know where you think Im wrong or unclear.,london,cwi641a,2,t5_2qkog

Were all adults we dont need to set blanket rules. We should be able to discuss and disagree on when its inappropriate to call someone racist for the sake of maintaining open and honest dialogue without denying anyone the right to ever call someone racist.For example if someone jumped in and said All black women are clearly violent and I think less of any black woman I meet for it we could all agree that calling out racism might be a necessary first step so as to avoid implicitly condoning that kind of assertively incorrect opinion from the getgo.,london,cwuf93z,4,t5_2qkog

I have not been won over as he didnt present a coherent alternative to tfl strikes or supply any sort of plan for ensuring adequate provision of affordable housing and adequate schooling.Missed a couple of trains that way then had to miss two more due to crowding.Man in front of me either has really cheap hair gel or dandruff.

5737674,0,t3_3tq1hc,Looking back I prefer the London of the s to now.  It had more interesting shops Tottenham Court Road was a row of hifi shops selling everything cheap  Carnaby St had small booths selling hand painted jackets there was a kebab place at Piccadilly  that was open   HMV megastores plus a virgin one and Tower records. Even Bayswater and Notting Hill had a more random nature now its all designer clothing and coffee shops.   It had more interesting attractions.  Funland in the Trocadero was a multi floor arcade Leicester Square cinemas were a level above your local ones.  It had empty spaces in the centre. Where the Mayors building is now was a wasteland  tramps got attacked there in American Werewolf in London  docklands was full of empty buildings.  Sounds pointless but where there is room for the expansion then you can see possibilities  now its packed to the limit.   It had old curiosities that didnt fit. Hat shops and proper book shops Borough Market was a proper fruit and veg market  Railway Arches were full of small businesses .

5744445,0,t3_3ttlmr,.  Luthers accent as with many London accents is quite hard to place exactly.  Its south or maybe east London but Idris own accent is much more neutral.  Idris accent is RP or middle class London whereas Luthers is a little rougher around the edges to make it a bit more lowermiddle class.  LutherIdris aside yes someone could be described as having a south London accent.  But someone from outside of London probably wouldnt make that distinction and just lump us all together into one accent.. I Visited the Tate not just Tate.

If youve ever been out sober in central London on a weekend youll understand why you need the five minute delay. Being able to call and say Hi Ill be parked in front of the boots across the road in five minutes or where would you like to be picked up exactly? is a skill lost on most minicab drivers.

6177584,0,t3_405od9,Everyone here has already covered most of this but as a CanadianAmerican in London for five years nowPlus London is the most exciting city in the world.  Ive lived a lot of places traveled nearly everywhere and I cant think of a city with more to do than London.  When youre living here youre in the capital of the world. If you should find yourself needing to escape London for the weekend its a short flight away to the continent and with five airports London is very well connected to every corner of Europe.  And once youre used to London prices literally everywhere in Europe will seem cheap. London is also well connected to the US more so than anywhere else in Europe.  I was in Chicago for the long weekend last weekend and it wasnt much trouble at all.   Depending on your industry London jobs pay well.  I work in financial technology and there are so many job opportunities here and a relative scarcity of talent so you can do quite well.Minus Taxes here are insane.  I pay tens of thousands more in taxes in the UK than I did in Texas.  This year after paying income tax NI stamp duty VAT and excise taxes I estimate that Ill give HMRC more than half of what I earned.   Cost of living is brutal.  I am finally buying a house but I couldnt afford to buy in London so I am buying in Suffolk instead.  Taxes and rent together generally consume at least half of the average Londoners income.   The weather is bad but maybe not as bad as everyone says depending on what youre used to.  If youre coming from Seattle you wont find it much worse.  And you rarely have to worry about the biting cold and extreme heat that youll find in many places in the US its quite temperate here.  But the endless dreariness particularly this time of year can get a bit tiresome.  Summers can be glorious though.,london,cyrtsc1,2,t5_2qkog

6276986,0,t3_41k3a1,If youre planning to take the Gatwick Express both ways buy a paper return ticket at Gatwick Airport.  Oyster is now accepted on the Gatwick Express but a paper return is cheaper.  For a single journey theres not much difference in price but Oyster is very slightly cheaper than paper I think.Of course many shops do sell Oyster cards but once youre in London you can buy an Oyster card from the ticket machines at any London Underground station.  Note if you want to buy it at Victoria you need to go down to the London Underground station rather than going to the ticket office or ticket machines in the National Rail mainline station where the Gatwick Express will arrive.Also note that most London Underground stations no longer have ticket offices only ticket machines.  There should be staff on hand to assist you with the machines if you have problems though.  Some large Underground stations do have a Visitor and Travel Information Centre too which will also sell you an Oyster card.  I believe Victoria has one but if youre arriving late at night it might not be open and if it is open it might have long queues.royI think all ticket machines on the tube now sell Oyster cards.  Its possible that there are still some older machines at small stations that wont sell Oyster cards but you should certainly be fine at a major station like Victoria.,london,cz34f34,2,t5_2qkog

They perceive you as a bad risk and do not want you on their book hoping that you will go away when given such a ridiculously high renewal price.. Insurance Premium Tax has gone up.. You are at fault. Your car vehicle rating is higher this year due to repair cost inflation.. The fact that it is stored in a secure parking space is irrelevant because car vehicle theft is low in the UK.. Other people living in E belong to a lower socialeconomic group. They are more likely to claim against you although it is not your fault. Neighbourhood with a high concentration of Personal Injury Claim lawyer is perceived to be worse. There are more staged accidents out there than you can imagine. Usual scenarios are a they flash you to go but they drive on b break very harshly usually target mums doing school run and lorry drivers c  seater car collision at mph  personal injury claims usually in the form of whiplash  followed by benefit claims due to loss of ability to work insurance companies receive bills from the HMRC  to pay for the benefits and vehicle damage.. You just moved. Not registered to vote. It is reasonable to assume that you are less familiar with the local area.Low credit score. Lower affluence level infers a higher claim propensity.More difficult to get car insurance if you are unemployed  have County Court Judgement.. Insurer changed their model without capping the maximum and minimum change in renewal premium. The insurers who cap it will quietly not renew you. If you go on comparison website they will not give you a quote because the premium looks too high.. You claimed on other insurance products underwritten by the same insurer..

When people stand they all stand on one individual step. walking people constantly take up two or more steps at a time think about the gap you leave between yourself and the guy in front so you dont tread on his feetSo you can fit double or more the amount of people on a standing only escalator. To match that with a walking only escalator everyone has to move at literally double or more the speed that the standing escalator does. Since people dont usually climb steps as fast as an escalator you can demonstrate this by walking down the stairs next to an elevator  if you dont go dangerously fast you wont beat it to  the bottom walking elevators actually result in slower overall movement of people.,london,d21rxb4,8,t5_2qkog

It has  levels with the very cosy basement being great for a live band and dancing or equally karaoke if thats her sort of thing. Ive been to lots of private events there including a wedding reception  they can provide really very decent buffet food.  Or you could have a sit down meal on the st floor Im sure.

I was also worried about needing to perform if I joined a special interest group like photography or music but everybody can enjoy eating!A smaller and more local group is more likely to have you bump into the same people at events which makes it easier to make proper friends at the same time being an open group accessible through Meetup means that there are always new people joining and preventing it from becoming cliquey.,london,d38ru5s,1,t5_2qkog

7647600,0,t1_d3ba6ol,Ill go over a few of the basic methods that weve found successful. Last week we had to fit a  story house with a combination homeplugs and repeaters because he refused to install wiring so we got to try out some home networking equipment.I usually push for proper cabling but some cases wiring is not an option.Option  HomeplugsPowerline. IF these work they are the best option after wiring. They dont always work it does depend on your home wiring but generally they are pretty good. All brands have a wireless kit which includes one wired and one wireless device this is what you probably need. And you can add more wireless points around your house if needs be.Devolos tend to be the most reliableFaster version  Although TP Link is a good brand and are very good valueOption  New router.Dont expect miracles with a new router unless the old router is very poor. You can put a  antennas on one but if theres too much interference or your walls are made of concrete they wont help much. For home purposes the brand I have had most luck with in increasing range is Asus and its what i use at home. I have an OLD dual band one which does the job you may look to buy an AC model. Option   Wireless repeater.WiFi repeaters do half the WiFi speed if they use the same channel to repeat. So you need to get a dual band one to maximise the speed assuming your router is dual band  also. If its AC speed even better. We used this model successfully in the  floor house and got very good speeds.Any questions feel free to call.,london,d3bhnsk,1,t5_2qkog

Pontius Pilate would have urged the people to vote wemain so as to awert Wowld Waw Thwee. The Peoples Front of Judea the Judean Peoples Front and the Judean Popular Peoples Front would have all campaigned to leave in between bouts of infighting. After Jesus walked on water many would have been worried that this would encourage illegal immigrants and refugees to cross the Mediterranean in a similar fashion. The cheese makers would have campaigned to leave as it was a disgrace how much foreign cheese was imported. The leave campaigns would also have promised that they could apply to principle of deeded the five thousand to stave off economic crisis and that Jesuss miracles would be replicated once they regained sovereignty. The remain campaign would have in turn accused the leave campaign of being the devil having assumed a pleasing form so as to tempt and trick the Jews into become racist and swivel eyed offering a remain vote as the path to salvation. Jesus would have told everyone to render unto Caesar that which was Caesars and render unto God that which was Gods. However neither side accepted this reasonable compromise.

Im guessing volunteer work would support that. This one   just says experience of working within a health social care or leisure setting is desirable. You will find that many NHS Trusts will sponsor you to do NVQsfoundation degrees in healthcare and possibly a degree. Another starting point would be working as a healthcare assistantnursing auxiliary and then moving up into a rehab assistant post after a year or so  that experience will be really helpful.

8307072,0,t3_4ta6lz,Mostly positive when it comes to services directly run by transport for London. Id like to see them take over rail services in the commuter belt not long distance services that run through. Some bus routes could do with more buses and be better managed  one bus I use a lot in central london often only shows up every half an hour and then two show up  but not always even though the timetable says  mins. If it stuck to the timetable it probably wouldnt be so bad. Id like to see more night buses a smallish increase in number of buses e.g every  mins instead of the half an hour standard for a lot of routes as a minimum and more routes maybe an an amalgamation of two routes as is somewhat common It would be nice if certain community run routes had timetables visible on the bus stop countdown and on the TfL website. Id also like to see more stations made wheelchair accessible  but this is ongoing work which is slowly happening as far as Im aware. None of these are major issues really.

8373239,0,t1_d5o684c,First of all I highly doubt this group was CM as its not the last friday of the month when they ride in London Anyway Its important to realise that CM isnt a group or some kind of organization with a message. CM is more of a concept its used as a tool by other groups of which there are plenty to gain attention but at a base level its literally just a chance gathering of people on bikes all who just happen to be travelling at the same place at the same time. There is no planned route or duration it just happens.It originated I believe from less developed countries where a lot of people cycle but the road infrastructure is terrible and its impossible to pass through a crossing or intersection on a bike. All the cyclists would wait and slowly increase in number waiting to get across the road safely through the messy and deadly clump of cars. Eventually a critical mass is reached where there are so many gathered up and waiting that they would be able to claim road space and move safely accross the intersection forcing cars to wait and give way purely because of the sheer size of the group. Its the safest way for the bikes to get around safety in numbers as the saying goes.There is a critical mass event in most major cities usually monthly to celebrate cycling and claim back a bit of road space for vulnerable road users.It will always be a bit abrasive drivers arent used to being forced to yield to a large group it gets used an opportunity for celebration of freedom on the road. In London the group will often take a route and stop to pay respects at the site of a recent road death and sometimes protest in the area to raise awareness for road safety one i can think of is at Bank when Ying Tao was killed by a HGV after a string of senseless HGV deaths.You can read a bit more here  ,london,d5o7ds9,6,t5_2qkog

Aka things people who fly must read.The pilot was flying VFR or Visual Flight Rules meaning his eyes are responsible for preventing him from going splat into something.  He is responsible for his separation no one else.  You cant fly IFR instrument flight rules that close to the ground because you might hit something.  You have a so called safety elevation that is shown on the charts maps each grid a square has its own minimum safety elevation clearly marked not only was he below it but the base of the cloud was far below it.  This is often referred to as scud running.  Its drummed into all students that this is a bad thing to do as its a leading killer of pilots.in IMC aka in shitty conditions Instrument Meteorological Conditions means you need to fly on instruments because you cant see very farat all.  You can only do this at safe altitudes in designated lanes which ATC monitor your progress through and are responsible for your seperation. So this crane was NOTAMd meaning he should have been aware it was there as part of the preflight planning.  He was flying VFR in IMC meaning he had fucked up big time with regard to the weather it was as forecast.  Its very sad.The lesson to be learned is one of when to say no.

From getting to Paddington to getting to the train can take up to mins depending on the amount of people at the station and it runs every mins. So in theory you could be up to mins at Paddington before you even leave. Add in the mins for the train itself and you are at mins to get to Heathrow from Paddington tube. For me sometimes it is worth it sometimes it is not. I like the express as sometimes I am short on time and the bathrooms are decent so I can get changed in them in between work and going where I am off to. For you to finish at  and be at Heathrow by  that is  doable but it tight. Tube or Express. What you take is up to you as youve a little bit if time to play with. Dont bother with cab that time of day as it could take you longer than transport. As for meeting your friend in Victoria and going to Heathrow from there. Cant be done. At all.

You are more likely to encounter racism in areas of outer London where immigrant communities are growing and displacingreplacing traditionally white working or lower middle class communities.There is some relationship between levels of antipathy towards nonBritish people and voting patterns for whether or not to leave the EU. If you click here you can click onto London and see how each borough voted. Outlying boroughs where this process of displacement of traditionally white working or lower middle class communities is most acute see much high levels of voting to leave the EU which was generally used by Brexit voters as a referendum on the wider issue of immigration. By contrast inner London boroughs where immigration and high levels of ethnic minorities are part of the fabric were more likely to voter to stay in the EU.Overall London voted much more towards proEU and by extension proimmigration than the rest of the country. It is perhaps a little simplistic to say this means London is less racist. But as a generalisation Londoners are far more accustomed to foreigners to immigration and to social change because what many parts of the UK are experiencing now London went through during waves of immigration and social change in the ssss when it was far more racist. The last of those big antiracist battles took place in the s. By  the National Front had collapsed in London and never recovered.

9218201,0,t1_d8k6sc2,The congestion charge as it works right now doesnt tackle the problem at all. Its a oneoff fee which is great at deterring private motorists who wont pay  just to run a quick errand but doesnt do anything for the other sources I mentioned. Uber drivers will happily pay  per day since they spend their whole day in the zone and get a lot of value for money out of it. Same goes for a delivery company whose vans will spend the whole day delivering in the zone.To solve the problem the congestion charge would have to be priced variably. For example  per hour spent inside the zone. That would do a lot more to deter ubers and delivery companies while having the same impact on private motorists. The problems with that are not sure if we have the infrastructure to do it would be unpopular as itd be passed on to an increase in uber fares and so on,london,d8kh3mi,1,t5_2qkog

9527037,0,t3_5a9qb6,So Im finally moving to London in March new job new city yay! and I have a few questions that experienced Londoners might be able to help with  I wont be starting work til midMarch so ideally I want to be able to rent somewhere from the beginning of the month. Its a little early to be looking now but at what stage do you think its worth starting to look in earnest? Id like to get something lined up ASAP.  I think my maximum budget is month assuming bills are included. Ill be working on Chancery Lane and I cant decide if its worth paying as much as I can to stay within half an hours walking distance which basically limits me to Southwark or going a little further out and commuting in. The Central line to Holborn  Chancery is a nightmare so it would have to be the District line to Blackfriars  Temple so Aldgate  Whitechapel and further out. But if I cant walk to work Ill need to pay   month on an oyster season ticket is it better to pay less rent by moving further out but pay to commute or paying higher rent and getting to work for free? Will I save more on rent than I pay on transport by living in an outer zone?a Following on from that my salary is going to start at k although it will be increasing over the first three years as I pass exams which is take home pay of   month. Is   month a reasonable amount to pay for rent based on that? Is it too high  too low? I know everything is more expensive in London!  How difficult is it going to be to find somewhere? Bearing in mind I dont live in London and I cant exactly nip up for spontaneous evening viewings. My understanding is the rental market moves pretty quickly. Any advice on this? Ill be able to travel up at the weekends but not during the week. Im nervous but really excited to be moving  Ive wanted to live in London for years so I cant wait! I just need to get everything sorted now.,london,d9neq42,1,t5_2qkog

That might be acceptable if it happens very rarely but if you have a lot of false positives you end up with an unreliable service running less frequently and that just isnt acceptable on what is a very busy high frequency service.Automation works really well on the tube and DLR because theyre completely separated from other vehicles and from nonmalicious pedestrians so there are far fewer opportunities for things to interfere with the automation and they dont need to be very intelligent. I cant see it working reliably enough in an environment where it has to worry about cars turning across its path cyclists drunks stumbling out of pubs children running about ...Im all for automated driver assistance such as automatic speed limit enforcement in a system that treats speeding as being like a SPAD  ie something that gets the driver a jolly stern ticking off and fired if he does it too often so they dont come to just floor it and rely on that automation to stay safe  but I cant see replacing the driver entirely.,london,d9tmwfl,1,t5_2qkog

9930523,0,t1_db1yo18,A lot of their flights through Dubai are Qantas jets. The thing about Qantas is most of their flights from Europe to Australia are As and occasionally s but typically As for the routes through Dubai that do the major routes on schedules and then have smaller planes mostly As to take you from the hubs like SydneyMelbourne to other locations. The A and the  while popular historically are just not the best way to do long haul flight. The  was good in the past when long distance flights were incredibly difficultexpensive because you could take hundreds of people making the individual cost lower hence creating the market for them. Smaller planes couldnt make these jumps before and had to rely on more stopovers which add time and cost. Recent advancements in engine efficiency and wing design mean our current jets read dreamliner can go massive distances for relatively low cost. Therefore more direct routes can be flown over longer distances. I imagine in the not too distance future places like Dubai will become less attractive as a stopover location because the more efficient jets can do the EuropeAustralia jump in one go. It may stay as a hub for more local trips but the concept of a hub airport is getting to become less of a thing globally as planes move towards smaller more efficient modelsAir travel is changing thanks to aircraft like the dreamliner and its only going to get faster and cheaper,london,db1z0ll,13,t5_2qkog

London aint that.Our roads are a nightmare  narrow crowded  autonomous vehicles will need to cope with all the cyclists motorbikes rickshaws as well as manualdriven vehicles. Not to mention having to navigate sporadic road closures from the police where the only thing indicating the road is closed is a police car blocking the way roadworks etc. Lastly lets not forget the sheer volume of pedestrians  some of whom I am sure will take to walking into the road more aggressively to cross safe in the knowledge that autonomous vehicles will stop.Autonomous vehicles will need to master simpler cities e.g. many American cities British cities like Milton Keynes before they are really credible for London.

10575150,0,t1_dd6pyki,To the USA their environment is still new and shiny and in need of protection. They value their wildlife and their natural habitats much higher than we seem to especially in London and so there is a lot more public concern for littering and pollution. I feel like in the UK we have had lush green pastures and great natural beauty for so many hundreds of years now that people have grown uninterested in maintaining it or even being conscious of its existence. With so many people concentrated in cities like London  who really actually acknowledges the natural beauty of this country cities included? People are just far too used to living in urban city environments where street sweepers and janitorial staff are prevalent throughout. People know that there is normally someone employed to pick up or clean up after them and in my experience there are still many people who believe that those doing custodialjanitorial jobs like that should have to earn their keep and work for their pay and by leaving mess they are actually creating jobs for these people. ,london,dd6qshm,4,t5_2qkog

Surely something has to give but people talk of a housing crisisshortage and the British are obsessed with owning property. Add in rich oversees investors and when it will stop becomes unclear. Especially in places like London. I think in the next  years we will see a reversal on industrialisation. That is many more people will be able to work from home offices wont exist so much and therefore people can move out of cities and to places they actually want to live. Then the prices might stop.

The pressure for clicks has pushed many news organisations to take an increasingly lax attitude to checking whether a great story is made up.

There are almost no financial penalties for this behaviour in adbased audiencescaleatallcosts publishing.

If you want to rent then there are possibilities naturally but if you want to buy then its exorbitant. I refuse to believe that that is down to a few hundred Russians buying multimillion pounds Chelsea piedsaterre.

Not added on.Also that service charge Uber actually does something for.  Running the payment processing dealing with card fraud etc.  All these things are real costs.  Then they have support dealing with refunds for when someone drunk orders an Uber to Bristol etc.  This all costs money.Uber charge as much as they think they can to the end user.  If they could charge more they would.  So having  of that subsidised no matter how you cut oh but they still charge  is still a  subsidy.

This is all well documented. gtI think at some point the thinking has switched to Too much crime is associated with music. Its too much hard work to deal with the root causes whatever they are so sod it no more music for young people. gtWhich leads to where we are today  a creatively stagnant London with continually decreasing performance space for emerging talent and underground music.This article does a frighteningly good job of showing the mechanisms of how this has been achieved.

11672945,0,t1_dgj4izx,I would argue that throwing acid at someone is always a grievous crime. Even if the injuries suffered by the victim do not stray into the realm of worst case scenarios such as blindness and severe facial disfigurement. A mandatory life sentence would act as a severe deterrent against a crime that risking hyperbole personifies sadism.One of the things I have seen suggested as a reason for the recent increase in acid attacks is that the sentences for attacking someone with acid can be less than for say shooting or stabbing someone. That coupled with the fact you can walk pretty much anywhere with a bottle and the gruesome nature of the injuries acid inflicts makes it an attractive weapon to some people.     A mandatory life sentence with a substantial tariff would make acid throwing the territory of the truly committed. It actually vexes me that David Phillips whose crime combined sadism with staggering incompetence was able to get his life sentence quashed. I dont much care for his justifications because there is no justification for throwing acid in someones face. In my mind the only issue with Phillips original life sentence was that the minimum tariff of seven years was far too low.            ,london,dgj57nh,2,t5_2qkog

11694044,0,t3_66v8gw,Hey. Im not actually a football fan at all so Im no real help for the first question but I do have one tip for the second. When your looking for a pub thats showing the game you desire I suggest downloading the app matchpint. It essentially lists which pubs are showing what matches and occasionally will offer a promotion of a free pint or snack if you sign in at the venue......by the way I dont work for match pint just to be clear haha. It might be especially helpful since there are a number of pubs that dont play sports so at least youll have it narrowed down. Once you have a shortlist of pubs to consider check out some online reviews maybe to cross reference? Hope you enjoy your time over the pond with us!,london,dgljdsh,-1,t5_2qkog

11697529,0,t1_dglv9oa,gtWhat doesnt make sense is the group of  cyclists zooming down a service road next to a freeway blowing a stop sign forcing me and other vehicles who were about to make a legal rightofway turn onto the road to skid to a stop then scream at us and flip us off as they blow past.Lets break this down a little. If youre about to make a turn youre at a stop sign you have right of way and you can see cyclists coming at a given speed this also means other vehicles arent about to go because only one car at the stop can have right of way. If its your turn to go then you need to go not sit there or signal a different driver to go ahead of you. But even in cars we dont always follow the rules of the road so sometimes we signal to others and sometimes we go out of turn when were signaled.Now both you and the cyclists can control your speeds in the sense that they can slow down and stop if theres timeneed and you can accelerate quickly andor stop. You can also signal each other your intentions with blinkers arm signals and just the general speed youre moving the direction youre looking etc.So to restate the situation youve described youre at a stop sign and have right of way theyre still heading in the direction they were and probably expect you to just go and get out of the way. They can then slow down or adjust speed and pass through in a way that doesnt inconvenience anyone. If they come to a complete stop and then go through with normal right of way its going to take everyone longer to get through the intersection because they cant accelerate like a car can.You can go for it and expect them to adjust or you hesitate go and then stop because they saw you not going and thought you were letting them go.Something I see literally every day is that cars pull up to a stop and just sit there as a cyclist approaches instead of making their turn or passing through the intersection when they have right of way. This in turn requires the cyclist to either a slow down further and then spend more time innear the intersection because they cant accelerate the way a car can which itself makes intersections more dangerous for them to be innear or b continue on and blow the sign in front of a car that has stopped.If I slow down to approach a stop sign that you reach before me and then you stop and sit at it watching me approach despite being able to pass through the intersection before I would even reach the stop sign Im just going to keep going at my current speed and run it in most scenarios where I know Im not going to get hit. Same thing if Im in a car and you signal me to go despite you having right of way. Following the rules of the road is important inasmuch as its a set of behaviorsactions that everyone can be expected to perform. If everyone is acting predictably and can respond safely to each others actions the rules themselves dont actually matter.So sure it sucks that you feel inconvenienced by cyclists misreading your intentions but it sucks a lot more when that misreading leads to your four thousand pound vehicle destroying theirs and injuringkilling them in the process.,london,dglxm2p,0,t5_2qkog

11707906,0,t1_dgm58ag,It says that pedestrians have precedence over vehicles. Obviously in a car unless its a very wide crossing they physically cannot enter the crossing when there is someone still using it without contravening the law. However a bike is more narrow so they can still use the crossing without contravening the law. This is what I am referring to with regards to leeway.,london,dgn4d9j,1,t5_2qkog
11707939,0,t1_dglqjbp,I think anyone who calls a cyclist a bastard for pulling out in the seconds between all movement ending and the lights changing has never experienced riding down Newgate Street with a double decker ft up their arse trying to do mph a car about  inches to the right and parked vehicles taking up every bit of room between the potholes on the cycle lane.Those seconds can mean the difference between being boxed in like that praying you dont make the tiniest mistake and having a relatively safe and clear road to cycle down. Those boxes at the front of the traffic... all they serve to do is put you at the front of all the cars so that when youre building up to a comfortable mph everyone else is either trying to climb up your unshielded arse or is steadily getting irate and preparing to trap your fingers in between your handlebars and their wing mirror.I had a Hackney cabbie shatter my pedal one time because he couldnt wait for me to go find a spot on Moorgate to get through to the front. No instead he decided to squeeze in beside me where the road narrows. Shattered my pedal right off the bike and I was riding the metal part the pedal was attached to until I could replace the plastic part. I was lucky that wasnt my foot.Im hardly blaming all drivers for the assholery of a few.
