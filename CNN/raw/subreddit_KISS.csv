639928,0,t3_21cbm3,I think the band is ten times better without Ace amp Peter and I think Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer are by far the best musicians the band has ever seen. Kiss shouldnt perform with Ace amp Peter for the RampR hall of Fame,KISS,cgd0dw1,-1,t5_2qoqb

1772978,0,t3_2es7tu,Even though the state of record sales is ridiculous this is still a great accomplishment and Im really happy for Ace.

2168565,0,t1_clfgx3a,Im in agreement that Bruce is indeed the last sole connection to KISS. Hes always remained a class act since leaving the band. Hes a rather refreshing soul in the music industry. He does what he loves lives his life to the fullest and it appears that he will always truly relish the opportunity to have been a part of the biggest band in the world. I had goosebumps when I heard Hide Your Heart live again on this past tour they did with Def Leppard. I hadnt heard it live since the actual HITS tour. If youre not following Bruce on Facebook I recommend that you should. He constantly updates the KISS fans and the fans of his music. Thursdays are generally the best because he tends to post a lot of Throwback Thursday pics.  The world truly needs more Bruce Kulicks. ,KISS,clfh437,3,t5_2qoqb
3136371,0,t1_con2vq8,Noticing my list its kind of funny as I see where I somewhat wasnt listing to KISS as much in the eighties hence most of my top songs were just the main MTV stapleshits.  Whereas on the earlier stuff it wasnt the typical Deuce and Rock N Roll All Nite.  Couldnt find anything to put under Carnival as I never liked it.  Monster I thought was a decent album.  I think Tommy nailed Outta This World although Id like to see him do a song not necessarily space man if that makes any sense.,KISS,con2y2i,2,t5_2qoqb

5373931,0,t1_cvyjy5n,I agree that Ace did very little to help promote COTN a couple of photo shoots maybe??? An appearance for the I Love It Loud video and thats probably about it.I read an article this past weekend regarding the release of COTN. I found this section of the article to be kind of interestingKISS record label Casablanca had been bought by Polygram. Part of that deal included some major guarantees for KISS who stopped turning a profit right about the time Neil Bogart started blowing on the ink the signatures were signed with. At the time of the deal it wouldnt have seemed an issue but the new deal contained one little loophole in Polygrams advantage. If KISS ever had fewer than three founding members Polygram could back out of the deal. And in  that would not be good for KISS who had already dismissed original drummer Peter Criss two years earlier. So Ace leaving the band would afford Polygram a get out of jail free card on a one sided deal with a band that seemed to be on the brink of demise. In an effort to hoodwink the powers that held the keys to the KISS bank account Gene and Paul Demon and Starchild for post  fans worked out some sort of secret deal with Ace for him to do some promotion and be on the album cover.

5576098,0,t1_cwo8eua,...at that time where most of the biggest bands in rock were heavily influenced by them.I agree with you. Kim Thayil from Soundgarden often tipped his hat to KISS as an influence as did Dave Grohl. Metal Edge? Geez I cant even remember the last time that I even thought about that magazine. The one thing that always sticks out with me was that Gerri Miller from Metal Edge was in almost every single photo with the bands that she was interviewing at the time. ,KISS,cwo9m5j,1,t5_2qoqb

5625317,0,t1_cwuccp6,Back in  Peter Crisss solo album was the only one that my parents liked because it was kinda sorta their genre of music.To paraphrase an old saying If your parents dig it its no longer dangerous. From what Ive always understood back in the day KISS the registered business entity not the band owned the rights to the characters known as Spaceman and Catman. Disclaimer to all By no means am I an expert regarding all of the ins and outs regarding the business aspects of KISS. If someone with more knowledge in this field would chime in that would be great. As of October  Paul Stanley did say this in regards to Ace amp Peter selling their rights to the charactersimages that they created.  ,KISS,cwudh70,2,t5_2qoqb

8647928,0,t3_4ycbgv,I see where he is coming from.  Poses some interesting questions.  I have no doubt that if Paul and Gene asked Ace and Peter to tour again they both would in a  heartbeat.  But I still question whether something like that is even physically possible.  I think Ace would be up to the task but Im not so sure about Peter.  What this guys says does make some sense and I would surely like to see it.  Then again if it is a halfhearted show like the end of the Farewell Tour was then Id much much rather see the current line up do a Farewell tour.I personally dont think KISS will ever do a Farewell tour again.  I think they will slowly limit some of their shows do some one off appearances and then eventually replace each of the members with someone younger over a slow process.  But who knows.  This article was definitely interesting.  Thanks for posting as always FrehleyFan!,KISS,d6mlplf,7,t5_2qoqb

9994845,0,t1_db9tb54,Im kinda with the journalists on this one. A large part of Kiss appeal has always been the visual aspect. During the original era Kiss looked super cool but after they traded the greasepaint for lipstick and mascara they looked like super ugly women to me. None of them looked good but GampP were the worst IMO.Its not like they were Poison or some of the other glam band dudes who could pull it off because they resembled attractive women when they were all dolled up. Nope... Gene and Paul couldnt pull off that look. Donald Trump definitely would not date any of them.,KISS,dbacuah,2,t5_2qoqb

11437002,0,t1_dfsaxfh,Glad to step in here FrehleyFan!Blathersmuseum basically how it works is that you purchase the KISS Armypresale package.  That will enable you to get the presale code and sale date of the tickets.  This presale will be a day or two BEFORE the general public tickets go on sale.  This is through Ticketbastards.  If I remember correctly they will email you the presale code usually a day or two before that presale date.  It is then just a matter of logging in to Ticketbastards and waiting til the time when they go on sale and clicking immediately to purchase the tickets.For me I was able to get front row almost dead center but they did sell out very quick.  I checked again about  minutes later and the first three rows were filled already.  So make sure you block out some time to be on the Ticketbastard site that morning.Youll get your confirmation email later and then about two days before the show they will send you an itinerary of where to meet ticket pick up etc...  For the price yes it is about  which is quite an amount of cash I do admit.  For me  and I did this about  months ago  I dont regret it one single bit.  It was one of the most awesome things I have ever done.  Would I do it again?  Possibly.  Its kind of like seeing the Grand Canyon a second time.  Totally awesome but not sure if it would have the same affect on me.  And as user FrehleyFan mentioned here is the link to my Meet and Greet post on this sub six months ago.Best of luck!,KISS,dfsdfwe,2,t5_2qoqb
