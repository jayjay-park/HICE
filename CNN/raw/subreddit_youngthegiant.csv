5525758,0,t3_3qscpi,Some backstoryI took a trip out to Colorado in September of  to explore and experience the Rocky Mountains in Fall and planned my trip to see Kings of Leon at Red Rocks. I had heard of Young The Giant but never listened to them and tossed them off as some generic wanna be Fall Out Boy type band. Kongos opened the show then Young the Giant came on. Im a pretty harsh music critic and a band has to be really tight to impress me their first time. They blew me away. Kings of Leon played one of the best shows of their lives and the best thing from that concert was falling in love with Young the Giant. ,youngthegiant,cwhyr9r,1,t5_2vf03
