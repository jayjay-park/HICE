4192909,0,t1_cry51te,I was told I had tendonitis about  yrs ago. I was in the Army so I was handed ibuprofen and sent along my way. Im assuming whatever is wrong with my knees started with that at least.Sitting with crossed legs makes my knees painfully stiff both straight and indian style. Squatting makes them audibly crack. Overuse  i.e. walks runs climbing stairs etc  makes them feel really sore and I get a deep throbbing pain. Just enough to keep me awake at night and it lasts for several weeks. My right knee always hurts the worse.If I run too much when it hurts like this my knee will get really tight like theres a vice tightening on it. It feels like somethings gonna snap. Thats a scary sorta pain.Ive talked to docs about it and I guess we all agreed its my IT band cause the pain is always on the outside of the knee and wraps around to underneath the knee cap.I havent been consistent on the exercises like I wanted to be but I can say they helped. Im at the point where doing the exercises will keep the pain away all day. Im outta the Army now and havent done much running. Theres no more constant pain in my knee but it still gets stiff if I cross my legs. Id very much like to get to the point where they dont get stiff or painful at all regardless of how I sit but for now I just shift positions a lot.I hope this info helps good luck with your knees and lemme know if you need clarification on any details.,kneepain,cry6uvd,1,t5_30tpp
10224226,0,t3_5fsn4c,Sounds like patelofemoral pain syndrome. it is caused from tight lateral quad muscles and from weak medial quad muscles. This causes the knee cap to track over the wrong part of the bone underneath it causing popping and pain. ,kneepain,dc2z1s7,2,t5_30tpp
