It seems like nowadays everyone focuses too hard on making the wittiest lines instead of giving a complete story with style. Im not saying witty lines need to take a hike but when you continue to sacrifice flow and grace to make a shitty reference beating around the bush of a topic for verses at a time. Its mildly annoying. Rap also has a glass ceiling. THATS BEEN CREATED BY THE ARTISTS AND THE CULTURE ITSELF. Granted this is prominent in every genre but i tend to notice it more in Rap. There is no valid reason why Kendrick Lamar cant be considered better than Big and Pac. Its the culture that cant accept that Pac and Bigs time has come and gone. So they continue to say that nobody will ever be better than them. But fail to see the flaws in their music that Kendrick has outdone so far inbetween O.verly D.edicated and Good Kid Maad City.But again critics just want to assassinate the character of the culture without any nonyoutube parody knowledge of this beautiful thing that millions of people love ,lewronggeneration,cel8gqi,7,t5_2y7lu

194897,1,t3_1wbv4l,I just stumbled onto this subreddit and Im thinking maybe Im in the wrong place.Are you guys hating on the old prog rock fans? For what its worth youre not going to find a more defensive fanbase.Of course theyre going to hate the fact that Kanye samples prog songs and reduces what they see as the pinnacle of artistry in popular rock music to a looping beat.You would hate it too if someone took a piece of art you loved cut it to pieces and used it in a way you disliked. It would only be salt on the wound to have crowds of people come by and gawk dismissing the relevance of the original work or generally not giving a shit.I happen to be a fan of s prog rock and rap and it definitely makes me a bit uncomfortable with Kanye sampling it. I was taken aback when I heard King Crimson in a modern song. Its kind of cool but at the same time it cheapens the original in my opinion. All of the sudden its not one of the most important songs in rock history but that old song Kanye sampled. And when the popular perception shifts like that its easy for the real historical significance to be lost.Edit For what its worth Im .

I did the same thing with a lot of other rock n roll gods too e.g. Jimi Hendrix and Clapton buy all their All Music Guideacclaimed albums proceed to listen only to the hits.

721409,0,t1_cgm3guw,Also Id like to point out that most of the people who complain about Pollock and that have never actually seen up close and in real life any of their work. I saw a painting by Larry Poons that was just a flat yellow canvas with some faint grid lines almost pencilled in and in each grid square there was an aquamarine dot. When described it actually sounds really boring and kinda like what but when you see it in real life on this xm canvas it just comes to life play tricks with your eyes. Ive forgotten the name of it It might have been something about a Chinese poet or a starry sky at night but it was an amazing experience to just stand there and stare at. The accompanying information plaque mentioned that this painting was Poons interpretation of a constellation and that he would have liked to be an astronomer but was never great at math. I feel like if some of these modern art is all crap people actually took the time to go to a modern art exhibit theyd actually quite enjoy it. ,lewronggeneration,cgma01z,3,t5_2y7lu

Hell it even changed the face of smut  Shades of Grey Gray? began as a Twilight fan fic. More people have tried to capitalize on the success of Twilight than on the success of Harry Potter from what I can tell probably because Harry Potter is such a daunting franchise to try to rip off. gtmade a ton of kids actually enjoy readingIm not sure about this. I think the kids that were super into Harry Potter would have been super into reading anything. Im not sure how old you are but I was in th or th grade when the last book came out.

1050980,0,t1_chnqqo4,lots of detail and great pixeling  good artistic vision.  I dislike MSothers art styles largely because they seem like a ton of detail competing for the players attention that make more of a wow le pixel art is WELL DRAWN atmosphere than I would like.Secret of Mana is also generally held in the same esteem of metal slug for attention to detail except I think that it holds a better atmosphere and vision than the metal slug games.  Still kind of just a generic JRPG atmosphere though just well done for that.Used to be an aspiring game artist so I studied a lot of pixel art and came to the conclusion of treating pixel art based on its context with the other art assets and the game itself rather than on a single spritebysprite basis.  Realized Im more of a music person and while my drawing skills have basically receded back to nearly nothing over the past year or two I still find it fun to critique game art based on what I learned from the experience.,lewronggeneration,chnr1un,4,t5_2y7lu

Although theres crossover acts such as Disclosure. Underground club nights and parties are still the same. I personally think EDM is a music bubble. It happened when disco got poppier it happened with pop house and such in the early s and it happened with the big beat explosion in the late s. ,lewronggeneration,chnzb46,2,t5_2y7lu

1174132,0,t1_ci1n1st,gtIt is a double standardLook the nword is a racial slur. Its hate speech. And it is a word that is specifically used against black people to dehumanize them and oppress them. White people have used this word for hundreds of years to verbally attack black people. Thats why its not considered okay for white people to use that word.When black people say it its different because the context is different. Black people cant oppress themselves with their own racial slur. By using it to refer to fellow black people they are reclaiming the word for their own usage.The word has completely different connotation depending on whos saying it. The fact that its not socially acceptable for you to drop racial slurs is not a double standard. Black people arent obligated to give you a pass on your use of hate speech just because they use the same word in a different context. Your reasoning is extremely juvenile like a kid who sees his mommy and daddy drinking wine and throws a tantrum when they say he cant have any.,lewronggeneration,ci1pkkz,47,t5_2y7lu

Conditions may apply.Marasy    Really if you dont recognize the name theres nothing for me to tell you. Its his latest album from Reitasai .YUI  Cant Buy My Love  She has a cute voice. The vocals have strength and the band is solid. Other excuses. Its jpop.The Naked and Famous  Passive me Aggressive you  I thought they were some cheery summer indie rock band. Lets just say I was wrong. The singers are good and the production is cool happy with a bit of eery atmosphere.Lowpass  Trimurti  Great math rock. Its not as math as Tera Melos or Giraffes Giraffes bit more rocky but definitely good. Good introduction to the genre as well the rockgtmath aspect makes it easy to approach.Haruka Nakamura  Melodica  Seriously one of my favourite albums. Smooth relaxing acoustic guitar combined with drums and a piano. Hip hop elements throughout some songs featuring rappers. Definitely a love letter to the late Nujabes. amp Len  Asymmetry  If I had guilty pleasures this would be it. Thankfully I dont so I can just say I love her.MIRROR  On Then In  Math rock. Extremely relaxing nothing crazy going on the acoustic guitar is as soothing as the harps of angels. Good for background music wouldnt call it interesting enough to listen to on its own.Cloud Nothings  Attack on Memory  Okay so I havent really listened to this album that much just the song Our Plans on loop. And thats a damn good song. I love bands where the singer really shows emotion and this guys got it.

1940592,0,t1_ckn0s0w,Oh no I definitely get that. But also keep in mind this idea that kids only text and never hang out thing is probably really overblown I also dont have science to back that up. Texting is just a way of talking to friends when theyre not around. You could conceivably make an argument that texting actually forms stronger friendships in some cases. Hear me out. Before texting there was either the class period or two where you were together then you might be able to hang out a few times after school and on the weekends. Maybe a phone call or two to arrange plans or catchup. Now I can talk to someone and conceivably get a response anytime within reason. No waiting for the  minute switch between classes to run over and give a rushed  second update on whatever is going on. No having the mom answer the phone at his house and tell me Jimmys not here right now. No confusion or ambiguity. If theres a fight I can clear it up right away without going through some immature bullshit silent treatment or waiting until were forced to see each other again or anything like that. And the method of communication is good too. Theres no obligation for the person to respond right away so Im not constantly in their ear demanding a response like a real conversation. I take up no important time of theirs. They respond on their own time whenever they can or feel like it. Just some thoughts.,lewronggeneration,ckn1cj4,3,t5_2y7lu

2702620,0,t1_cnb9vq2,The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as the greatest or most significant or most influential rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else not true by the way therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.In a sense the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole too much attention paid to commercial phenomena be it grunge or U and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels distributors and record stores. They simply highlight what product the music business wants to make money from.Hopefully one nottoodistant day there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley who never sold much and commercial products like the Beatles. At such a time rock critics will study their rock history and understand which artists accomplished which musical feat and which simply exploited it commercially.Beatles Aryan music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody and lusty negro attitudes with cute whitekid smiles.Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles and for good reason. They could never figure out why the Beatles songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon thanks to Beatlemania which had nothing to do with their musical merits. That phenomenon kept alive interest in their mediocre musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than say the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon amp McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the Fab Four. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer capable of entire operas such as Tommy and Quadrophenia not to mention the far greater British musicians who followed them in subsequent decades or the US musicians themselves who initially spearheaded what the Beatles merely later repackaged to the masses.The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses it had no difficult content it had no technical innovations it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented Beatlemania in  you would not have wasted five minutes of your time reading this comment about such a trivial band. ,lewronggeneration,cnba0a6,0,t5_2y7lu

3286592,0,t3_2xs94o,x of last week What am I even listening to edition.Just in case you really want to know what weird alt pop Im into right now Yelle Pop Up Im kind of in love with this album. Its in french but I dont really care about lyrics anyway. This album is an irredeemably upbeat fest of ableton live. There are some problems with it the production is kind of weak for one but that makes me like it more. I can listen to it and think I could totally make this. Its a confidence boost. I dont know how I found this album. Moby Innocents This record is a bunch of pads with voice samples and occasional live singing. It has a really nice peaceful feeling to it and it doesnt ask much of you. Most certainly one of my favorites. I dont know how I found this album. Ulver Shadows of the Sun Ulver is a black metal band that decided to give up on metal and just make really chill electronic music. This album is almost like the soundtrack to a film. It stays quiet and slow a lot of the time and the singer sounds like hes trying not to wake up someone sleeping in the recording room. Its great. I dont know how I found this album. Kimbra Vows I just needed a bit of kimbra in this time of my life. Blockhead Interludes after Midnight I dont like this album quite as much as the music scene but its still pretty great. Its a little collection of happy warm memories from Blockheads life living in Manhattan. Also smoke signals is catchy af Misterwives Our Own House This album starts off really cool and happy but then kinda stops. I was kinda bored by it. Enya The Memory of Trees This album is relentlessly soothing. Listen before bed. Bjork Vespertine I like Vespertine. Its my third favorite Bjork album after Volta and Debut. The nice whimsical feeling this album has really strikes a chord with me. I like whimsical indie pop. Blockhead Downtown Science This album actually kind of grew on me after a while. Ill have to think for a while before trying to rank blockheads again. This album is grim but is has an atmosphere to it as well as some of the only instances of Blockhead trying to be hectic and intense. Its a good album but not mood music.x for this month Studio killers edition,lewronggeneration,cp2wbrf,2,t5_2y7lu

I wouldnt say that social media itself causes troubles in relationships so much as incompatibility in social media use does.

3647194,0,t1_cq808rg,ampampampSection .  election of article  AntiCatholicism in the United States sfw gtA key factor that affected the vote for and against John F. Kennedy in his  campaign for the presidency of the United States was his Catholic religion. Catholics mobilized and gave Kennedy from  to  percent of their votes.  Some Protestant spokesmen such as Norman Vincent Peale still feared the Pope would be giving orders to a Kennedy White House.  To allay such fears Kennedy kept his distance from church officials and in a highly publicized confrontation told the Protestant ministers of the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September   I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Partys candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters  and the Church does not speak for me.  He promised to respect the separation of church and state and not to allow Church officials to dictate public policy to him. Kennedy counterattacked by suggesting that it was bigotry to relegate onequarter of all Americans to secondclass citizenship just because they were Catholic. In the final count the additions and subtractions to Kennedys vote because of religion probably canceled out. He won a close election The New York Times reported a narrow consensus among the experts that Kennedy had won more than he lost as a result of his Catholicism  as Catholics flocked to Kennedy to demonstrate their group solidarity in demanding political equality.gtInteresting Oregon Compulsory Education Act | Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act | Sidney Johnston Catts | Les Balsiger activist Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcqyn oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecqyn.

4899655,0,t1_cuc3tis,Im not going to release my location as at least one of the kids that I have talked to at the schools browses Reddit. I work as a TA for AP classes STEM extracurriculars and that kind of stuff. Two middle schools and one elementary and high school respectively. The high school was my favorite as the middle schoolers tried too hard to act like adults and I have a problem with small children.These are mostly from actual teachers but I have seen myself a couple of these. Ill mark thoses.. Hallway first day of school. A couple of the eighth grade popular children were ganging up on one of the seventh graders. They were doing that IRL meighmeigh where they point at someones non  dollar Air Jordans and yell WHAT ARE THOSE. About as annoying as it sounds.  The ring leader of the group kneels down to do it. The seventh grader looks like he is about to cry. Then he grabs the ringleaders Hitler Youth haircut and slams it against the lockers. One of the other eighth graders was able to land a couple punches before one of the teachers in the nearby classroom was able to break it up.  The ringleader then posted a picture of himself on Instagram with the caption some kid hit me for no reason or something similar.. Slap Ass Friday. Exactly what it sounds like. I saw a seventh grader most would label a swagfag readpopular walk up and slap some girls ass. She told him to stop in that cutesy voice that girls do when they dont seen to actually mean what they say then he did it again. I walked over to him and told him to cut it out. Then he gave me a look so smug that even rcirclebroke would turn red in the face and said  I saw it on Vine so its okay.  I would have punched him right then and there if it wouldnt have gotten me in a world of lawsuits. I took his ass to the front office for that shit.More to come. Last year there was a clique of particularly sketchy seniors n the school I was volunteering at. Most were known for having cigarettes and the like and a few were busted for having weed.  After one kid in the group had told the principal about the kids who had drugs on them there was a campaign on multiple social medias to freename. Earlier that year there was a similar campaign to allow yoga pants in school. One kid told the vice principal and was beat up after school for it.I decided not to volunteer at that school anymore. There have also been multiple kids who have told me to go fuck myself after I have taken their phone away midclass. I also have an official Twitter hate page and Im not even a qualified full time teacher.,lewronggeneration,cuc5287,5,t5_2y7lu

Beat matching is also a pain in the ass to learn and you need to know how to transition songs and be able to read the mood of a crowd to know what song you should play next.

6211800,0,t3_40mwah,Wow this sub just never ceases to amaze me. This just might be the worst post yet. Is this supposed to be funny? Because it just isnt. How can you honestly sit there and tell me music hasnt been going downhill since Queen RIP Freddy Mercury. Do you even know what real music is? All this shit about moms lasagna and ladybugs is just complete and utter garbage. You hear songs from the s and s that are still so iconic they are featured all the time. Todays music just doesnt have that staying power. It is just formulaic filth that panders to whatever todays youth is into. You think you can honestly sit there and tell me people will still be listening to Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj  years from now? Yeah fucking right. You still hear we are the champions by queen at every single sporting even in the world. No song made today will last anywhere close to that long. And wheres the emotion? Wheres the feeling? Back in my day artists actually put thought into what they wrote. And thats just it. Todays artists dont even write their own songs anymore. They get some guy with a degree in bullshit who makes money engineering these meaningless but catchy songs that rake in millions only because the record companies are forcing radio stations to play them every ten seconds to get them stuck in peoples heads so that is all they can think of. This simply didnt happen in the s. People made songs based on how they were feeling. And guess what their music also had impacts on what was going on in the world. You guys have probably never heard of him but there was this indie guy named John Lennon who wrote a song about imagining the world without any violence. Now thats the type of stuff we need in todays music. Something to inspire the youth to do something good. Thats why kids are always getting in so much trouble now. The music is telling them to fuck everything that moves and beat the shit out of each other. So they do it. No questions asked.And dont even get me started on todays celebrity worship. Do we really need to know every time Kim Kardashian is taking a shit? Seriously who gives a fuck what those idiots are doing. Why are they even famous in the first place? And all this obsession with technology is driving us into idiots. You see with the most recent facebook scandal how easy it is for them to manipulate you. Do you guys even realize that facebook was designed for college students? Anyone under the age of  should not be allowed on it. Simple as that. I think you should be required to register with a .edu email when creating an account. That also keeps out the idiots that cant get into college and the poor people that cant afford it. And back in my day we didnt even need facebook if you wanted to contact someone you had to call their house. And guess what if they werent home you didnt talk to them. We also had to memorize each others phone numbers by heart. Kids these days have it too easy putting everyones numbers in their phones. And twitter is even worse. what is the point of these things? Seriously I dont get it. They are just made up catchphrases that make you sound stupid. And what is with advertisers trying to get me to use them? Like when a couple guys are going hiking and spot some wildlife and you see ladybugs. Stop popping those things up in the middle of my show. I dont fucking care!Now I know you guys all agree with everything I just said but are going to down vote me anyway to try and fit in with the group. And thats fine. But listen to this first. Todays music is ruining this planet. Pretty soon there will be riots in the streets that will make Rodney king Dwarf in comparison. Freddy Mercury will rise from the dead and lead the charge in murdering Mark Zuckerberg the Kardashians Justin Bieber and every other trendy celebrity that is ruining the youths. It will be called the modern cleansing where a new renaissance will emerge. We will see Davinci and Michelangelo rise again and bring new artistic beauty in this world. And you will all see just how bad it really was.,lewronggeneration,cyvpqny,44,t5_2y7lu

When people rightly point out how those jokes are vapid and most likely inspired by the joke tellers conscious or subconscious bigotry theyre consistently met with a torrent of hurr durr triggered PCpolice SJWs take a joke.So you turn it around with some serious hyperbole like kill all men and watch the hurr durr triggered types who are predominantly white dudes flip their fucking shit.

Aim for seinenmeans youth which are targeted at the adult age demo.Some are always going to be better than others but theyre much more serious and grown up unless of course its the comedy genre where ridiculous is necessary. Some recommendationsBaccano  Italian mobster setting. Violent. Very story driven.Mushishi  Relaxed story of a wandering traveller that deals with spirits. Very calming to watch. Each episode is different. No overarching story so each can be viewed standalone mostly.ERASED  Murder mysterytime travelabused child story. Recently extremely popular. Quite emotional.One Punch Man  Action driven comedy hero series. Violent. Bloody. Funny. Ridiculous.It all depends on what youre looking for really. Anime has the same diversity of content youll find in movies there are anime made for children adults theres terrible and good and theres the cashcows being milked to death.It gets a bad rap from some annoying cringey kids in school unfortunately which people then use to dismiss it all without ever having actually taken a look for themselves.

9046682,0,t1_d7z5fjh,To be fair Lincoln was pushed into stating that opinion by Douglas because at the time being a nonracist was a pretty radical position. I think that the mans actions tend to speak a bit louder than his words and in that he may not have been as vociferous as the most radical Republicans Tad Stevens comes to mind but his antislavery views were why the South seceded and he went way above and beyond repairing the country which is essentially what his successors did more or less punting on the race issue by among other things pushing the th Amendment through Congress to make it clear that no matter what we were never as a country going back to slavery.Its also worth noting that Lincoln also succeeded in pushing Douglas to a doctrine of popular sovereignty on slave states which itself wound up causing the Democratic party to split in  Douglas won the nomination but future Confederate general John Breckenridge ran as a rd party candidate and definitely helped Lincoln to win technically the two got a larger share of the popular vote combined than he did although there is a huge caveat that Lincoln was not allowed on the ballot in some Southern states.

All were forced to admit to having a mental illness and agree to take antipsychotic drugs as a condition of their release. The average time that the patients spent in the hospital was  days.

10051701,0,t1_dbhngy9,So most of this comment is just incoherent wankery but Ill focus on the one factual claim you actually made that refugee flows into Europe are associated with an alarming increase in crime rates.First the premise here is simply false. We can quibble about the details and play various studies or subgroup analyses off against each other but its clear at the least that the effects of refugee flows on crime are so small that if they exist at all they can only be detected through elaborate statistical techniques the alarming crime wave simply does not exist.Second even if it were shown that refugees commit more crimes this wouldnt necessarily show that refugees are somehow predisposed to be criminals. It could just as easily be and no doubt partially is that refugees have limited economic opportunities and tend to be packed into crimeridden neighbourhoods. If so then were effectively pointing to the mistreatment of refugees to justify the mistreatment of refugees.Third and crucially... so what? Why should we be more concerned about crime in Germany than crime in Syria? Would it be justified if say Connecticut started deporting its criminals to Louisiana? Why would Connecticut citizens be entitled to protect themselves from crime by subjecting Louisiana citizens to it in their stead? The whole discussion rests on a completely unjustified and frankly evil assumption that the safety of people like us is more important than the safety of others. This is exactly what I had in mind when I said that crude nationalism necessarily underlies closedborder ideology.,lewronggeneration,dbhrg27,19,t5_2y7lu

Which many libertarians love to claim private industry could do better.Okay Ill address the other programs. SSI Medicare and so on are policies and programs by and large intended to improve accessibility to services to vulnerable people. Boosting aggregate demand is a poor economic justification for them which seems to be your argument. We dont dont build and maintain roads and government schools in order to put money into the economy if we wanted to achieve that we could use much less expensive measures e.g. monetary policy.gt This is a basic economics theory known as the velocity of money. Poor people spend much more of their income because they have to to survive.Its been a while since the last time you opened an economics textbook hasnt it? What youre describing here is poorer people having a higher marginal propensity to consume not velocity of circulation which is a different economic concept.gtIf that income isnt being put into the economy it doesnt take a genius to tell me what happens next does it?Increased saving leading to more investment?gtThis is another problem I have with libertarians. You respond to every critique of your bullshit ideology with hyperbole and logical fallacies. Dont throw stones when you live in a glass house.

11780884,0,t1_dgveg0n,gt what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitchI dont give a fuck who you are or where you live. You can count on me to be there to bring your fucking life to a hellish end. Ill put you in so much fucking pain that itll make Jesus being nailed to a cross in the desert look like a fucking back massage on a tropical island. I dont give a fuck how many reps you have or how tough you are IRL how well you can fight or how many fucking guns you own to protect yourself. Ill fucking show up at your house when you arent home. Ill turn all the lights on in your house leave all the water running open your fridge door and not close it and turn your gas stove burners on and let them waste gas. Youre going to start stressing the fuck out your blood pressure will triple and youll have a fucking heart attack. Youll go to the hospital for a heart operation and the last thing youll see when youre being put under in the operating room is me hovering above you dressed like a doctor. When you wake up after being operated on wondering what ticking time bomb is in your chest waiting to go off. Youll recover fully from your heart surgery. And when you walk out the front door of the hospital to go home Ill run you over with my fucking car out of no where and kill you. I just want you to know how easily I could fucking destroy your pathetic excuse of a life but how Id rather go to a great fuckng length to make sure your last remaining days are spent in a living breathing fucking hell. Its too late to save yourself but dont bother committing suicide either Ill fucking resuscitate you and kill you again myself you bitchfaced phaggot. Welcome to hell population you.,lewronggeneration,dgveg31,9,t5_2y7lu
