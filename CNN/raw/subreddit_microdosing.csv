I remember in one of Terence McKennas lectures someone asked him what if they took a little bit of the mushroom every day.

10450697,0,t3_5pnu9w,The effect is very subtle.  If you notice any perceptual changes you probably took too much.  ug is a good dose to work with.Yes swallowing is fine.  You can hold it in your mouth for a couple minutes.  It is absorbed very quickly.You should wait at least  days to try again.  Tolerance builds very quickly.  Microdosing is something to try over time without rushing things.Id like to ask you a question though What is your intended purpose in microdosing?I cant speak for others but for myself I microdose as an alternative to prescription SSRI medication for depression and suicidality.  It works extremely well but the effect is subtle.  The only overt thing that happens is that Im well not depressed and not suicidal.Also I am more socially outgoing more empathetic with others have an easier time concentrating on large boring tasks and I actually enjoy my life and hobbies and companionship with animals and other people.  As you can tell these are all very subjective things and frankly I didnt notice any of it the first time I microdosed.Keep a daily journal and try to write about your emotions and your experience of each day.  That can help you figure out exactly what microdosing is actually doing for you and whether it is something you may want to continue.Edit I have found that low doses seem to actually help me sleep which is interesting because higher doses really interfere profoundly with sleep until it wears off.  I dont dose after noon but I do find that I can get tired and successfully nap even within the dose window.Also for your insomnia just something from the peanut gallery I recommend trying melatonin.  Get a dropper bottle so you can titrate the dose easily and dose at the end of the day to emulate the pineal glands natural production.  It can take  or  weeks to notice any changes.  That is assuming you want to do anything about your insomnia.,microdosing,dcsonzj,3,t5_2yt3g

10615679,0,t1_ddawwpw,Agreed. Might not be for OP. Could try again w another entheogen. Or OP could try and MAOI if depression is a problem. Or Nootropics if just craving a straight forward mental boost and high.  Edit didnt realize it was that guy. Shouldnt have taken it the way he did. Any forum would have told him not to dose in that manner. Try again and if you dont feel anything at a low dose wait a few days. Not a few hours. This is your mental health I wouldnt be impatient.  Edit  Id also highly suggest getting off the maoi and replacing it with microdosing instead. They do very much so affect each other ,microdosing,ddaxdsa,2,t5_2yt3g

You could be asleep by  or pm if you took mg at  or pm.I know that most psychiatrists like to prescribe the new fangle drugs. But for me small doses of ritalin are the best.

Granted I was in a good mood already but again I just laugh more easily.
