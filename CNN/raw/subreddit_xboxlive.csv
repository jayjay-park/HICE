3123058,0,t1_coloxej,Still youll get lag though if you are seriously not cheating by any means then its other gamers that report you.  How you handle a situation online determines of people report you.Whenever I get hate messages I take the fight away from them lets face it its incredibly easy to piss someone off.  I like a challege its a challege for me to get someone who is pissed to like me even if Im faking it.  So I always am friendly maybe mention something like My roommate so you sound older is downloading porn or something sorry if that stuff was laggy.  My roommate is a buzzkill all he does is downloads random videos makes worthless beats and is constantly eating my hot pockets even AFTER I write my name on them.Then the gamer will forget about his hate for you and will instantly hate on your made up roommate.  BOOM you made a friend AND saved your rep.I mean you can talk shit every now and then just pick your battles.  If you they played like a jackass and you won by some dumb luck but you can play it off as skill then ALWAYS turn the knife in their wound but only if they send the hate message dont be the first to send a hate message.,xboxlive,colpcj9,2,t5_2quo9

10043859,0,t1_dbgq3rx,I have my notes I took at at home and am at work currently however I do notremember UPNP being brought up.  there was talk of one  being DMZ and the specific words are escaping me at the moment but something to the effect of port triggering? and port forwarding I think.  I will also check the make and model and will reply to you with that information this afternoon.  The strange thing is that on one occasion my son on his xbox one and me on my  were finally able to get him into my game or vice versa but it was after multiple tries which I assume is when we luckily caught the changing Nat setting from strict to moderate.  I had both groups xboxxfinity chatting to me at the same time which basically turned into a blame game back and forth reminiscent of elementary school.  I am not educated enough on the networking side to feel comfortable doing it as I am afraid I would end up opening everything up and letting the firewall down and have everything ive ever had or known taken.  The though of possibly buying a new router was brought up but that too was argued about between the techs and I would rather not buy something new with an underlying problem possibly not addressed.  Thanks again for all of your help now and in the future.,xboxlive,dbgqo6y,2,t5_2quo9
