The video doesnt cover the entire duration of the interaction with the cop at the end saying he must wait longer while they check his logs so we can probably assume the entire interaction was around  min at least. Now imagine that happening perhaps twice a month.

640095,0,t3_21h8m3,I can comment on college social life. Its pretty awesome. If you go to one of the University of Queensland colleges youll have a blast. There are  of them of about  people each and I would say they kind of like a large fraternitysorority although maybe a bit more casual. There are sporting social and cultural events all the time.  I went to an all male college and it was heaps of fun.Good rivalries some over  years old but everyone still is still nice and you can talk and be friends with people in other colleges. Everyone is generally ready to party stay up late playing Counter StrikeDotaWhatever. Rugby and Rowing are two major sports amongst many.Things are expensive for example Seirra Nevada Pale Ale is about  a six pack whereas when I was in NY last year it was . But you can get cheaper beers than that and most college people drink boxed wine Litres for  Its shit but alright with tropical juice and ginger aleMcDonalds costs abbout  for a meal a basic beer out at a bar will cost about  depending on the brandbar.Everyone is friendly which I found similar in the States.Spiders can be huge but you dont really see them that often and most of the ones you willmight see wont harm you or will hurt like a bee sting.edit radio wise we pretty much have exactly what you guys are listening to on all the commercial stations.

Work your ass off as a glassy but observe everything learn about spirits pouring beers making cocktails and generally what it is like to work from pm  am in a busy environment.After a while and depending on where you work push your way into the back bar ask for shifts on quiet nights get some real hands on experience. Learn how to use the tills and make basic drinks. Once you have demonstrated to your colleagues that you are a solid bartender start pushing your managers to give you bar shifts and go from there. If you find that they arent giving you bar shifts and continue to roster you as a glassy then claim the experience at your next job go for a trial if you are confident in the bar and fake your way in. ,brisbane,chznlb8,2,t5_2qutz

Since having kids is the norm I guess these doctors assume that leaving my uterus inside by body to torment me is in my best interest even though my GP and I know it isnt.When talking to a friend about it he also pointed out that most gynaecologists who are qualified to do a hysterectomy generally also do obstetrics. Its in their best interest job and money wise to not sterilise women what with sterilised women generally not needing to see a doctor about being pregnant and all.

1747467,0,t3_2eg8gk,So many people has been asking this. Maybe we should put it at the sidebar? Girraween  southwest of brissy near Stanthorpe. You can get to do the Granite Belt wineries afterwards. Friends said that the nightlife there goes off as well. Further south over the boarder is Castle Rock which is also pretty cool climb and Glen Innes birthplace of the Australia federation idea. Both the Pyramid at the Giraween and Castle Rock are granite rocks so the surface is really smooth. Also interesting. Its also a  to  hrs drive. A good drive down that way would be through Beaudesert and Rathdowney cross the border and then head west. Better than the highway through Warwick. Although I can recommend the butchers at Warwick. Mt Barney  south of Brisbane near Rathdowney. A challenging hike but still worth it. This is a shorter drive. Maybe  hrs? I think my friend said theres a waterhole at the bottom of the mountain. Im not too sure. So bring your togs.The two mountains on either sides of the Cunningham Gap  they are always great. I climbed one Mt Mitchell but a fellow redditor on here said the other mountain is better. This is also maybe  hrs. Highly recommend the bakery largest wagon wheel I have ever seen! and the truck stop breakfast in the town of Aratula. Mt French  located near the town of Boonah is a nice daytrip. You dont climb it as a road takes you straight to the top but the view viewing north down the Fassifern valley and the small town of Kalbar is fascinating. Again highly recommend the bakery. Its also a  hrs drive. Lastly my favourite climb. Tabletop Mountain just before climbing up to Toowoomba. This is a great climb. Unlike the others I pointed out this is not part of the national park or state reserve. Its just a local park. Nevertheless I think it is still great. Youll see it when you drive up the range and is located on the left hand side. To access it you need to go up Toowoomba first. The view down towards Lockyer Valley is really beautiful. My gf and I had a picnic up there sitting at the edge and just watching the world goes by was still one of the best thing weve done together. This prob takes  hrs drove.,brisbane,cjzff7e,2,t5_2qutz

Depending on the vegetable it could be in cool store for  months before its sold. Most of the difference in appearance is just about how long it has been on the shelf in close proximity to corrosive gases say from apples or onions or exposed to organisms that make it rot some of which are transported by shoppers.Heres my vote for not quite perfect looking shelvesbins for fruitveges.

Id been hitting the weeds on nearly every cast and thats what he felt like.  He really wanted that fucking lure. Im pretty sure the hooks on it are older than me and could barely penetrate butter. Basically the trebles were just jammed against the side of his mouth. Baby duskies are pretty.  First fish Ive ever caught on a lure. No really. The lure is some ancient French thing. Brass spinner.

3424088,0,t1_cpikeb4,Just thought id throw this in as many people seem not to know this until its too late.  LMI is not insurance in the traditional sense they will cover any gap between what the bank recovers from a defaulted property and what you owe and you will then be required to pay them back that amount.  You arent washed of the debt.  Hopefully it well never matter to you but I had no idea when I paid for LMI I assumed it was insurance as in they pay if you default and the property is sold and you are freed from the debt so its worth being aware of.  As for mortgages  Commbank is average service I doubt you would find much difference with them and the other biggies.  We most recently went with Macquarie who had the best rates my advice would be make sure you are able to pay weekly Macquarie only allows fortnightly which costs a lot more over the loan period.  Also we fixed a portion of the loan and left a portion in variable this way you can take advantage of current low fixed rates but also have a variable loan so you can contribute extra if you are able.  Essentially you end up with two loans if you do this. ,brisbane,cpikknc,2,t5_2qutz

3506425,0,t3_30f467,I think its sad too that it takes an event like this for us to consider the driver as a human being. Prior to this the majority of people I spoke to condemned the man without knowing the circumstances. The scene of the accident itself lends credibility to a belief that even the most cautious driver could have hit Ashleigh. Ashleigh made a mistake and paid for it with her life. As did the driver. Admittedly I would hope that I placed in the same circumstances would have stopped to render aid but Ill never know that for sure. Personally I hope I never will. People on the Internet all too often make callous remarks about the Darwin Awards. Though Im yet to see it in relation to this case I think it bears mentioning that we have all been foolish at one point. Ashleigh just happened to make her mistake at a more critical point.

You can slurp up a fair amount sitting on one place in the food courts of the malls for cheap. Brisbane libraries let you log on with with a library card but youre limited in time and data volume. They typically leave it on at night so you can sit outside and use it after hours.  I did this when I arrived about four years ago  had a card for me and my SO plus swapping devices and hotspotting seemed to reset the time and data limit. There are still a bunch of business centres and net cafes still around and some of the job placement places might help you out. Brisbane City has a lot of free wifi spots too Maybe not so obvious but better than wandering around the city and sitting in public while you apply for jobs and stuff  what about a G data dongle  Sim on a month to month no contract plan? It might actually be cheaper than hour over a month as a lot of them do a larger data cap in the first month. If a Telstra tech broke your internet maybe getting aggro at them might net you a dongle until the wired comes back?There are a couple of apps that help you find open wifi spots Hotspotio WeFi FreeZone WiFinder so you can do a little old school wardriving...

I neglected one of my bikes and had my brakes totally fail when I slammed on them as a car cut me off. Nothing more terrifying then having no brakes and trying to avoid an accident.Other than that just keep an eye on your body and listen to it when something hurts. Hopefully you got a bicycle that is the right fit and not a Small when you need a Large for example.

3930664,0,t1_cr44k2t,Im not just generalising from my attempt  research into attempted suicide via wrist cutting has shown that it is almost never lethal. Ive done more extensive research on this as part of my degree but this is just what I have come up with now with after a very quick literature search this article found that  of their sample of people who were hospitalised for attempted suicide via wrist cutting were only able to inflict a superficial wound and only .  of  of the  that inflicted a deep wound lost enough blood that they needed a transfusion. Nobody in their sample died. This article on the lethality of various suicide methods found that cutting as a method of suicide had a low fatality rate I can find a lot more citations if youre interested though I have had trouble finding a single report of a lethal wristcutting attempt where some other factor eg. overdose didnt contribute to the death. This is not to undermine the seriousness of an attempted suicide via wrist cutting  any kind of gesture like that should be taken very seriously as seriously as any highlethality attempt. However a person is more likely to survive a less lethal suicide attempt and get put into hospitaltherapy. Someone who attempts suicide in a highly lethal way eg. jumping off a bridge usually doesnt get that chance. So it makes sense to act first to cut off access to high lethality methods and then zone in on less lethal methods one might use at home. As for other methods people might use at home I am not really in a position to debate that with you because in order to effectively discuss it I would have to disclose more information than I am comfortable with re how exactly those methods work and the many ways that they can be thwarted. However firearms and suspension hanging aside both of which can be difficult to accomplish for various reasons most methods of suicide that one would use at home are nowhere near as lethal as bridge jumps etc. There are some methods eg. gas car exhaust that many suicidal people are unwilling to use too because of their potential to harm others  most of the suicidal people I have known have actually been very concerned about the effect that finding their body will have on others and have wanted to minimize the harm as much as possible which doesnt gel very well with leaving behind a room full of explosivetoxic gas for their loved ones to choke on. Of course leaving your body for your loved ones to find will mess them up anyway which is why things like bridge jumping are attractive to some people its more likely that police will find their body instead of their loved ones but suicidal people are not entirely rational when thinking about these things. Like I said above the research that has been done so far the research cited in the article and research done in other places appears to show that suicide attempts at other sites do not increase as a result of suicide barriers being erected at a suicide hot spot. So said research would indicate that most people will not walk  metres over to jump off the cliffs. But if you want to believe that they will and that a mentally ill persons suicide is somehow inevitable then I guess its none of my business. EDIT Just as a side note I have just found in the course of researching this subject that the gas supplied to residences in Australia is no longer lethal several decades ago we switched from coal gas which has high levels of carbon monoxide to nontoxic natural gas partially because gas suicides were epidemic. So it actually isnt even as simple as switching the gas on anymore either even if you set a persons unwillingness to use gas aside. ,brisbane,cr4bxxl,2,t5_2qutz

They cant put no fat dudes in the job description because that would be discriminatory  but by making half the role a specific fittingmodelling role theyve found a way around it.

And the admins have had a hands off policy for years.Also blacking out such a small sub only punishes your users not the admins. The traffic stats are negligible in the bigger picture.If you actually want to do something then make it a bannable offense to gild comments and submissions or make the sub private permanently. But your precious modships are too valuable to you for that right? All bark and no bite.Grow up. I get mods who run subs with millions of subscribers are finding it difficult but here? No chance.

There is no evidence that an allegation published online this week either directly or indirectly led to his death. We feel an obligation to report all facts as we know them. And if an allegation against Mr Masters is indeed incorrect it is truly abhorrent  particularly so if it is found to have contributed to Mr Masters death.

Looks a little like white shadecloth and looks like mosquitos might fit through.  Fortunately though fruit flies are actually mm and dont fit through.  No maggots so far this year.   The flies dont eat the fruit but rather lay eggs  maggots in fruit.  The fruit rots and drops quickly when this happens then the maggots having had their fill burrow into the earth and turn into flies which emerge and the process repeats.  Rotten fruit attracts more flies so get rid of that asap.I was surprised that the true fruit flies arent those tiny midgie things when I first moved to bris.,brisbane,cw2ewtg,3,t5_2qutz

5573791,0,t3_3rgkid,Copied from a comment I made on another thread regarding EvoccaI did a Bachelor of Games and Interactive entertainment at QUT which by the way is a useless degree and  of the people that graduated alongside me are now game design tutors at Evocca college.These people haveNO industry experience.NO professional experience.NO industry references.NO game design experience past university projects. Not only are Evocca preying on people who cant afford to enrol and pay for these courses theyre also preying on people who cant find a legitimate job with their degrees and so offer them positions that any recognized institution would require far more experience for.If you do some research on Evocca they were investigated by the Australian Skills Quality Authority because their graduation rates were so so below the standard of what tertiary education should be.In addition to this while I dont work in the games industry I do know some people in it contacts from university days and they have explained that job applicants who have degrees from RTOs such as Evocca and that College Kickstarter thing you see all over Facebook are looked down upon because they know that the quality of training and education they receive is so far below industry standard. Mainly because its being taught by what are essentially amateur indie developers many of whom have not shipped a title.TLDR  Evocca is a giant scam and a festering shithole that will take your money and leave you unable to find a job. If you want to do game design save your money and use the many many many free and powerful tools available online to learn it.,brisbane,cwnzas2,3,t5_2qutz

5631034,0,t1_cwv29me,An excellent question!  Ive been working out of a shared commercial kitchen so Im limited by the time that I can book there as well as having to cram a  day process into about  hours. I also need a climate controlled spacce so Im just relying on the aircon at the moment which isnt quite powerful enough for the really hot Summer days. Then its hauling things to markets or relying on advertising to attract orders. Wholesale is difficult due to the storage conditions of my product. The next step for my business was to locate my own production space and if I was going to do that then a shopfront attached made sense.  I was actually offered this space as a destination store in the developments laneway so it made the most sense to expand into a bricks and mortar store in that particular location. On top of that I have oodles of recipes I want to trial and it will make my life much easier to make them and then immediately have them on the counter for sale.  Whenever I tell people what I do they tell me stories about the chocolate and sweet stores they went into when they were a kid and saw the products being made and how much they loved it.

But they suffered from a lack of material and only had a  minute set. Mini Mansions  now I will be honest and I sort of overlooked these guys when I was checking out the supports my God. The sound lighting and overall look of these guys was awesome. They were playing as the sun was setting and I highly recommend checking these guys out when they decide to come back over.

6062308,0,t1_cye7bil,This. In the CBDSpring HillValleyNew Farm it varies by building some ban BBQs outright some allow certain typessizes e.g. electric only no bigger than x and some include provisions where possible as to how far from the building the BBQ must be operated for large balconies or ground floor apartments.With city living its also important to keep in mind that your rights end where your neighbors rights begin. If the smoke from your BBQ prevents them from using their balcony or keeping their windows open on a regular basis management may ask you not to use it andor fine you. Sound carries louder and farther at night so if youre outside using the BBQ later in the evening or early in the morning neighbors may make noise complaints. If a particular building doesnt permit smoking and there are a number of nonsmoking buildings in the CBD and inner suburbs youre more likely to get smoke complaints from neighbors who may have chosen to live in a nonsmoking building for that reason.Basically if you rent in a building that permits smoking and explicitly permits BBQs and youre considerate with your smoke and noise you probably wont have any problems. ,brisbane,cye9g0z,1,t5_2qutz

In recent years there is no real outlet for this type of personality. The desire to be a powerful warrior is still there ingrained in guys like this but not the opportunities to prove it.

6151502,0,t1_cyme0am,I play in a band and no Ive never played a show at am. I have however been very drunk at the venue we played at until well past am  and many other people were too.Closing early cuts into venue owners profit margins. Venues are very expensive to run in QLD as it is so further restricting their ability to take in money will only mean that they have to cut corners elsewhere  less bar staff increased drink pricing the ability to pay bands even less than they do currently which trust me is not very much.While the pay thing isnt a huge problem for local musicians who have to give up a few hours of their time on a Friday night and buy equipment that they were probably going to buy anyway because its their hobby it becomes problematic when looking to get interstateinternational bands through the door when you just dont have much money to pay them. The times we have played interstate have always been fun and even though we were getting paid substantially more than we would if we were playing locally it still didnt come close to covering all the travel expenses associated with doing it.Essentially its squeezing the shit out of an industry that has already been squeezed to death in this state. The kid who delivered the coward punch had been posting violent shit on Facebook for years.

Get a complaint further up the chain and you start to get some reasonable intelligent people who know how to make things right. Seriously I went into Centrelink one time because I received a letter warning me that my course was about to finish it wasnt. Btw you should have also received one of these but around this same time I had just had another big dealing with them relating to permission to study part time an issue which saw them temporarily suspend my payments that had pushed my course end date further back. So I just wanted to make sure that my course enddate had been automatically updated when I went in to speak with them. The guy at the counter said he couldnt find any info on that but just kept repeating that what I was saying didnt match up with what he saw on my file. A few days later Centrelink suspends my payment again based off what this guy had inputted into my file that day WHICH WAS JUST ME ASKING A SIMPLE QUESTION! Unfortunately getting into contact with the right people is tough however I saved two phone numbers that you cant easily get. These should be for the Student Review Team who you have to leave a voice mail with and they get back to you.    and   . There was one guy in particular who I spoke to who knew exactly how things are supposed to work and cut through all the bullshit I had been authoritatively told previously by other staff. If that doesnt work try a formal complaint. If they have the wrong information about your course thats not your fault and you are still entitled to your payments.,brisbane,czhfy9k,6,t5_2qutz

Middle kobble camp is a lovely small clearing next to a waterhole at the top of kobble creek falls. The water is crystal clear  blue the site is remote and you are highly unlikely to see another person for days. The hike down is wonderfully steep the hike out is heartbreakingly steep  hrs uphill so you need to be fit!! its a km loop with about m descent and ascent each way  the main Lepidozamia road is flattish the loop is where you losegain elevation and where the campsite is located. If you are fit up for the challenge and really want a place where you wont be distracted by civilisation the kobbles are ideal.There is also south kobble bush camp but this is a proper offmap offtrack hike in campsite with vegetation hacking thousands of leeches rock scrambling and all that good stuff!

The bike was locked but it was just a cable lock.  There isnt really a perfect lock situation because youre just locking it up to a chain link fence and because of the volume of bikes its impossible to use a Ulock.

No reason why you couldnt bring a desktop apart from it being annoying for you to carry! People generally start getting in to groups at the ideation night and are finalised at the start of the event. Basically after you hear the pitches at ideation you go talk to the groups you are interested in working with and then decide. A bit of preorganisation happens between ideation and the event but its kept pretty basic. The ultimate goal is to get the best result for the charity group so in terms of what you are allowed to do we wouldnt want to limit it but generally its kept basic as there will be people at the event that werent there for ideation so things might change. You can go home at night  We generally are at the venue from   . Some people will stay on or work through going home and communicating through Slack etc but we dont do a lock in.

8010732,0,t3_4oxtpn,Step . Admit it publically.  CHECKStep . See your GP explain to them what you are going through and you are seeking help.They will give you a referral a letter to a psychologist. This will also put you on a Mental Health Plan it is not a log book like completing your Learners it entitles you to  sessions with a registered psychologist with a Medicare rebate which means you will be out of pocket about ish dollars. They will make you pay the total amount and refund you the rebate so you have to have the total amount in the bank to start with weird I know.Step   Listen to your Psychologist work with them actively do what they suggest between your appointments.Step   After a couple of sessions depending on where you are at re book and see your GP to see if AntiDepressant Medication will assist with your treatment.Some depression is caused by chemical imbalances in the brain rather than just feeling down. Antidepressants work towards adjusting the balance to help the cause. Continuing to work with a psychologist whilst on antidepressants will go to ultimately work through the issues.Step   Once you think you have control of your situation re book again with your GP and talk about weeing yourself off the antidepressants. It is possible to do but do it with medical supervision.Dont be ashamed of what you are going through. You are not the first nor will you be the last person to suffer from depression. The above procedure may take  months to go through so be prepared to be in it for the long haul.Take your mental health with the same precautionary approach as you would your physical health. You need to work towards healing yourself to be healthy both inside and out. Remember that there are many people on here going through the same who would be happy to take you out for a drink or have a chat or be there in an emergency. Dont be afraid to ask for help what you have done here is amazingly strong and brave. Dont stop that momentum.,brisbane,d4ghbns,6,t5_2qutz

8357245,0,t3_4u1el5,PM me if youd like i had a similar thing happen with SPER and griffith uni in relation to parking called sper and ask to dispute the fine with them its like a  page double sided form you have to fill out basically explaining the situationas you have here and they should just send the fine back to griffith just tell them its unwarranted and you have paid to park there once its out of SPER it gets sent back to griffith uni for them to try to deal with it or get the funds from you. That is your point to try to fight it with the uni and yes they are fucking cunts about replying i emailed them about  times and had only  replies MONTHS later after constantly harassing them for not replying go into the office and yell at them if it helps they are at nathan campus in with the gym up top. And yes they are really just stalling for time but if you can get the fine removed from SPER it will take about a month to get back to griffith uni giving you more time  although unneeded really once its out of SPER as your license is no longer being threatened Griffith uni does not want to have to keep harassing you and sending your fines to sper there are a few reasons for this mainly time and money griffith uni has to go though a stupid dirtyshady company an info broker called citec it cost them money each time to get your personally details from citec in order to send you fines via transport and main roads as TampMR will not give out your personal information to a rd parties like griffith uni but will via citec on behalf of griffith uni so a lot of money and time is used passing around your infomation trying to get in contact with you so they can say they have done their legal due diligence  in getting in contact with you. On a side note i could go on about TampMR and citec and the relationship they have with rd party companies trying to get money from you and how they interact...super shady stuff that should be illegal but isnt.

8743957,0,t1_d6ylkjm,Deregulated places meant for the first time students from poor or regional backgrounds could actually access degrees they wanted to study. University participation soared among disadvantaged groups and in about  years time Australia is really going to start feeling the benefits of this investment. Limited places drives up OPs which means if you didnt go to Girls Grammar or BBC then good fucking luck studying anything other than nursing or business. Recent drops in graduate employment which weve been bouncing back from since  have more to do with struggling markets than oversupply of graduates. Queensland in particular enjoys much higher than average graduate employment rate except for a select few regional centers Toowoomba actually has some of the highest in the country although this is largely due to matureage graduates who already have full resumes upon graduation. An ongoing issue with compacts and regulated places was that governments are notoriously terrible at workforce planning  which left regular skill shortages and driving prices up for both consumers and governments particularly health. It also left the system prone to corruption. Say there was an industry that wanted to drive their prices up  they just lobbied the government to throttle university entrants so they could charge what the please for example  literally every fucking medical profession. Restricting supply for vital services so the elite can pocket more cash is bullshit you expect out of Russia not a modern st century nation. The VET exploitation fuck up was actually another issue entirely and implemented entirely by the other end of the Labor party. IMO deregulation of university places was the best policy Rudd ever implemented. I still get a semi thinking about Kim Carr and his LaborLeft mates being forced to stomach it even after they stabbed Kev in the back. Deregulated places was a perfect example of what LaborRight could do for this country  if they werent held to ransom by the left or kept under the thumbs of certain interest groups. ,brisbane,d6ynbu5,3,t5_2qutz

9094910,0,t3_54u1t7,Im not from Brisbane but after hearing about this project I dont really see the point. . billion is a lot of money to convert a BRT system to a metro  especially when the improvement in service would be pretty small.It seems like the big issue with the existing busway system isnt capacity but the design of the bus network. Having dozens of different routes going to different destinations is horribly inefficient and means that buses often arent full. It just doesnt make sense to run  buseshr when they are halffull and get stuck behind each other.BRT systems elsewhere in the world arent set up like this  they run more like a metro. They have  routes that travel the entire length of the busway and passengers transfer to local services at the stations. Its basically the same as this Brisbane Metro proposal except using buses rather than trains.So why not at least give network restructuring a try before spending so much money on new infrastructure especially when you so desperately need funding for Cross River Rail.,brisbane,d85297i,22,t5_2qutz

Maybe she saw the blue car maybe it was obscured by uploaders car doesnt really matter either way it was far enough away that any pedestrian whos been in this country more than a month would expect that if there is a car there theyre going to stop. She shouldnt need to be constantly staring down the road.A few comments from the video that were particularly apt these are more for general interest rather than directed specifically at youNick Oversidegt Look at the angle she probably wasnt aware of the blue vehicle because the red vehicle was obstructing her vision. And on top of that when someone stops to let you access a crossing its in the back of your mind that youre holding that person up so the general etiquette is to be quick about it. Its all too easy to take situations like this for granted.Madison Wrightgt She was not in the wrong at all. The driver of the blue car if they had two brain cells to rub together should have noticed that the car in the right lane had stopped and realised that there was a pedestrian on the crossing.vincentpolgt No she cant even see cars coming from that way if theres another car in front of it. The driver who went way too fast on the crossing here deserves to get his license taken for reckless driving. At the very least a  figure fine.mak kgt Looking doesnt help on a crossing the only options she has are to stop in the middle of a crossing every time a car drives up to it waiting to see if it stops or carries on or read the drivers mind.Tay Lockgt Ever heard of a zebra crossing?

It honestly is a once in a lifetime opportunity and there are great opportunities for professional development as well.

So they make suggestionsrecommendations to local AG demand changes to localstatefederal lawsGood example of this was uber drivers. DTMR offices couldnt get evidences for fine if a driver refused access to the phone...What does DTMR enforcement do? They simple recommend to Minister and state AG to change the law that forces you to unlock a phone or anyone whom refuses face  years in person.

This is definitely more pronounced with the banks where the Big  charge  higher interest rates on home loans and have essentially half the interest on savings than smaller ones simply because people dont shop around or even know they exist.Plus they arent always more expensive too since economies of scale flattens out the larger you go there used to be a quite popular grocery store in Tarragindi which generally had lower prices than Woolies and Coles on most things.

Plenty of other organisations  many of them contracted to offer public services like Energex  have staff that have to work on Christmas Day. Its part of being a public servant.

In order to make it stick in a civil court case you need balance of probabilities  I.e. better than  likelyhood. A smart lawyer could argue against the method of collection  is it forensicly correct? Can that be proven? Can you prove current issues with IPperson logic? That will drag out the case somewhat making it more expensive for the litigant. Given the current actual damages system vs the USs magic figures of potential damages means theyre likely to recover the cost of a DVD at best.gt Hardly worth it given the extra effort needed?Why do you think AGD is changing laws atm for civil cases?Someone has need to use publicprivateillegally obtained Big Data and government metadata to point the strong finger towards a downloaded or discover those whom influenced in politicallegal advocate.

10553227,0,t3_5qz56x,Sublet from a guy who turned out to be one of those minor local celebrities. He was famous for all night drug taking and owning a goat. He would flip out and spill rubbish everywhere. Lived in a managed sharehouse. Landlady was an incredible example of narcisism in the wild. Went nuts all the time. Hated that the strippers living in the house would not pretend to be her friends. Went on rants all the time. Turns out she was charging us more rent that she was meant to pocketing the difference and that she was meant to be doing the cleaning.The strippers were great no inhibitions what so ever. My mate did get banned from coming over to visit when he bragged to his missus about his mate who lived stripper adjacent. We had tons of backpackers in this time most of which would get very preachy about kitchen tidiness despite them not cleaning up after themselves and declaring my fishfingers lebensraum.Eventually the Owner cottoned on to the property manager taking her for a ride and decided to fire her. This meant a reversal in the No Irish policy. Immediately she the owner filled every vacant room with Irish Students studying English who seemed to wear a shit ton of Fluro yellow work wear. Maybe its a cultural thing. Instantly transformed the place into a drugviolence den. They broke a glass table in the pool during their first party. They would also play soccer in the living room. Internet cap was reached instantaneously every month. After  complaints to the Landlady she told us she had spoken to the irish about their problems. However the only substantive change was that she would send her son to collect rent rather than come herself. She acted very surprised when some people broke lease due to someone shooting heroin outside their window. I had no idea it was that bad. When I moved out she had just hired a new property manager who had never seen me before but decided to pick a fight with me because he decided that I had broken into the house to perv on his girlfriend. ,brisbane,dd4bs8t,3,t5_2qutz

You might add other toppings for good measure but without the  core ingredients its nothing like a poutine. There are plenty of places that offer shredded cheese gravy and fries in brisbane and thats A LOT closer to poutine than those filthy fries.

11272307,0,t1_df98018,Yeah those are legitimate reasons why agency work would be more interesting re variety etc.  So it probably would satisfy that.  But yeah you need to weigh up with the stresses downsides etc too.  But it really depends on where you work of course some places might be good if they have good project managers and dont expect people to work lateweekends etc.  Really depends on the competency and expectation of the management.  Also keep in mind that depending on the agency a lot of the jobs could be very similar if they have regular clients in the same industries.If you work in a place without much stress and you usually always leave on time... that can be a rare thing.  For this reason I also quite often recommend people work in more boring industries than startup type companies... for example working some place like Google even if theres no pressure from management most of the employees basically selfimpose living at work because its so competitive.Anyway these all just some opinions I came to from my limited experience working for a few places.

Edit found a sauce but drinking water doesnt always have to be free it depends on the liquor license Making drinking water available to patrons is the responsibility of every licensee and is essential to minimising harm and intoxication.The Liquor Regulation  makes it mandatory for commercial hotel licensees community club licensees commercial other bar licensees licensees catering to a commercial public event and any licensee who trades after  midnight to provide cold drinking water free of charge to any patron who requests it at any time the premises is trading.

11661043,0,t1_dghptvi,Not looking to defend the doctor in question but just speaking from experience things do come up first thing in the morning and you wouldnt believe the nature of certain emergencies.  It can range from an urgent task such as being presented with pathology results first thing in the morning which requires the doctor to attend to asap or something out of the ordinary like a patient making a formal complaint due to mistreatment at their last appointment.  The harsh reality is that all doctor practices generally run late on average it is very rare for a doctor to be on time for all their appointments throughout the day.  For every patient that simply needs to go to the doctor for a quick referral or script for their oral contraceptive pill theres going to be another patient which will require an thorough workup discussion andor additional testing and diagnosis.  Doctors dont want to run late its no different to a someone else at work being held up with things past their expected knock off time. The difference is whether the receptionist or practice can let you know before your appointment if the doctor is on time or what the expected wait time is.  ,brisbane,dghslff,7,t5_2qutz
