2621685,0,t3_2px6g2,My ExplanationThe edit on this is completely wrong The reason I made this statement is because Pie made multiple command blocks which constantly smite me and other things. He also made a skript which smites me  times then kills me which he was spamming. While this was happening I was very irritated with pie and just wanted him to stop so I made this statement which may have been rude but I believe what he did to me was much more rude canceling anything I did wrong out.Also I would like to point out this is my first offense on the courtroom,TeamSpeakCourtroom,cn0siua,2,t5_35gia
