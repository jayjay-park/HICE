11584876,0,t1_dg94m60,If you really think someone is misinformed in a thread where were having a reasonable discussion the correct response would be to teach amp share your understanding or share a link that explains your reasoning. How are you going tell me Im wrong if you cant tell me how Im wrong or what is right? I made it abundantly clear that Im not well informed on plant physiology and instead of helping me to understand or clarifying your questionpoint youre just being dismissive.Of course ions are in plants. The plant balance ions with in itself and the soil but the plant uses metal ions to control that balance not organic nutrients. Those get used and built into more complex organic molecules.Of course nitrogen ions are taken up by plants but that doesnt mean they persist in that state waiting to be smoked up in your bud.Of course oxidizers are involved in combustion reactions.The question is then what form is the nitrogen in within the buds were smoking? Is it in ionic form is it bound to other elements? Which ones? If they are in simple ions are those ions reactive? And thats what I was getting at. But you apparently already know the answer to your question and just wanted validation dont know why you keep persisting.,selfsynthesizing,dg95iax,2,t5_3jz3f
