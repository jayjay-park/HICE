2490041,0,t3_2o41vq,I dont like the idea of telling people what to attack with or not to attack with.  If people continuously do ineffective attacks kick them from the clan. Dont dictate what army they need to use ,redditalchemy,cmjl4os,6,t5_30vsg
2683169,0,t1_cn8svjl,gt And Im sorry i never saw the request to review your base or i wouldve done it. Line four in my  on this thread to gratuitously quote myself...gt Maybe one of your leaders could check me out and see if you think Id be a good match for Alchemy?It doesnt really matter tho. It would have just stopped me leaving my old clan so early... Im sure theyll have me back tho.gt You seem active and obviously know your way around the subreddit so thats a plus. Thanks for prefacing the critique with some positives gt Get your walls defenses bk to level  and troop levels up and wed happily accept you.Close to my current plan! Im looking to fill out my walls as I expand defences. Upgrades to storages are only for when they are prereqs like DE for BK  right now or over xmas when I didnt have time to farm lol. I also have one Barracks to get to  for better mass Dragon production.gt And no matter what you do dont upgrade your TH again until everything is maxed Lol! Yeah I do know that! In fact the only reason I upgraded to TH was because every building was maxed. I was in two minds about it because I knew my inner walls were low. What I didnt consider was the rebuild for TH making my outers so patchy  Gold is a painful limiter lol.,redditalchemy,cn8t6ra,2,t5_30vsg
