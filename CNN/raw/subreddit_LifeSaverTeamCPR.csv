5881530,0,t3_3kedt9,Hey Sean Im a paramedic in Albuquerque. I also own a CPR training center This is of course a black and white question with a gray answer and I will do my best to answer. If a person is in a car crash and not breathing we can assume that a lot of trauma has been subjected to the persons chest and that is the main reason they are not breathing. At this point the person has about  minutes before permanent brain damage occurs. The first thing I would do is make sure the tongue is not blocking the throat. We use a manuvuer called the Jaw thrust to pull the tongue off the back of the throat. However the jaw thrust is often ineffective and may require a headtilt. Head tilts chin lift maneuvers in the event of trauma can cause more damage to the spine so one must be careful when performing. If the patient does not breathe after opening the airway then yes rescue breathes can be performed to the patient. If paramedics are on their way ie you are in town. I would not attempt to remove the patient from the vehicle as the risk vs reward is not there. If you are  minutes from the nearest paramedic and rescue breathes are not effective it might be justifiable to remove the patient. The main concern of course would be to maintain the spine in an inline position. It seems like you have an interest in this subject have you considered being an EMT?,LifeSaverTeamCPR,cxqlnph,1,t5_346v0
