11506825,0,t1_dfvttvh,DISCLAIMER all ranges are estimated by eyeballing the range of the skill to flashs range and could be off by a margin of  unitsgive or take someE is nearly instant and so is the dash on w. So as long as you have someone who can engageor someone is engaging on Xayah you have a long engage range. Waiting on the exact numbers on each to appear somewhere but between Flashs  range ws estimated  rangeflash reaches base of shopkeeper from the center circle w reaches his headslightly more than halfway inside the second flashs range es estimated base  rangeflash reaches base of shopkeeper from the center circle the body or the extended range to Xayah of .x flashs rangeskill range for e to Xayah reaches the top of the ladder on the merchants beast flashing from the center places you at the wall and then the range for the second flash doesnt even reach there and it looks about another halfThat means provided that Xayah is in between you and your quarry another teammate is at the exact range to either put you within the edge of Xayahs dashor at your dash to them after the dash to her then you flash while wing your max engage rangeprovided perfect conditions of course is  which is about one flash away from Luxs ultimate range. Add in each teammate flashing at the right timeassuming you follow said flash and say the second teammate dashing directly after the flashlets say Gnar who bounced off a minion or something and you follow both dashes that would be   flash flash bounce and you get the impossible number of .The max engage that you can count onie not have the stars align during a winter solstice solar eclipse that is caused by a gold duck is E to Xayah gtflash gt w of    units if all my estimation and adding is correct. E to random teamate  w would by about .But  please  dont take any of this as fact as it is all speculation based on eyeballing ranges.,XayahandRekanMains,dg0asqw,1,t5_3jvbu
