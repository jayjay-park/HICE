228495,0,t1_cf4f8rh,Ive looked at them and I like the idea but what Id like to do is work with the group of donors to make a decision on where the funds could be donated. A democratic process to weigh pros and cons.One donation option  Mars One. Theyve taken a long view where theyve said Mars by  however theyre saying that they need billions and are willing to sell the mission as a reality show.Another donation option  Fund a Grad Student or a Researcher Have someone work on solving a small piece of the colonization question through a donation to real research happening today. This wont put someone in space today itll help us understand future missions.Id really like to have the donors make the decision on how to fund.,MoonCoin,cf4fjay,1,t5_2zj3g

273296,0,t1_cf8opbb,Like has been mentioned earlier. Show us your credentials and if it checks out Im sure the coins will be donated. If I was to tip you k mooncoins I would need to see the price almost double even to get back to even. You have shown me nothing to think you could even move the coin in a positive way. Come with links to back up your claims or dont waste our time.,MoonCoin,cf9375d,2,t5_2zj3g

320051,0,t1_cfdxpw3,TIPS fedoracoin thought all their issues would be fixed when they implemented the gravity well thing.  Since getting to block  where it started their stock has dropped from about  litoshi to  now.  My point...fixing this problem doesnt mean mooncoin will suddenly be amazing again.  It is definitely a step in the right direction but there is much more to a coins value than this.,MoonCoin,cfdxy8v,1,t5_2zj3g
