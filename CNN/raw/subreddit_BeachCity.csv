Furthermore sand would be so much more mass than the cobwebs it would take longer and be harder to eat and it would be uncomfortable throughout the entire process of bodily passage. Honestly if your friends or family say sand theyre either hung up on the bug part got a different version of the question or simply didnt think about it much.

8781809,0,t3_4zxqnd,While I do agree with you I think that the oddness of the high notes paired with Garnet is a pretty good combination! It adds a little vulnerability to the character since we associate high pitch with something gentle and soft. On the other hand maybe Estelle is not as experienced singing high notes as Garnets voice. In that case she might improve as time goes by!

Your family is clearly not responsible enough to keep pets. If its a matter that you cant afford to take them then i understand but that means you cant afford to keep pets as regular health checks are part and parcel. So give them to a shelter.

11118762,0,t1_desar6e,No shes NOT one of the writers thats not how the crew works. She is a storyboarder. The writers are an entirely different section of the creation department. Despite the wikis strange confliction on what Zukes job is she is not a writer for the show. She is simply a storyboarder. Writers include Ben Levin and Matt Burnett. If you can find another source that claims she is on the board of writers on the crew please do but I am quite confident in my statement that she is not one. Meaning she gets directions from the ACTUAL writers about the episodes general details. Furthermore if she WAS a writer then shed still be answering to Rebecca Sugar over where the story should be going. ,BeachCity,desax1i,5,t5_3c6zb
