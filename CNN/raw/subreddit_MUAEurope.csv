3375364,0,t1_cpd02ug,Yeah so I went a little crazy and in my best Google translate German I found that the only store that carries it is in Dusseldorf. I live in Utrecht so thats about a  hour drive S Ill just go ahead and order. Too bad they dont have the NYX Matte glosses. They have been sold out FOREVER here. I also order from Sephora US. Its kinda pricey but you pay all taxes at once. So no extra charges after delivery. I got a bunch of Kat von D goodies D,MUAEurope,cpd0lp6,2,t5_33bzh
3398603,0,t1_cpdqqw1,I agree to this. I use W as dupe for Urban Decay  and . In the Buff is for UD  and In the Nude is for UD . With primer under I see not that much of a difference. There is some fallout though but the pigmentation is really strong in my opinion. ,MUAEurope,cpfo0kh,2,t5_33bzh
3444698,0,t1_cpk5xdw,I really hope you managed to find one because that one is amazing! Theyre soft and firm do a good job of picking up product and theyre easy to work with. And only  a piece! Despite not being the biggest fan of double ended brushes Im definitely going get some more.,MUAEurope,cpkx5rf,1,t5_33bzh
3586902,0,t3_313r7r,Whenever I feel like it I use either a matte bronzer or the Anastasia contour shade in Fawn. I naturally have somewhat defined cheekbones so Ill only lightly define that part of my face that sort of sits deeper does that make sense..? which is only  cm long. So it starts a centimeter far of my ear tragus and never goes further than my eyebrows tail. I either use the RT contour brush or the Illamasqua Blush up brush. This is an every once in a while type of thing for the times that I reaaaaaaaaly take my time. The bronzer is very popular here in Greece but contour not so much. Personally I feel like bronzing up my face doesnt work for me. Im quite fair and I stay out of the sun so I dont tan I would have to bronze my entire body for it to look good. The dramatically contoured look  for example Samanthas form Batalash really doesnt work in real life. Even if the workplace is lenient with this type of look I only seems appropriate for the stage or nightclubs because of the lighting. Sure it looks pretty in pics but even in videos it looks like to vertical lines aiming for the sides of the mouth. Imagine how harsh it looks like out in the sun. Now everyone is entitled to their own opinion and taste so I really wouldnt go around telling people your contour looks like crap unless I was very close with them but I will avoid that look for myself.   ,MUAEurope,cq14v36,2,t5_33bzh

4228159,0,t3_39bez2,I dont know if you have it in Denmark but if you want to get stuff like nyx or artdeco you can find it in Douglas which you can find in pretty much any large shopping centremall like Alexa or kudamm. They carry mostly high end brands but you can get drugstore priced makeup too. Though I agree with uTotallyNotAllie dm is really the best choice . You can also find Mller which is right across the underground station Elsterwerdaer Platz where they carry a lot of exclusive products from catrice and essence that dm etc. dont carry. ,MUAEurope,cs26rhs,1,t5_33bzh
