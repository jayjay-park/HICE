2974983,0,t3_2u94cz,This is a crosspost from rDnD because I wasnt originally aware that this was a map of Glorantha.The map itself dates from the time when RuneQuest first came out and Ive recently discovered that Chaosium was based in the Bay Area where my birthfather lived.Ive asked my birthuncle if he recognizes any of the names associated with Chaosium and Glorantha itself. What a trip that would be if these maps were that old and part of Gloranthas inception.,Runequest,co69rt9,1,t5_2tw2a
3352170,0,t3_2yhnmw,Glad to hear you like it! It seems complex on paper but once everyones got it down it flows smooth but deadly. My players tend to shy away from combat just because their first one was pretty horrific not only to them but to their opponents. It doesnt help that ones a healer who only fights in selfdefense but it certainly makes things more interesting.Welcome to the tribe!,Runequest,cpadep7,2,t5_2tw2a
5919024,0,t3_3wd3sd,I got started with RQ and a homebrewed world. It had broos and gloranthan elves but was otherwise a pretty standard fantasy pastiche. That game really never took off.. Most of my dfantasy was spent with Stormbringer and WFRP which isnt really relevant to your question.  RQ got its initial trial in my version of the Gloranthan Borderlands. Ongoing trials is dark future technofantasy. Never did bother much with the higher aspects of classic RQ. Runes are still a neat way to classify religions and magic though.,Runequest,cxvikja,1,t5_2tw2a
