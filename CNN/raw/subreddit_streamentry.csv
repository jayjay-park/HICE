This is somewhat of an aside but do you still feel the technical fourth path designation of KennethRon is useful based on your experience?  As best I understand it its a feeling of being done yet many practitioners  like yourself  seem to continue to practice quite diligently.  Is it that the practice become less seekeroriented and more minddevelopment focused?  Curious to hear your thoughts.  In fact if you wanted to start a new discussion thread based on your technical fourth path experience I would love that.  ,streamentry,d54ra87,1,t5_3f7zb

8401422,0,t3_4uphls,gt My goal with this thing is to really build some momentum up in my practice when I am not sitting. Any moment I am alive is potential fuel for awakening I just need to take advantage of it.This attitude will serve you well.  As far as the noting is concerned it sounds extremely useful to develop a habit of mindfulness.  Have you reached the point in your practice where youre comfortable with simply being aware of experience without the notes or labels?  If so you might find that you can bring that same quality of wakefulness to your life in situations where noting is cumbersome or impossible.  For example try having a conversation with somebody while noting its possible but difficult.  On the other hand try to simply be mindful while having the conversation its much easier.  You might just keep up the noting when the conceptual mind isnt really useful at the moment.  Noting at those times gives the conceptual mind something to do so that its less likely to wander off in day dreams critical thoughts or other unnecessary judgments about the experience.  But at other times if youre having a conversation working or reading you might find that its extremely difficult to split the conceptual mind into the necessary conceptualization for those activities alongside noting those conceptualizations.  Again it is possible so feel free to try it.  But if your conceptual mind already is productively engaged you might just drop the noting and try to be mindfully aware of it.  Does that make sense?  Otherwise just try your best and dont beat yourself up when you lose the noting or find that youve been lost in thought or distraction.  Youll wake up from the wandering eventually and when you do just get back to work.  And then dont ever stop practicing.  ,streamentry,d5rq2oz,3,t5_3f7zb
8493319,0,t3_4vztjs,For myself I cannot speak to whether this is applicable to TMI practice sitting zazen while sleepy is better than not doing it and it is fairly easy for me to tell that it is.I can sit fine in the morning even if I did not get much sleep but if I do it at night in a dark room because like Rolling Stones says you cant always get what you want if it had been a long day then sometimes I spent most of the time basically almost nodding off and jerking awake.  It was still a little better than skipping it.  But I cut the session somewhat short in that case and get more sleep which was a reasonable compromise.If no one has mentioned exercise yet I suppose that is an option drop and give me twenty.  Or work your way up to it from very short morning sessions and see if you make any progress towards tolerating it.  Or find some other time of day lunch?  Or What is Zen?

8538668,0,t1_d68vpmh,Alternating attention happens all the time for everyone. Its the default mode of brain functioning the thing that makes it seem as if were attending to several things simultaneously commonly called multitasking. Its just that youre not normally aware of it as a single thread of attention that alternates very quickly between multiple objects unless youre watching it carefully in meditation. So becoming aware of this rapid alternation is a sign of progress. Attention only ceases to alternate when you enter the exclusive focus characteristic of Stages Six and higher.,streamentry,d68wfik,1,t5_3f7zb

Threads such as this weekly group practice and weekly beginner discussion are starting to make this into a really good meditation forum.Here are my answers  Im currently doing instinctual offcushion investigation driven by intentionalityresolution towards my overall practice goals.  I would first have a beginner define their practice goals and then develop a magicklawofattractionintentionality method.  Then I would encourage them to investigate qualities and aspects of their direct experience that they may not currently be seeing. Daniel Ingram had an interview at Lauren Willoughbys Cheetah House in which he discussed the difference between a permanent shift and temporary benefits of meditation saying if you want this stuff hardwired inhouse this is what you have to do.  He also expressed his hardcore outlook through the phrase anyone can do this weve all done stuff that is harder than this.  The challenge is just to keep investigating.

8788218,0,t1_d737wvr,Awesome stuff meant in the true sense of the word.  Crazy?  We all go a little crazy with this practice sometimes.  Due to past conditioning related to all things religious I had to open to some of these concepts via the backdoor of esoteric magickal traditions.  Once I confirmed that it is certainly possible  and in some cases even more practical  to simply let go of conventional conceptual models and to accept a much more... strange magickal wonderous concept of reality... I was suddenly able to turn back toward the beauty of our many ancient spiritual and religious traditions with newfound appreciation.   Your prior post and this update are inspiring.  I personally have more work to do in opening the heart.  Ive come a long way but that shit was locked pretty air tight and I had burned and thrown away the key and then splattered my head against a wall to make sure I could never recall what happened or how it happened.

8811236,0,t1_d76yzg7,So far there have been no actual practice instructions.  Its not a book necessarily intended for beginners.  Rather it is written  it feels like  for more advanced students reaffirming the view that fundamental shifts as he defines enlightenment are possible using any number of different methods or techniques.  He has his own way of synthesizing the various techniques and traditions and discusses that synthesis within a framework that does not offend modern scientific sensibilities.The best way I can describe my feeling for the book is this  Inspiration.  Its also chock full of entertaining anecdotes helpful metaphors and general commentary on the path and practice that is deeply absorbing.  If youre familiar with Ron Crouchs writing style and way of explaining things it feels a bit more like that  very modern western down to earth way of describing enlightenment.  It kind of reminds me of Adyashantis Straight Talk on the Nature of Enlightenment which was also a great and inspirational book but this one to me goes even one step beyond that  so far.

Just to make things confusing Joy On Demand takes exactly the reverse point of view. The idea is that a mental state is like a lens or filter through which you perceive everything one that tends to emphasize some features of experience and deemphasize others. An emotion on the other hand is a palpable energetic experience.Its obvious theres no consistency in this area across authors though and youre lucky if you get any definitions at all. ,streamentry,d7a6ajz,1,t5_3f7zb

8967133,0,t1_d7pjlwr,Thank you! One of the practices that has been engaged in over the last year and a half is the examination of the layers of beliefs and narratives that still exist most notably as they relate to awakening and how it should feel. For instance the idea that it shouldnt feel like there is an I and if it feels like theres an I then theres still more to be done. Why do I believe that it shouldnt still feel like an I operating? How do I or can I know what awakening is supposed to feel like? Is it supposed to feel like anything other than what it is right Now? I find from having studied so diligently one might say obsessively the writings of Maharaj and other sages that there has been a lot of expectations created about what this should feel like. This was also part of the initial resistance to starting a formal meditation practice as I didnt want to be lead to have certain expectations about what should arise and I felt like I was past the need for books that reality could only be found in exploring the experience that is arising. Although I still feel that way I also recognize that the mind is a tool and as such there are methods for exploring the arising experiences that may be more effective than others. And certainly there are benefits to engaging in a meditation practice that go beyond the cushion and into the workings of the mindbody apparatus in the spiritual marketplace as you pointed out. I look forward to sharing more of the journey with you ,streamentry,d7ppprd,2,t5_3f7zb

9611018,0,t3_5c9xhg,HiI used to meditate but did not have any real Buddhist faith and didnt believe in precepts at all. I enjoyed sex and I enjoyed drinking and drugs I also enjoyed eating meat seemed silly to me that these things that are so obviously fun could be thought of as causing suffering. Also there are may tales in Bhuddist history where enlightened male beings have female consorts. For a long time I had an enjoyable sitting practice and made progress towards having a happy and mindful life and did all of the above. Then my wife died which changed a lot of things in my life. She was ill with cancer for two years and my meditation practice really deepened. A few months after her death I went through a succession of new things in both my sitting and off cushion practice. After those things happened I no longer felt the need for drink or drugs did not find it possible to eat meat and became vegetarian and became celibate.  I have been so for some time now and dont feel I have given anything up or am missing anything. I am very happy without these things. I think my message is dont worry about it these things will happen for you at the right time. Intention is everything and you have to take precepts with right view and right intention. Just because they are not right for you now does not mean they will not be in future. Study Dharma on your own and in sangha and meditate on samathat and visipansa and you will be fine with application. I had a heavy dark night and thought I must take refuge I went to the head monk of our local tibetan tradition and poured out my worries and fears and thoughts to become a monk. He asked me about my practice then said dont be hasty this is common and you are doing the right practices dont be hasty come back in a month if you are still in trouble. In thatt time I got through dark night by daily practice and reading Dharma on my own. With good mindfulness you will go far no need to live like a monk. ,streamentry,d9xr63r,3,t5_3f7zb

9663111,0,t1_da40eql,Hey thereThanks for clarifying your question. A sensation could in very basic terms be defined as a moment of contact interpreted through sense organs and pushed to conscious awareness. This definition gets somewhat tricky down the road... But lets hang onto it for now.In the quote you shared from TMI I interpreted the author as meaning unique types of sensations and not amount of sensations. The reason bring that when concentration on the breath increases you can perceive far more than a dozen sensations at the tip of the nose let alone the entire body. At a more minute level these tactile sensations really break down to individual vibrations of energy. This is probably difficult to comprehend right now but I am mentioning it yo clarify that paragraph as being related to type if sensation and not necessarily quantity.This brings me back to my previous advice of deepening the discernment of each sensation. What makes a sensation? What are the constituent parts? How is each moment of sensation unique from the rest? In the anapanasati sutta the Buddha describes this process as knowing short breaths from long breaths. Im on a phone in Japan so i cant quote it directly but I recommend reading it if you havent yet.As to your question regarding what to do when you notice a sensation do you move to it etc. Think of the tip of the nose or the inside of the nostrils as the playing field and concentrate only on the sensations that arise in that area. Rest your attention gently in that spot and stay with the arising and passing of sensations there. There are many other ways to work we with mindfulness of breathing but this is the primary method discussed in the book you are working through. If any part of this still doesnt make sense let me know and Ill clarify further.,streamentry,da46ims,2,t5_3f7zb

I vividly recall driving downtown and feeling like I was internally suspended in perfect silence yet nonetheless surrounded by a screen of audiovisual sensations  like one of those Disney rides where the car just moves in place but screens around you create the sensation of movement. I had some other interesting nondual stuff arise shortly before First Path.  Like you at times that has freaked me out but when in EQ its just amazing.  Have fun with it!

For example apologies for the political example but I would consider Trump University to be a con job even though there were many students who claimed they got their moneys worth.If you dont find the content of the Reiki book problematic thats fine but I disagree. If he actually believes the content of that book then I would call into question his standards of evidence for belief and if he doesnt believe the content then I would consider that further evidence he is intentionally misleading.

10047845,0,t1_dbem5ww,gt  I cant believe how bad it is.That was me in Stage Four too! I still marvel when I think about it. For me the worst lasted I think almost  months. Or  years. Something like that. No seriously somewhere around  months. It started easing up somewhere in there without me even noticing then one day it was like my mind went I get it now. You dont want me to do this.I love the punching the air idea. It is important to cultivate awareness of when dullness is deepening so you can catch it as early as possible thats the thing that ultimately gets a lot of people out of the quicksand of Stage Four. So early in the session when youre still alert really feeling around for any sensation or change in thought pattern that might indicate dullness can get you familiar with that. But I was not very good at it and spent a lot of time having to get up and do standing meditation etc. which didnt feel like meditation at all but it was still training my mind to stay out of dullness in the long run. So while punching the air may or may not feel very satisfying that doesnt mean its not helping you get where you want to be.Also speaking as someone with chronic pain I understand there are uses for pain in meditation but I dont need my practice to make me hurt more. If punching is less painful than standing thats what I would do. Or switching between a technique that hurts a little and something that doesnt if youre up for that.,streamentry,dbh9d82,1,t5_3f7zb

I see metta as its own skill one that certainly can lead to equanimity but its also not the only path. Guy Armstrong I think pointed to this in one of his dharma talks if I recall correctly. I also recall an interview with Daniel Ingram in which he talked about the different unique qualities of enlightened people and how their method of practice to enlightenment and individual personality kind of shaped them. This may be completely incorrect but when I think of an enlightened mind I think of the Buddha and when I think of an enlightened heart I think of Jesus. Of course they both appear to have had enlightened hearts and minds but each focused a bit more on one side of the coin.

10767339,0,t1_ddpwgzc,gt Id be curious what ucoachatlus would say about a beginner trying to follow in the fire kasina footsteps.I dont know.  There is a lot to be learned from the fire kasina and for some minds at least at a certain stage of development the candle may be a better meditation object than the breath.  The breath is an ideal object of concentration but for some folks its extremely difficult so kasina practice might be easier initially. However the fire kasina called to me primarily for flashyexperiencerelated reasons which is a major potential pitfall.  Its easy to go chasing experiences with the fire kasina which often leads to frustration.  It can feel like its not working unless cool visuals are occurring which is an unhelpful mindset.  Also like all concentration practices you need to dedicate quite a bit of time to get into the deeper territory so ones typical daytoday experience with the visuals from the candle may be fairly mundane.There are valuable lessons to be learned from all of that but they are lessons that could get lost on beginner meditators who mostly end up feeling bored and frustrated by the entire endeavor. Additionally given that the fire kasina can end up in borderline if not full blown psychedelic territory it might be particularly challenging for a practitioner who believes theyve crossed the AampP and are in the Dark Night. All in all I would probably recommend sticking with a program like TMI working with the breath or metta as the concentration objects rather than the fire kasina.  If thats too boring or slow going then Id likely recommend dry insightnoting before Id suggest the fire kasina.  I worry that the fire kasina has too many potential distractions and side shows which may be seen as the point but are not the point. ,streamentry,ddqkkq1,5,t5_3f7zb

10966952,0,t3_5wlpji,Hi Rex and welcome!The biggest piece of advice I can give you about your confusion and frustration which by the way is totally understandable given the ocean of opinions and resources out there is first and foremost to relax. Try and fully accept each moment just the way it is without trying to change it. minutes a day of sitting practice is a good start and enough to see benefits but I think if your goal is stream entry an hour a day is even better. Personally I advocate a very balanced approach to the path that includes balanced amounts of concentration insight and dharma study. I dont think that your car is necessarily the best place to do noting practice for safety and effectiveness reasons. That said being in the car is a wonderful time for dharma talks. Dharmaseed.org has a variety of good dharma talks available to download as mp files. There are some really great dharma teachers you can listen to from all over the world my personal favorite is Guy Armstrong. He has a number of engaging talks on the four noble truths and other topics that are fantastic resources. I think that dharma study is really important and sometimes perhaps a bit overlooked in the pragmatic community. So theres three things so far that will help  relax and accept  try and get  minutes of concentration practice in each day.  Dharma study.Once your concentration practice gets to the point where you are reaching and sustaining access concentration regularly IIRC around Stage  of TMI then its a good time to start incorporating some insight work like noting. There are also other methods of insight practice too so even though noting is very popular its not the only practice available. Personally I do Choiceless Awareness more often myself.You can of course forgo concentration practice entirely and go straight into insight practice. A lot of people do that. However there are a lot of benefits to be gained from establishing a strong foundation in concentration first. So generally speaking I dont really recommend it.Last but not least I really want to encourage you to incorporate metta into your daily practice. Its a precious gift that has the power to transform your life in beautiful ways. I wish you all the best on the path and Im looking forward to hearing all about your ups downs and inbetweens as you follow your heart and mind on this amazing journey. lt,streamentry,deb5wmf,1,t5_3f7zb

Sometimes these sensations are in the heart area or lately in my throat but most of the time their in my stomach. I dont think Im focusing too hard or creating tension. This happens off the cushion also. But its getting a lot better. Now I have days completely free of it and the days I do have it arent as intense as they used to be. Plus the easy accessed joy and equanimity Ive developed make things easier .

Tried changing diets and watching what I eat and  that didnt change anything. I feel perfectly healthy tbh. Its just annoying but I just gotta see it out.

11112228,0,t1_deq12pa,Im in the middle of moving to a new state and dont have access to all of my real sources but I poked around on Youtube and found this video which is very similar to what Ive been doing. Its also similar to trauma releasing exercises championed by a guy named David Berceli. Ive combined that with Yin Yoga. I started with this routine but have been going to a local Yoga studio to diversify the Yin practice. Theres also yinyoga.com and other resources. This style of Yoga pays particular attention to hips and has been helpful in combination with the quivering method above. Youll definitely want to broaden the routine given in the video but its a fantastic place to start. I do some form of the Yoga practice every day in combination with meditation. After about  weeks I could feel the muscles in and around my lower abdomen and legs moving when I would lie in bed at night and Im now at the point where I can feel the psoas throughout the day and help it relax when it wants to tighten up again. Still a lot of work to do but incredible and very noticeable progress. Obviously this also ties into the somatic work that Im exploring in combination with TMI. It took me about  months of  minutes meditation every day  yoga to get to stage  but prior to discovering TMI I was doing sudarshan kriya pranayama and mantra meditation for a little bit so we may have started from slightly different places. The last thing that helped my psoas and I just learned this the other day is that chakras are really a thing and healing my sacral chakra with directed Tibetaninfluenced meditations had a profound effect on me the night it first happened. I realize this might sound out there so feel free to ignore this part if you prefer. The me of  months ago would surely have and I wouldnt blame you either!  ,streamentry,derk8ah,1,t5_3f7zb

11243501,0,t3_60gczz,If youre comfortable with the group and finding them inspirational to your practice then I would stick with it.  Ultimately you are the master of your own practice and you have to find out what works best for you.  I started out practicing Zen but it was a bit too opaque for me.  As a beginner I found Pragmatic Dharma with its open discussion of attainments and progress to be refreshing and inspirational.  After practicing for a while I fully came to appreciate the elegance of the simplicity of the Soto Zen approach.Soto Zen teaches a good technique within a wonderful tradition.  If you like it stick with it.  If you need something else try something else.  Feel it out.  ,streamentry,df6fn6v,2,t5_3f7zb
11353249,0,t3_6207ft,Practice is going pretty well.I met with Fred Davis yesterday. Fun experience to meet with an advaita guy especially considering my no self background. Honestly though he really helped to clear some things up for me that Ive been going through for a while. One I know there is no self called Chris but it feels like theres one. His response was stupidly simplistic as it was obvious simply because theres a sense of Chris doesnt mean there is a Chris. This feeling behind my eyeballs is what feels like  Chris but it is not Chris. From the advaita crowd it would be called the Witness and I like that so Ill call it the Witness. He refers to the bodymind as the unit. I like that too. Use the witness to look through the unit he said. Use the unit as a lens. When one does that the personality structure dissolves. Well when doing vipassana meditation thats what I have been doing. That might very well be how everybody does vipassana but Im not totally sure about that. So thks advaita perspective of dwelling as the Witness is remarkably like doing vipassana. Nonidentification investigation inquiry relaxation. Its a lot like RAIN too. I believe dwelling as the Witness is a great off cushion practice and its a good stance to take while on the cushion. I just sat and using the Witness as the basis for my concentration moved up to th jhana maybe even peeked into th. Did some vipassana after that nothing new there. Second path is close as hand I find it strange I havent popped yet but Im not too concerned about it. Ive read second path usually happens quickly but seeing as I spent years and years in the dark night the first time through this is infinitely faster lol ,streamentry,dfivbkh,3,t5_3f7zb

11398864,0,t3_62nwa4,Absolutely no experience with awakening given that Im only stage . But the Suttas often begin with something like and the Buddha rose from meditation and said. Moreover the Mahayana Sutras seem to almost universally begin with something like. The Buddha sat in the x samadhi and bodhisattva y saidAs a more contemporary example although not without controversy Daniel Ingram has stated that although he has reached Arhantship there is still work to do to in developing concentration states and ethical discipline that is easier but not automatic with the shift of awakening.As another way of answering. is formal meditation required? No but youll probably keep doing it anyway.,streamentry,dfo1orr,4,t5_3f7zb
11495616,0,t1_dfyuy2z,I fortuitously stumbled across a post by David Chapman on this topic and I think he sums up my own opinions better than I could The main point for me is on the distinction between cost of service and cost of dhamma. I agree with you that the teachings themselves should not require cost but there are costs associated with upkeep rent server costs etc that I see no problem requiring payment for.The issue I have is that I dont think the burden of responsibility for providing teachings should fall solely on the teacher in the way that it does in a solely donation based system under the attitudes of donation that seem common in capitalist societies. If a center is forced to default on a mortgage for instance those attending hopefully they would help out if they could upon learning the center was in financial difficulty can just find a different center to go to this may also not be the case but those running the center suffer significant financial penalties.,streamentry,dfz0zoc,3,t5_3f7zb
11527228,0,t1_dg2l48a,What happened to the Patreon idea?I do empathise with all of this. i am about to start giving up some paid work to devote more time to dharma and sharing it. My current instinct is that this is going to progress to a form of full time dharma well it already is but you know what I mean. Logically I should start charging people to attend the groups I am setting up and facilitating. But it feels uncomfortable. I am wondering if when explained carefully the dilemma people may go with regular dana. I may say to people I am happy to give time and support for free but if they are able to consider what they might pay for say a weekly yoga class and consider setting up a regular transfer  but no judgment if they do not feel able to.So suggesting to people a helpful form of dana from my point of view would be a regular setup... I mean that still feels a bit persuasive but there may be a way of phrasing it that is more stating the reality of my situation and people can choose how they want to proceed. Oneoffs unless very generous do not keep paying the bills. What do you think?In my other work self employed teaching I have seen some people being tight with money but others being generous. For instance someone keeps giving me pay rises every year even though I do not ask them to. Another person will happily pay for missed lessons even when my policies say they can get a refund. So maybe there is a way.,streamentry,dg2m2y8,1,t5_3f7zb

11639466,0,t1_dgfbwmo,I sympathize with the work thing. Lately Id much rather be meditating than anything else. But for me its helpful to reflect on the value my work has for me  in terms of my overall wellbeing and how it supports that  this helps me prioritize work or see it as a valuable thing to be doing rather than some senseless set of boring tasks that I have to do.Aside from that try little microgoals to keep yourself on task. Small little bitesize goals to keep you focused. Reward yourself in some small way for  sticking tocompleting these little goals.Notice what is distracting you. Is it a sense of ambiguity in the task?  Or something else? If you can clarify what draws you away from work you can begin to develop solutions to keep yourself on task. Bringing this kind of mindful awareness to your work activities will also strengthen your cushion practice.HTH!,streamentry,dgfchtv,2,t5_3f7zb

11720149,0,t1_dgnze0b,You functioned just fine in that state of nonduality didnt you?   What it means to no longer believe in the self is not that you never have selfrelated thoughts anymore.   You dont stop thinking that there is a body that is particular to the instance of awareness that is associated with it.   You dont stop thinking that that body needs to be fed.   You dont stop thinking that there are people who do not share the same thoughts that are occurring in association with the awareness that is associated with that body.Whats changed is that the construct of self is no longer in the way.   Its just a tool.   You can use it when you need to and it falls away immediately when its not needed.   Things that would have upset you and resulted in continuing upset no longer upset you because they are hitting a dummy in the attic not the driver of the bus.There is no driver of the bus which is a bit disconcerting at first... ,streamentry,dgoi9xi,1,t5_3f7zb

11771110,0,t1_dgmbw2f,gt I wonder if whether you experience a cessation event directly has to do with whether or not you have shamata and that they actually happen to everyone who has stream entry.Cessation is appana samadhi so its the highest degree of shamata. That doesnt mean it requires formal shamata practice though.I dont think you have to notice a cessation for stream entry although I am skeptical of this but I would think the more enlightened you get the more likely you would be to have an awareness of cessation. I have a hard time believing you could be an anagami without noticing a cessation but I really dont know.gtThis is new as of the past couple of days.Well let us know in a year or two. I didnt have even minor irritation for  months after what i think was finishing second path but it turned out to just be that I had practiced so much that I had suppressed them for that long.gt Im just watching the interaction happen.Like a spaciousness?,streamentry,dguac11,1,t5_3f7zb
