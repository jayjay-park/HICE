7853065,0,t3_4mq1od,One more thing due to the nature of this roleplay being really time consuming on my part expect new posts every  hours not every  hours itll also give people more time to submit.The reason im doing it like this is imagine a table thats literally x full of different coloured boxes and then having to write up  seperate reports to give to people in addition to all the other work here and there like updating the stock.Im basically saying if I did this every day my brain would literally turn to mush so yea.,TotalDanganroleplay,d3yr6ij,1,t5_3eo8g

10917664,0,t3_5vzcgz,So ill just say it here for reference you each get to choose an additional character. This will be the character that you play as should your main character die.GOAT gets to pick first then LIME then ESTONIASS. Going in order upwards I will remind people when they can pick a second character.ulimeberry uestoniass udaboswinney,TotalDanganroleplay,de62w0g,1,t5_3eo8g
