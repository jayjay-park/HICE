7447,0,t1_cef3ixc,Yeah bro be careful. Another word of wisdom. I work at a cell phone repair shop. Make sure what you buy is legitimately what it is. For example I had a customer come in for an S that was malfunctioning. It looked like an S but looking at it closely the front glass dimensions were off. Taking off the battery and the back housing reviewed that the motherboard was nothing like the S. It was a generic cell phone with an S body. The poor girl was out  dollars. They had a box accessories and manual but it was fake like a  bill. ,verizon,cefa8t6,2,t5_2raz5

Verizon is great because it works everywhere but these people are saying that while TMobile may not work everywhere it works everywhere they need it to because they will switch the second Verizon takes away their unlimited.My question is if these people know for a fact they can get satisfactory service at a fraction of the price why havent they switched already?

1741099,0,t1_cjymev3,The problem Verizon is going to be facing for a while is that their network is not dense enough. Their original mhz LTE network that launched in  is severely overloaded in a lot of areas because there is usually just one large macro cell site tower to provide service for a large diameter of an area. There is only so much bandwidth a single cell site can provide and they have started deploying their second layer of LTE which they are calling XLTE. In most large cities they have enough spectrum to provide twice as much bandwidth per cell site but that is not going to help the other network because the majority of phones on Verizon do not support XLTE only the new phones coming out do. What they are going to have to do is either erect more cell towers or place small cells on top of light poles and building all over the place to densify the network.

By choosing to see your role in the company in such a literal unrealistic sense you are really becoming your own worst enemy. Your own company does not see you that way and while they may emphasize sales as a part of your job it most certainly isnt the only role in your position. Have your purchased a car from a dealership before? Those guys walking the lots on  commission are salesman. And yet their duties of salesman are far exceeding the literal process of selling a car. They are charged with ensuring  of the total process is problem freefrom the selecting of the car agreeing on a price going through financing etc. And yet even after the car has been sold they are still charged with ensuring the customer is satisfied and answering any customer needs in subsequent visits albeit in sales service or otherwise. They are so much tied to customer satisfaction a large portion of their pay is tied to it in the form of customer surveys. Often when it comes to surveys if a salesman doesnt score the equivalent of straight As they actually get docked a portion of their commission. Everyone in the dealership from the General Manager to the lot porter is charged with customer satisfaction. Your company is no different.I have worked in sales for over  years and I can tell you never has being a salesman just involved the literal transaction of selling a product. Whether you want to believe it or not whether you accept it or not you are part of Verizons total customer experience.

3105558,0,t3_2vpbgx,We need to first define grandfathered. Not trying to sound like an ass here. I am sorry if I do. Verizon Wireless and yourself came into an agreement a contract when purchasing a device to what the plan and features will be. The contract is on the phone not the plan. You can make any changes to plan as you see fit and it will not renew your plan. As soon as you decide you want to change out your phone for a discounted price on the phone that means you want to renegotiate and start a new contract. A lot has changed since the st contract you had. It really comes down to that. Again I am not trying to sound like an ass here sorry if I do but I find it unfair to saying trying to take it away. If they really wanted to they can easily say if you have unlimited and you make a change to your device they would remove it but they wont. They done away with unlimited because they realize voice and text is no longer profitable like it was in late s and early s. Data is king. Now I agree Verizon does have some shady practices I disagree with i.e. supercookies. But the unlimited data stuff unless you are on T Mobile and I guess Sprint you arent getting it for a top tier company.Verizon is a business they want money and it really comes down to that. I am very wary of the best buy method I have been hearing from my verizon account manager VZ starting checking on accounts that do upgrades with other lines that have unlimited to make that the device that did edge or upgrade is still on the account and if the device has changed to a line with unlimited that line would get bumped to GB. If you came into my store with this delimma I would look at your usage for the  months try to find ways to cut the bill down and show you better practices on lower data usage I assume U probably dont need that being you are on here idunno. If that isnt good enough. I recommend swappa.I have a consumer line on VZ with unlimited and I buy my phones outright. Just bought a nexus  for close to  dollars day  it came out because I dont want to lose my unlimited. I get it man so I hope you dont think I am ass.

Now get the Verizon model no matter what carrier youre on in case you ever think theres a slight chance you may want to get Verizon.In your case you just need to get your hands on an active Verizon nano SIM. Thats the hardest part. Once you get that far youre golden. Do you have an iPhone with Verizon now? Just pop out your existing SIM and pop it in youre good to go. If you have any other phone with a nano SIM  Droid Turbo Maxx for example those work too.I decided today I wanted to try out my old S again.

It was honestly probably the phone call that did it and getting in touch with Verizon or something we havent been made privy to.I do the Switzma method for my line exclusively which is transferring an upgrade to a basic line then doing the Best Buy method. Why? Because if the shit hits the fan you should just be required to pay the data fee and not lose unlimited. Something else went wrong here. Best Buy already used my upgrade for the Galaxy S edge using this method and Ive maintained everything. Transferring the upgrade to the basic line really changes nothing as the changes dont take place til the new sim is activated anyway. So something else happened.

Advantages of EDGE  APR for  months if youre already going to pay full retail price of a phone can add TMP insuranceDisadvantages of EDGE youre paying full retail price of a phone gtlt you have other options such as Swappa Basically if you were hellbent on getting an S EDGE since they cant be found for any cheaper than retail youre better off financing it   APR with EDGE.But if you dont want the latest and greatest you can pick up a likenew S off Swappa for around  which would be cheaper than financing it through VZW for .Lastly consider upgrading your plan to GB  .

5620120,0,t3_3s3cgp,To open a business account you need an EIN or TaxID. If you do not already have an established business you will pay  deposit per line since they can see your business has no credit history. When you open your business account and have less than  lines on it it will still be considered a consumerbusiness account. Therefore it will still be subject to the increase. The only way you wouldnt be subject to an increase is if your account had an ECPD Profile. This would require you to have atleast  active lines on the account and then you need to sign an account agreement and this moves you up to the next step of business account. However as Im assuming you do not have many of these things it is likely unfeasible as the ECPD Profile setupMajor Account Agreement process takes a couple of days as well. Aside from having  lines you can AOL all at once having an established business and doing the Major Account agreement youre kind of out of luck. Your best option is probably just to use the Best Buy method and lock that price in for  more years.Edit so if you dont have an established business but you have    dollars proof of existence of your business and  lines to AOL and you contact a regional rep asap you can stop your data from increasing until Verizon decides to up the price for businessgovt accounts as well.,verizon,cwtqa6f,3,t5_2raz5

There have been a few posts that instore will work it will require a rep who will agree not to activate it or whatever but the  sure fire guaranteed way for it to work short of issues with a backorder or declined credit card or something like that is to have it shipped to your home.Your contract renews for the most part depending on the device you order within a few hours of ordering so as long as the contract itself is renewed before the th you should be golden.,verizon,cwx23xh,3,t5_2raz5

You argued above that unlimited plans were ok when they were new because they didnt have to transfer THAT much data because it was just handset data.  You are implying that now unlimited data is bad because its not just handset data.And I call bullshit.  VZ themselves said it was less than  of customers grandfathered on unlimited plans.  Less than  of customers cant be having that big an impact on bandwidth.  Many argue that the costs of bandwidth have continued to drop dramatically over the years yet somehow prices stay the same or go up.AndgtThey could just stop grandfathering the plans.Not from what I understand.  The FCC said no Verizon cant just cancel plans because they feel like it.gtThey could selectively block services like ATampT did.And again the FCC said no.  ISPs cannot be selective about what internet services consumers use.  ISPs have no right to influence what bits come from where and how I consume those bits.  gtThey increased speeds dramatically.

Ive never had problems with TMobile in my area because I dont live in a major city in Florida I live in a medium sized one so what Im saying is dont switch off your service onto Verizon if you value data like op said he has unlimited data and att I would much rather have unlimited data then gbs of data and a  fee for every device I use I also cant stand contracts which makes me like TMobile only reason Ill stay with Verizon is for their exclusive droid line of devices,verizon,cxau4sn,2,t5_2raz5

It saves you a trip to the store and as long as youre an account manager on her account youll be able to pull your line off. When you move the line it will not reset the contract dates and you will not be forced to resign anything. You are assuming the financial responsibility of the line and any agreement that already exists on it.  In terms of the most costeffective plan I would look to join someone else that already has Verizon. It is almost always more cost effective to split the cost of a bill than to run solo. If you decide to run solo it depends on who is using the majority of the data but if the GB is being split evenly GBperson I would say the GB Verizon Plan. It would be  for the line access plan less any employer discount the cost of your phone and any additional features and taxes. Odds are youll be right around that  mark you mentioned.  I would seriously look at what it would take to join someone elses plan though. The cost of bumping from a Verizon GB plan to GB is  and the line access would remain the same.

Every s upgrade has been a doubling of the processing power and RAM for a systemwide spec boost of pretty much  on everything. So the s youre using will have twice as easy a time handling that OS. Ive watched a very welldone sidebyside test of the different models running iOS  on YouTube. I cant seem to dig up the one I saw previously that Im basing my assertion on but just check out YouTube if youre curious.I have had several version conflicts. I just havent cared about any of them enough to be motivated to buy a new phone. There are a few apps that I just cant use any more and some stuff where I have a really old version so it doesnt have some new functionality. And I cant get new apps for most stuff. The most notable thing was that my FB Messenger app has gotten broken in some way by updates they make to their serverside stuff. Each time Ive just reported the bug through the app and within a week it worked again.I think Apples got something good up its sleeve for the iPhone . I really trust that executive team theyve got. I havent been paying much attention to the Android phones that come out. I had a Galaxy S at one point after having the original iPhone. I just was not a fan of the S hardware and I really did not enjoy the Android OS.

That last screen before you submit the order is confusing to read but technically your bill would go up a total of  a month. That last screen should separate all the charges for you.Edit I forgot to mention the most confusing part. You are required to pay taxes of the device upon purchasing it on Device Payment. Ipads are spendy so youd probably be looking at around  in taxes up front a one time charge Has to be paid at the time of purchase. Depends on citystatezip etc. Wasnt sure where you were getting that extra amount but thats probably it.Edit I realized I forgot the  for your phone so yes  is correct.

8332083,1,t1_d5iy4yd,I disagree with your Lambo and Moped analogy as that just comes off as brash Verizon propaganda.Verizons primary advantage is the vast swath of low band spectrum it has owned over the years.  So that means they have greater coverage and only needing fewer towers for that coverage.  When youre comparing the Verizon network to cars that makes no sense.  Those two car brands have tangible workmanship differences.  Verizon doesnt really DO anything.  Its physics doing the work.The negatives of low band spectrum is that its horrible with capacity.  So in the age of mobile data thats where TMobile shines because they have needed more towers than Verizon to cover the same area so they can handle more capacity.  Now no doubt TMobile doesnt cover everywhere Verizon does but the gap is closing fast primarily thanks to the low band licenses Verizon sold them.You also have better wifi calling support on TMobile over Verizon with full handoffs from wifi to LTE and vice versa.,verizon,d5j2dlk,1,t5_2raz5

8362405,0,t1_d5mtdsb,Youre right my halfassed example is not indicative of the reality here. The average of all users not just those over  GB as in my example is needed to paint the picture of what the UDP really represents to company policy. On another note I wager that they actual utilization asymptotes at a number near the median as is the case with data utilization. Its difficult for most people to use  GB in a month its exponentially more difficultuncommon to use  given the common usecases. I agree that abusers should be kicked off in the interests of protecting the network with their perpetual torrentingetc and gratuitous overutilization but  GB does not make someone an abuser per se. I know a guy who streams  GB per day of completely normal content from legal sites twitch netflix hulu youtube because wifi is not feasible. Thats  GB per month I wouldnt call him an abuser. The takeaway is that Verizons use of the  GB figure does not represent the interests of protecting the network and  GB is not the median for all UDP subs just those in the most extreme cases used to justify this move. ,verizon,d5mup0z,2,t5_2raz5

The  trade in is also going to be BIC but these show up as soon as Verizon receives your phone and passes the value inspection test i.e. was it damaged?. Generally its about  days after you shipped your phone back to Verizon or when you turned those phones in if you did it in a corporate store  day shipping time   day inspection and BIC application.  The  per phone discount will be similar to case  BIC on nd or rd bill.  You can opt to pay off any installment balance at any time. This wont affect your alreadyinvoiced bill because you always pay a monthinadvance for your service but it will affect your second and future bills.  Note that you cant direct any BIC values toward an installment balance if thats what you were thinking of doing.

On a computer if you run Linux or some test versions of Windows the bootloader will come up and ask you which OS or OS version you want to load. Every computer and phone including the iPhone has a bootloader but most of them just default to the one OS.There is a way to actually choose which OS on Android through a modified recovery called MultiROM but generally the bootloader loads the OS unless something special is done to load a much smaller stripped down OS called the Recovery. While the stock recovery just allows you to factory reset the phone and maybe clear the cache the custom one everyone likes called TWRP can back up the contents of the phone restore a backup and much more.The OP likely wants an unlockable bootloader to flash TWRP and then from there install a custom ROM firmware such as CyanogenMod or something like that.

10638795,0,t1_ddczmk1,So a lot of the G stuff is still being kept really close to the chest but from my own independent research at GHz at normal cell site power levels you would look at about  meters for coverage and the limiting factor would mostly be the phone because phones are limited to dBm based on the LTE standard with the exception of the HPUE that Sprint managed to get the standards body to approve which is dBm. All that being said based on all the research Ive been doing theres a millimeter wave solution and a sub GHz solution that would do a lot to extend the range and allow a macro solution in addition to the small cells.  The only issue is that it requires a LOT of contiguous bandwidth and in the US I dont know if theres much sub Ghz spectrum thats not already being used for some purpose or another. P.S.

There should be a promotional trade in credit on the st line and if the phone support did what it said it did after a bit of a mistake by the trade in department that should be applying this month.But Im not  positive what the amount will be as there are a few different choices depending on exactly how you read the promotion.Black Friday Pixel XL GB with a S as trade in.  Appraised value in the first set of emails was .mo but they didnt process my trade in for a week after they got my S which put it over the  day line.
