11406454,0,t1_dfow0as,Im sure it is but I ask again who is a legitmate target in your mind? When the people vote for near  years for an Irish Parliment and Westminster doesnt grant it for  years how do you respond? Wait for it to be  years?  years?  years? Forget the idea completly? What would you want done? I hope the answer you give could at least provide some insight but the quality of response on this sub appears quite lacking in nature with no ability my the members to reason or formulate ideas looking over both what you have posted about me and others the only user who has shown the ability to do it was splatterpuss.    I did like how czechme argued I was a Corbyn supporter as an account on a different site with the same name as my account here said in  they support Corbyn.    Genuine question are you looking forward to  when the Tories look set to have around  more seats than Labour? I just saw on Britian Elects you havent once been not even for an instance had a votining intention average higher than the conservatives keep up the divides in Labour with subredits like this and rLabour ! How many elections do you think itll take before labour is on double digits in regards to seats in Parliment?,shitcorbotssay,dfowodb,1,t5_3daz8
