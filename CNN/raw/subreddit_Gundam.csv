51763,0,t3_1ulbxx,Ok so now for my second post which will actually contain my true mobile suit.I spent so much time designing this. It was so much fun.So lets start with the body and frame of the PhenexBut lets remove the two shields from the back of it and keep only the beam sabers the beam tonfas and the vulcans. So I drop the rifle.Also I will keep the NTD system simply because I enjoy transformations and having that option.Now lets talk additionsLets start with some from the Akatsuki Adding the Akatsukis twin beam saber and the Shiranui  pack.I will NOT be adding the gold plating because this is GUNPLA. In life or death sure but my suit will require me to be a better pilot so NO PROECTION!Also I will take the beam sabers from the Hi Nu Gundam   that can create the second blade on the other end of the hilt.Those will be carried on the Shiranui pack.And lastly the paint job.All of the gold on the Phenex as well as the Shiranui will be Azure  All the black parts remain black. And when it enters Destroy Mode which I will be calling God Mode the glow will be Rose Pink So now I give you The Based Gundam!!!TYBG,Gundam,cekbnpt,1,t5_2sjr4

383609,0,t1_cfk5d4u,gt Why change the color scheme? I heard from your old Destiny Rant video that the Destinys color scheme is a ripoff of the Zeta Gundam. But is that really such a bad thing? Isnt the Destiny supposed to be a homage to the Zeta in the first place like how the Strike is a homage to the RX?The problem is that Destiny went overboard with references and at that point we had to change that too. The Arch Destinys goal was to go out of its way to be different and that includes distancing itself from the original Destinys color with something much better.gt I have nothing against this new color scheme though. Its awesome but it screams Strike Noir sometimes.Strike Noirs Colorscheme is definitely different. It has more of a Gunmetal Black Gray and Red Secondary and Orange Trim. Arch Destiny has a more Basic Black White amp Red Secondary and Gold Trim.gt Why do you hate the original Destinys tears? Isnt that a representation of Shinns crying out of the pain and struggles he went through?Because the Arch Destiny Gundam is a hypothetical representation of Shinn putting the past behind him and that hes fighting with a clear head and not mentally suffering anymore. Its a hypothetical representation of if Shinn were to actually get the character development that was originally intended for him. Those tears are not needed on this mobile suit because Shinn has already put his past behind him and hes not crying out in pain anymore.gt The way how the Ragnarok is described just makes me wonder how heavy that thing is. And since its stored on the back it makes me wonder how the heck can the Gundam maintain its balance without falling backwards due to the weight. The Ragnarok sounds so heavy it probably can only be usedcarried in space.In Normal Firing Mode its about as heavy as I would say.....the Gundam AGEs Sigmaxis Rifle. That seems about right per se. But nothing that cant be used on earth. And ontop of that. Its easier to hold because of how your hand is supported by that slot you insert it into to grab the grip with. ,Gundam,cfkiyd7,1,t5_2sjr4

431945,0,t1_cfnb9kq,gt I cant tell what kind of show it wants to be...It wants to be a Gundam show that incorporates all of the various Gundam shows. Some Gundam series work via more conventional and realistic mechanics  like pretty much all of the UC series. Okay so they are only realistic within the realm of Minovsky physics but they generally do keep things more consistent  there arent many super powerups or anything. Other Gundam series are less realistic and are more akin to super robot shows.If Gunpla fighting favoured one style over the other Gunpla fighters would flock to one style of mobile suits. They would either use the more super robot designs or the more realistic suits. Instead Gunpla fighting seems to allow both sorts of mobile suits to prevail depending on the skill of the users and the quality of construction. Weve seen both super suits  the Star Build Strike the Gundam x Maoh and the Sengoku Astray  and weve seen more conventional mobile suits  the Zaku amp Kampfer Amazing the Qubeley Papillon mostly the Wing Gundam Fenice and the GM Sniper K.The benefit is that the show can incorporate both types of Gundam series. The downside is that when you have a fight between two of the superstyle suits it often ends up being less about tactics and more of a slogging match between powerups.,Gundam,cfpjawg,2,t5_2sjr4

Kamille became one of my favorite protagonists as he matured into a competent pilot and in general I like a lot of the characters ex. Four.

517677,0,t1_cfz2o5n,His intentions may be pure but that does not necessarily mean the results will be as clear cut as is his intention. If this goes the way Im thinking then Tatsuyas ongoing battle between lust of victory as the Meijin and his friends as Tatsuya will come up again. On the chance that Tatsuyas internal battle turns up as defeat and he becomes the Meijin of lust for victory will the show go full shounen? Will Tatsuya the friendly rival become the main antagonist battling with strings attached to PPSE?Will the show take the G Gundam route where Tatsuya acts as the antagonistic older brother but is constantly looking for ways to bring down the corrupt powers of PPSE?The way that Tatsuya talks fits the character trope of friendly rival and now that hes piloting an unfinished Exia  the most powerful Gunpla ever created the road to corrupted friend rival character trope lies ahead especially with the Dark Matter Exia announced.In the end this is all speculation take it for what it is.,Gundam,cfz43tf,0,t5_2sjr4

622977,0,t3_21806u,The depth of the stories has me.  Even the shallowest storied series is still pretty in depth compared to a lot of the crap on US tv.  An actual ending and goal to get to that ending helps.  It also doesnt just revolve around giant robots fight giant robots.  G is the only exception but an argument can even be made for that one about it not completely being robot vs robot.  The characters are also not extremely over powered.  They can be defeated.  Characters die and dont come back lots of dieing in DB but they always found that one loophole to let them come back...and even more powerful.  It shows how war affects not only human life but the environment in general.  It does get a little woe is me in some of the series but it isnt completely out of place in many cases.  In a lot of cases they are thrust into war in the teensearly s.  Not just a war over a small piece of land but in most cases a war for survival of one entire race of beings.  Like the spacenoid vs earthlings throughout the entire original series.,Gundam,cgb2zyl,2,t5_2sjr4

664320,0,t3_21rbkf,I agree with you Ive got a lot of flack trying to stand up for shows such as Seed Destiny and Age. I really dont understand why people cant enjoy them. They may not be the best Gundam series but that doesnt mean they should be ridiculed and tossed aside.Ive made a post before trying to explain that Gundam is a very flexible franchise. It contains tons of lore different character variations and hours of quality. Of course not every series is suited to one viewer. For example and I know Im going to get a ton of flak for saying this but I couldnt pick up Turn A. Ive only watched a couple of episodes but it didnt have as much pull to me. The same kind that I had while watching  or Stardust Memory. But thats just my preference.Now the franchise is expanding even wider with shows like Build Fighters and soon G no Reconquista. These shows are aimed for the younger audiences but they contain plenty of content for the die hard fans. So what Im trying to say is. We all have our own preferences and just because we dont enjoy something else it doesnt mean it is absolutely bad.,Gundam,cgfs6j7,4,t5_2sjr4

1617312,0,t3_2cu2fv,Gundam could absolutely thrive in the west but just needs the chance to do so. Gundam no doubt hit its high of popularity in the west around when Wing was being shown on TV in the early s followed by G  SEED and Destiny. I believe  was broadcast as well but not on CNs Toonami like the others were. I remember when Wing was being shown places like Toys R Us and the such would have gunpla lined up on their shelves. It was also around that time that many Gundam related games would be brought over here as well. I believe the decline in popularity began to happen because it wasnt handled correctly on the business side. They made a huge effort to market the original  series which while awesome couldnt really hold the interest of the then present audience. I remember the home video releases for Gundam DVDs were pretty expensive for the North American market. There are other reasons for sure. Case in point Gundam can find a big following in North America much like it has before. With the recent release of Dynasty Warriors Gundam Reborn and Unicorn you can conclude that the hope of bringing Gundam properties over to NA isnt dead and honestly it seems like a matter of time before someone announces they have the license to it. I remember hearing rumours that BandaiSunrise are looking for a new distributor for Gundam but wants them to do so for all of Gundam Build Fighters. Also in terms of games I firmly think the release of Extreme Vs would do wonders. Even if it were to be released right now with the majority of the gaming community not knowing what Gundam is. Gundam fan or not the Vs series has a winning formula for an amazing fighting game and it saddens me that a lot of people are missing out.     ,Gundam,cjj11jm,4,t5_2sjr4

1902413,0,t1_cjdx516,Late reply but whatev I didnt even know this sub existed until I found it on Google.gt But if thats true then this must be his original vision.No this isnt his original vision. Beltorchikas Children is the third version of the events of UC .The original vision was laid out in HiStreamer written in . The second half of HiStreamer was then more or less straightforwardly adapted into the movie Chars Counterattack. However Tomino wasnt allowed to include certain elementsBeltorchika most obviouslyso he wrote Beltorchikas Children to include them.The differences between the threeHiStreamer details exactly how Char took control of what was left of Neo Zeon using terrorist groups like the New Summer Project to distract Londo Bell and the Federation.Chars Counterattack adapts the second half of HiStreamer so we miss out on the background events.Beltorchikas Children occurs slightly later in UC  than CCA shows Amuro in a relationship with Beltorchika instead of Chan Agi modifies the QuessHathaway events to set up Hathaways Flash confirms that Char and Amuro are KIA and includes some conceptual elements like Amuros Newtype baby that would later be seen onair in Victory Gundam.So no Beltorchikas Children is not the original vision. Its the most refined vision but its still not original. Even HiStreamer doesnt fully implement the true original visionfor instance Gyunei Guss was invented to fill the role originally reserved for Kamille Bidan because Sunrise didnt approve of using Kamille as basically a cybernetic brainwashed henchman.gtThis is why Im having troubles identifying what to consider canon and what not.TV series are canon over movies which are canon over books. For instance the Zeta TV series is canon while the Zeta movies are not. However the CCA movie is canon while the CCA novels are not.

Is it because you showed us masked Luin in the next episodes preview?So far so good. Im trying not to be too optimistic. Nothing Earthshattering or mustwatch yet but that would be weird and its pretty highquality. The battle was excellent although I dont know what to make of that SUcord yet. Maybe SU as in Surugan? I loved seeing Dellensen amidst a million speedlines.Im expecting Dellensen to die soon. Isnt he walking arminarm with Bellri and Cahill in the ED? Two honorable authority figures one on each side of the conflict both who die early on? Thats what Im expecting. Maybe Aida will kill him?Its good to see that neither the Amerian pirates nor the Capital Army is outright villainous so far. I was expecting Bellri to learn that the Capital is ridiculously evil once the Amerians tell him some things like Crossbone showing Tobia the truth about Jupiter in the manga. But I thought it was a good sign that Klim ruined the chance for a talk between Bellri and Dellensen. This AgTech taboo stuff is also interesting.

Watched Wing and it was meh Dont try to shove me with your nostalgic BS The  cemented my place in the fandom as I loved this show despite its obsolete animation. Then I watched Rrobberts Gunpla Review shows and it got interested in Bandais very own crack. NG  Overflag was my first Gunpla btw Watched few episodes of Unicorn and I was amazed by the amount of quality but I need to do more research on the lore. While waiting for another episode I got straight into... Zeta Gundam. Holy hell this was my favourite! CCA was too goddamn epic  made me cry like a bitch  gave me one hell of a testosterone boost AGE was actually good until Kio came G Gundam was entertaining and a good tonic to deal with the seriousness of the whole Gundam universe Turn A was majestic and beautiful Build Fighters makes me proud of my Gundam fandom.I didnt have Toonami when I was a kid but I am actually glad that I discovered Gundam at a later stage of my life because I start to appreciate the deep themes of every universe and appreciate the human side of robotic warfare,Gundam,cle26b5,1,t5_2sjr4

2172182,0,t3_2jx5ho,I entirely agree with everything youve written here. And if you watch more of Gundam youll see the word Newtype pop up more and more. In the Mobile Suit Gundam story Newtype is a term applied to people that have advanced reflexes perceptive abilities and sometimes psychic abilities. But in Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn the writer Fukui IIRC took a different approach to the concept of the Newtype.In short the idea of Newtype that he put forth wasnt a super soldier or a psychic. He believed Newtypes were people who never let themselves be chained down by tradition habit or the fear of failure and that they were always willing to explore or try new things. A relationship shared by parent and child which is another theme that he wrote into Unicorn. He believed that this was the difference between Oldtypes and Newtypes parents and their children. In other words Newtypes are free spirits that wont ever be dampened no matter how bleak things may seem.To see the free spirit message being pushed in an ostensibly silly show is important in my opinion. The target audience of children is critical because the free spirit message is encouraging them to not be stagnated by routine and norms. It wants them to be creative to explore and to not be afraid to try something new. This pushing of the boundaries is something important to teach children. And as someone who is also transitioning into the working world I also feel like Im being overwhelmed by expectations to essentially perpetuate a status quo. Rather than living as a Newtype I feel that I am expected to behave as an Oldtype. As the Mobile Suit Gundam story would say I feel as if my soul is weighed down by gravity.,Gundam,clfxp95,5,t5_2sjr4

ZZ has some of the best storytelling and story arcs of all of the UC Gundam shows. Its also required watching to understand Unicorns subplots.In the meantime just enjoy the characters and laugh at how many excuses they come up with for the cockpits on the mobile suits to stay open so that people can yell at each other directly.

2399590,0,t3_2mtz10,Most late UC Full  degree view cockpits use simulated view for blind spots with a combination of all the suit camerasensor arrays you might think that at first glance the only cameras on the MS are in the head but in fact there is a multitudes of lens all around the suit. So the MS OS take all that video feed and display it around the cockpit in one big seemingly uncut picture when in fact its a bunch of picture grouped together and adjusted to give a  view.Gundam Alex was one of the first MS to posses a  cockpit view I think other older suits do not have such luxury remember that all the electronics of a MS have to be shielded heavily because of M particles dispersion so they could only afford maybe a main camera on a suit  maybe  sub cameras and maybe thermal vision gear.That said most MS rely on a main camera for long range vision usually on the head therefore charging an opponent in space from bellow going at full speed from a reasonably long distance would give you an edge on a nonvoodoo using teenager that is. I think that is Why weapons like funnels are so devastating there is probably a bit of lag with certain spots in the  monitor that  milliseconds might be enough to not be able to dodge that beam coming from the back. ,Gundam,cm8apr5,1,t5_2sjr4

Hitting on his teammate calls Sekai out saying how Jigen Haoh wont work on him and proceeds to absolutely wreck in a GFighter with arms in the semifinal match. Its almost unfair.  Poor Gyanko. Her plan didnt work to get the date and then she lost her match unable to keep her promise. On the bright side it looks like shes going to be a regular character so who knows?

2841227,0,t3_2sn5xe,Personally I prefer the series.  So much of s brilliance to me is showing the characters progression in a way and pace that makes sense instead of the usual big thing X happens now Character Y is evil way.I also feel the show pulls off what its trying to show better with the slower pacing.  Especially when White Base is trying to escape from Zeon territory.  You get a much better sense of were in a pretty desperate situation we have GOT to survive this and get away and for the Zeon We have GOT to get rid of these guys!   In the movie it feels more like some battles happen now were in space for more battles.  The movies do a good job but its just not the same to me.  Also the movies while not entirely passing over the Zeon characters dont seem to spend as much time showing the enemy as being made up of mostly reasonable men with good hearts.  Not to mention it feels more like a war is progressing with all the pieces moving and getting positioned in time etc.There are some throwaway episodes and one part in particular where someone throws a hissy fit lasts longer.  Oh and one STUPID part with these old people I would have executed them all.  But those pass quick enough and I think the overall effect is far superior to that of the movies.I LOVE original MSG.,Gundam,cnr1ml0,24,t5_2sjr4

2949765,0,t3_2tqz74,Im definitely in the minority but I didnt like it and it was all because of Albert and how stupid he acts throughout the entirety of the show plus the fact that hes the cause of everyones misfortune in the show makes it even worse. I generally liked the ending and the build up in the second half of the show and every other character is really endearing like Bernie and Chris and even the whole Zeon team but Albert was just insufferable for the majority of the show.Hey lets give these photos I took from a secure government area to a Zeon soldier even though our colony is obviously allied with the Federation.Seriously if he didnt give those pictures to Bernie he wouldve never gotten him killed and there wouldve never been a nuclear warhead threat to destroy the colony. Bernie wouldve gone home been dishonorably discharged and thats about it.Hey when we see that same soldier back on the colony with an obvious band of dubious soldiers lets not tell the police or anyone about it. In fact Im gonna help them which could only possibly lead to even more destruction on the colony as the war intensfies. It doesnt really help that it shows Albert as being legitimately stupid going as far as to show him failing in school and not like he was being manipulated by the Zeon pilots. Than itd at least be tragic but he isnt and he just goes along with it with no hesitation or question because he doesnt understand the consequences of war and it makes it super frustrating to watch. Edit Even if he had some unfounded hatred of the Federation as previously explored in his character but he doesnt he just thinks the Zeon are cool.Hey Bernie I know youre not a very good pilot and youre out numbered and you have no supplies or resources what so ever and this whole situation has now spiraled totally out of our control but instead of leaving the planet to save yourself from being nuked or falling victim to prosecution via Federation government why not go fight the nay unstoppable top of the line killing machine. We can definitely beat it you one random dude and me some kid. The Best thing Bernie couldve done is what his plan B kind of was anyways and thats confess the Zeon plans to destroy the colony he couldve even brought that one guy from the bar with him as extra testimony its obvious he has more of an alliance to the colony than he does the Zeon since hes willing to die with them and become a POW but Bernie had it in his head that he had to fight the Gundam he had too. I dont know how the federation treats POWs but I highly doubt they wouldve just straight up murdered him especially since he was shot down at the beginning of the battle and in this hypothetical situation turned himself in.,Gundam,co3ehh9,1,t5_2sjr4

3257748,0,t3_2xdfm2,These comments are some of the weirdest Ive ever seen. Did we watch the same episode?This is fantastic. I loved it beginning to end. The CG looks good and between this and Unicorn it seems like Sunrise is finally finding a clear and consistent graphical style for Gundam machinesand its very visually appealing.The various MSG character cameos are surprisingly thoughtful and striking and lends some context to MSG. Clamps appearance did more for that character and the Ramba Ral arc of MSG than all of the RalHamon escapades throughout the episode. Kycilia is presented in a fairly favorable light though I think Sasro needed more air time and failed to get it. Also I hate when characters have pets because it inevitably means the pets are going to die.If you think Gundam is just about explosions and particle effects then youre going to be disappointed by this. Frankly the Battle of Loum at the beginning is totally unnecessary and feels like it was added just to have flashy footage to use in advertisements. This is about a core cast of strong characters some of the strongest in anime history. Theyre still effective and appealing  years later and  years earlier. Bravo.It really does feel like were moving towards a remake of MSG though. I know thats not happening at least not under the moniker of The Origin but it feels like the time is getting ripe to do a full Tominodirected remake of MSG.,Gundam,cozodi8,32,t5_2sjr4

3364361,0,t1_cpbp5qf,Personally I dont know why everyone is treating GBF as if it were a masterpiece I watched it straight through into Try when Try was still at Episode . And have since rewatched GBF while building Gunpla. Id agree tonights episode was so exceptionally good I think it tops almost every fight for both GBF and Try at least for me anyway. Wish they would do more with the Team Settings like the one th Team from earlier in the season.And I am personally really sick of hearing the Martial Arts Asspulls line. Ive brought this up before but just about every other episode Sei and Reiji had a new gimmick first its a new Gunpla then its the booster can be autonomous then its the shield then its the mega beam then its the RG and then the Build Knuckle and then everytime the RG or Build Knuckle came on and you heard the music....Thats good game for their opponent hell they even did it against the Dark Matter. Can we stop pretending that GBF didnt have the exact same formula?Honestly theyre teasing. They have a reason for not showing Sei that will most likely come up next season maybe end of this season as a cliffhanger. Its a pretty weird choice to throw China out there. And if them teasing is just as bad as not showing them how much did you hate the first half of Zeta? They teased Amuro the first  something episodes and practically hang Char in front of your face with out actually saying it you know? Just stop watching if you dislike it that much dude. What would you have done if GBF had been canceled after Season ? And Sekai got a whole lot of development just  episodes ago...and a lot in the early episodes.....I mean personally Im super engaged with the characters. Loved Junya loved Lucas loving Minato loving Sekai and totally digging the thing Lady KAwaguchi Shia and Fumino have going on.

3525876,0,t1_cptnlu3,gt Same here. I ended the series confused as heck and wondering why each and every character seemed to lack common sense.Culture man. The characters are somewhat alien because of the cultures theyre raised in being so far ahead in the future not having war and whatnot. What they consider common sense and how they act is going to reflect that. Its kinda like the Jovians from Nadesico. They based their culture around a Super Robot anime which has an effect on how they act. We think they act like loons the crew of the Nadesico think they act like loons which is saying something but to them theyre acting perfectly normal.And why I like this series is because its one of those works that you can really read into. This feels like like an anime and more like a hard scifi story. I love this kinda shit. Edit Doesnt mean I find its perfect though. Kamen Rider Kuuga did the same thing is probably the most realistic toku ever and I still find Kamen Rider Agito to be the better series even though its more cliche.,Gundam,cpu6ax5,1,t5_2sjr4

Thats why it appeared with Lalahs. Only part of Char remained after the Axis Shock. Fukui In the last scene of Chars Counterattack when Chars soul is dispersed its not strange to think that part of him consented to die peacefully but another part might have been unable to consent to dying and remained in the world as a kind of grudge.

Giant robot laser sword science is very serious and should be treated as such!gt Additionally the plasma wouldnt be solid if the tip of the saber got disrupted I dont really see why the bottom half would be stopped.Its not and I could be wrong about exactly what happens when beam sabers clash in UC but I know fictional science behind it which is as I described. It could just be that ifields dont play nice with each other and naturally push against one another. And actually when we do see beam sabers clash in UC the bottom part doesnt stop which causes the entire blade to bend. Since part of the blade that the saber is maintaining cant pass through though its not like a pilot could detach the top half and slice with the bottom half.

4025851,0,t1_crf4sbh,But Amuro does have crazy psychic visions in space and later has the ability to deflect an entire asteroid with human will alone.  But yeah I agree with youre second assertion.  We just get this nebulous label called newtype but what is that exactly?  Its not clearly defined and there are inconsistencies with their power.  But thats the beauty of Gundam.  Most of Tominos work in UC attempts to answer this question and the answer evolves the further into the time line you go.  At first newtype is equivalent to ace mobile suit pilot.  Then in Zeta and beyond its used to describe people with ethereal powers.  Its not until the later parts of the UC that we perhaps get a true answer.  In F Seabook states that maybe newtypes are people who understand somethings true essence.  That would imply that these powers used by newtypes like Kamille and Amuro and Banagher are actually the true power of their mobile suits only capable of being used by someone who truly comprehends the machines use.TLDR Maybe its not Newtypes who have super powers but the machines.

War in the pocket gt short series that is very unique in the gundam universe still a great series though and almost has a studio ghibli feel at times.

But the fact that he keeps on fighting for a minute and a half before Hanayo literally had to bail him out or he was going to die if she didnt. That still shows something about him. He has so much will in him that he didnt care about his neck bleeding out fast or his blood pressure dropping rapidly. He just wanted to beat the shit out of the Thrones. Even though he didnt get far even before Hanayo bailed him out it still showed just how strong his will was.He definitely seems fine to me? Idk what youre talking about man.

4244611,0,t1_cs2nksy,gt Reconguista in Gs pacing was a problem but the narrative storytelling is something else entirely.This.  I readily admit the pacing was a problem because there were a number of scenes and times when something dramatic or important was happening and a little extra time lingering on that specific scene would have greatly increased the impact of those scenes instead of rushing along.  The show very seldom spends more than a few seconds establishing location or letting something important sink in before were already at the next plot point.However the narrative storytelling is IMO superb.  As a person who studies history extensively GRecos style of presenting character perspectives free of unnecessary exposition and narration is not just more engaging and intellectually stimulating but much more true to life.  The whole point of Gundam originally was to try and make a robot series as realistic as possible.  GReco takes that realism that was applied to the scifi world and extends it into the form of the show itself giving us a realistic perspective into a very realistic world.  IRL you dont have info dumps or get to hear peoples inner thoughts or have timely flashbacks if youve forgotten something.  You just have to observe all available information and figure shit out yourselves.  I dont want to be insulting to people but if you couldnt figure out what was going on in GReco then you either werent paying attention well enough or your brain isnt used to having to do the kind of critical analysis of primary sources that GReco insists the viewer partake in.And the brilliant thing about the form of the show that requires theme of critical analysis and piecing info together yourself and learning to empathize with others to understand it is that the characters themselves are going through the same thing.  The form of the show reinforces the shows themes themselves and thats always a neat thing.  Bellri and the crew of the Megafauna are stuck between a bunch of competing powers and perspectives and have to attempt to piece together what everyone wants and where theyre coming from because those people themselves are failing to do that and engage in rational discussion.  And thats what ultimately sets the good guys apart from the antagonists in this show.,Gundam,cs42qp0,4,t5_2sjr4

Is it too much to ask for the whole story in one format?Im aware I can get the original Saturn game or get the Missing Link PS game but I dont wanna import a Saturn and hunt the game down and those games arent going to portray the battles very well because you have to make the bosses... well bosses.

Raise the Brightness a bit. Added a lot of Lens Flares. and BAM! Instant Profit. If he really wanted it to be an HD Remastered he could have easily reanimated the entire thing with improved animations.

Overall Destiny and SEED didnt get me into the universe and I wasnt sold on giant mechs yet. When  came out I fell in love with the designs. After that i entered into the multiverse and quite rapidly grown to love most suits the Strike the Zogok which looked terrible which i still believe to be true in the ZZ illustrations and the Zeta.What I havent grown to truly love yet is the ZZ Gundam. Its just the wrong type of bulky and the combination gimmick seems so tacked on. TLDR Loved only  suits at first quickly grown to love the rest. ,Gundam,csty7gg,1,t5_2sjr4
4487318,0,t3_3ck4zu,Yeah it was an odd piece of story. As far as the gundam mk.  issue I can only assume that the GP models were high powered prototypes. So they were made with a budget be damned kinda mindset. The Gundam mk. were made to be mass produced I believe for the Titans still high powered machines but with more tried and true systems then with high end systems. Though GP three was the only Gundam of the project to survive and it had a panoramic cockpit  years later that shit was everywhere.Nina..... Yeah they should have left the love triangle out or had that fleshed out back in the screenplay development. If I remember the director added that in half way through production.

All the various protagonists that start out getting dragged into the war against their will Amuro Judau Kira etc eventually decide that they need to keep fighting not just to keep themselves and their friends alive but to defeat the bad guys.  The message is resolve your problems without fighting if you can but be prepared to fight and win if you have to not fighting is bad and you should never ever do it.Well thats the message for pretty much everything except the  movie anyway.  But the  movie shoots itself in the foot by making it so that they have to fight in order to communicate which makes the fighting always bad talking always good thing kinda dumb.,Gundam,ctw757v,1,t5_2sjr4

What if Destiny had continued to fight or Kira refused to allow Destiny to retreat?

That doesnt change the fact that Zeon and the various Zeon remnant organizations deliberately commit mass murder on a startlingly regular basis     ... while the Federation continually opposes them.Actually thats rather telling by itself.  Over four TV shows two movies and four OVAs not once is the Federation fighting an offensive war.  Each and every time they find themselves fighting its because someone else is attacking them.

5126519,0,t3_3l7fav,i mean in all fairness SEED isnt a typical gundam series to begin with still my fav series tho D hate me if you must AND LETS NOT TIE DESTINY WITH SEED  now to answer your question with my personal opinionThe value of a gundam is still there though to a lesser extent. The characters who get gundam like suits are only MCs who play very important roles. and to clarify for me a gundam is a suit that has overwhelming power and abilities. When we take a look at SEED we see the strike having this status as well as the stolen G weapons. The zaft grunt units though super compared to their earth alliance counterparts are relatively weak units. I mean the ONLY real reason that the zaft grunt units are good is because they were actual mobile suits where the earth alliance only used tanks and old mobile armors. When you compare the zaft grunt units to the strike or any of the g weapons they are severely out matched. With this mind set if we look at what has gundam status in SEED we have strike buster aegis duel blitz for the first half     then we add freedom justice clamity raider forbidden. second half at the point where freedom and justice come out the strike is downgraded to a normal grunt unit in part as orb now has an army of them. If you look at DESTINY you can find that the setup of what is a gundam is almost the same. where actually infact instead of having the various G weapons we only have zakus which i would say count as grunt units. even the upgraded zakus and windoms.and honestly if you compare it to some of the other gundams easiest i can think of to relate being  this is something that happens. if you look at  POSSIBLE SPOILERSSSSSSSpoilers Celestial Being starts off with  gundams that completely out match anything else. from there the show progresses to  more gundams showing up that do what they want to the earth federation having  i think it was gundam like equals. fast forward to second season and now there is literally more gundams in the enemys control then there are for the allies. almost all of which having unique set ups.In my opinion its all about the frame of reference.  hope i didnt undermine anyones favorite gundam or series. again its all just my opinion and i am kinda biased to love seed though i do admit it had its flaws D,Gundam,cv3xrrz,4,t5_2sjr4

The shit Fukuda gets here is nothing compared to what Jonathon Tzachor gets from the Power Rangers fandom and there is no defending some of the things JT did. No defending. The final product supposed to be the most expensive season in Power Rangers history looks like the cheapest season in Power Rangers history. A season meant to celebrate  years of Power Rangers feels like the higher ups didnt give a damn confirmed in an interview with the Yellow Ranger and couldnt differentiate between themselves and sentai.No word of a lie. They left in sentai teams that were never used in Power Rangers all season so that they could use the footage from one of the enemy generals death. They could have reshot the fight but they didnt. The kicker? They digitally replaced Vul Eagle with Mighty Morphin Red for the anniversary.TTAFfBH is at least selfaware and gets a few genuine laughs out of me.

5413119,0,t3_3oytjv,Actually Ill combobreak and say yes if youre a fan of most of the original cast. Athrun and Cagalli do get regression in some ways which is basically a function of their new roles and interactions with a bunch of people skilled at manipulation.The new cast basically goes from protagonists to outright villains in some way shape or formbasically becoming villainous and less capable versions of the old cast by the time Kira gets an upgraded Freedom Strike Freedom.Granted there were plenty of flaws in GSD overreliance on flashback episodes gratuitous reused animation sometimes even reusing animation from the wrong Gundam but it isnt as utterly horrid as its detractors claim it is. Remember it succeeded in Japan for a good reason and Kira and I believe Lacus are still among the top  gundam characters for their respective genders despite their last show being around  years ago.Or if you want a TLDR Kira and Lacus are even more amazing than they are in SEED kick tons of ass and save the day.

It has begun.Awesome actionpacked episode today!Although can someone explain to me again how do bullets even work in space? I understand that theres no beam weaponry in IBO but I still cant wrap my head around the idea that physical projectiles still fire fast in space.And finally this linegt Machines with that name have appeared many times in historical turning points and has been a great influence on the history of man.You have no idea how that line gave me so much goosebumps as I heard and read it. This is the thing Im always looking for in a Gundam series. A line that represents the main concept of what a Gundam is. And this line does that perfectly. That line right there is the PERFECT line to describe what a Gundam is all about. What the legacy of a Gundam is throughout the years.For me a Gundam isnt just a title for the main lead. It has a meaning throughout every series and what it represents. A Gundam is a name that will rise when a world has fallen into war and the world needs it. A name that will strike fear into the hearts of many as they see it or even just hear someone say Thats a Gundam!. The most recent moment I saw something like this was in GReco where one of the guys from Towasanga realized that the GSelf was like an ancient legend called a Gundam.Well done IBO.

Thats not something hardcoded into your genetics meaning somebody put that there intentionally because they wanted to fool people into thinking he was literally Char. Thats an extension of the surgery he was given to resemble Char. As for the soul? Again this has what to do with being a clone? They had the Psycoframe imprintthey couldve put it into anybody it doesnt matter whether the guy has Chars genetics or not.And you know how clones work right? You dont just pop out a fullgrown man. For Frontal to be a clone of Char he wouldve had to have been made literally before the OYW even started.This is what the Japanese Wikipedia article has to say on Frontal  tl his identity is an artificial newtype enhanced human intentionally created to resemble char by zeon remnantsIf he were a clone of Char then he would share the same genetics meaning he would be a natural Newtype and the CyberNewtype enhancement would be pointless. Plus his appearance would be the same so there would be no need to make him to resemble Char he just would by default. Zeon remnants took this guy and put him through hell thoroughly twisting his appearance and mind in order to make him into a second coming of Char to lead their cause. Mineva explicitly refers to it in the final episode. He is  not a clone of Char.,Gundam,cy5zzsg,4,t5_2sjr4

People latch on to the total pacifism thing because it was so explicit but that was an ideology Wing both introduced and discredited.Wing looks at the totality of the Gundam franchise as an antiwar series and is largely a commentary on those ideals. Its obsessed with two questions Can violence produce peace? Is true peace attainable and if so how?Numerous characters and situations provide multiple answers to these questions with the final answers only ever really being final because they come at the very end. Wing ends with the idea that maybe peace can be obtained by conning the population into uniting against a demonized foe and sealing with deal with a dose of mythic sacrifice. Then Endless Waltz comes along and says that maybe peace can be obtained only when human beingsall of ussimply refuse to allow others to fight on our behalf.,Gundam,czhfa5z,2,t5_2sjr4

6497785,0,t3_44jp17,Im really digging Mikazukis character development. He really does have a lot of love for Kudelia and Atra which is just growing more explicitly... healthy? As time goes on. From his dedication to Orga to kill a guy just because he said so to the notion of hugging someone when theyre sad... Even if its explicitly shown to himsaid to him thats what he should do in such situations I feel like hes becoming a lot more accessibly kind to the other characters. Its also interesting how theyre displaying Naze and Mikas little harem lol. Theres no other way to describe whats going on but its a rather kind and sweet and equal portrayal all around I feel. Ive read some comments about how terrible the whole Naze harem is but he and Mika treat their girls very well and they treat him just as well. Didnt really expect such sensitivity and thoughtfulness in these relationships but I guess thats what happens when Mari Okada writes. Shes honestly not that bad at writing romance IMO.

While machines like the Graze which is based off the Valkyrie frame Grimgerde are high performance and top of the line in terms of things like tech and mobility they simply dont have the sheer power that Gundam frames have in addition to their degree of motion and fine tuning.

Or like watching a movie all the way up to the end credits and then announcing to the cinema that youre not going to be watching the rest of it because it was awful as you foresaw.Dont get me wrong theres nothing wrong with dropping a show whenever you feel like it. Im sure someone with as refined a taste in anime as yours has much better things to do with the  minutes of their life they wouldnt be getting back otherwise but your announcing that youre dropping a show just sounds weak and spiteful to me kind of like when Jada Smith announcing that shed be boycotting the Oscars to which she wasnt even invited.,Gundam,d16r0ti,6,t5_2sjr4

But one of the things people complain about  long stretches of time without mobile suit action  is mainly because IBO takes its time to set up a game between Nobliss Teiwaz and Gyallarhorn with Kudelia in the middle so while Tekkadan itself just tries to get by events around them are rather impactful for their Earth Sphere.,Gundam,d1hfl9t,3,t5_2sjr4

7124538,0,t3_4d5n1w,My guess? MSG and Zeta are stylistically different stories. Zeta is clearly a story of a situation completely spiraling out of control around the protagonist and maybe Tomino felt that the need to present some kind of political moral neutrality was just not a part of that. Rational villains detract from the insanity so instead you crank the evil up to .I mean Kamille is constantly utterly surrounded by a chaos beyond reasoning and it pulls at him from every direction until hes destroyed. Its like literally everyone in that series is driven by some fucking mental complex to the point they cant see how batshit insane theyre being anymore.In the end I dont really know but thats how I see it.

Theres hardly any trust displayed for Athrun from Shinn he constantly disobeys Athruns orders complains about the ones he does follow and combined with Athruns constant reprimanding of Shinn Id say theres more animosity than trust. Thats nothing compared to his friendship and time spent with Rey who Shinn does trust implicitly. Athrun questioning the chairman that has put so much faith into Shinn who has constantly taken Shinns side and supported his point of view over Athruns combined with the fact that in Shinns mind his view is more right than Athruns because he defeated Freedom and Athrun was defeated by Freedom.It would make far less sense at that point for Shinn to point his sword at Rey.,Gundam,d1twxem,2,t5_2sjr4

A moment that does not get enough credit is in the first episode of Mobile Suit Gundam where Frau has to run through a field full of the bodies of her freshlykilled friends and family.

There was no inherent conflict of interest between the Federation and Zeon.  Zeon got along just fine for  years before starting its war with the Federation.  They werent faced with an existential threat where they were forced to attack the Federation or die.The only reason they attacked the Federation is because they wanted more power.Claiming something was inevitable means that it would happen no matter what.  This was not the case with the One Year War.  It happened because the Zabis wanted it to happen.  If the Zabis hadnt wanted it to happen it wouldnt have happened.It was in no way inevitable.,Gundam,d440ae0,7,t5_2sjr4

8221205,0,t3_4rydt4,gtQuess and Hathaway being the worst gundam characters Ive seen so far currently on Victory GundamYeah Ill give you that one.gtwhy Char gives the londo bell designs to make a stronger gundam for pretty much no real reason other than for a challengeChar had really nothing of value left in his life at that point. And while Amuro is his ultimate rival hes also likely the closest thing Char has to a real friend as well and fighting each other was probably the most truly intimate form of human contact that he knows. Giving Amuro the Nu Gundam wasnt just about measuring his dick it was about being able to properly communicate with the one person in the world who understands you.gthow stupid the newtype psychic powers got when they pushed back axisTheyd been established as getting pretty powerful back in Zeta even without the psychoframe. And while the psychoframe did end up getting ridiculous it fit with the theme of Amuro and the films ideology. Your mileage may vary.gtwhy zeon soldiers would give their life to help Amuro save earth when they joined Char knowing that he was dropping asteroids onto earthThis probably has more to do with them getting swept up in the whole Neo Neo Zeon hype not really considering the gravity of what they were actually about to do until it was about to happen.gtor not knowing why Amuro Bright and surprisingly Astonaige decided to rejoin the earth federation even though Zeta and ZZ gave these characters no reason to ever want to go backWell first off AEUG was part of the federation just a faction within it that opposed the Titans. They just happened to have some ex Zeons join them due to the coincidence in their positions. The AEUG ended up disbanding after the First Neo Zeon War but most of its members were absorbed back into regular EFF seeing as they never really properly left it. Youll notice that the AEUG still continue to use EFF styled outfits Bright himself doesnt even change his uniform at all and iconography.gtmy main biggest problem with this movie is that Char is now a villain for no real reason.Theres a reason and its actually pretty tragic.I think the biggest thing is that between Kamilles Fate the state of the Federation the crushing responsibility of his role as a political figure after Blexs death and losing faith in life and humanity in general Char just ended up losing all stability and falling into a horribly deep depression.While punishing humanity or forcing them to immigrate to space is the original reasoning he uses I feel that the true motivation for his actions is much more fatalistic. With nothing left to live or hope for he doesnt believe in the value of changing the world for the better anymore he just wants one more fight with Amuro. If his intentions really were truly important to him hed have not risked his entire plan in letting Amuro live while he was still in the RGZ and later on by not destroying the Nu Gundam when he had the chance. But rather instead of moving towards a specific goal the entirety of CCA is more of a suicide attempt on Chars part I also think that a lack of will to live and depression in general contributed to the curb stomping that Amuro gave him in the latter part of CCA. Not that Amuro would have lost but that Char wouldnt have been so reckless if he felt he had something to live for.Keep in mind the Char we see in CCA is definitely not of sound mind. Its questionable if he even properly had any plans for after Axis would have hit. I believe that he went into the Axis plan with the full intention of dying one way or another. What we see in CCA is an incredibly self destructive figure brought on from years of never really being able to connect with anyone despite being a fabled newtype. Its very likely that if he got the support he needed when he needed it or if things simply didnt turn out so rotten he could have gone on to do some really great things. With that mindset I think that one thing that I really like about CCA is that it ultimately does end up completing the set up of Char as an incredibly tragic figure and in a way that makes a lot more sense with the ending of Zeta than people might think when they initially criticize Chars big change over the years leading up to CCA.Id even go as far as to say that his transformation into who he was in CCA was essential in making him the memorable and meaningful character that he is. Its the payoff to the tragedy and pessimism that his character is built around and theres really no way someone like Char could have had a happy ending as he was. Its also what makes him one of my absolute favourite fictional characters.,Gundam,d557gmo,28,t5_2sjr4

8498572,0,t3_4w3odr,The After War timeline is basically a what if version of the Universal Century where the One Year War went fullon apocalyptic instead of both sides signing the Antarctic Treaty to limit the collateral damage.  The Zeonanalogue starts throwing colonies around en masse the Federationanalogue mass produces Gundams equipped with giant beam cannons as a counter and the fight continues until civilization collapses on Earth and people start building back up from citystates while the population in space is reduced to inhabiting a bare handful of intact colonies and are too busy trying to stay alive to worry about conquering Earth.So I dont think you could really call it a Turn A  GReco style same universe just way later but its definitely connected to the UC timeline in spirit moreso than other AU timelines.In other news its really weird seeing someone quoting me in other posts in this thread.

For me Unicorn was a fantastic conclusion to the UC story but stuff like F was a story that wasnt quite told the way creators and fans wanted so if the later UC stories that were written before Unicorn get revisited Id rather they just treat it as an alternate UC timeline where Unicorn didnt happen and tell the story the creators wanted to tell without the need of retcons that degrade both.,Gundam,d84fflm,3,t5_2sjr4

Goal is to drop a colony on Earth and use the Gundams in the confusion to take OVER the current Earths Government. Well the people who made the Gundam decide to do something else and sends all of them down solo without knowing each other. So the first couple episodes now is the different Gundam Pilot doing separate terrorist acts. They later all meet up and do a giant joint mission which ends up disastrous.

9364530,0,t3_58sgk1,Im pretty sure its implied both sides used nukes among other things in the first weeks of the war? The Antartic treaty was signed AFTER the first month of the war during which both sides lost nearly half of their population. While we remember the colony drop and the colony gassing incident from the Zeon side that doesnt even come close to killing off half of the federations citizens. According to the wiki the zeon forces used nukes during the battle of loum as well not sure if thats new.On the other hand we dont know much about the Zeonic casualties. However many soldiers they lost it can only be a fraction of the amount of people they have to have lost. My guess is that in desperation the federation used pretty much every kind of WMD in their arsenal just like zeon.So yeah Im pretty sure they did.

9697863,0,t1_da8gfek,Yeah thats exactly how I saw Char as well he got his badass credentials at a time nobody could really fight him fairly and he ended up kind of coasting off of that from there on out. I mean he gets props for not dying to Amuro but hes not alone in that distinction and in fact he kind of gets shown up by Ramba Ral and MQuve in terms of combat abilities they actually give Amuro really good fights without having any Newtype powers. Char kills less than a handful of other mobile suits all throughout MSG despite featuring in almost all of it save the Ramba Ral episodes spends most of Zeta getting his ass kicked or just holding his own he fights to a draw with Jerid Messa who had an inferior suit and had to try to kamikaze Haman and then as you said didnt even get a hit in on Amuro in CCA...but hes seen as the best mobile suit pilot by a lot of people for some reason. He lives off hype both in and out of universe and that hype is why I think he is the way he is in Origin.To cope with Origin people I have watched it with and I have deemed it all as Chars recollection and ideas of how things went. It makes some sense when one sees the insane stuff Chars doing and how it all is framed in a way to make him look good though of course it doesnt cover the parts hes not there for.

10001982,0,t1_dbb8myu,Youre right it is a waste of time. But not for the reason you believe. Its because you lack the inclination to consider another view point and apparently did not read my rather short post very well. I literally said that I agree Origin does not fit. But no lets just gloss over that to be a complete dick. But consider I know its probably really hard for you that Sunrise doesnt have a concept of Canon. You seemed to gloss over that point too for the sake of making a giant wall of text mostly containing words you put into my mouth not which I actually stated. So let me say it more clearly.Sunrise does not have an stated concept of canon for Gundam or any of their other properties. They never make any statements as to wether or not something is canon. And they freely produce content that contradicts the established universe and say its just as official as the original. So no for Gundam canon does not exist. You can have your own personal idea of what the canon is but there is no official canon issued by anyone with authority over the Gundam universe. Perhaps its actually better to say that the canon for Gundam is fluid rather than nonexistent. Since there is no official stated canon the writers are free to tweak the details for better or worse. With a rigid established canon retcons or other small tweaks can become awkward. Im not saying there shouldnt be an established canon. Theres merits to having one and merits to being free of one. But my entire point is that there isnt an official stated established canon that separates everything neatly. There has been no official word either way on the Origin about its canon status. Oh andgtOrigin is a different continuity so it is not canon. You do know the manga it was adapted from yes?Yes I do. Ive read the manga. However Ive also read the translated interviews from sunrise about the whole everything animated is Official thing in response to the question of what is canon in UC which is really all anyone has to go on as an official statement of what is canon. Again just for claritys sake I agree with you that Origin is contradictory with MSG. So please stop putting words in my mouth. Just because I pointed out you had no official statements from the creators backing up your statements doesnt mean I think youre wrong.,Gundam,dbbac6e,4,t5_2sjr4

10010931,0,t3_5iz9zy,So going by what happens with the AV system in this episode I gotta assume whatever system that was used during the Calamity War must have been much more advanced than what Mika and Akihiro are using. The Gundam pilots of that time must have fought without any limiters and done it without crippling themselves. Since you know the pilots losing major body functions every time they went out to hunt down a MA I dont think wouldve worked out very well. Somehow they must have been able to handle the intense feedback in a way Mika and Akihiro cant. I wonder if by the end of the series Mika will finally be able to do this. ,Gundam,dbcgbo3,2,t5_2sjr4

What I mean by full weeboo is that people will only watch shows like sword art online soul eater attack on titan and the other mainstream anime that usually has either action girls in skimpy outfits or both. Then theres the guys who think all anime is gay and for nerds. Im not personally a huge fan of newer anime and am hooked on Gundam from the nostalgia much like Im hooked on Cowboy Bebop outlaw star trigun and FMA. Although I can see why gundam died here in the west when I was a kid growing up I watched the original gundam but it was mainly gundam wing that had me hooked. I loved that show and while I couldnt comprehend the storylines at the moment it had action and the mechs were these badass huge things I had never seen before and I became obsessed. Then I began to build the model kits and had so much fun doing so and toys and kits were sold everywhere. But then came G Gundam. It was more kid friendly and while I did buy a few of the kits I stopped watching the series and moved on to other shows and eventually me and other people forgot about gundam especially since toonami stopped airing. I tried getting into anime but everything my friends would show me was trash and I saw some seed but decided to stop watching it. Then fast foward to  and I see season  for gundam  on YouTube  and I watched it then immediately got interested again found out it was still airing and got hooked and began to order high grades and now in  I no longer have to order or drive  hours to get a model kit because Barnes and noble stocks gunpla!TLDR I blame G Gundam,Gundam,dbok1po,1,t5_2sjr4

Currently I doubt that she still views Mika as a romantic interest anymore. She might still have some feelings...but I get the sense that she only had a crush on him because he brought to light so many of her personal flaws to her like no one else had such as her ignorance of the wider world and indecisiveness on achieving her ambitions and represented the opposite of them.

10480888,0,t1_dcuwzqs,I mean so is killing prisoners both from combat S first episode and civilians both old men in S. The argument of grounds for X X is a war crime is an extremely silly standard to be using for mecha shows. Would current governments view beam weaponry as unethical as mustard gas or hollow point bullets? Just like you cant use certain types of ammunition in combat if youre really trying to apply our current real life laws in this fictional far futuristic alternate universe why would something as destructive as beam weaponry ever be allowed? Like someone else posted in this thread trying to apply NuremburgGeneva laws to Gundam is dumb because we dont know if in that universe they were created and even if the were if they are still standing. Considering the abundance of child soldiers I imagine in their current real life state they are not intact. On top of that Iok Kujan pales in comparison to numerous villains of Gundams past who get nowhere near the vitriol The God Kujan does. Haman KarnChar AznableGihren ZabiAguille Delaz  Anavel Gato performed variations of a colony drop which kills millions of lives and has catastrophic economic and environmental ramifications in the world. Iok Kujan got some railguns not Iron Masks bugs not Fonse Kagaties mind mush Angel Halo not the Turn AsTurn Xs planeteating nanomachines some railguns and took shots at his enemies who happen to be friends of the protagonist. Calling out Iok Kujan for ignoring surrenders and ceasefires makes it sound like hes here in any legal or official capacity in the first place. He planted illegal weapons as the excuse to attack them. How shocking and evil and horrifying that he kept to his dastardly plan of manufacture excuse to fight Tekkadans sponsors.Majority of this Iok anger is purely because hes done everything hes done accidentally ruining the ambushgetting farming village annihilated or underhandedly frame Turbines for carrying illegal weapons as excuse to attack them without a lick of deceit competence or evilness. He is Gai Daigoji for the bad guys and its infuriating that Gai Daigoji is fucking things up for the good guys. Thats why hes actually a great character though. Usually the dumb bad guys are overconfident and are made fools of by the good guys or the deceitful bad guys have executed some intelligent dastardly plan that the heroes must work hard to overcome.

A bit surprised that only Lafter died... for now. Oh wait I actually made a comment about it in THIS very thread. The part of the comment section wherein I started it. The one where I was I was explaining why I expected that someone will die. You on the other hand cannot accept the reason why I saw it coming because you wanted a scene wherein Jasley will explain his evil plans to the audience before he does the deed which isnt even necessary for one to expect that someone will die.

10565366,0,t1_dd4m8dl,I love Lafter but I disagree.Lafters arc was cut short by the Turbines being dismantled  this itself might be because of how late into the season Naze and Amida were killed because I could easily see Lafter and Azee taking over in their stead but thats another discussion. Even thought everyone was shipping Akihiro and Lafter hard in a writing sense the relationship was barely there. There was no indepth look into how much Lafter liked Akihiro or even a glimpse of how he felt about her  the idea that Lafter was in love with him would have felt really forced had fans not decide any characters that smile at each other are to be destined to be together. If you throw out fan bias Lafter had little more than a crush on him and this is confirmed when she decides to not join Tekkedan.  Also Lafter and all of the Turbines were side characters until a few episodes ago.Think of it this way  if Lafter bought the bear and walked out of that store caught up with Azee and went about being a member of Teiwaz remember the Turbines were dissolved and the girls were put into different agencies what real significance would she hold? At best shed get the Kudelia treatment and get put on a bus until the mobile suits came back to Saisei for repair and who knows when that would happen as they were trying to lay low. Lafters arc was over as is Azees  ill be utterly surprised if she lives through next episode.

Using armor impervious to basically every non particle beam armanent. AWOTT Gundams are even deadlier as they are designed to handle numerous opponents at once like Zabanya which is practically a mobile flying artillery division.

The other Gundams are owned by their pilot descendants so they pretty had the right to do anything they want with it.Kaeru seemingly doesnt have any descendants and he was apparently the best of them by a mile in terms of respect and allure. There is even a legend about Kaerus soul being in there. Even if people dont believe that literally in the current age its not worth it.Bael as a weapon while presumably powerful as a single unit isnt absolute anyways since Gjallahorn easily produce mobile suits that are also powerful even if not as powerful as the Twin Reactors  Alaya Vijnana combo its stated in sidematerials that AV is needed to bring out the full power of the Twin Reactors like Mika did I suppose. So the way I see it they could modify it as they want just that they dont because of how revered and sacred it is seen in the legends.

10925855,0,t3_5w2av8,Ok you left out a Very Crucial Detail here.Which universe are they fighting in? If you answered Cosmic Era then Kira is literally Invincible regardless of what Mobile Suit hes in and he would easily beat Sestuna without a doubt. If you answered Anno Domini then Kira would have absolutely no Plot Armor and the fight would be far more fair ground. But Setsuna would beat the everloving shit out of Kira. If you answered Universal Century then the fight would be debatably even more fair since what little plot armor Setsuna may have had would be gone to but Setsuna would still beat the everloving shit out of Kira regardless of this.My reasons for this are as followsSetsuna was a Child Soldier at a very young age who has WAY more experience in War than Kira could ever hope to have in his entire life and willingly joined Celestial Being a PrivateArmed Organization. And unlike Kira Setsuna gives absolutely no fucks about putting a bullet in people if thats what it takes to stop them. Setsuna is also no stranger on how to carry out Strategic Operations considering hes carried out numerous operations given by VEDA before. Ontop of this getting the obvious one out of the way. Setsunas got dem Innovator Abilities and Insight while Kiras got didley dick. No Im not counting SEED Mode as an equal because it fucking isnt. You cannot compare Quantum Brainwaves to SuperEnhanced Concentration. Its like Apples and Oranges.Bottom Line here is thisRegardless of what opponent you put up against Kira except maybe Turn A Turn X Devil Gundam God Gundam and Master Gundam.. If they fight in the Cosmic Era as their Universe of Choice to be the battleground in Kira will win every single time. But the moment you take Kira out of the Cosmic Era his plot armor completely vanishes instantly and he is then  exposed and vulnerable. It has been shown what happens when you do this with Kira multiple times in a variety of different Gundam Games etc.... who do CrossoverStyled Stories.Dont believe me?

10966873,0,t3_5wlrbh,I too like the idea of frames it makes a lot more sense that UC does... Maybe have every faction have suits designed for certain environments which compliment them and have the reactors hard to make but not too hard so you can explain having the MC or smaller factions have their own special suits. But Im all for none curbstomp battles. Its been happening way too often in the last few series. gtterraformed moons of Jupiter Terraformed of Colonized? Ganymede or Callisto are the only two colonization would likely make sense doing but their rotation is so slow that maintaining the atmosphere would be tough. Unless you could speed it up but youd have to make Saturn more dense for that. Europa you could probably have underwater stations and have naval combat taking place.Personally no clue on Saturn though Ive just read a lot of Clarke. I love the idea of a pirate faction on Ceres for some reason. Maybe have them praying on trade between the Miners from the belts and patrolled zones near mars. gtgenetics and nanotechnology come into play especially with dealing with zero g situations or colonies far out that may have food water or other survival problems.Try not to make comic book super humans. If there bodies are genetically engineered they need to have some trade off. SEEDs coordinators are just better theme got stale real fast. gtwell defined idea of how a mobile suit works and is piloted.Piloting has been explained in UC its just very old and has never really been translated besides Anaheim Journalsgtthe overall theme is darkTry to avoid crapsacking the world then. Try to equally balance the dark with the light. MS  did it really well with the romance subplot. IBO hasnt been doing all that well of it it worked in Season  with the Kudelia stuff but since the beginning of Season  it died off fast. Everybodys just always unhappy and the world sucks if the battles werent interesting to watch then in would be a drag. But since youre doing this in writing you cant fall back on visuals or sound design. You have to have interesting stuff that the reader wants to get too so they slog through the combat and other boring stuff. As far as your worlds particles go you could go with a slight off shoot of Minovsky particles something like they absorb all sorts of waves off the electromagnetic spectrum to generate a charge. Which then engines strip them of the charge and release them again. Scientifically it would take years for them to generate enough but ehh. Using something like that as battles went on and more energy was expended communication would get harder and harder. So you could have prebattle talks between people but as it got on it got more and more chaotic. ,Gundam,deb5m2r,2,t5_2sjr4

11021408,0,t1_deh86tj,You are not understanding the difference between a psycommu and the psychoframe.  A psycommu system is there to allow a newtype pilot to control various equipment almost always funnels or bits.  Its function is to act as an amplifier and to project the Newtypes brainwaves into the receivers on those pieces of equipment.  A Psycoframe is the psycommu system built into the suit such that the mobile suit itself not just its equipment can receive Newtype input.  They are related tech but they are not the same thing.  A psycoframe is not just a psycommu for a smaller suit.  Im not sure where youve gotten that idea but its flat wrong.  And again Im not interested in what the videogame says in a conversation about which tech is canon.  There is nothing in the canon to suggest that the F has a Psycoframe.  The old rule of thumb that if it isnt animated it isnt canon rules it right out.  There is nothing in the movie that suggests or even hints at the F having a psycoframe.  Even if we extend it to the manga I havent encountered anything there that suggests it has a psycoframe.  I havent seen it in any officially licensed product at all except for apparently this one videogame.  There is no source for it as far as I can tell except for the makers of the videogame wanting to include it in the F and not really caring that its erroneous.  ,Gundam,deh8vkq,1,t5_2sjr4

11169841,0,t3_5zgo0l,Favorite . It just holds a certain appeal to me. I really liked classic Star Trek as a kid along with the animated series. When I watch  it just triggers something nostalgic in me from the animation not being the greatest to how it seemed ahead of its time in some ways but a product of its time in others. While I do believe there are shows that are better on a technical level I really like Picard despite being a Kirkfanboy theres just nothing that will stick with me as much as the original series.Also its so very very quotable.Least Favorite WingI could put Blank here but that would mean acknowledging its existence.  I prefer to think of it as canon only to the special edition and HD Remaster not the original broadcast version. After all they did have to later retcon a few things in order for Blank to happen so Ill take my excuse to say alternate timeline thank you very much. SEED ended the Cosmic era as far as Im concerned...Okay jokes aside heres how it goes. As much as I could go after it that shall not be named a lot of my feelings towards it are because of what it does to the cast that returns from SEED. You like to think they are smarter than Blank presents them as to the point the show feels like its using bastardized versions of them. Some of the problems with the show come from being connected with another and Im going to admit I look back on SEED far more fondly after watching Blank.With Wing though my problems with it are all its own. I like the music by TwoMix and while I question the super robotlike nature of the Gundams designs I do think they look cool especially Heavyarms EW Custom. One other thing was the OZ uniforms strangely enough along with Treize and Duo. Those are the things I like.Other than that I really have nothing for this show. It just never really worked for me. Its hard to put into words but it never felt well puttogether to me more like it was a bunch of things haphazardly stapled together. It definitely felt more style over substance.Also way to blueball me. Follow through with your promise and kill Releena already Heero.,Gundam,dey38no,2,t5_2sjr4

11200778,0,t1_df1h0qw,   Look man I support gender equality and variety in fiction as much as anyone but Sexual Dimorphism is a thing. Men are absolutely stronger than women both in terms of physical output and durability. In fact almost all men are stronger than almost all women   Now how much does it matter when it comes to piloting a Mobile Suit? I dont know and Im content to say that all of it is fiction so it doesnt really bother me.  As for the larger issue of female action heroes Im all for it but it pulls me out of the immersion a little bit to see a lb woman slug it out with a lb man and win. Unless theres superpowers or a huge difference in skill that would never happen. Moreover I think its a little unsafe to portray that without anything to balance it out. I remember one time I was paired with a womanwho was very fit think Zumba Pilates etcin a selfdefense class. She was shocked at how easily I wiped the floor with her despite both of us having no prior experience. Im only lbs and the difference in strength between her and me was overwhelming.  So in conclusion saying women are just as strong as men is false detracts from your overall message and isIMO unnecessary as justification for their inclusion in fiction.,Gundam,df1legw,1,t5_2sjr4

11438192,0,t1_dfrv9hv,I was referring to their impact on Rustal and other key members of Gjallarhorn. Someone on another thread summed it up quite nicely like this Peace or justice? In the wake of the Calamity War Gjallarhorns system created peace in some measure but simultaneously allowed for children like Mika or McGillis to be stepped on and taken advantage of. So when a whole organization of these children begin to pose a threat to Arianrhod as soon as Rustal considers them threatening enough to factor into his calculations you can argue that they have made their impact on him. If you go further and take this path to its logical conclusion the implied incentive that compelled Rustal to democratize the Earth Sphere and grant autonomyindependence to Mars is so that this factor is taken out of the equation entirely i.e. no more human debris or child soldiers. Id say this qualifies as a discernible reason.Also I read your review on MAL. You need to stop treating your opinions as facts regarding this show. Youre free dislike whatever you want but bashing IBO in the guise of criticism is kinda bullshit.

11524601,0,t1_dg1skrm,Ein wasnt a terrible pilot so much as he was aboveaverage when almost everyone he went up against had a tendency to be a goddamn genius Shino being the exception. That and a tendency to try and save Gaelio over and over from certain death with his body. The AV did boos his reaction times to an absurd degree but its telling that said melee combat style was something that Mika remembered when he was attacked by Vidar.Gaelio was an OK pilot in S to the point he was capable of holding back Mika until Montag intervened but otherwise he wasnt anything special. Season two shows his piloting style has drastically improved... until he runs into Mika again after which he pretty much goes fuck it and wisely lets Type  E take the reins the moment he realizes that he cant deal with Lupus Rex by himself The thing is absurdly fast and strong in addition to having the PD equivalent of a bitincom? whereas the only reason Vidar is so fast is because it has literally metal plates with excess metal cut out of it for armor which is useless against Rex and Vidar already took a shot to the chin from the tail.,Gundam,dg2bdck,2,t5_2sjr4

I can kinda see where youre going with this but IMO saying it looks bad is a bit of a stretch. Bandai also screwed up  one of the  super badly Gusion and produced one for a fairly unpopular kit so its not surprising they would decide to focus on a smaller number of kits and kept them for the more iconic suits. Dont ask about Vidar I dont think will ever get an answer as to why bandai hyped that up in the first place.

11642193,0,t3_65u9cw,I didnt like the ending because this ending should have happen at the end of season  not season .Season  was grim and everybody was waiting for a bad ending yet none happened. IMO it was a bad decision to have IBO getting a second season.Season  in my opinion was full of hope. Way too much hope to let it go on the bad ending route. It really left a very bad taste in my mouth especially because a plot device the Dainsleifs was used to kill off most of the main protagonists. Thats a very lazy way of killing them because that basically means you made your own protagonists way too overpowered for their own good and you dont know how to make them lose without a plotdevice weapon.A plotdevice weapon which was itself introduced by another plotdevice weapon Hashmal. When Hashmal appeared they should have gone with the full MA route instead of.. what we got. What we got was basically building hype for.. nothing.To be honest Ive seen some people compare IBOs ending to EoE and boy are they wrong. EoEs ending is actually one full of hope when IBOs one is basically not. IBO is just saying that the guy who was sold to the viewers as the main antagonist of season  wasnt an antagonist at all and did reform Gjallarhorn to make it good when he was using everything that was wrong with Gjallarhorn for his own plans. Thats just so.. wrong. I mean dont get me wrong. I know IBOs universe is grim. But damn dont make it even more grim and sell that as an ending to your viewers expecting them to be satisfied with that. Hell no.To summarize my opinion IBO  was great and should have ended with a bad ending. IBO  was too much full of hope to finish with an ending that is so.. off and forced.,Gundam,dgfnms9,3,t5_2sjr4

11706167,0,t3_66yvlg,MAs were widely frowned upon though. They were also indiscriminate and autonomous leaving neither side with a way to control one.Using Dainslief was stupid in the first place. Just because the other side used a banned weapon doesnt take the weapon off the ban list. You dont see anyone gassing the Syrians except Syrians. Rustal should never have used it. It would drive home the point that Iok is all the more stupid.Of course in Gundam its magically acceptable because the plot must go forward and because Gjallarhorn had the biggest say but if thats the case why did they need an excuse to start using Dainslief anyway? Nobody was going to call them out on it if they just outright started using Dainslief. There wasnt even anyone with matching might to go up against Gjallarhorn anyone crying foul would just only go that far.I think the worst part was Gjallerhorn didnt even need to use a Dainslief. Just plant one on Tekkadan like Iok did except wrongfully frame Flauros for using it and McGillis for delivering it. Then intergalactic opinion would be automatically against Tekkadan. Barbatos was going to lose anyway from sheer numbers but the lack of Dainslief could have set the stage for Julieta to have a good battle. Using this plan Rustal didnt even need to have one of his own ships be shot by one of his own guys and then have that guy kill himself how much was he paying that guy anyway?. Rustal would have won everything without getting his hands openly dirty like he did which was a political risk that worked out by luck of nobody actually caring about Dainslief but realistically wouldnt have been worth it.They really only need them twice. Once when Iok did what he did to show everyone he is retarded and then a single one smuggled into Tekkadan again to frame them we already know they never check their cargo they unknowingly smuggled weapons for the workers earlier and didnt learn from that to check cargo for Ioks Dainsleif. The plot was needlessly contorted to involve more Dainslief than necessary just to make Rustal look more bad for a grey ending. ,Gundam,dgmx4k2,8,t5_2sjr4
