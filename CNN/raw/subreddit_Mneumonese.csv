3002232,0,t1_co8s13c,It is worth emphasizing for any of this to make sense that a logic can have some true inconsistencies and still be nontrivial i.e. not prove everything if it is weaker i.e. proves less from the same information than classical logic. That is it can make sense. This also isnt to say that contradictions should be true in most cases such as with social interactions or politics.gt Its still possible to say them though in language capable of mathematical rigor such as Mneumonese.That doesnt mean they carry the same weight particularly in a language with paraconsistent semantics taking the inconsistent option of inconsistent or incomplete at the end of Gdels proofs.Now going backgt In a mathematics paper it means a proof exists within the established framework and in discussions about nonabstract matters it means a proof exists within an abstract framework imposed upon the nonabstract reality this framework being agreed upon by all speakers present.The issue here is that the speakers had to have come to agree on the framework somehow modern logic was first formalized as an attempt to make clear the unclear details of reasoning that were causing issues in analysis after which the paradoxes were discovered and not the other way around. Formal logic is supposed to just be a clearer version of natural intelligent reasoning at least in my view. To that extent it should be able to talk about itself without becoming hopelessly confused.gt Note that fact runs into an issue for Gdelian statements which may be true within a framework but for which no proof exists.Which is precisely why I chose an inconsistent model rather than an incomplete one.gt But as for the truth value who cares is my stance its too confusing and obscure to be much of a problem.Im not particularly concerned about classical truth values but I would say that this really isnt that obscure so much as philosophically unpopular. Examining these things has the potential to make a number of aspects of logic clearer but contradiction is still regularly used as the very definition of falsehood.As for confusingI cant really argue with that.,Mneumonese,co96gp9,1,t5_35q9i

7825833,0,t3_4kcobf,Ive been looking for a language that tries to code emotions like this. I was looking into maybe using the four elements water fire earth air as the basis for it but this is a neat idea. ,Mneumonese,d3vourf,3,t5_35q9i
