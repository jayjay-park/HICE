17757,0,t1_cegcyqg,Thanks for the feedback.  Is there any reason in particular you feel the ideas wouldnt work?As for Honor keep in mind theres a secondary thread attached to this one that details the process of fixing Honor.  Lets be real Honor in its current state is beyond worthless. P,summoners,cegge28,1,t5_2wenn
42323,0,t3_1uldkd,My apologies for calling this guy out but misinformation really irritates me.  Look for more of my opinionated blog posts in the future as I have decided rather than trying to correct misinformation in comment strings I will just go ahead and publish my opinion when it makes sense.,summoners,cej8zoz,1,t5_2wenn

55087,0,t1_cekp498,Exactly. If Im supposed to be beating platinum lvl teams and Im in Silver why am I not being promoted to Platinum?Why do I then have to go through  more Silver divisions to prove Im Gold material if Im already beating platinums?,summoners,cekp9fg,6,t5_2wenn
84402,0,t1_ceo01cd,Yeah there are a bunch of inconsistencies.  You will see a bunch of champion a counters champion b who counters champion a.  I actually dont know how the system should be done with less relevant bronze old patch votes always taking a majority of the vote.,summoners,ceo1dma,1,t5_2wenn
87135,0,t1_ceo01cd,That there arent the same sort of hard counters in League as in DotA that the counters to certain ults or champions lie in items a lot and that there is no credential check on the contributors. ,summoners,ceocl4n,2,t5_2wenn
146316,0,t1_cev3cgn,Actually from what I remember he was mostly the follow up to Meteos initiate or Lemonnations picks but thats beside the point. He was a big factor in the wins but C being better than the rest of the teams influenced his winrate more than the champion being stronger or weaker than other champions. They got it done on other champs as well they just preferred Ashe most of the time.,summoners,cev3hbv,3,t5_2wenn

507840,0,t1_cfxpr0o,The lee sin bully build is not played as a tank it is played as an ad burst caster that buys tank items later if he gets behind or has to be the primary initiator.,summoners,cfxzsyg,2,t5_2wenn

830933,0,t1_cgypy5z,This is why Im curious what OMG will bring to the table. The Chinese always seem distant but they never are slouches at international tournaments. Im hoping for a big curveball from OMG... dare I even say metachanging.,summoners,cgyq93w,2,t5_2wenn

1012960,0,t3_25p7v2,Love the idea for it but KiWiKiDs reasoning reads Clearly one of the top  supports in North America as CLG rises look for Aphromoos value to increase.,summoners,chjfihf,7,t5_2wenn
