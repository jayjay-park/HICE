747273,0,t1_cgp56ci,First you post this here and ask for comments and now you complain about peoples reactions? You clearly expected high praise but got valid criticism instead.To the second part I am a professional software developer so I know about coding passion and failed projects. However honestly it doesnt seem like you know much about coding. You talk about it like it is the easy last stage where you just need to learn a bit more C to get going. That is the easy part. The hard part is understanding algoritms design patterns code optimization and a bunch of mathematics if you want to build your own big scale game from scratch in your own game engine. And time to get the experience to make increasingly bigger software projects.People here are not harsh against you they are realistic. Many of us has probably seen the same multiple times before. Where someone has a bunch of ideas for a game and just need to code it. The reality of game development is that ideas can be made in  minutes but takes a team of experinced game developers months or years to implement.,4Xgaming,cgp7z8k,2,t5_2sf8w

From what Ive heard UPT basically makes it impossible for the AI to be anything more than not outright shit both here and in Civ.

In terms of design and atmosphere its imho still the very best x game ever made. The factions all have a real difference in feel and gameplay the tech tree is awesome etc.The pack contains both the base game and the expansion. I recommend playing without the expansion first as while it adds a lot of neat stuff for experienced players it makes the game feel more cluttered and hard to get for first time players.

Ill be honest I backed Kinetic Void and Spacebase D and those were failures but whatever man I still support the concept.

3457768,0,t1_cplrdgg,gt what about all the stories of the abandoned support for the first Stardrive? Should that be a major concern.Well the dev has admitted its a broken game that he will never support yet continues to sell it full price while being sure to scrub the forums clean especially before sales days. Beyond this he hasnt even given the code over to modders who actually are trying to make it a stable game still.So while the dev and cwilsons here the only guy posting Stardrive stuff in this sub insist Dicicco has learned his lesson an actual apology would be an admission of guilt his actions so far paint a different picture.Maybe it will be a good game. Who knows? Unity will certainly play ball with most systems right out of the gate for most things. That hardly means anything though in the grand scheme of how does a game perform. Besides turn based strategy game tend to run on a different basis than your average game. D graphical power mean almost nothing. Its all about database transactions something I doubt unity is optimized for. Beyond this it usually balloons in size as the game goes on over a period of hours. This makes practical testing hard.A FPSopen world with horrendous popin and frame drops is considered unfit for purpose while civ was praised despite have the same problems with even less of an excuse graphical power limit wise.The criteria by which X games are judged are different.  UI needs to be good have good mechanics and it needs to be stable late game at least on a nice machine.Being stable late game is the tallest order and it will be hard to test until the game comes out and he gets guinea pigs. All we know is that if it did turn out to be a mess everyone who bought had better hope it takes him less than  months to sort it out or its Stardrive  time again.So to those who buy I hope it works out for you but I will totally be here to laugh and point if it doesnt.

You can customize this as you see fit.The game also has a mixture of space and ground combat. Its not enough just to blow up a fleet. You have to win on the ground as well. A strong army on the ground can hold a planet no matter how big the hostile fleet in orbit is.DWU is a real time game but its a very slow pace.

How long will it take them to get it right? Their games usually need time to mature as the community plays them. If this is as deep of a game as it seems it may be a long time after the initial release before it truly shines. I generally dont buy Paradox games until theyve been out quite a while anyway but there is always a chance it could be perpetually unbalanced or too complicated to allow a pleasurable experience. but if I can handle Distant Worlds I suppose I can handle anything lol Lots more to wonder about... It looks amazing from the screenshots but will the UI be any good? Have they learned lessons from their other four titles as well as the modding community?Ugh. What an awful wait this is going to be.

Ive always really enjoyed turn based but I have recently been playing a lot of Paradox games and the realtime is really growing on me so Im going to say realtime with variable speed and pause options..

5897594,0,t3_3w25bh,This post is semirelated to your issue but I want to expand a little how nontraditional X games or rather a very specific one handles that issueMan the midgame in AI War Fleet Command is so interesting. I cant imagine stopping there.Basically in the early game you are mostly scouting and identifying targets of interest plotting routes how to get there best and do early territory grab since its necessary to build your military and extend your abilities to attack heavier defended targets. But in the midgame you are trying desperately to attack and hold those targets of interest with various possible strategies and tactics like doing beachheads to hack those targets to not keeping them on hold all of the time or doing specialized raids to destroy specific targets on those planets to lessen the defense. Or if you feel secure enough that your fleet is up to the task you go fullon frontal assault with high changes of losing your whole fleet and getting huge retaliation waves from the enemy. And you do this simultaneously while defending from the AIs waves trying to breach your defenses. And while you extend your territory its getting harder and harder to defend everything properly. Especially since the AI is not dumb keeping fleets in their back hand to attack you specifically when you are at your weakest point. Like having an energy brownout will just disable all of your defenses and from there the enemy has a high chance to steamroll directly to your home planet and destroy your base which leads to your loss. So its a very difficult and delicate dance on the knifes edge. And the issue is you need to takedestroy those targets you need to take planets to increase your fleet size with science you need everything you do and by doing that you spread out more and more. And the AI progress increases further and further by doing that pulling more and more aggro of the AI. And maybe your fleet is just doing a big frontal assault on the enemy while they just backdoor you at the worst time possible with you losing the whole game.Its such a huge and interesting undertaking man I really loathe that the game has a learning curve that is basically a wall in the first  hours and continues at at  slope afterwards for the next  hours or so making the game unattractive for most people. I personally have no issues with that neither do I have issues with the graphics which are subpar the gameplay makes it up for that a thousand times.,4Xgaming,cxspidg,13,t5_2sf8w

6045547,0,t1_cyc18gp,Theres a few ways to get out of this situation.  There are some very rare asteroids that have a t resource you can mine for this costs no upkeep and is the most advantageous option.  Sometimes scanning anomalies will give you one of these.  You can also use a genesis device to change any planets resource to a random t resource or you can invest quite a lot of energy into upgrading a protoplanet to have a t resource though sometimes its something nonexportable like tropical paradise or ancient city. Finally and probably most obviously you can go to war and conquer one.

6286107,0,t1_cz0d9jz,Thats one of the things that was fixed by MoO.  In MoO you could literally build a huge fleet of the tiniest ships with the highest level of  shot rockets you could put on them usually  levels behind your best and the game would rather than calcuating it as  hits that each did  damage meaning armor that deflects  damage should have shrugged it off it instead did one hit that was  damage which would slag whatever the fuck it hit.Fire twice idle for a moment to let them all hit flee immediately attack again repeat.  MoO you could still build huge fleets of tiny ships with missiles but each shot was calculated independently.

6880146,0,t1_d0w4dcm,gt My point is that I actually enjoy this and Im sure I cant be the only one.I totally agree that the sense of progression and building up to more varied options and important decisions is essential to a good X.  Im just not convinced that increasing the number of decisions and micro per turn and is the best way to do that.gt What Id love to see is large empires fracturing into factions and declaring civil war on each other... I also think there needs to be some way to come back from the ashesFunny you should say that.  We actually have schisms coups civil wars rebellions rogue AIs and plagues.  All of those things can lead to the formation of new factions or the dissolution of existing ones.That would normally cause an issue since having factions in wildly different levels of prosperity would make the game easier for some factions to win.  However we use a point based mechanic that measures influence.  A faction coming back from the brink can be just as influential as one currently in power so the game remains balanced even if the factions differ wildly.The really exciting part is that this plays really well with our legacy mechanic which lets you continue playing in the same world as the descendants of one of the civilizations in your previous game.gtThats great. Although Id also love to see actual mechanics differences between races either innate or evolved through a particular event. For example in a space x a species could only exist on water worlds etc.So the reason most games dont introduce new mechanics for each race is because adding mechanics makes the game hard to balance and adds to development cost.  We use a perk based system that makes it really easy to have factions evolve over the course of play.  Our perks vary not only what bonuses you get but also what types of options are available to you.  For example if your society has the abolitionist perk you are not able to take slaves.  This means that the strategies available to you change by faction and by game.Note You can actually do things in game to change the perks your faction has.  So it is possible to start off as warlords and end as peaceful bureaucrats.,4Xgaming,d0w6gxx,2,t5_2sf8w

Then there is the ocean currents commonly used lanes in sea and that isnt even getting into sea battles close to landislands. A map without star lanes removes the strategic depth I should say. Its like going from chess to checkers. An open map simplifies the game when everything is open you get a horde mentality as the best strategy. Invade mindlessly go on the offensive or youll get invaded without any possible recourse.Star lanes when done right combined with nebulae storm clouds wormholes ect create the perfect balance between defensive and offensive strategies. They also create contested chokepoints which become valuable objectives even without high value stars being situated there.Empire planning in itself becomes more akin to playing Go than Checkers. Do you extend for that large Terran world opening yourself up from potential attack on  sides? Or do you go for the Medium Tundra world as your border giving yourself a defensible position with  lane?,4Xgaming,d1cih96,3,t5_2sf8w

7686982,0,t3_4jar5h,Its serviceable. Game is still blackwhite about diplomacy if you have good traits for it most of the AI empires will bend over backwards to give you whatever you want within reason if you dont in the early game you are going to have a lot of wars. Carriers are still the best ships to use because they completely cheese the fleet strength stat making the AI think that your carrier fleet is much weaker than their doomstacks when in reality its x as powerful so they run right into the fleetwiping machines youve sent into their territory. The game crashes frequently in the late game due to lag caused by a lot of inefficient things the AI does with its fleets. Information Warfare is still an absurdly powerful warfare type which you can trade for or research for as Humans which isnt hard to do if you have good diplomatic traits. Finally there is no way to truly automate station building which can be hell. Aside from that certain map types break the game because you can get starts alone in a cluster map with dozens of good worlds becoming the most powerful empire in the game very quickly.,4Xgaming,d3fymua,1,t5_2sf8w

If they have the ability to produce more A maybe they have to but that could drain other things they need to make B or C.

A lot of games try to be gamey and be simmy to pander to all audiences. Or games where you have indepth tactical battles and indepth economy. It cant work.If you have to have a game where a player can win through micro managing every battle and paying little attention to the production and a game where you can optimize production and auto resolve battles you get a game thats far too easy for either group. And god forbid someone is good at managing both. The game lacks challenge as well as focus.Similarly simulation vs game has the same issue. If you have to be able to focus on simplistic abstract stuff and still do good vs focusing on microing everything and doing good either the game is too easy or each aspect has little effect on the results.,4Xgaming,d830mb6,1,t5_2sf8w

9969519,0,t1_db20muf,The whole most complex ever thing seems to come up with Distant Worlds seems to come up a lot. I bought it recently and I must say I dont see it. I dont mean this in a negative way Im enjoying the game so far.Its not simple but its not much of a step above the standard fare. The systems are all pretty strictly classical and familiar to anybody with much x exposure particularly spacebased.Theres not really anything that crazy there. Many of the systems are relatively anemic compared to some of the more innovative counterparts that have shown up in other games. The main thing that gets so indepth is the fact you can design basically everything in space  but thats more of a breadth thing rather than a depth thing. Colony development is practically nonexistent being somewhat subsumed by moving that into the ship design area via bases. Even the ship design is pretty barebones in terms of mechanics as its just a list of components.I think the perception mostly comes down to a lack of good ingame explanation and actually the automation system itself. I started with the idea of using the automation to slowly ease myself in and it resulted in me feeling very out of my depth. After that I tried going full manual and it all came together.The automation basically lets you think its a good idea to jump in the pool without even turning any lights on first. Who knows what else in there. Then you just kind of sit and flounder with whatever is right in front of you while worrying about all the things you cant see.If you go full manual and grab a tutorial like this one youll quickly see it isnt really unfamiliar territory.

11175742,0,t3_5zjrti,Dear mister Anward I would like to ask some questions..   What fictional works did you take the most inspiration from when creating Stellaris? I Swear the soundtrack sounds inspired from Mass Effect . But all my friends think im crazy..   Do you ever plan on adding more Guardians and or crises to the Game? Those are my favorite parts.RegardsP.S. Loved your Hohenzollern megacampaign.,4Xgaming,deyraju,33,t5_2sf8w

11477445,0,t3_63u3ou,This week Ive made a lot of progress on my potential X game. As of today this post represents about  month of work on just the visualization aspect of the procedural galaxy generator. The topic I will be talking about is Star Lanes and other forms of interstellar travel.TechnicalIll get the technical implementation aspects out of the way first. Star lanes are generated using a combination of Delaunay Triangulation and Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms plus a touch of fudging massaging and hacking here and there to achieve the result I wanted.AestheticsUsabilityStar lanes makes the galaxy map look fucking cool. In addition to this it also makes the galactic map significantly easier to navigate in D. The visual aids I included previously grid amp crosshair star stalks etc... help the player a lot in terms of orienting the camera in D space but humans are still really bad at navigating through arbritary point clouds. The inclusion of lanes emphasizes the shape and structure of the galaxy which makes it easier for the player to memorize and tell where they are at a glance.GameplayYou may have already noticed that the lanes themselves dont span every single star in the galaxy. There are several reasons for this . Aesthetics amp usability too many connections actually dilute the striking shape of the galaxy and adds clutter that makes the map harder to effectively navigate.. In the games universe star lanes only exist between stars which exceed a certain massdensity possibly something to do with the interactions between the stellar gravity wells. Perhaps I will call them gravity lanes which require gravity drives to be researched.. Freedom of movement. While I agree that star lanes add options for strategic gameplay allowing defensive choke points strategically significant star sytems etc... I feel they also limit the gameplay to that particular aspect. In this universe lanes serve as shortcuts to star systems a high speed interstellar highway if you will. You can still travel to neighbouring stars using conventional drives but this method will be much slower and less fuel efficient compared to using the lanes. Star lanes allow you to zip around the galaxy quickly but you will still need conventional travel to reach star systems not connected to the network.. With lanes linked to high massdensity stars players will eventually be able to build and destroy star lanes by adding and removing mass from stars by researching later game technology. A bit like building and destroying bridges on land.. In each generated galaxy there may also be rare single lane connections between  stars separated by huge distances. These are like the wormholes in Stars! or like the Bajoran wormhole from DS. These could be either temporary or permanent and allows travelling from one end of the galaxy to the other in extremely fast time. Space is big and conventional engines are slow and costly so controlling important systems that contain wormholes and star lanes will be of the utmost importance.. Combine star lanes and wormholes with nebulas which I discussed in a previous post provides an emergent space geographical terrain that exhibits peaks and troughs of strategic importance.BonusEven more images of interesting looking galaxies after star lane generation Previous PostsPart I Spiral Galaxies Part II Nebulas amp D Navigation Aids Part III Black Holes amp System Names ,4Xgaming,dfwyq8x,10,t5_2sf8w
