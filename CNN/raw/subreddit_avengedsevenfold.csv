I dont like the autotune but in my mind the solo at the end makes up for it several times over. I also really like the angsty rebelliousness of Critical Acclaim.

However in the interview about this Shadows didnt say that the hope was to integrate more WtF songs into the set he actually said that it didnt respark any desires to play more from the album. He said that the energy goes way down when they play those songs because people dont know them as popularly as other albums songs. That could be an implied nod towards wanting to play more WtF but if Im not mistaken he didnt say anything directly about playing more stuff. ,avengedsevenfold,cizjeyi,1,t5_2shpy

1755546,0,t3_2e0saa,In no particular order. Warmness on the Soul. IWSYT. Chapter Four. Desecrate Through Reverence. Strength of the World. Sidewinder. Almost Easy. Unbound The Wild Ride. Tonight the World Dies. Victim. Fiction. Natural Born Killer. Coming Home. Second Heartbeat. Crossroads. Unholy Confessions It would be so cool to see Natural Born Killer live really like the change in pace after the intro and its got a killer solo and to make it even better they have never played it live. IWSYT would also been so epic live with the climax in the ending and the really high vocals. There s actually a lot of songs that id really like to see live that they have yet to play livewhat i know of like Crossroads Coming Home Victim Tonight the World Dies Unbound Sidewinder and Warmness of the Soul.So damn hard to pick a playlist of  songs lt I kinda want to pick some of the typical ones like Bat Country Afterlife Nightmare ALPoH Critical Acclaim amp Beast and the Harlot. But Im that kinda guy who really wants to hear the not so commonly played songs at concerts. Considering if you have seen them before youll most likely have heard all the commonly played songs once or twice already. HOWEVER Unholy Confessions is just too good of a song not to finnish the set with.,avengedsevenfold,ck0g084,2,t5_2shpy
1799209,0,t3_2f4bhh,They have a couple good songs IMO but they arent complete as a band in my opinion. Avenged is the complete package and their live show is InFUCKINGCredible. I dont hate BVB but they are no avenged,avengedsevenfold,ck5xzl9,4,t5_2shpy

1994570,0,t3_2hk49t,Just like Avenged I see Slipknot as going through a process of rediscovering their core following the  loss of an essential member and songwriter. Im a huge fan of Corey Taylors work and tend to be biased I see both the beauty and flaws in each album and what the two new singles give off is raw cathardic emotion and I think its the tip of the iceberg. Just like with any band in transition  theres gonna be fans who arent happy with the direction the guys might take but Ive come to learn via some of my other favorite bands that patience and faith in their work pays off. At the end of the day  its about what you get from the music personally. What I always expect from Slipknot above all are Coreys idiosyncractic lyrics and riffs sharp enough to cut and over the course of the last two albums  the haunting melodies. Slipknot have a musical core that theyve never abandoned but simply morphed with the times and this new album is basically them starting from square   but with  years experience behind them.,avengedsevenfold,cktjo84,2,t5_2shpy

Full of angst. Their lifestyles were undoubtedly completely different back then even chaotic. Listen to Bat Country if you need a refresher.

As planets collide this new song has NOTHING about gods the mention of Jesus Christ was to say that we as Man are so full of ourselves that we put one of our own a above everything else. Also to connect in to those songs would be going back to the past Matt has said a million times they only move forward with their work so they would not revisit old songs. As far as a concept record if you listen to the spoken lines in The Stage if this was not a concept record they would be out of place and make absolutely no sense for a standalone song.

10820203,0,t1_ddvwc7s,Id start with Good Apollo Volume .  It was the gateway album for me and has a lot of their most accessible songs like Welcome Home The Suffering Wake Up Ten Speed Apollo The Writing Writer.  And the last four songs are the Willing Well suite a half hour prog feast.The thing with Coheed is that they are so ridiculously catchy but not at first listen because theres always so many different melody lines going at once in their songs.  Welcome Home is kind of an oddball song for them in that a couple riffs carry the whole song instead of about five different interwoven guitarbassvocal melodies.,avengedsevenfold,ddw105g,3,t5_2shpy

11035599,0,t3_5xho82,Id have to say the order I like their albums in right now would be. City of Evil Its the album that really got me into Avenged and the song that really got me into them was Bat Country. I went onto YouTube and looked up Avenged and saw the LBC video for Bat Country and heard Matts scream right at the beginning and was immediately hooked.. The Stage I honestly didnt like this album very much the very first time I heard it. I was just in shock of how different it was from everything else they had done. Now I cant stop listening to it haha. . Waking the Fallen This and The Stage are pretty close for me. I guess it depends what kind of mood Im in that day because I switch those two in my order every day. Chapter Four and Remenissions are probably my all time favorite Avenged songs. . Nightmare There is a big drop off for me after the first three albums but Nightmare is still pretty solid. I thought this album was their best right when it came out but it has really fallen off for me over the years.. Sounding the Seventh Trumpet I didnt really get into this album right away after I discovered Avenged but I think its a cool record now. The big downfall for it would be the sound quality for the vocals. It is really freaking hard to make out what Matt is screaming for most of the record. The drums on this record are out of this world for sure though. I have been listening to this album a lot recently. Hopefully they will dust off a couple songs off of this album at some point besides To End the Rapture but I highly doubt they will haha.. Hail to the King Not a bad record but not their best either. The songs are all pretty catchy but the songs dont really have much to offer after the first few listens. The songs are so stripped down that you arent discovering anything new after the first few listens. The highlight for this record would be Matts vocals are really strong. The biggest negative would be they are way too heavily influenced by other bands on this record. Definitely their least creative album to date in my opinion.. Avenged Sevenfold I used to love this album but now I hardly ever find myself listening anything besides a couple songs on this record. I cant really come up with a good reason as to why I dont enjoy the songs as much but based on how little I listen to this album compared to their others I have to rank it last on my list. ,avengedsevenfold,deiv67l,2,t5_2shpy

Gave armies reason to rise thats about when they played in front of the US army in Kuwait and Iraq and Ive stood in hell Where many had to suffer I stared the devil in the eyes is about that time they were in Saddam Husseins palace and were looking at his portrait on the wall.
