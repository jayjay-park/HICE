9471171,0,t3_5a3dp1,You are correct about requiring a nested loop. Your outer loop is going to be for each row and your inner loop will actually populate said row. It is going to be a decrementing loop so that you have the full range on top leading down to just the first number  on the bottom row. So this loop would start at iterator  input value and decrease once per iteration while iterator gt . Your nested loop would then actually populate the row so your iterator would start at  and count up to your input. So for an example of  as your input your first loop would be set to count down     and then stop. Then inside each internal loop you would iterator up from  to that iterations value.Input     Top LoopInput Value           SubLoop I   Until Input                        End SubLoop     Decrement Iterator    Top LoopInput Value         SubLoop I   Until Input                        End SubLoop     Decrement Iterator    Top LoopInput Value         SubLoop I   Until Input                     End SubLoop     Decrement Iterator    Top LoopInput Value         SubLoop I   Until Input                      End SubLoop     Decrement IteratorEnd Top Loop,C_Homework,d9gizd8,1,t5_3b64v
