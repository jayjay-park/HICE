Mutiny is easy to get in and so is elbo! Personally I like playing the mutiny. Dive asDive comes but all shows are free. You may also get paid in beer. If you get paid...,chicagomusicscene,cfd6rjg,5,t5_2ro12

Of course Id encourage you to make one and participate on a deeper level if youd like too!,chicagomusicscene,cfrqnzq,1,t5_2ro12

3423726,0,t3_2zffi2,The intersection of western and Fullerton is a good place to look for shows. Quenchers and The Mutiny often host punk shows. A mile west the Burlington home to independent shows of all genres. A mile east? Liars Club. All great places most booking often. Hope this helps! ,chicagomusicscene,cpij38g,7,t5_2ro12

11147244,0,t3_5z1fif,Great idea! It would be cool to be able to a preview of what the site design really looks like i.e. available shows in a given city before making people signuplogin.Many people on the internet have so much junk email everyday they are hesitant to create a new account before actually knowing what productservice they are getting.If a prospective bandmusician saw the actual setup first they can feel a lot better about giving their FirstLast name emails etc.For me personally I really dont want to give my info and then later find out I dont like the service design or whatever it may be. On the other hand I could see some really cool designuser interface and instantly want to sign up for an account.,chicagomusicscene,devj0z5,1,t5_2ro12
