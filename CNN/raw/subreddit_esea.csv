4878145,0,t1_cu9dmxx,The admin that banned netex and clive is not a child and didnt act out. They made a decision and executed it. What that group does is not related to ESEA.  If you have a problem with it then I suggest you report them to the appropriate moderatorsadmins that oversee the gambling subreddit where their alleged offenses are relevant.,esea,cu9ff0e,1,t5_2tl66

5635517,0,t3_3sal5r,The matchmaking is done from the available pool of players queuing up at the time that the match begins.  It sorts teams based on a hidden score that each user has not RWS.  RWS is a statistic used to gauge the impact a player has on rounds won its not done for matchmaking ,esea,cwvn19x,1,t5_2tl66

7985435,0,t3_4ohzvp,honestly it should just sort pugs by ADR rather than RWS since its such a controversial statistic. ive had this issue for a LONG time consistently having to do EVERYTHING for my team even at b rank. just fucking remove limits on block lists  is not at all enough. they should be permanent blocks as well. what makes them think that once i block someone i wanna play with them again?,esea,d4dmzzr,1,t5_2tl66

9294304,0,t1_d8t1bai,Why is my MMR up there with Rank A players and Main players. But I still get Other C players on my team. When my team consists of all C rank players and the other team consists of  Rank A and Main players. That just proves to me that ESEAs system is complete garbage. Very rarely have I gotten into a PUG that is fun to play.,esea,d8u4b7e,2,t5_2tl66
