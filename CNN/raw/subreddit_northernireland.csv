969281,0,t1_chee7yu,gt How do people feel about the Expansion of Ukraine over the years? Does this complicate things? How do the competing nationalist thought deal with it?It does pretty much  we have the regions of Ukraine that have very different views. The Eastern Ukraine hated Western Ukraine because according to soviet propaganda West. Ukraine supported the nazis. Now maybe they did but this sort of propaganda made the life hell for those Western Ukrainians who decided to move to Eastern Ukraine.I do feel there is a big difference between Western Ukrainians and for example Central Ukrainians. At the same time there is strong difference Between Donbass Donetsk and Luhansk citizens and Central Ukrainians as well. Now the differences are not that strong. Not as strong as in NI for sure. We speak the different variations of the language though this is the point where the similarities with Yugoslavia are obvious  the difference between Croatians and Serbians is really small they speak almost the same language but...yeah... due to their political stance they had to choose to live separately  and this is what is going in Ukraine now too I think. Its mostly political not an ethnic conflict but politics can divide people just as much as ethnicity.gtDo not put you hopes in Russia the EU or the US. They view you as pawns and do not have your interests at heartFrom what I see this is not possible at all these days. Like Ukraine is too weak and the globalization tendencies are too strong  the people would prefer to live with someone big rather than live on their own. I agree with your point of view about that its better to be truly independent  yep this is true. But its not possible really not in modern Ukraine.I also want to see Russia proEuropean as well.

1436087,0,t3_2al8nx,Protestants vs Catholics is a misnomer. Irish Catholicism became politicised and associated with nationalism in the th century when nationalist politicians used the infrastructure of the Catholic church to spread their message. Lots of prominent Irish nationalists have been Protestant. Northern Ireland happened to have closer ties to Britain through heritage and trade and also had a higher Protestant population. When Ireland received its own government Northern Ireland resisted fearing that its economy and culture would be overwhelmed in an Ireland ruled from Dublin. The problems started because the Northern Irish state wasnt  unionist and nationalists  the vast majority Catholic  were marginalised under Stormont rule. This lasted from the s to the s when a civil rights movement started. This quickly caused friction between the two sides as unionists felt their position was threatened and nationalists felt unable to demonstrate for better rights. Extreme elements on both sides turned to violence while politicians struggled to find consensus.The Orange Order is both proProtestant and prounion and they march because its a traditional part of their heritage. The marching is only controversial when it passes through areas where residents consider a proProtestant Unionist victory parade inflammatory. Both communities feel theyre not being respected by the other or the powers that be and so the friction continues.,northernireland,ciwagbp,8,t5_2qlve

2077501,0,t1_cl37yrh,Well Ive spoke to someone who used to be in the police and they knew an officer who had to deal with this guy who quite clearly had mental issues. When they went to arrest they guy he tried to set the officer on fire dont ask me how. In the station they asked him why did he do it. Your man responded how every time something like that happens the hospital just drugs him for a few days and lets him out and that the cycle repeats. He even said that if hes arrested again the next month hell probably try and set the officer on fire again. Every week or so after this the same officer who was nearly set on fire goes to his house and talks with him for a few hours which according to the person I was talking to really helped the poor lad out.On the other hand Ive spoken to an officer who said theyre happy when the homeless addicts die. They said all they do is steal and mug people and are the most frustrating people they have to work with. They said theyre a drain on society and its good when they die off.So we go from one officer who takes time out of their life to help someone out to another who uses the same logic as the Nazis. I guess what Im trying to say is while theres some real cunts in the police theres also some really nice and good people also.

Protecting your home and your family and fighting the good fight for Ulster. Its why people actually defend the Shankill Butchers and all the other arseholes like Billy Wright. Hell most Loyalist paramilitary groups have killed more Protestants than Catholics but its all glamourised.Kids grow up with that as their backdrop and I do feel like they have some deluded sense of missing out on their war to save Ulster. There is the motto We will not be the generation to fail Ulster.I know there have been people in my immediate family involved in the troubles to certain extents and the older generation such as my elderly aunts and uncles think its rude I dont want to pay tribute to a INLA funeral or some former IRA coffin on Easter.

As well as a robust Economy locally which would build upon choosing STEM related courses.gtThese degrees that became available were trendy fluff courses like philosophy sociology accountancy and dance leisure and tourism and media studies. These courses were never industry lead and utterly useless.Whilst you have plucked a series of seemingly random incoherent subjects to explain a point it belies your lack of understanding of economics and actual course choices of potential existing and former students. gt There are very low levels of graduates in Northern Irelands agriculture sector compared with rest of UK.

How is it this debate cannot be framed rationally instead of each camp falling into extremes before anything has been negotiated.You actually think that the UK leaving the EU will lead to nationalists in NI becoming second class citizens? How so? Because I dont understand that their right to a United Ireland might somehow be undermined? How the GFA is enshrined in law in this devolved government. People should be held hostage by that idea should they? That violence might ensue because people make a decision? We should put the Union Flag back up on shitty hall day in day out if were just out to minimise violence and tension. The Taoiseach has every right to a voice as do you but its not actually your decision to make. Talk away but making political spinny soundbites like The guns are silent makes a mockery of rational political debate in my view and ought to be criticised.And phrases like Irish Unionism just make you sound like more of a dick. ,northernireland,czmdf8s,2,t5_2qlve

6530685,0,t1_czunvrs,I had a quick look at this. Spain allows longer time limits for abortion if the foetus is found to have a significant health abnormality or pose a threat to the life of the mother. A UN panel of the committee on the rights of persons with disabilities made a nonbinding recommendation as part of a wider review of Spains laws on disabilities that this distinction be removed Cant seem to convince Google to give me the direct link  search Spain Foetal abnormality OHCHR should be in first few results.Larkin is attempting to imply that this is some sort of binding judgement that abortion laws which draw distinctions based on foetal health are against the UN human rights conventions so we cant just allow abortion for foetal abnormalities. However I dont think is really the case as the ruling is nonbinding and Spains law covers a range of nonlethal abnormalities as well as lethal ones. A law which only allowed abortion for fatal abnormalities wouldnt run into this problem I think as the foetus wont become a person with disabilities in any meaningful sense. But as others have said this is primarily thrown up by Larkin as an additional roadblock because of his personal disapproval of abortion and so hes trying to make it an all or nothing system where legislators cant legalise abortion in some cases without legalising it for all. Which I would dearly love if it backfired on him but thats probably too much to hope for... ,northernireland,czutovt,2,t5_2qlve

The country is stuck at am impasse and will be for at least some time to come eg at least  generations. If not really hard to think why. If you think an united ireland is going to happen just think back to the flag protests. But it would be s of times worse. This is the reality. It will be stuck in power sharing for a really long time. So in the meantime......I dont give a fuck which country I am a member of. But what I do give a fuck about is having a good health care system Good infrastructure Good education system and good care for the elderly as well as having a great quality of life with lots of freedom to enjoy it. Which tbh neither the south or the north has many of the above.So instead of talking about which colour the flag should be. Can we just have no flag and get the country to benefit the people by providing the above? After all you only have  attempt each at life. Stop fucking wasting it in what I would consider being such a completely stupid way.

Against whose will?gtThis therefore is a blatant strawman and I am disappointed you even said it.Not at all. You said there is no case to be made for a tiny province to demand the financial support from a separate nation. That statement directly applies to the current setup of the European Union. Belgium demand more grants and subsidies than Germany does. How do you justify that?gt Its just a loophole towards doing the exact same thing?Yes it is. But its still abiding by self determination. No country can be removed from the Union against their will.gtImagine if say a country started rejeting EU legisaltion on the environment. Do you seriously not think the EU should be allowed remove them?No. The country that rejected the proposal is well within their right to do so. Thats the point of variable geometry.

Loyalism suffers from this as people are dismissive of their role due to a handful of crazy fundamentalists. On the other hand any nationalist who tries to dispel myths about the Provos is shunned. The whole timeline is a lot more nuanced and riddled with contradiction than the world is to believe. It is exactly why we have such trouble dealing with the past. I understand why people see it as good fodder for filmmakers. I havent seen  days nor has many of the dicks making a big deal about it. Ill reserve judgment until I see how the subject is handled. Personally I thought hunger was great! I didnt walk away thinking of Sands as a hero rather a conflicted man who happened to have a lot of resolve no matter what his background. Its a fascinating subject. I could watch a documentary about a high profile loyalist I just dont think the world could stomach it because they have literally no individuals of historical worth beyond a couple of extreme nut bars. Loyalism has an image problem and I feel that if the hunger strikes never happened this would also be the case for republicans.

9484734,0,t3_5aotj1,Its worth noting that SF beat the DUP in the  European and Local elections so the DUPs support  is being artificially propped up.This situation where all the PULelectorate support the DUP was coming under increasing strain even before Brexit because more and more people were getting annoyed with their rightwing views and foolishness. Look at Gay marriage. How will working class loyalists feel when cutbacks start to bite? Will the PUP start complaining that they are being frozen out just like the UUP? All those loyalist paramilitaries will disappear at some point and the PUP will turn into a normal party like SF.The DUP also deny any sensible Unionist movement enough space to get off the ground. If the DUP fall below SF there is a good chance they will collapse down to their core vote since there will be no reason to vote for them. The problem is that if this occurs then there wont be any other Unionist movement strong enough to take their place in .In addition it isnt obvious that SF want to keep the assembly at all  since when were they emotionally attached to NI?You have to remember if Stormont fails its basically Joint Authority over NI Plan B. If SF have strong influence in Dublin they are basically getting to jointly rule NI without having to deal with the DUP. This obviously appeals to them since they dont have get bogged down in the current arrangements. The threat of it alone would also give them leverage in negotiations with Unionist politicians in NI. The simple truth is that PUL people will always value NI more than CNR people so this gives CNR politicians power.

Early Irish law is like the Old Irish language remarkably standard across an Island with no central authority. However close examination has revealed some variations.Regarding parliamentgtThe earliest parliament in Ireland was the Parliament of Ireland which was founded in the thirteenth century as the supreme legislative body of the lordship of Ireland and was in existence until .So how do you explain all the things you are talking about.  The Church probably which mediated aspects of brehon laws which mediated aspects of education.I know you want there to be a Unified Ireland politically independent and sovereign but there is NOTHING that suggests that is true.Ireland was composed of Kingdoms which fought among one another for territory and control.  Ireland was never a unified sovereign state at any point in history prior to English  British control.  You need it to be though because it validates your political perspective but that political perspective is based on fantasy.So who should the reader believe a guy on reddit or the scholars which others can readily look up and say your full of crap lol.   If the AngloNorman invasion had of came a few centuries later perhaps there could have been a United Ireland under one king or parliament which was truly sovereign and where legislation as made which ruled under over the entire Island  but that just never happened.,northernireland,dam3iif,1,t5_2qlve

AnywaygtJohn Hume and Seamus Mallon  the two titans of the SDLP in its heyday  had an open row about whether nationalists really cared about a united Ireland.gtThe party leader and his deputy whose differences were mostly kept under wraps during their dominance of northern nationalism for much of the Troubles were fundamentally split on the definitive issue.gtThe schism erupted during a meal at the Irish embassy in London in January .gtThey had been invited along with other SDLP members and family by then ambassador Noel Dorr to mark MP Mr Mallon officially taking his newlywon seat for the first time at Westminster.gtIn a missive  marked secret  sent back to Dublin Mr Dorr told the Irish government considerable differences of outlook and approach between John Hume and Seamus Mallon came out quite clearly in discussion.gtAn argument developed between them in which Hume spoke of the ambivalence of Northern nationalists about Irish unity  they want it but they know the time is not ripe for it and the concept of unity is more important as a factor in what he called the tribal conflict than in itself the diplomat reported.gtMr Hume argued that his native and predominantly nationalist Londonderry had closer links with Glasgow than the west of Ireland or even Dublin according to the newly declassified documents released into the Irish National Archives.gtMallon on the other hand disagreed with this and spoke of the desire for Irish unity as a deep motivating force North and South of the border Mr Dorr said in the letter which was copied to the taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald and tanaiste Dick Spring.gtHe also challenged Humes view that Irish unity of necessity would have to be a very longterm prospect.gtMallon sees the AngloIrish Agreement as a kind of last throw by constitutional Irish nationalism.gtThe fledgling agreement had been signed just two months beforehand and was facing a revolt from unionists.gtMr Mallon told the dinner party if it failed the outlook would be bleak.gtBut his party leader dissented from this analysis  insisting the treaty which gave Dublin an advisory role in Northern Ireland was a new beginning rather than a last opportunity.gtMr Hume argued that a substantial number of Northern Catholics would never support violence in any circumstances and agreed with a suggestion that there would be another agreement if the AngloIrish Agreement failed.gtThe pair also appeared to differ on what direction the SDLP should take in the immediate aftermath of the agreement.gtMr Hume said the choice was to play it safe by appealing to their own supporters or to reach out to unionists to resolve the fundamental historic problem.gtHe strongly favoured reaching out to unionists and wanted to do it sooner rather than later.gtBut Mr Mallon had a longer timetable in mind and said his voters  many of whom gave him conditional support  were giving the agreement a chance and wanted to see it delivered.gtIn the letter Mr Dorr appeals for discretion around his report as he was sure neither Mr Hume nor Mr Mallon would appreciate having their differences talked about.,northernireland,dbwfao2,1,t5_2qlve

If the job prospects of the field are nil there is some validity to the argument that statefunded education shouldnt support it.But thats assuming youre educating people for todays job market and were not. Were educating children and young adults to become productive members of a society that is  years away and we have very little idea what will be valuable then.  years ago we were all told to be doctors and lawyers if we had the grades because thats where the big money was then but now its in IT services. The most robust longterm education policy is always going to be one with a broad subject base that lets people pursue their interests to the absolute limit that they can regardless of the perceived value to todays economy.If you could go back  years and give education advice to schoolchildren again you might give them what was considered at the time to be bad advice.

Not gonna put any words in your mouth.  If Republican crimes are rape and the British army committed crimes in Northern Ireland then surely they are equally guilty of rape right?Now to your question.  I never said anything about whos to blame for the Troubles.  Youre the one who wants to talk about that.  Sure things were calming down a bit and the Ra restarted the violence with their campaign so theyre obviously one of the causes of the violence but if you think you can blame one group for the whole conflict then I pity whoever taught you history.  Its never black and white and anyone who insists that it is clearly has their own agenda.  The Ra didnt operate in a vacumn they depended on support from Catholic communities support which they could only get because of the actions of Stormont and Loyalists and the British army.But yeah sure republicans were a cause of violence.  And if that doesnt satisfy you then idk tell people Im a Ra sympathsier?  The only ones whod believe you already think that anyway.,northernireland,dctrhhe,1,t5_2qlve
