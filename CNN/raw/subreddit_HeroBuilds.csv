10384471,0,t1_dcky80l,Hey another one...Lifestealers Ult mentions that ults can be skilled at level  which is not the case anymore.Is there some more convenient way of doing this? P Have you considered putting the hero builds on something like Github so that people can contribute edits more easily.,HeroBuilds,dcl573w,2,t5_378ip
11042091,0,t3_5vpr0h,I dont like this change Why should safelane pa rush vanguard? and lycan starting with e in jungle cant even get level  without using a shrine. Also junglers starting with salve instead of tango and some skipping iron talonursa. Probably gonna start making my own now,HeroBuilds,dejlo0p,2,t5_378ip
