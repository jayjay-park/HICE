1230582,0,t1_ci805q6,Its too bad all of this is happening right when Im expecting Greenwalds grand finale revelation any moment now.  I am really really hoping with the next revelation that they are epically caught with their hand in the cookie jar by spying on Congress like the CIA was already caught doing judges defense attorneys Amnesty International Human Right Watch and the ACLU.Now all the intelligence committees are going to point screaming and yelling about Iraq but fail to recognize that the bureaucraticgovernment dysfunction that helped bring about Iraq not an overabundance of rights.  Just look at the Veterans Administration thats an example of the type of tripover yourownshoelaces bureaucracies that screwed the pooch on  and post war Iraq.The NSA caught the terrorists contacting a safe house enroute to attacking on  but didnt share that with the FBI?What Al Qaeda a double agent working in the CIAFBI Ali Mohamed?There was no weapons of mass destruction?We disbanded the Iraq Army?We demolished the Iraqi secular civil society with blanket DeBaathification?Dopes,iraqconflict,ci823hu,1,t5_324nn

1323488,0,t1_ciii4da,gtCouldnt they potentially borrow syrian supply lines ? lol... How would that work?I mean for a start theyre geographically completely isolated. Secondly... even if this insurmountable problem wasnt an issue whose to say Syria even has the supplies to share?And finally... America has already issued threats to Assad for using his own jets to bomb ISIS in Iraq. A fullblown alliance between Iraq and Syria is NEVER going to happen. America would never allow it it would be a humiliation.gtgtIraq doesnt have satellites so no satellite intel unless its provided by an allygtAs you underlined yourself...Which is not an acceptable solution at all. For hundreds of reasons...Its like borrowing somebody elses car instead of owning your own. It might not be available when you need it you cant use it as you want use of it could be revoked at any instant for any reason  youre bent over a barrel.,iraqconflict,ciiicha,1,t5_324nn

1821161,0,t1_ck83zgx,gtWhat is more likely is that they realize they are losing and move most of their forces to Syria since they actually poses a chance of overthrowing the Assad regime.I think the problem with that is do the Syrian rebels want them there anymore? Remember that ISIS was not popular with the opposition groups in Syria because they were more interested in behaving like brigands than they were in cooperating to bring down Assad. If they were to return to Syria now they would invite airstrikes from the US and other parties perhaps Israel as well. Groups like Jabhat alNusrah have tread a fine line when it comes to their jihad against the Assad regime I dont think they would happily accept a group that has openly incurred the wrath of the West into their ranks for fear of being branded friend of ISIS. It is possible that the world of militant Islam has learned some lessons when it comes to who your friends should be from the experience of the Taliban with al Qaeda.,iraqconflict,ck8mxpi,1,t5_324nn

1876753,0,t1_ckfazj5,I like that one because it is specific and objective. I think that we should shy away from adopting names if they are not indisputably factual and this name passes that test. Then again once we kill AlBaghdadi and someone else takes up the leadership role we would have to change the name. ,iraqconflict,ckfcbds,0,t5_324nn

10958858,0,t3_5wg9v1, Isis seized a lot of weapons a few years ago from Shia Iraqi military bases that were supplied by Americans. The newly trained Shia soldiers didnt want to risk their life defending Sunni territory since they viewed them as not their people.  Ive also read that Isis is continuing to get arms from a black market that originates in the Balkans.  Isis controls territory they get their funding from taxing and selling the resources from that territory. They also managed to seize a lot of money from banks when they initially conquered that territory. They are becoming weaker. They dont really talk about this much on American news but the Iraqi and Syrian armies have taken back over  of the original territory Isis seized a few years ago.Im not sure what country your from but ISIS is already losing. It should be far from public priority  for American Federal policy.,iraqconflict,deabtz2,2,t5_324nn
