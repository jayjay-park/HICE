8097191,0,t1_d4pygb5,You contemplating suicide because of us is stupid. Not saying youre stupid but doing something permanent because of what people say over the Internet is dumb. I didnt mean any harm towards you I was just questioning why you decided to post this here. I also said that I was more than willing to give your channel a shot and check it out once you have content. Please dont do anything rash because of other people. Especially over the Internet. Thatd be a shame and a waste of human life. If its that bad you need help and Im more than willing to point you the right direction and talk you through anything if thats what you need.  ,EdenMCMXCV,d4q73w3,1,t5_38tkd

8943977,0,t1_d7mxk9a,Thats the biggest reason that the team are preferring to stay here but I proposed the idea of automatically redirecting to rEDEN so when people come here then they wont have to do anything because theyll already be at rEDEN. Most of the subscribers and I hate to say it are inactive and Im not worried about subscribers. Im worried about active users. Hence the redirection system.,EdenMCMXCV,d7mxn96,1,t5_38tkd
