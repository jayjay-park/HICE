199688,0,t1_cf15zl5,You are right i havent handled one of your lowers in person but as someone studying materials science I am pretty familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of various materials.  I personally was just pointing out that PleaseExcuseMe was saying that the PSA rifle would be arguably better due to the fact that it has an aluminum lower.  Also if you look at your website your so called crush tests do nothing to examine if tolerances are still kept after the tests and also do nothing to show what the actual forces being applied to the receivers are.   Also in your NP BCG video which appears to be the only torture test of your receiver the take down pin comes all the way out and the buffer and buffer spring are not held in by the detent which doesnt really speak well for your receivers.    That being said there are some obviously nice parts on that rifle i would just have to say that that receiver is not one of them.  ,gundeals,cf16q9z,5,t5_2rq8n

9264011,0,t1_d8p95x0,I love my lcs regular with safety. Its almost a year old has around  rounds through it at one point going  rounds without cleaning at all and has been carried almost every day. Ive done deep concealment working jobs where clients might not appreciate seeing a gun. Ive open carried Ive pocket carried. Ive carried with the flat magazine the pinky extension and a  round extended mag love that one!. Ive carried it hiking its been carried and fired in the rain and snow with one range trip being in single digits. Its been dropped in snow and dirt. Basically Ive put it through the paces. Mine has some dings and scratches and a significant amount of holster wear.Heres my opinion after a year its awesome. Ive had exactly two jams and both were the same batch of garbagefactory reloads made locally. Other guns have jammed on that brand so I cant blame the gun. It has taken a dozen different brands of ammo. Lead copper fmj hp everything. It all feeds. And after that many rounds the trigger is beautiful. Very smooth. A little while ago my guide rod did break. The washer on the end sheared off. Ruger took care of me right away and sent a new one no questions asked but Im very uncomfortable. I find it hard to trust the gun now that something has broken on it. I recognize that its a fluke but Im still uncomfortable with it. What if thats a design flaw and that happens again? What if it happens when Im using it in self defense? Or am I worrying about nothing?That said my only real complaint is the finish. A lot of modern carry guns have better finishes and I think the Shield is one of them. The bluing is wearing off on mine. It looks aged and worn and Im ok with that. But eventually Ill want to do something about it. If I keep carrying it daily and dont upgrade Ill probably get it cerakoted and thats another expense. Honestly for the price of the lcs  cerakote I could just buy a more expensive gun.I cant see trading it in and I definitely dont regret buying it. But... if I didnt have it? Id be  with the Shield. I think the lcs is slightly easier for deep concealment but I honestly dont think it makes a difference because nobody notices anyway. The trigger is much better but the Shields finish is better.In the lifetime of the gun I kind of think the Shield might be a better deal since Im contemplating a  cerakote job. That would make the Shield cheaper.,gundeals,d8qa2kt,6,t5_2rq8n

My friends Anderson lower has the tiniest bit of play between his Anderson upper and all he did is install those rubber stoppers they sell for the takedown extensions. The mate is rock solid now though it is only really a problem if it bothers you. Its that sort of stuff that usually go wrong if you can even call it that. His feed ramps dont perfectly line up either even though he has an Anderson barrel too and hes never had any feeding issues.

Because of its durability we offer a lifetime warranty.   I would also mention our system is easier to install it takes about  minutesAll that said we also have used the Law Tactical adaptor ourselves.

10173525,0,t3_5lo3n7,Its a great way to buy guns and ammos if you plan on using brick amp mortar chains like Cabelas or Dicks. However for the vast majority of gun deals places like Grabagun or Buds will not be available for purchase. These stores also dont charge taxes and shipping is usually free or low. Certain stores like Buds and Tombstone offer lifetime warranty for new gun purchases. In terms of price comparison the online stores tend to offer the cheapest price. For example the MampP  is usually available for  with free shipping. While in stores like Cabelas it can cost as much as  more. No sense in jumping through hoops when you can just buy online. Another thing you have to consider is liability. With credit card you have zero liability and protected against frauds.

They sell a prepackaged ideology an unreasonable approach to gun control opposing even funding nonpartisan scientific studies on gun violence data collection improved background checks training requirements etc and serve as a promotional outlet to get you to spend more money on guns training insurance and other products. Their lobbying efforts though not solely responsible have poisoned the national conversation on guns IMO and are part of the larger almost unbridgeable political divide we see today.

We do UPS carrier calculated shipping and were in the southeast so west coast shooters can get the short end of the stick on that.  For us to ship a  rd sample of ammo from our shop to our shop costs ..Were going to do a shipping special tomorrow running through the weekend for  flat rate on mm sub ammo.  Thats for a  round sample or k rounds or whatever strikes your fancy.  To be fair weve already contacted everyone who has ordered mm sub and let them know were refunding their shipping over  because fair is fair.  The shipping rates wont be updated until tomorrow evening but everyone who has purchased or purchases up to the special will be taken care of.  Were sending out notifications to our mailing list tomorrow Thursday March   at pm and well also post up on rgundeals with a super cool full auto video.Thanks guys!,gundeals,deouged,1,t5_2rq8n

Then ehh dont really like the A style sight switch it out with a lowpro gas block and different sight. Ehh could use a better stock so upgrade that too. Now you have a Sport II customized to how youd like it but with probably the same amount you would have put into just building a customized rifle ground up. ,gundeals,dgcf36c,1,t5_2rq8n
