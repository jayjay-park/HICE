I suppose its up to the coaches with how hard they are willing to run him. In my mind thats the only thing holding him back. Owning both these guys could get annoying quick... ,FootballGameFilm,cumzxfs,3,t5_39gsb

I realize that it must take a lot of time to put those together and Im sure it seems like an unrewarding job but trust me many people here love all the hard work all you guys put in.  I just want to say thanks for everything all you guys ever did for this sub or any other similar subs.  You guys are the true heros of reddit!,FootballGameFilm,cxdqn9t,1,t5_39gsb
