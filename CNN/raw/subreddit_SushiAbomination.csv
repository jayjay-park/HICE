6375112,0,t1_cze89hy,I guess if he and by he were talking about the head chef that creates the menu for a large chain of restaurants were to call it temaki or nigiri even though its clearly tartare not sushi or of real Japanese origin youd still believe what the menu said?,SushiAbomination,czea3us,2,t5_2wi6p

9294516,0,t3_54x5wh,A local sushi bar often serves this as part of omakase. But their omakase is very much a kaiseki sort not everything is actually sushi and they dont call everything that. This is basically poke.For what it is this is effin delicious. Theirs is usually surrounded by a thin outer layer of avocado with the barelycooked egg on top. I think the amount of avocado pictured would be overkill the tuna should still be the star ingredient.,SushiAbomination,d8u5a0p,1,t5_2wi6p
9317978,0,t1_d896c9g,My experience in Tokyo is that they prefer using dark meat so its all a little fattier tasting but oh my god so good that way. ,SushiAbomination,d8x4ebf,1,t5_2wi6p

9866826,0,t1_dateaga,Id imagine the filling to just spill out when you bite it. Or the nori not tearing away properly with the bite and just pulling the rest of the taco apart. ,SushiAbomination,dato4xz,7,t5_2wi6p

11180275,0,t1_dez94q8,Hes absolutely correct  that Reddit is a congregation of trolls and losers! Im one of them ofc! But there are also boat loads of scientists open minded individuals and even celebrities! There are so many open minded individuals just not open minded enough for bananas rice and fish neatly wrapped up into a fine dining fiasco. Its literally... bananas. Ill try it oneday and make a post about it tagging you in it.,SushiAbomination,dez9sev,6,t5_2wi6p
11267734,0,t1_df8q4ch,I bet the menu promises great things from the trump roll but when you order it you just get a can of tuna fish and some rancid mayo. ,SushiAbomination,df96iwx,10,t5_2wi6p

11667618,0,t3_66g9w5,I wanted to say that it wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt so badly plated.But then I took a closer look. What the hell is on those rolls? The weird gritty looking stuff? Is that... ketchup drops or something on the top of each? Why whole chunks of avocado? Why the flower?,SushiAbomination,dgijg70,37,t5_2wi6p
