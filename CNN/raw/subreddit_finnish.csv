3996269,0,t1_cqz35hk,Aha thanks for your reply although in the end I also left you hanging..!Cheers for breaking down the thought process you take! It pushed me to develop an approach to cracking words so I can start doing some reading with a bit of comprehension. I want to get out of the awkward phase of knowing so little where I cant consume enough content to further my development bit of a chicken and egg problem.In terms of material I ended up buying Finnish An essential grammar from Amazon. In the first few chapters it explains the suffixes of nominals and verbs and provides tables. In the same chapter was also the order of the suffixes which was super helpful in developing a cheatsheet.Cheers,finnish,crbt2z5,2,t5_2qkj7
