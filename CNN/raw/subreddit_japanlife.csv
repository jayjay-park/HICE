1087463,0,t3_26kco5,Ive dropped a bit of weight this year in Japan by sticking to a low carb diet and joining a gym. Its much easier to eat better when you are cooking for yourself. Its easy to fill up on meat and lots of vegetables here and most restaurants should at least have a few simple options. Avoiding rice and pasta is more difficult especially when eating out with groups.The conbini is a bad place to get food if you are on a diet. Almost everything is grains or sugar. If you want to drop weight think about eating as little of those as possible. Go for the salads pickles kimchee eggs or meat. I second the idea of not drinking calories. We are lucky we have so many choices for unsweetened teas and coffees here.Low carb isnt for everyone but significantly cutting down sugar has been the best thing I could have done. Cutting out the grains wasnt as easy but I let myself have a few of my favorite things every now and then and I stay in check.There is a restaurant supply grocery store in my town worth checking if you have one and frozen berries and vegetables are really cheap nuts are really cheap comparatively and they carry interesting foreign foods and spices too. Try looking for something like that. I also order meat from the themeatguy.jp and protein and bars etc... from iherb.com . shipping!I second the advice to exercise where you can drink tons of water and cook for yourself as much as possible.

1619995,0,t3_2cuega,gtIve never ridden oneHoly shit! This is my biggest concern.  Remember its not if you crash but when.Please please please go to a proper school to learn or rent a dirt bike and crash it a bunch of times before you hit the street or both. Practice the hell out of emergency stops because most of the time its the old timers in kei trucks coming out of nowhere or assuming youll stop for them that are going to give you trouble on Japanese roads.  And for a newbie the giant uncovered ditches on the sides of mountain roads.Now that Ive finished playing mom I agree with udagbrown.It depends how long you are planning on staying in Japan.I think a cc gentsuki would be very practical to get around unless you have your heart set on doing long touring trips using the highways to get to your destination. You dont need a special license but you will have to convert your US license after  year which is a pain in the ass.Speaking of riding on highways uukatama is right.  You need to be OVER cc so a cc bike which is actually cc pink plate would be illegal. You would have to have at least a cc for the highway.For long term with no experience I also agree its worth it to pay up to learn at a proper driving school.  However it will be much more expensive than in the states.If  year or less I would recommend getting your motorcycle license in the states then just using an international license from triple AAA for the year.  Using this option Id recommend buying a bike from Red Baron. Theyre a little more expensive than other places but you pay for the service.  Theyll set you up with insurance and will also buy your bike back from you when you leave so you dont have to worry about selling it.Another thing to add is that there is no shaken for bikes cc and under.  Not that shaken is that expensive for bikes but its less paperwork and hassle.,japanlife,cjjd6xh,2,t5_2rg2o

Which is something that for good and bad simply does not happen in Japan.This bugged me my first few years here but Ive come to appreciate why not giving LEOs room for judgement on many issues may actually work better in this environment. Spirit of the law works pretty well in a smaller town or for stuff in a local context of a city where everyone knows each other and knows the local cops. For situations like sound trucks in a situation where both sides could get contentious really quick? Not so much. Lots of things get like this in big cities where no one really knows each other much less the LEOs involved. Hard to do anything but letter of the law in those cases.gtRegarding hate speech there are some very good arguments both for and against it.Ive yet to see a good argument in favor of hate speech laws that overcomes the way bad speech is handled in the US i.e. its all good up to the point of incitement to crimeviolence oversimplification but relatively concise. How do you define hate speech legally? Hurt feelings on the part of a minority because of a rd partys words? Laws which get specific about you cant say X Y amp Z about ltprotected groupgt are easily evaded and mostly exist as a fig leaf so the Left can feel that it has done something about the problem.

2526431,0,t3_2olkfe,Why doesnt it change? Because youre forgetting that Japan is one of the safest countries on Earth even if you included the unusual suicide statistics.  While the reasons behind that are very complex an argument can be made for the system  it would cost an enormous amount of time effort and energy to change the legal system and as it is now on paper it looks very good. Remember that this is a country to which image is very important. They dont see a problem with a  conviction rate  thats a plus actually. Junko Furutas murderers are out IIRC because they were minors when convicted. The difficulty in writing law is that it has to apply to everyone especially in Japans system in which the only leeway is in whether youll prosecute or not. Nobody would have expected minors to do what those kids did. If Japan had a death penalty for minors or tried minors as adults I dont think they can and gave them the death penalty theyd get a lot more negative press than quietly releasing those minors back into society. The incident is abominable...but you cant invent new laws for individual cases.gt Japanese police will often simply NOT INVESTIGATE murders and call it a suicide to maintain a low murder rateThis may be suspected but you cant state it outright as a fact. They wont investigate murders that based on the evidence they have they cant convict. The west isnt very different  cold cases. gtNone of the AV actors who raped the women on the Forced Uterus Destruction   DVDs were sentenced and only one person from Bakky the AV company was sentencedhe got  months. Im not very familiar with this case but the link makes it look like he got  years not  months. . This is less a statement about the rule of law and more a question of the involvement of law with the AV industry and that gets very heavy very fast in Japan. Your argument would have been stronger if you pointed out that the courts seem to tolerate the Yakuza presence. gt There is a  conviction rate and convictions are based on forced confessions. conviction rate looks good statistically and the argument is made that innocent people wouldnt confess to crimes they didnt commit. But from a western perspective yes this raises eyebrows. gt Executions are done without the familys knowledge and not even the condemned will know until the morning of.Im not sure what you think the problem here is. It doesnt seem right from a western perspective but thats ethnocentrism more than it is that this is immoral. gt but I think something more extreme has to happen like threats from the west to cut trade or impose sanctions unless legal reforms are carried out. Now this is just silly. Their system is different and it makes some questionable decisions but that doesnt give foreign nations a right to question Japans sovereignty. Their legal system was given to them by American occupiers in any case and IIRC is based on how military tribunals work. How would you improve it?  The judges in Japan are tasked with pursuing the truth but theres still a defense lawyer debating the prosecutor and innocent until proven guilty still exists in Japan with the exception of the  day hold prosecutors can put on you. Getting rid of that rule would be a plus for the legal system probably but switching to the western system? It hasnt exactly worked brilliantly there either.,japanlife,cmocap1,7,t5_2rg2o

Since they have essentially bought the room they can rent this out.I would assume there may be people who rent an apartment then sublet it out. Actually I know a friend who does this using airbnb.

3814415,0,t3_3419wu,Let me talk about my own experience and try and help you at the same time. My wife is also helping me out as I type this so youll get her opinion too. My inlaws had some reservations about our wedding initially however in the end we were able to create a wedding that completely satisfied them. Weddings are a big thing in Japan. Its important for the parents because they want to showcase their children as much as possible. Its a testament to how they raised their children. Its about honor. My wifes parents made it a point to go around to every table and pour beerdrinks for each guest at some point in all three of their daughters weddings. They stood and had a conversation while they did this with each person there. Our wedding was an international wedding. My inlaws dont speak english but at the very least they made it a point to learn enough of it to at least thank each guest for coming. It was a big deal for them. So while itd be really easy to say Fuck them. This is our wedding. We shouldnt have to care about our parents wishes. Dont do that. Youre better than that. Youre marrying someone from this culture. Youre marrying into a series of cultural compromises for the rest of your life. And dont talk to them about the wedding yourself. Let your wife do that. Itll make things way more harmonious that way. But Ill explain more about that later. First lets talk about my wedding and how we got an amazing wedding done for so cheap.ampnbspMy total wedding venue cost was  yen. Me and my wife ending up paying about  of that money. The rest was paid by the guests. We had a kickass wedding. Seriously... It was at a fancy hotel and it was better and more entertaining than any Japanese wedding that Ive ever been to. It was Star Wars themed and all of our family and VIP guests were able to contribute to it in a tactful and fun way. In the end it did not feel like a wedding that my  guests only paid  yen for.Here is the bill for it Resumeblanks Wedding ReceiptIll break it down for you.ampnbspNon Religious Ceremony Plan Includes ChapelMusicBubbles that launch everywhere when we step onto the aisleAn MC for the chapel eventFlower showerAnd launching a bunch of doves into the sky once the ceremony is finished    yenDress and Makeup  yenBuffet for  people Note We had  people but we figured that the old people and kids wouldnt eat as much. We were right.  Free drinks If you dont have this Im not coming to your wedding. There better be as much goddamn beer as I can drink  Main Flowers for the banquet room  yenOther bullshit flowers to make things pretty  yenWedding Cake  yenLighting and Music  yenCommemorative Pictures And the last three charges are for my wifes dress change midceremony and rehearsal makeup for my wife Which she now says she shouldnt have done rehearsal makeup because it was a waste of  bucks.ampnbspSo... How did we accomplish this?First of all youll notice the tremendous amount of discounts that we got for the wedding. This is because just like any expensive thing you buy price can be negotiated. We had our sights set on Foresta Hills from the beginning but we ended up going to three other places and getting quotes from them. One of the places was cheap as fuck. We took that quote and went to Foresta Hills and said Look... We want to have our wedding here but this other wedding venue is giving us this price. Is there anything you can do?Within  minutes they had price matched the other venues price.ampnbspThe second thing we did was go to the Wedding Fair at Foresta Hills. Wedding Fairs are something that every venue has to bring in customers. They basically show you around the venue and let you sample food etc. But thats not whats important. Whats important is that they give you discount tickets for your wedding just for showing up to the event. Youll see on the bill that there is a  credit. Thats from showing up to the event.ampnbspNow... like I said we had each of our  guests pay  yen for our wedding.  yen was the cost of the buffetstyle food and the cake. That only equals  yen.    .Why did we only end up paying  for the wedding?Cash gifts from the family totaled another . You will get these cash gifts from the Japanese side of your family.We did all this because we needed a wedding that felt like a Japanese wedding which will typically run between    yen but we knew that there was no way that our gaijin friends were going to shell out  to come like they would at a normal Japanese wedding.ampnbspOkay so moving onto my wife and how she dealt with her parents. My wife had a CLEAR image of what she wanted for her wedding before she approached her parents. And even still my motherinlaw was kind of concerned. After all... all of our family was going to be there. My wifes uncle was going to be there. He practically raised my wifes dad and the uncle was supposedly a really conservative person. There was simply no way that he would accept such a cheap wedding! I hadnt met him at the time. It turned out that he was a pretty badass guy who really wouldnt give a shit about what kind of wedding was taking place.At the very least my motherinlaw wanted a proper MC for the wedding. She was willing to pay for it. But it was the fact that my wife had a clear image of what the wedding was going to look like and her conviction that it would feel exactly like a normal Japanese wedding aside from the high price tag that ultimately convinced my motherinlaw. And we did have an MC for the ceremony that was included in the package... which was nice. And for the banquet my best friend and my sisterinlaw did an amazing job at being our MC.Our wedding even had a storyline. Basically the entire banquet hall was a spaceship that was going to take off and land at different destinations in outer space Buffet Omega Danceatron  Caketopia. My best friend and sisterinlaw were the tour guides for the spaceship. And then at one point our spaceship gets hijacked by Emperor Satoshi My wifes dad who comes and abducts my wife after we have a lightsaber fight with his bodyguards played by some of our friends. He eventually wins the fight when I get knocked out and says that he wont accept our wedding and return my wife until I can prove my love to her. I then had to do a series of challenges in order to win her back while my wife was changing her dressmakeupI answered trivia questions about her which were read by our VIP guests  Our bosses my wifes uncle important friends I shouted out my love for her and finally I had to face a guy in a lightsaber duel in a Darth Vader mask who was played by my father.The drunker everyone got the more awesome it became. But my wife had the vision and the conviction to convince my inlaws that it would be a wedding that wouldnt disappoint them.So have your cheap wedding. But make sure it wont disappoint your inlaws. You will have to deal with these people for the REST OF YOUR LIFE. Might as well keep them happy  especially if you can do it at very little expense to you by properly taking bids for your wedding at other venues and getting discount coupons where you can. Plus if you do it right you can have an even better wedding without incurring additional debt. If you have any questions on things please feel free to message me yeah? ,japanlife,cqr2oiv,16,t5_2rg2o

LolWhile Im sure Im not speaking for everyone Ive never been to one of these establishments because Im unable to find a girlfriend or hook up with someone at a club I go because this is more like premium masturbation. Just like my analogy sure I could make some awesome  star meal at home but it would take a lot of fucking effort if I go to a restaurant I order the food and sit back and enjoy it. Same with sex. Whether in a relationship or a one night stand sex is a mutual activity and I am just as concerned with my pleasure as my partners. Visiting one of these fine establishments I do not have to worry about those things. It is all about me even if I wanted to I dont think I could make it pleasurable for the workers and Im certainly not doing anything to make it unpleasant for them as much as it can be nonunpleasant in that kind of work.I would recommend soaplands in the same way I would recommend a Tenga which I would highly recommend.

4929121,0,t3_3id1ls,People have already outlined the major points but more specifically about restaurants I would recommend not even trying to get special orders if youre with a group and need to make a good first impression. First off most places might outright refuse. Second off they very rarely will fully comprehend the concept of no animal products even if you ask them in perfect Japanese. Even asking about the menu usually makes things awkward for everyone involved.Im not vegan myself but Ive tried to help vegetarian and vegan foreigners find stuff they can eat while visiting Japan. If you do find some place compliant with special requests you have to be extremely specific. Heres one exampleWe went to an Italian place and a vegan lady in our group asked for a pizza with no cheese just tomato sauce. The server was confused and concerned that the pizza would turn out terribly but we assured them thats what she wanted. They conferred with the staff and agreed to make it as requested. The finished pizza was indeed free from the regular cheese they use but it was covered in powdered Parmesan cheese. We explained politely that Parmesan cheese was still cheese and they responded But without that it wont have any flavor! They apologized and brought a new one that was plain and we apologized for being difficult. Basically every restaurant experience will be like this if your server even agrees to take special orders. You will have to be extremely specific and ask about fish meat and other animal products by name. Calling in advance helps. Ive managed to get a few veggie dishes mixed in for party sets but I had to be very clear that bacon should not be in the salad.,japanlife,cufushq,5,t5_2rg2o

LDR only work when there is a concrete plan in the future to be together. You dont seem interested in returning to Japan and if she isnt interested in moving to your country something I wouldnt advise if she hasnt been there for extended periods of time then its doomed from the beginning.I might be sounding a bit curmudgeonly right now but a large number of the miserable bitter jaded expats I have met have made the mistake you are currently contemplating making. Got into a relationship. Fallen in love decide to cancel their plans to return home and then subsequently ruined their lives with bad decisions made because of time pressure and pussy.If you really need companionship hit up Roppongi for a few one night stands but dont try and give love a chance or some such hollywood bullshit.TLDR Dont ruin your life for a girl.,japanlife,cukjp6l,15,t5_2rg2o

In order for the U.S. to be exempt from the driver test requirement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must instruct the Japanese Embassy in Washington to contact each of the  states and provide them with a questionnaire. Once the  individual questionnaires are collected they will be translated into Japanese and studied by the National Police Agency. In addition to individual state safety records and procedures for acquiring a license the National Police Agency will be looking closely to see if each of the  individual states exempt holders of valid Japanese licenses from taking state road and written tests.gt gt We shared with the NPA statistics which showed that the United States had a risk value much lower than that of Japans with respect to fatalities as a share of vehicle kilometers traveled. We were told that the Japanese police still needed to see the safety records of each individual state.

5598185,0,t1_cwpb0xz,There was a teacher like that at my school and yeah basically she was working out her personal issues on me because she picked me as an easy target. She wasnt an English teacher so we didnt actually work together but she would go out of her way to be unpleasant and rude and lie about me to other teachers. The other teachers knew she was batshit and interacted with her as little as possible which is probably why she targeted me. I think ALTs do become targets for people with major issues because there are no consequences for treating the ALT like shut since theyll be gone soon.,japanlife,cwr0b2p,1,t5_2rg2o

5751251,0,t3_3ttqtp,I work for a language school and am a licensed immigration agent so I can provide some information and clear some things up that people have been talking about.I can guarantee that your school has already informed immigration its almost an automatic process we just print a letter and mail it to them whenever a student leaves the school.  If a school doesnt do this there will be big problems.  Disregarding what would have happened if you had passed the exam if you have no intention to study in Japan your visa status is more or less expired regardless of what your residence card may say.  You should also keep the school updated with your current status such as if you changed schools or have changed to a different visa.  If the school discovers you are still in the country and doing activities outside of the primary visa status they can request immigration to start an investigation and you will be visited by them although in our case we try to avoid this situation whenever possible as it can lead to a deportation order and banishment from the country.  Wed rather just try to convince them to surrender their visa status voluntary although sometimes we get students who refuse to leave and have to be forced out.Note that if someone important finds out that you are not engaging in activities related to your status the school gets penalized since they were the ones to bring the person into the country so its in their best interest to be the ones to initiate the deportation.Saying that youre probably fine with your situation you can easily go to immigration to change to a tourist visa since you had the intentions to continue studying in Japan.  Since this is no longer the case you wont get in trouble since it hasnt been much time yet.  Taking the JLPT is not sufficient means to be a student just to let you know.  Just to be safe I would recommend bringing your jukenhyo and any other evidence that shows that you took the test and failed it.  Theyll be more than happy to help you out though.,japanlife,cx9zxqm,2,t5_2rg2o

First time the it was closed on Wednesdays. Ok sure fine. They didnt seem closed but whatever. Second time it was five to nine. We walked in. OH SO SORRY we close at nine! Again. This was a bar. On a Friday. Were like Huh weird that a bar closes early... A Japanese couple walked in as we were leaving and were seated right away. Posted a bit back but I had a relative in town from the States. Really nice quiet kid  wanted to come to Japan because hed studied Japanese in school. He was in an elevator and this old guy starts talking to his buddy and laughing. My relative suddenly realizes that they guys were talking about him and calling him a gorilla. He looks at them and says Im a gorilla?! in Japanese. Old guys nearly shit their pants and started rounds of panicked gomens. It happens sometimes. Others it doesnt.

5904079,0,t1_cxrggkc,For you and ublahandmoreblah since the thread is toast at this time. years ago already  years into being a total badass I often came to Tokyo to teach staff in the Tokyo branch office IT stuff My trips were fully paid because I could speak Japanese plus at that point I was badass at my IT specialty which again one of the reasons I rec becoming awesome at something THEN coming to Japan There are lots of free lunchestravelfun paid for by others to bring you places and have you do your thing.Anyway at this branch they were using a third party Japanese people not outsourcing to do support for their product. Like most third party support they were cheap and pretty much sucked. IT guys who were straight outta college who read some manuals and were given a laptop the most senior guys had like  years of experience repairing vending machines or cash registers and are now supporting supercomputers... Within those guys though there were some real excellent people. They never lasted though. No attitude they just knew this was a stepping stone and once they could theyd dive into a place that would actually pay them well. But these are guys who Graduated from college. Many of them didnt have engIT background but some did.So got that background?When I was there there was a nomikai One of the real great guys one of the ones who really stood out among his peers got a job at another place and it was his last day. Within that worthless org he was a real gem. Smart funny trilingual hes from Myanmar he could speak Japanese Really Well English nearfluent. And he was the better among his IT peers. He was so noteworthy that even in the US where we didnt hear much about even the official Japanese staff much less the third party staff people recognized his name and talent.Stand out guy real skills real good guy and trilingual. About  years old or so? At the nomikai we were having fun joking around with him. One of the Japanese staff members ribbed him lightly about where he was going next. Then were poking him about his salary.He was going to DELL server support in Japan. He kinda beamed about the salary he was going to receive It was basically . We all held our poker faces. Congratulted him. Still FB friends with him and meet from time to time. In about  years once he has more EXP Im going to aim to recruit him into my office.But yeah it fucking floored us. This guy was excellent given his age and background and his hot presepect at a respectable IT company was K.Also it made us go What the fuck are they paying these OTHER guys on the CURRENT team that this guy thought K was a huge leap up in pay...So yeah thats the IT story of pay in Japan if you work your way of from the bottom Youll fucking stay at the bottom in Pay Job Satisfaction etc unless you really make some hard moves. Its just so much better to become an expert in a field at home in your own lang keep up on Japanese and aim for a position at a good paying foreign company with foreign payquality standards in Japan.That level of pay after a few years at a wellnamed company is what you may look forward to. I went the route of going home becoming an expert in something over  years then coming back. I make over redacted MANY times that above Dell pay my friend leapt for for doing what I do where I am in a great company with great guys.The tradeoff While I came back regularly to Japan and kept my Japanese current with TV dramas and movies the  years I wasnt livingworking in Japan and Japanese meant that my Japanese isnt at the N level that I wished it was by now. But hey it was a choice I traded in NativeLevel Japanese ability to pursue a fun exciting wellpaying career. And now  years later Im doing Both Together.Best of luck.,japanlife,cxtk4bz,1,t5_2rg2o

6740966,0,t1_d0gjdtd, weeks ago I attended a talk by a French artist in Tokyo MOCA. His English was so thickly accented that my focus was on the Japanese interpreters reinterpretation of what hed said rather than his own words questions were partly scripted it seemed. BUT despite speaking English his character and French indifference completely shone through not through his words but by how he was putting them across  I dont think I would have judged him as such a pompous knobend had he spoken in Estuary English for example.  And thats important I think since thats the persona he wants to put across presumably. In summary I think you lose a good chunk of your character identity and national identity if youre mimicking someone else.

6932413,0,t3_4abz5n,Posted this on the previous deleted thread Finally something I can actually contribute something to!gt Typical gym goers Are there as many old people there as there are climbing mountains and such? Are there going to be weird looks from people because Im a foreign woman at the weights?Lots of old people both male and female. Most gyms ie fitness clubs which happen to have a gym area... have lots of classes  ranging from pilates and boxfit to aquadance and ballet. So you meet all sorts. There are also younger people higher ratio of men in this group and even a few regular folks who actually talk to one another in all the places Ive been. There are a few foreigners at my gym so we dont get too many weird looks although I have been asked why I squat too low  you can squat heavier weight if you dont go so far down you know  . I dont see women in that area often sometimes they grab a minidumbbell and run off to do whatever you do with those but I doubt there would be any more looks for that than youd get other places youve been. gt What to expect in terms of equipment available cost and gym etiquette in Japan versus the West Are tight workout leggings on women inappropriate here? What about sleeveless shirts?It might be hard to find a squat rack. For that you might have to go to Golds or get lucky and find a nonchain powerlifting gym. Other than that there shouldnt be too much problem. Most places have resistance training machines although free weights are slightly less common and there is quite a range in availability. This depends on the chain but broadly speaking private places will be much more expensive than what you were used to.  is not unexpected. On the other hand you get a lot more  expect in addition to the classes pools sauna furo studio use. In the UK I was definitely paying less than that but on the other hand what I got for it was essentially some barbells and a shower. I was happy with that but its nice to have the extras if Im going to be paying more. Ward gyms are cheaper but will be less likely to have what you want. But you can always go along for a kengaku and see if it suits you  everywhere Ive been has been cool about that. Etiquette is an interesting question. In general it is much better than what I have been used to. People take care of the equipment wipe it down little towels at each piece of equipment how novel! and put it back! One thing I found amusing is that we have whiteboards to put down the times youll be using equipment for so you dont have to ask when the next bench will be free. Taking shoes off in the locker is a really nice upside. Really I think the only thing annoys me is when I see really random shit. Wear a belt for curls? Okay... Do oldschool leg presses in the Smith machine? Okay... In general people seem less informed than they were in the places I went in the UK and US. The concept of proper form isnt too popular.Regarding wear Ive seen everything from headtotoe tracksuits to shortshortshorts and tank tops for both men and women. Never seen anyone harassed or commented on for that. People do their own thing for the most part. gt Whether my limited Japanese will be a problem getting a membership Im still studying now and intend to bring a friend when I signup to help me with paperworkDepends heavily on the gym  not only the chain but also on the branch. A friend went to another branch of my gym and said it would have been impossible if he hadnt had a good level of Japanese N. At mine I was through in half an hour with my shoddy N but that was because the staff were cool and spent their time explaining things to me. If you bring a friend everything will be smooth. gt Any gym chains that I should know about and the upsides and downsides to eachGolds and Tipness seem pretty ubiquitous. Golds is basically the only thing that would qualify as what you might be used to as a powerlifting gym. Ive only been a few times and never got a membership. It seemed ok although there was more of a macho fail at lifting something too heavy make noise and look around proudly kind of attitude. Tipness is more chill but thinks that Smith machines are an acceptable alternative to a squat rack. People also use it for deadlifts shrugs benching and a bunch of other stuff that could be done anywhere else. Other people probably have better insight. I never really bothered shopping around. Like everything here gyms open late and close early. Oh well. They also tend to have one day a week off. Annoying. ,japanlife,d12452t,1,t5_2rg2o

7182421,0,t3_4dud4r,I think its really all explained by Japan being slow to change. Im sure there were similarly high rates of subscription in other major countries in the s its just they have hung on longer here and have been slower to move over to digital news although it is happening and seems to be speeding up over the last few years.I think the big reasons that the shift has been slower in Japan are digital strategy of media companies  While newspapers in the West were putting their entire papers online very early papers here are still mainly putting only short summaries. If you want the whole story you need to get the paper. While this is bad for consumers it seems like its been a better strategy than the freeforall seen in the West that has meant big media companies are struggling   Unityconformity is important  you want to be up to date on the same news stories as everyone else. If your boss or a client mentions something about xxx news story it would be more embarrassing than in the West if you didnt know about it.  You can ensure youre all reading the stuff by sticking to the major newspaper lines More people are in jobs that are more directly affected by the news. This is kind of tenuous but I kind of feel that since so much of the economy is based on exports that the basics of international events government policy changes and market movements are more important to peoples livelihoods whereas more Westerners are likely to view the use as kind of entertainment  just being interested in whats going on in the world   Longer work hours amp commuting on public transport You work long hours you dont have enough timedont get home early enough to watch the news on TV. Youre also commuting for a long time on a train with nothing to do.    Although I kind of hate this stereotype  Japanese dont like to make decisions for themselves. When you read a newspaper its almost completely passive. You start at the front and read to the back. Maybe you read some articles while skimming over the others but for the most part you consume the news that someone else has deemed important. Your only decision is deciding which paper to read. If you read news online you have to decide the paper then which section youre going to click through to and which article to click on. Its much more active and even more so if you choose to use an aggregation that displays a basically unlimited number of stories from every possible source in the world,japanlife,d1ukty5,8,t5_2rg2o

One company was mostly staffed by seemingly very talented foreign developers with a focus on the Japanese market for now but easily could have international appeal when they refine it and the other was detailing to me their roadmap including their first overseas release very soon really curious to see how that turns out.Im interested in seeing how some of the VCs I interviewed at will be doing in a few years if they dont manage to break out of the Japanese market.,japanlife,d1w1v42,5,t5_2rg2o

7765474,0,t3_4l3d7b,I made this account to reply to this comment.  Its a few days old so I hope that you see this.  I am by trade an engineer but I used to work in Commerical banking for  years.  I have tons of experience with franchising in the US and Canada relevant because of the chains you are trying to bring in.  Because I have represented a lot of the big chains in the past Ive done Burger King McDonalds KFC and chain restaurants as well I know that you pretty much have no chance of getting a decent franchise with no experience. No technical details are needed here but let me give you a real example.  One of my clients was a decently sized chain restaurant  mil in revenue and they had been approached by a wealthy businessman who wanted to open  stores in the Philippines.  When it comes to opening restaurants in new countries even if you can afford the domestic franchise fee there is  chance you will be given an opportunity unless you already own and operate a large number of similar franchises.  The guy was willing to put down mil USD per store about  more than the franchise fee but the company still said no. Its not just about having the money its about the company trusting you to run their brand efficiently without tarnishing their reputation.  Simply put there are easier ways to make money. ,japanlife,d3ovg8f,1,t5_2rg2o

Maybe a part of the reason shes hanging to a LDR.But as you said its the first hand experience and the future will show.

I paid only the deposit x month when I moved plus no cleaning fees when I move out.But yes moving is expensive.

Save money to visit Japan.  Maybe you could go to community college or technical school while you work try and find a skill that would have value in Japan if you still want to go there after visiting.  Even community colleges have study abroad programs although many are only a month it might be worth trying.  After  years at CC or technical school you can move on to  year you will probably need it to get any visa.

8770421,0,t3_505zft,Have been with my SO for about . years recently married and expecting our first child at the end of the year. We have only lived together in Japan he doesnt speak a lick of English and I jokingly call him Yamada Taro because he can be so very stereotypically Japanese. I was the first American person hed ever befriended let alone dated. And while in writing it sounds like a disaster waiting to happen so far things have worked out pretty well.Thats because the majority of our issues have not really been cultural in origin at all. The biggest stumbling block of our relationship? Im messy and hes neat. I think as you get older youll find that youre better at picking people who have values and world views that match yours regardless of your cultural backgrounds. I would never seriously date or marry a guy who expected women should stay at home and be housewivesmothers only or thought cheating was acceptable in certain cases or had no interest in childrearing or helping with housework Japanese American or otherwise. If youve really found a good guy who complements you well then the rest of the stuff personal or cultural can usually be overcome with good communication and perhaps more importantly the ability to be flexible and know which battles to pick. ,japanlife,d71yudi,5,t5_2rg2o

8927345,0,t1_d7kw0l5,Hey man yeah I just took a punt and got them on Amazon probably about  or  years ago. Maybe the latest models are slightly different. Basically there are  or  metal drivers in each speaker. Each speaker has a separate amp. Cables thick good quality transparent connect the LR speakers to the sub and theres a in pin Jack that you put into the headphone socket on your PC. The sub is powered and has a volume control which switches the system onoff if you push it. If you dont want any bass turn this knob all the way down.The good the sound is excellent. Clear gutsy and it will play very loud but also is really nice at low volume too. I have  Dalis in my main room and Q Acoustics in another for a  package the sound is really terrific even comparable to a hifi.The bad the volume buttons on the speaker need to be reset every time you turn on your PC. Its a minor thing but its irritating. Having the extra set of volume controls is a pain  one for your music software PC controls and speaker controls.Next if you want to listen to headphones you need to jack out the main speakers to jack in your headphones. If you connect via monitor that might not be an issue but I find it irritating. On a Mac you gotta reach around and kind of feel got the socket.Next there are no other inputs you cant plug in a CD player or jack in an iPod for example at least while the speakers are plugged into the PC.

8957269,0,t3_52wbo5,this was all over the course of October  my third trip to japan    I went to Fujisan for the first time and began my ascent up the advanced trailabandoned side from the train station at pm. stupid idea it was dark when I reached the second station and I had only a minimaglight. the thth forget which one station was not open like their website said so I pushed through and got to the summit about am. tired I went to the station where the busses go and a guy in a sleeping bag on top of a picnic table offered to drive me back into town as far as he could they close off the base of the mountain at night.    I went back to Tokyo loaded my stuff into a L backpack and began a walkingtrain journey to my hometowns sister city Nemuro in Hokkaido north easternmost point of japan. first night I ended up locked in some kind of castlepark place near Utsunomiya I was in there too late and had to climb over a wall to escape. went into town and went into a small bar I heard girls laughing in met two gorgeous waitresses my age and I had the whole place to myself until an ojisan came in and took his seat. he was friendly offered me lots of large strong drinks that I drank with enough gusto that he took me around town on a drinking tour that I dont remember at all. he let me stay at his home too which I vomited at wish I didnt remember that.... ended up sleeping on the ground outside a bicycle parking building near the station for a few hours after because I was so hung over. barfed on the train it had a small toilet room on the local train and a kind old lady watched my bag as she listened to me hurl up my guts.    I had made it up to somewhere near akita. it was a Tuesday I remember because everywhere was closed for lunch and I went into the first place that was open to fill up with beer. the owner and his wife were astounded at having a gaijin in their little bar and I got a lot of service the owner even ran to the supermarket to buy a tin of kujira because I mentioned it was on my toeat list. he ended up having a highschool buddy living in Nemuro my destination and he called him up and asked him to take me around. that really blew me away.    a while later i am on the last leg of the journey to Nemuro. There is a single car local train that goes there like once a day from Obihiro or something so it took a looooooong time and I arrived around midnight. Apparently there was a conference or something going on so all hotels were booked solid. it was about am before i decided to stop looking for a hotel in this small fishing town and i ended up lying down in some tall grass behind someones house. i must have made a little too much noise because a car pulls up and someone is wandering around with a flashlight. must have been police but i didnt make a move or a noise and after about min they wandered off and i could finally get some shuteye.    the next day i went to the station and called the Akita bar owners friend. he spoke no English at all and my Japanese was even more limited than it is now. we concluded our talk and i was sure it didnt work out but a guy appeared min later calling my name. we spent the day together as he drove me around Nemuro is not a walking town then afterward we drank a lot. turns out he had taken the day off from work to escort me a complete stranger around his town. that really stuck with me.    did some other weird stuff during that trip like making drinking buddies with some random Hokkudai professors and thinking i was part of the ouendan at a college football game but this post is long enough...,japanlife,d7oj2qd,19,t5_2rg2o

There are a lot of formatprotocols that allow lossless data transfer whereas jack headphone are prone to such issues as they are fully analog. Dont like the new Apple Bluetooth headphone? Buy better for cheaper. Both on sound quality and battery duration aspects.  Moreover its been several years that Apple push wireless communication between its devices. And keeping the analog jack is a nonsense just like it is for computers USB headsets consolesHDMI etc. because it is more efficient to go full numeric for data transfer and use the least amount of analog possible.

The second time the screw threads were stripped so the headphones basically fell apart after wearing them for two minutes. They fixed it for free though. They may not have the cable you want in stock so depending on what headphones you have it might be worth it to actually buy a new pair of headphones used and either use them as a replacement or for parts. I got an AHD set used from them both for the cable and the headband since the D one I have was damaged in places and I still have the D if I ever need a backup.

10646580,0,t3_5scpf7,My oldest beat the crap out of a kid a week before middle school ended.  Teachers confided in my wife that the kid was a bully and probably wasnt expecting my kid to fight back and had failed to get into a high school so he was about to enter the workforce and that confidentially they were happy someone had let this kid have it.  Fortunately he didnt hurt him to badly or hed have been forced to sit out middle school graduation. My middle kid has gotten in probably half a dozen fights mostly because he doesnt take teasing well and once the kids figured it out some of them had to learn a painful lesson.  The worst was a girl he popped.  That one he got to go apologize for and spend a few days at home. There was one kid who smacked him in the back of his head and knocked his glasses off  that one was fun because his parents wanted compensation money and we told them wed pay them after they paid for new glasses.So in short expect to have the teacher and school contact you.  Expect to have to apologize and for the kid to apologize.  Blah blah blah they generally look at it as kids will be kids.,japanlife,dde42p1,32,t5_2rg2o

Usually its an open account that your purchases are made against paid from and you have to produce all receipts to show they are related to the building of the house.  Once completed the account is turned into the loan that you start paying back.gt A house that costs  man to build will be worth  man maybe less the minute its finished. That doesnt prevent you from getting a loan for  man to build it. Sure as long as you throw out those pesky things called LTV numbers that all banks use...

I get that you really wanted to check out Japan but for fucks sake have some humility and consider the fact that you were not a good teacher when you started. Nobody is a good anything when they start and I guarantee you your degree is not in teaching.

All perks gone bonus based on company performance overtime nonincluded but banned for cost cutting which means you have to do service zangyou.While the contract salary could be fully negotiated with reference to my skills the seishain salary was on a rigid agebased scale negotiated with the union.
