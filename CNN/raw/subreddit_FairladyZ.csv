Its not a very rare car at all and there are plenty of them to go around. The only rare ones would be the SS shiro special from . ,FairladyZ,cff5a48,2,t5_2t4bi

5800094,0,t1_cwo9rae,The turbod z has so many block problems that people rarely bother with owning them anymore. If they do get them theres usually an LS swap rendering them nonoriginal. Its an already difficult engine to work on in terms of space and cramming the turbochargers into the bay usually asks for more issues. And at this age with the wiring and hoses hoses being so brittle the overall cost of restoration is extravagant. I had a natural aspirated fairladyZ  and with the things I needed to repair brakes transmission intake exhaust tyres and more on that I couldnt imagine the headache associated with a turbo version. ,FairladyZ,cxg21xh,1,t5_2t4bi
8331178,0,t3_4tjm1q,There is a massive difference in comfort level between a z and a modern car.  A z is more mechanical more visceral and a hell of a lot less safe in an accident.  If you and anyone you date can handle it go for it.  Personally I would drive one first and then decide you want to live that everyday.,FairladyZ,d5iyaz8,1,t5_2t4bi
8632121,0,t1_d6jzd8q,When it comes to auction level type cars autos dont sell for as much as a manual version when you compare two similar cars conditionmileage. When somebody is actively looking for a old sports car like a Z they tend to want the manuals for that sporty drive. That goes for almost all manufacturers sports cars really. I get that modern cars come with flappy paddles and clutchless shifting like my mothers smg auto trans in her Z and thats all well and good but you ask any real driving enthusiast which transmission they would rather have in any car and its more than likely going to be a manual. As far as why they are cheaper from a financial standpoint my guess would be that nobody really wants them so they just end up selling them for less to get rid of them. Leave the fancy flappy paddles and sequential shifting for the racetrack learn to drive a manual like a proper car enthusiast I say! ,FairladyZ,d6kme1z,1,t5_2t4bi
