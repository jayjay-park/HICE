3883149,0,t3_34lphq,I would gladly participate and answer peoples questions on the forums if I could but my understanding of Haxe and HaxeFlixel is limited so I dont usually reply or attempt to answer afraid of misleading people.I agree with the point its a chicken and egg thing. I think the problem isnt that people ignore you but rather there arent enough people who are interested in the language or capable enough to answer you. ,haxeflixel,cqywuqi,1,t5_2xrpu
