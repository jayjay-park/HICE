2246293,0,t1_clh2lsj,Maybe.. I have to say Iam getting mixed feelings when I see hem on shows lately. He talks to much about game Design as if he has invented it when he is just stating fairly obvious points most of the time. Also we all have seen him grow into what he is right now and stood behind him as we all supported him and his channels. We subscribed and looked every time his show was airing etc. Is it that hard to do something your loyal fanbase loves just for one day on Halloween? I just dont feel the connection anymore when I watch him. Its just him in his own cloud. Maybe Iam overreacting but only the time I find it fun and informative is when he is doing Mostly Walking with two other great people.,day9,clpcuv1,1,t5_2rvng

It would help to know if this is before or after that fix and for me to see the exact embed code being used. Screenshots help as well. Thanks!,day9,d02d2px,2,t5_2rvng

9384257,0,t1_d7yakn2,I dont understand your comment. He still plays LOTS of games and he certainly talks alot about hearthstone strategy and how to play on his dailies. Just because he isnt telling you about how to be a better starcraft player doesnt mean his mantra doesnt ring true. Also I love amiyuys interpretation. ,day9,d95iqwk,1,t5_2rvng
9815295,0,t1_damxt9y,Early in the game he stole a Vilefin Inquisitor and commented that it could counter Anyfin Can Happen if he just made a ton of little  murlocs since Anyfin resurrects ANY dead murlocs including your opponents. Hilariously when Anyfin eventually was played it returned  little silly murlocs instead of any of the ones the opponent planned to summon so instead of instantly killing Sean he just had a board full of adorable s. Also as a kicker the sound it made was pretty funny.,day9,damy8ku,11,t5_2rvng
