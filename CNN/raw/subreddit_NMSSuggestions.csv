11234848,0,t1_df4j21b,I did this for the first time today and was pretty impressed at how useful it was. The only downside is the cost. Back when you could chop resonators out of crashed ships this would be NBD but needing to carrying around dynamic resonators and not getting ANY kind of refund for removing it when youre done is pretty steep. If I got the resources back when I removed the thing then it would be great. At LEAST get the resonator back.OPs post still makes me feel like their solution is a better one. The last thing this game needs is more grinding. So if I have to spend an hour to build a bay in my freighter to drop exos I would much rather do that.,NMSSuggestions,df5gdho,1,t5_3g2ou

Also seems to me no big change to implement this.Addition to quick menu I would like the buttons to be better readable white on yellow iron is very hard to read andor make them a little bigger in quick menu  because it should work quick a fast recognize is necessary.,NMSSuggestions,dgqiu28,1,t5_3g2ou
