For example many animals there are endangered if one of them is injured they will be treated by specialists oftentimes this does result in euthanasia if the wounds are severe. gtLastly the hyena probably either attacked the lion tried stealing the lions catch andor got too close Very unlikely. Lions are not the majestic kings that disney would have you believe they are ruthless predators. In fact its much more likely for Lions to usurp a hyena kill than vice versa and lions are much more likely to attack and kill hyenas than the other way around. Its much more likely that a lion saw the young male hyena on his own and attacked him to kill competition.,natureismetal,d0vtwsb,0,t5_324zi

They keep finding their way into the goanna pen and nothing that ends up in there leaves in one piece.Monitor lizards are actually very lovely animals they actually have many similarities with cats.

7981029,0,t1_d4d4oax,gt The term fish is a convenient term used to refer to diverse aquatic organisms such as lampreys sharks coelacanths SEEluhkanths and rayfinned fishes  but it is not a taxonomic group that would be used in a phylogenetic classification scheme as vertebrates or hominids is. Thats because phylogenetic taxonomic groups must be clades. A clade is a group that includes all the descendents of a common ancestor and that ancestor and all the different organisms that we think of as fish dont form a clade. Look at the phylogeny here. Almost everything you see on this phylogeny is a fish  with one exception. The lobefinned lineage technically called the Sarcopterygii sarKOPtuhRIJeeeye includes both the lobefinned fish and fourlegged vertebrates like frogs dinosaurs bats and us humans! Because this nonfish lineage is nested within a bunch of fish on the tree of life the fish do not form a clade.Now do you see why so many people were arguing with you?

8537094,0,t1_d685z5h,I havent worked with big cats personally but I have friends in veterinary and animal training services. Ive been paying attention to animal behavior analysis body language social cues etc. Certain things in cats especially the movement patternspeed of the ears or tail can indicate very specific behaviors or responses. Someone who has spent a lot of time with just house cats should be able to recognize from the footage that this cat was having a prey type response the same way that it would with a little rolling ball. Thats just visual cues. I didnt watch the full video but I saw someone mention that the kids crying is what piqued the cats interest. This is another type of stimulus that a trainer should be watching for beforehand so that he can stop a little attack like this before it starts. Honestly once you bring the cat out to that spot and you are sitting there your options to control a cat that size are really limited. You can restrict the cat with a leash and grab its mouth the way he did but lots of times it doesnt take much to set an animal off... so even being proactive could make the situation worse because if that cat starts flipping shit you are going to need a tazer or a tranq and people are going to get hurt.Wild animals arent pets. Im not even going to list all the tiger performers that have been killed by their act. You can be good with that cat for  years and one day... something little like the wrong eye contact body contact overstimulus and you are fucking dead.Clutching a little baby from the jaws of a lion with that giant DO IT FAGGOT smile.

They are closer to wolves in terms of stamina.You see the reason ectothermic species tire fast is not due to being ectothermic but due to breathing issues. Look at lizardstheir legs are to the side and restrain the rib cage during a run preventing breathing.Monitor lizards including dragons have a workarounda system of muscles that pumps airso they dont have that issue. They dont just sprint they can make marathon runs. And endotherms are not necessarily good at distance runningcats are horrible at it. The idea metabolism plays a role in stamina is pretty outdated and based on the same prejudices that lead into myths of how mammals are somehow superior.Its breathing not metabolism that affects stamina. read the part on how some ectotherms avoid this issueSource from Wiki you have to subscribe to read the full articleSource  pg .

They slash through opponents like cutting through water.Edit obviously they dont slice their fish prey during skimming however when used on something that doesnt get pushed by their beak they will puncture it.,natureismetal,dbevyia,134,t5_324zi

10149551,0,t1_dbudxwo,Thats great!  Do lots of reading its one of those things that is worth buying a book on but this also looks good SuppliesBuy everything ahead of time once you have your package bees you will need to be ready to care for them.Hive tool A Veil Baggy pants a baggy jacket or sweater leather gloves.Duct tape to seal sleeves hems and pant legs.A smoker Do not burn off the bees wings!A dustpan brush or an actual bee brush.There is a whole host of things you can buy to process your harvested frames but that entirely depends on what you want to do with your honey.Tight thin jeans can be stung through so wear either baggy pants or wear sweatpants underneath jeans. Even if you arent allergic remember that getting stung five or six times still hurts a lot and can turn a happy beekeeping session into a torture session. Location locationMake sure you are abiding by zoning rules depending on where you live its considered polite to check with any nearby neighbors to ask if they are allergic.The bees will need a fairly large open space in from of the hive for take off and landing roughly  meters of open air space in front of the hive is what my bees tended to occupy when they came in to land more is probably better.Protect the bees from animals by putting in a mouse guard during cold months and surrounding the hive with electric fencing make sure it is both skunk and bear proof depending on where you live.  Place the hive in a spot that gets sun early in the morning.MaintenanceharvestingThe bees by default only sting when they or their hive is in mortal danger. So to handle them I suggest getting a dustpan brush to move them off of frames when you are inspecting or harvesting frames. The brush is actually more to prevent damage to the bees than to prevent yourself from getting stung. Check on the hive every week and inspect the corpses in the graveyard closely for signs of mites. If the dead bees out front have frayed wings then its a sign of natural death from old age. Im sure there are many other signs to look for here reading will help with that.When your hive has grown considerably there is a chance that a swarm will form and you will lose thousands of your bees! This is another thing to read up on later. There will be a lot of dead bees in front of any large hive its the result of the workers disposing of their dead sisters. And to wrap up remember that losing a hive is not the end of the world. I lost one hive to colony collapse disorder and another to a bear attack because my fence was not strong enough. Sometimes a hive will die and you cant do anything about it but you can do your best to take care of them! I hope to one day resume beekeeping when I have a house of my own ,natureismetal,dbuhlxr,8,t5_324zi

I was looking at one of them with an eagle perched on it when suddenly it got excited and then little eagle offspring heads popped up and were excited too.

10618871,0,t1_ddb8vq8,Yeah I initially had this reaction too.  However I must admit that I definitely shy away from any dog or canine creature being hurtkilled.  I have dogs and it just feels a bit worse I guess.  If you keep watching he admits that these animals are his favorite etc but also these dogs are quite endangered  so any death is amplified in terms of the species long term success.  The guide is a  year veteran on safari so hes seen MUCH more shit that any of us will ever see but it doesnt mean that he cant feel bad about certain things happening during his drives.  Theres a vid I saw on their twitter which had a leopard killing what looked to be some type of basset hound or something he was a bit apologetic for lack of a better word but certainly composed.  ,natureismetal,ddb98kw,3,t5_324zi

Lets recap!Somebody  said the animal is sufferingSomebody  said its going to die anyway who caresSomebody  said well were all going to die anyway so maybe that doesnt help when considering the nature of sufferingThen you said  not to Somebody  but to Somebody   the animal isnt suffering and you have to prove that it is or else grrrrrNow see your comment would have made sense if you were responding to Somebody . But you werent silly you were responding to Somebody ! But Somebody  was simply making the very excellent point that the animals ultimate fate  considered only as broadly as Somebody  considered it  shouldnt factor in to our consideration of whether or not it matters IF the animal is or isnt suffering. So you sort of whiffed on the exchange you see.But dont worry! Dont fret!

Following that logic shouldnt they be faster? Theyre not because they dont have the same streamlined shape as a diving peregrine falcon. Once you start a dive no amount of initial speed helps you if the shape of the airfoil body induces drag.,natureismetal,dgexlvo,1,t5_324zi

Youre actually saying that there is no reason to believe that a penguin wouldnt grasp the gravity of the situation? You think its reasonable to just assume from the getgo that this thing is virtually equivalent to a human?Look Im not saying that I know if or what that penguin was thinking or feeling. It probably was experiencing some kind of negative emotion sure. But this is a creature that evolved a lifestyle completely different from humans in an environment completely different from humans. And this is of course a bird a creature whose ancestors diverged from the ancestors of not only humans but all mammals a very very very long time ago.

Thus Ive come to the conclusion that it is now too big to fit into any fishes mouth to replace their tongue which is why its forced to hunt. However if there was an animal that measured up in terms of size then yes this thing would eat their tongue and then replace it acting as a parasitic prosthetic.  ...all in theory of course.,natureismetal,dgxkz3j,7,t5_324zi
11804460,0,t1_dgy2gtg,Ive found small mud catfish on the ground the next day when my dad used to run a fishing marina. They never got very big and people found them a nuisance so they would throw them into the woodsup on shore when they catch them. They would be alive the next day on the ground and you could throw em back in the water and they would swim away. Catfish are pretty tough fish. edit the same types of people that did this to the fish would see a northern brown water snake and start yelling water moccasin at the top of their lungs and the whole family starts throwing rocks in the water at it trying to kill it.,natureismetal,dgy2rfz,27,t5_324zi
