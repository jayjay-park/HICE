3326228,0,t1_cp76xkv,Thats an absolutely great question. I dont think anyone truly knows. I would expect that in some way it must be connected to the unusual and mystical properties of the Neath itself.There are many things in the Neath that by Surface Standards are very wrong. For instance the dead do not like to stay dead. In this way I feel the light of the Neath is something entirely unique to the qualities of the Neath.I think it was already clear that these are the colors of the Neath and they may only be found here but that is not what im trying to get at. What I mean to propose is thisThe colors come from the Neath itself.  There is a certain otherworldly nature to the Neath and with that different rules for how physical nature acts. Thus the way that light interacts down in the Neath may not be the same way light interacts on the Surface. And it may be in those interactions with places and objects of the Neath which cause the propagation of these esoteric colors.I dont think its necessarily the moonish light and the false stars that create these colors although it may in fact turn out to be but the specific nature of the Neath that causes them.,fallenlondon,cp7f1oh,4,t5_2uexp

4550907,0,t1_ct46spg,Its generally best to buy equipment hats clothes weapons etc at about your current level of affordability. At your level I think you could be looking to buy a bunch of items that give you  to a stat edit and a couple of the cheaper s too. Id generally do that if theres a particular opportunity come up where the numbers arent looking good and you really want to do well on it. The drawback to selling things at the Bazaar is that theyre x as expensive to buy back if you want them later but on the flip side as your skills raise so does the amount of cash youre earning. So dont be afraid to sell things that you dont know a current use for. Youll end up with quite a lot of the basic items that sell for p each Nevercold Brass Whispered Hint Rostygold MoonPearls and so on. Its sensible to keep a certain amount of those and sell surplus at your level you might want to hang on to  and sell anything over that.

The whole final level was one of my absolute favourite story conclusions in terms of how everything wraps up  your relationship with your companions the hints of your past lives throughout the game and of course the dialogue with the final boss.

You do some research yourself and ask at least four different people in various parts of the city about details and then you break the lock which is also something not everybody could do. And then your in a library. The books would be nothing special to most people. They are to you because you have a lot of background information.

A visit  Criminals faction card  Connection pet or Renown  card  cheery man card . ruthless henchman card . alluring accomplice card . gang of hoodlums  the next victim.So even if your connection pet is something else and you favored the constable you can have . favor cards in your deck or . if you want to avoid the conflict card and dont have the lodging or dont have annoyance to jac of smiles.However while in the tomb colonies the deck is much smaller and you have  cards in lt that give favors so those might actually be easier to grind. I know I have  of those which is my secondhighest renown only falling to criminals. However youll need to actively seek out their favor they only have  card in london not counting connection pets. . if you manipulate airs and take His contacts in the tomb colonies every time you draw a drink with the cheery man but that requires siding with the cheery man. It still gives a favor though.Docks has the best pureaction grind in london with  actions per favor on an average and that number goes down with the  chance per favor of another favor for one more action pruning the average to about  actions per favor. Docks only has one certain card but it has another from the mayor at the moment and with the companion you can get that number to three.Criminals can be brute forced with echoes though which nothing else can in newgate you can get one favor per skyglass knife given to the fence. An absurd number of trips but actually highly viable if you dont care about notability or absolution ablution.aluring accomplice and ruthless henchman adds a discardable but mostly terrible conflict card to their deck. Since ruthless henchman offers more cards if youre going to choose one to not have I suggest the accomplice.,fallenlondon,d9vwmbq,2,t5_2uexp
