8663954,0,t3_4yh4x3,I do get why theyre disliked and I think bootlegs can be severely misused ... however I have watched the Hamilton bootleg on numerous occasions and showed it to several friends.I was fortunate enough to travel to NYC from the UK and see Hamilton. I got a holiday out of it but it cost me  and we got tickets months in advance before the show hit the astronomical levels it has now hit. Im never going to be able to repeat that experience. However watching the bootleg lets me revisit it several times over. Theyve had my money and now Im lucky enough to repeat watching from the comfort of my own living room. Yes the quality is no where near as special but its still nice.Equally Ive been able to watch the bootleg with several UK friends who had either heard of the musical or heard me raving about it... They now all want to go see it when it comes to the UK. Several have bought the album and  have bought Hamiltone. I think I have a current total of  converts so far so thats a further  UK ticket sales thanks to the bootleg being available.I think bootlegs are a negative if they stop people seeing the show because theyve relied on seeing a bootleg... but if the bootleg inspires more people to see the show and buy more of the merchandise because they want to experience the genius in real life than thats a positive? If they ever release the professionally filmed version then they can have my money in a flash and I will turn my loyalties over to it in an instant. ,hamiltonmusical,d6om249,12,t5_392ob

8746537,0,t3_4zupy7,I saw a video of a QampA with Miranda where he was asked about the possibility that Hamilton may have committed suicide by proxy during the duel and Miranda said that he ultimately couldnt decide what Hamilton was thinking so instead Miranda focused on Hamiltons ambivalence on the idea that Hamilton was torn between living and dying and to leave it ambiguous which of those he chose. Alexander Hamiltons life characterized by decisive action for good and for ill ends as a result of an uncharacteristic moment of indecision on his part and also because Aaron Burr will no longer wait for it as he has previously.As to the line I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory thats something he sang in My Shot and Yorktown as well when he was a young man eager to make a life for himself. He saw his mother die from the same sickness that could easily have killed him saw who knows how many lives ended by that hurricane that devastated his town. I never thought Id live past twenty. Where I come from some see half as many. The man knew death intimately had seen it up close so it was more a memory to him than something abstract that awaited him in his future. This fuels his ambition and his boldness because hes alive despite the odds against him. So to my mind as hes preparing for the duel his singing that line again indicates as ever that he has no fear of death not that hes abandoned life.,hamiltonmusical,d6yyz0i,12,t5_392ob

They do complicated choreography while singing and just add so much to the show.I have to say I was not overly impressed with Lexi Lawsons performance. It was just kind of meh for me. It wasnt as smooth or powerful as Phillipas so maybe I just prefer Phillipas voice? Chris has an amazing voice and I think Anthony stole the spotlight for me whenever he was onstage.

But they are far more talented than them. And the choreography was adjusted as needed for the roles they played. Lupone sure as hell did not do the same  minute tap solo at the end of Anything Goes that Sutton Foster did. It doesnt mean that Lupone couldnt play the role. There are roles that require you to be a slender dancerbody type. But there are many roles that dont. And those roles normally get filled by men in drag skinny women in fat suits or just skinny women.

With the line about Reynolds destroying Ham.s career.
