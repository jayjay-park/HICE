1601368,0,t1_cjh0o38,Im not sure how the capsules would work but Id imagine them either A as giant rifts in space that you have to find and enter maybe they only open up at strange times and locations adding to the mystery of them or B Tiny handheld artifacts left behind by some species to be learned about as the story progresses maybe even as a sidequest sort of thing The capsules would have some way of linking between eachother from the inside through either in the case of A more rifts in space in the capsule or B some sort of teleportation magic or something not sure on that one,gamedev_lair,cjh0s5c,1,t5_32v6q
