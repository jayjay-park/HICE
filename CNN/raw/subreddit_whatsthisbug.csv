295989,0,t3_1xcywd,Cockroach. Maybe an oriental or wood. Cannot really tell from this pic.Best treat your house now before you get so infested it will require industrial grade materials. Boric acid and the diatomaceous earth will only work while the problem is small. Do NOT use a fogger. We have found the best way to treat is to get some genetic mutation traps that prevents adults from breeding and some DuPont Advion roach bait traps. They love cardboard btw. They also love electronics. We had an infestation in our living roomkitchen and they colonized the computers. Yes it was truly awful Also make sure to take out the trash constantly and leave out no standing water. That is one of the things that draws a roach out of hiding in a kitchen. I know you think they are coming in from the drains but they probably came in some boxes or papers. The egg casing might have been on something you brought into the house and they hatched out. Ours came from our exroomie who didnt clean worth a flip. We are a generally clean home but they got into the walls and exroomies dog food container nightmare of epic levelsAlso make sure to clean up after the roaches.

Sprinkle it around the perimeter of every room and in the backs of cabinets and any recessed spaces. This will eventually kill them. Make sure you get caulk and seal up any little gaps near cabinets and walls because this is probably where they are sneaking in. You can also mix the boric acid powder with honey and put it into a bottle cap and set those around the place. There are recipes for that stuff all over the place online.

Their common name is taken from the round shape of this typical web and the taxon was formerly also referred to as the Orbiculariae.gtOrbweavers have eight similar eyes hairy or spiny legs and no stridulating organs. The Araneidae family is cosmopolitan including many wellknown large or brightly colored garden spiders. The  species in  genera worldwide make Araneidae the thirdlargest family of spiders known behind Salticidae and Linyphiidae  The orbweavers include over  species and make up about  of spider diversity. gtHowever orbwebs are also produced by members of other families. The large golden orbweavers Nephilidae and the longjawed orb weavers Tetragnathidae were formerly included in the Araneidae they are indeed closely related to them being part of superfamily Araneoidea Their webs are similar to those of the typical orbweavers but tend to be less sophisticated and often have an irregular instead of a neat spiral arrangement of the preycapturing threads. The cribellate or hackled orbweavers Uloboridae belong to a distinct superfamily of the suborder Araneomorphae their webs are often very sophisticated but Uloboridae use neither venom to kill their prey nor sticky threads in their web and probably evolved the orb structure independently. Uloboridae are cribellate and their threads can be recognized by the fuzzy and dull appearance which captures prey by a velcro mechanism.gtgtImage iInteresting Nuctenea umbratica | Golden silk orbweaver | Araneus quadratus Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcgzll oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecgzll.

Im assuming the real issue is a concrete house built in very wet soil and surroundings like a damp hillside. Then again Im unfamiliar with German construction but it still sounds odd to me. EDIT I found this passage on a forum about concrete houses. I dont know what theyre doing in Germany but theyre not doing it right if this is the caseI lived in a stone and concrete house in Germany and I can tell you that the part that I bolded claiming no bugs or mildew is just not the case everywhere. The climate has to be conducive to building materials or viceversa.We constantly had to air out the house in the winter at least  times a day every day. If we didnt we had mold issues in the bedrooms and the bathrooms. The house could not breathe. We had just as many insects ants spiders bees moths mosquitoes etc. as in any wood house Ive ever lived in.Rodents dont need much space to get in. There were several documented cases of rats coming in through the toilets.Regarding water we had to replace half of the basement floor due to water damage. We constantly had moist walls which we couldnt tile over to finish the bathroom in the basement. The water did not flow away from the house properly and insted stood there so there were several spots in the basement where you could see water marks.,whatsthisbug,cho19ds,1,t5_2s3bw

Germans will happily squat in your home with no plans of leaving so once established theyre best left to the pros. Theyre also a lot harder to keep out since theyre smaller squishier and much more motivated to get in. Again as with most household bug pests the cleaner you keep your place especially the kitchen the better.

Unlike more familiar blow flies such as the bluebottle genus Phormia they do not present a health hazard because they do not lay eggs in human food. They are strictly parasitic on earthworms the females lay their eggs near earthworm burrows and the larvae then infest the worms. However the flies are a nuisance when the adults emerge in the late summer or autumn they enter houses to hibernate often in large numbers they are difficult to eradicate because they favour inaccessible spaces such as roof and wall cavities. They are often seen on windows of littleused rooms.

4300045,0,t3_3a8glf,Its just a Cellar Spider commonly known as a Daddy Long Legs though thats quite a regional term it shares with two other critters.The family is Pholcidae. Its probably a Pholcus phalangioides the species most associated with the daddylonglegs label or a related. Possibly one of the most common spiders in the world certainly one of the most commonly encountered by humans. Also quite probably the least harmful spider you could possibly encounter.Its also the subject of a lot of myths. One is that they have the most potent venom of any spiders but cannot pierce human skin. This is of course completely horse shit. Their venom is not particularly potent but making them bite is near impossible. ,whatsthisbug,csac83t,3,t5_2s3bw

Not sure if it is the result of a scuffle accident or just some local mutation. For tailless whipscorpions amblypygid species youd be looking for the absence of an opposing leg segment the forms a claw  it would just have a sort of spiked scoop or club held in a laterigrade manner arms akimbo.  It would also be somewhat flattened.Unlike amblypygid specimens this one should be given just a tiny bit of space because it can pinch you if it decides youre a threat  although its not likely to do so.  Not sure what the implications are of losing its tail but a tailed specimen could also spray you with a vinegarsmelling acetic acid which is irritating.

Others are more than willing to be your new roommate  and bring their friends and relations along for the ride. A more reasonable approach would be to clean thoroughly eliminate potential food sources and set out sticky traps to determine the extent of the infestation. This might be a stray that wandered in on its own  but if not then your friend could try using bait stations and boric acid to control them. More info here,whatsthisbug,cugv40s,1,t5_2s3bw

5273393,0,t1_cvkl0p3,Hmm... it depends on what kind of stuff you want to find. Most spiders are nocturnal so if you go out at night and look around trees and plants you should have no trouble finding them. You can put one in an old pill vial and then photograph it the next day when theres good lighting. Also at night you can see wolf spiders by the reflection of a flashlight in their eyes as a green glint.Most of it is just being observant though. Look closely at flowers and you might see a crab spider. Check the sides of buildings and you might find a jumper. Look in crevices for the telltale webs of the family Agelenidae Its all about looking closely at your environment wherever you go.One of the issues though is that now that its getting colder the number of spiders youll find will be lower.,whatsthisbug,cvlqhsu,2,t5_2s3bw

When people get bitten it is usually because the person has initiated contact with the spider  such as if they have stuck their fingers into the web or the spider has become trapped between the persons skin and their bedding or clothing.

7302990,0,t1_d2892z8,gt Apparently its all my fault and I just have to deal with itYour parents are twats. gtReally dont know what to doEverything that can be put in a dryer do so. High heat for at least  minutes to kill them. Keep everything thats been clean that way SEPARATE from items not heat treated or sprayed. Clean plastic storage tote garbage bags just not back into dressers ect until they can be sprayed. Get bedbug spray. Fleatick spray can be used too as the main ingredients are the same. Its almost always gonna be a pyrethrin such as deltamethrin or phenothrin or cyfluthrin. Use it on your bed spring box and mattress until its damp to the touch but not soaking wet. When its dry you can put bedsheets back on. Consider getting a protective mattress cover like the kind that seal for storage. Itll  keep the bedbugs that are in the mattress in and once the spray has finally killed them or the fkers starve to death which takes about three months you can take it off. Use that spray on anything with cloth or linen covers that cant be heat treated in the dryer. Same thing no touchy till its dry.Vacuum the absolute fuck out of your place.  Dont skimp corners and under furniture. Even if its not full empty the vacuum bag or cup outside into a garbage bag and throw it out. Eggs hatch roughly every two weeks so you can get the ones that hatch before they can lay more eggs by vacuuming at least weekly. Dont forget to take it outside and empty it you can reinfest yourself with a vacuum like that. You said its been going on and off. It might be possible that youre picking up hitchhikers off someplace that has them and isnt treated. Other friends houses parents house etc. Be super cautious about anything you bring into your home that is second hand or gifted. Heat treat it or stick it in your freezer over night if you can. Keep up the treatments vacuuming cleaning weekly. You should see improvements in a few months. Keep it up for at least six.Edit added in the names of the insecticides used.  ,whatsthisbug,d28au6z,255,t5_2s3bw

11219640,0,t1_df3q5z6,Okay thanks! Like I said its definitely a young cockroach species is a bit harder to determine. It could be an American cockroach which is American only in name since its imported. The genus page on Periplaneta has some guidelines to help you ID different members of the genus if youre curious but American cockroach nymphs are pretty nondescript in appearance see this pic for example. But again Im not sure on the species.On the plus side I can guarantee its not a German cockroach since those have distinctive markings at any stage of their lives.,whatsthisbug,df3qdck,3,t5_2s3bw

Unfortunately Im not familiar with the larvae of all Coccinella species for example I dont know how C. magnifica and C. hieroglyphica look. But both species are unlikely the first one occurs in heathlands the second one in heathlands and peat bogs. I think the coloration present in this specimen is characteristic for C. septempunctata.
