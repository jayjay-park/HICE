With that said to answer your questions If something sells online it will subtract the inventory away but will that purchase show up in the POSs sales page or just the websites sales page?Shopifys reporting can show you sales totals for just the website just the POS or a combined total. Do you use the bar code scannerlabel printer? How is that? I cant seem to find much info on that. Where do you make the bar codes?We have an app that ties the Shopify admin to a Dymo LabelWriter for creating barcodes. From their youll connect a scanner to your iPad via Bluetooth and when you scan barcodes it adds the products to the cart. Is there anything you wish you knew about Shopify POS before you signed up for it?This is a question probably better directed to current users. Anything that is negative about it?It doesnt let you track inventory in multiple locations  if youre a singlelocation boutique it works beautifully but if youre a chain there are challenges involved in getting it up and running. Not impossible but additional work and expense. I currently have the month plan with Shopify if I got the POS will it show any sales info on the POS most bought item popular time of dayweek etc.? The month plan doesnt for the website.On our Basic plan you can export your data to CSV to determine that information  the export will include information on online vs. POS if you need to separate each out.

603384,0,t3_211o39,I own a homemade ice cream shop about to enter its st season Im happy to help with questions you may have.  Personally I would recommend the ice cream business though we do yogurt and soft serve too.  The yogurt business seems to boom and bust while ice cream has always been a constant.  We make it ourselves which has created a niche for us and helped us develop our brand fairly successfully.  Then again I am of course biased.I will say some of the questions you are asking seem to be putting the cart before the horse.  A solid business plan is crucial.  Use friends and family as a sounding board to help determine whether or not they think youve got a viable idea.  Determine if youre interested in working  hour weeks all the time.  Only you can make sure the business is run exactly how you want it to be and that means youre at the shop much of the time its open.  Weve had hundreds of employees some for eight to ten years.  Without regular development and critique unwatched employees let the business flounder. If youre still on board here are the answers to your questionsI wouldnt recommend getting your MBA.  It seems like overkillI have a bachelors in English thats it.  Helps me write emails and press releases.  I would recommend getting a entry level grasp on accounting.  Youll want to understand how to read a PampL statement how to comfortably balance a checkbook account for expenses vs. profit margins and take care of payroll.  And of course determine if opening a business makes good financial sense for you.The storefront is perhaps one of the most important aspects.  We work in the impulse purchase business and if youre hidden away youre lost.  Good quick parking is crucial.  We are located on a busy street with street parking and a parking lot adjacent to a library childrens programs and multiple restaurants.  Id recommend checking out  for equipment.  Google restaurant food distribution and find a distributor that can deliver locally.There is obviously a ton more that goes into it.  Good luck with your search.,smallbusiness,cg8uwk5,8,t5_2qr34

Then whenever a todo item comes up I group them under one of these objectives. But here is the key if a todo item does not fit within any objective group  I throw it out and move on.

862204,0,t1_ch1v970,On mixing analytics and media I was specifically speaking to situations where the CTNs were to be used for traffic sources outside of YP as well.  If someone is ONLY using call tracking on YP properties and ONLY for impressions driven by YP media spend that is a slightly different scenario.  However if they are doing call tracking anywhere else that is really stupid to fragment their data unless they are redirecting those calls from YP into their other system.A perfect example of the point system sucking btw was when I realized that it was more costeffective to purchase the video ad unit even though I had no videos to run and would not use the placement just to get the points to boost the position of my other placements compared to other options.  Ridiculous.No offense to you specifically but part of the reason I also would love to see it go programmatic is to take the sales people out of the equation.  Ad sales reps are the bane of my existence.  Ive met perhaps a small handful in my entire career that I would say honestly worked to partner with me and give a fair deal and Ive dealt with MANY being a key decision maker for large ad budgets both agency and clientside.  The sales person model is old and dying and the sooner the better.  If there is a negotiation with a salesperson that means there is less transparency in the model than there could be and it also likely means there are inflated costs.Again not knocking you specifically but it is a large part of the benefit that has been realized with RTB.Re the articleI read it when it came out originally.  It fails to address quality of calls in a sufficient manner and also fails to address the attribution piece of the puzzle.  Swooping in to claim the last touch point that would have occurred anyway and counting it as a success doesnt count.  Would love to see the distribution between branded vs. nonbranded queries for both AdWords and YP in that study...I think that would be quite telling.  The comments below the article are pretty spot on as well.One of my favoritesgt The problem with the cost per call model is that it doesnt take into account customer service calls.  YP.com bids on their advertisers brand terms and gets cheap calls that way.,smallbusiness,ch2adpb,2,t5_2qr34

885833,0,t3_249om9,Maintenance can be quite minimal once youre set up. How your store looks and everything is really up to you. The amount of work is proportional to how many SKUs you have and whether theyre retail items or proprietary. If youre matching up against other SKUs retail you have to constantly pay attention to the price war. Being in the buy box is everything so checking that you have the lowest price is a multipletimesperday task if there are a number of other sellers for your SKUs. Otherwise its honestly just keeping your inventory numbers accurate.A couple notesAmazon just started allowing some of their larger sellers into a program in which they dont need a UPC number to post a product. Im not sure if theyre letting the smaller guys do that yet. My point is if youre not retail then you may need to purchase UPC numbers for all of your products.Also expect Amazon to take  of your sale price depending on the categories youre in. If you participate in Fulfilled By Amazon that will go up even higher but that of course involves a costbenefit analysis based on your shipping coststime.,smallbusiness,ch4z0la,3,t5_2qr34

1594168,1,t1_cjg1ggl,You are going to regret pushing me for proof.The reason I didnt respond to you before is because I actually have a ton of experience in this and one of the main things I do know is that it is pointless to argue with EliteYelpersEmployees.  not sure which you are  Usually you argue the same tired rhetoric that YELP feeds you regardless of what I say or you realize I am right disappear and continue to do what you are doing because YELPERS love to Yelp and they like the benefits and they have no intention of stopping.Either way it is a waste of time.It assume you drink the YELP Koolaid because if you really wanted to know the truth you would actually look at all the numerous sources of proof many which have been validated by credible news sources AND even courts.  Judges have been quoted to say they agree that YELP is like the mob. In fact the judge who did say that actually ruled against YELP. it was the first case that someone won against YELP It was overturned ONLY because YELP has a parachute in place in their TOS that means that anyone using the site agrees to use mediation before going to court so those people violated the TOS by not doing that first.I am a former YELPER.  I was a YELPER early on.  I actually put over  businesses on YELP and taught social media classes for businesses where I included a whole section on adding their business to YELP or claiming their listings.  I lived to regret that when one after one I started hearing stories.  I got involved to help them and personally deal with case after case.   The amount of money that a business has to spend to get their website ranking over a yelp listing that is not accurately reflecting their business is sad.I have written a few YELP articles much which has been quoted numerous times in news sources and that YELP themselves were pissed about.  And it wasnt because it was inaccurate it was because it resonated enough factual truth to piss people off.I actually have a recorded call where a rep not only offers to help but admits that the filter knows the difference between an advertiser and a non advertiser.  The only reason I have not published that call was   didnt want the girl to lose her job and  in my state it is legal to record a call but not in San Francisco and I am unclear if I can publish the call yet and until I get a lawyer to confirm this I wont do it.But I can tell you this.  Even without sharing any of the numerous facts that come from the actual studies experiences recordings and testing i am just not going go into all that   I can prove something shady to you and here is how  Remember that Jeremy Stoppleman proclaims that advertisers are treated the same that the filter DOES NOT know the difference and they dont do anything to manipulate anything for advertisers.  Here is why that cant be true.They tell you not to ask your customers to leave you a review. WHY?  Well one it is against policy. They have a few reasons why it is against policy but the real reason is they dont want you to get too have any kind of control of your listing.  Even though it has been a common and well documented business marketing technique to ask your client to review your services to make you better.  If YELP was truly helping you wouldnt they want you to get your customers to give more feedback?  At any rate regardless they flat out tell you that if you get too many reviews at one time your account will get flagged and you run the risk of getting your reviews filtered for trying to game the system.  And that is exactly what happens. That is how many people get in trouble and they admit it is not a perfect system because sometimes people get a lot of reviews at once and get filtered.Ok so let us say everything I say above is true because it is coming from YELP and we are supposed to believe them.NOW when you advertise their pitch says that one of the benefits of advertising is that if you have unrecommendedfiltered reviews advertising will drive more traffic to your page and your reviews will become unfiltered as the filter sees your page getting all this great traffic and new reviews.SO tell me... if the filter doesnt know the difference and YELP doesnt manipulate your listing then how can this work? If the review sees everyone equally than actually advertising can hurt you because it is bringing all this traffic and all these reviews.  If anything it should make your account get worse as the filter sees you trying to manipulate the system.  I will go one step further.  How come businesses paying to sponsor a YELP event dont get in trouble?  Ever seen a YELP page after an event?  Pages and pages of great reviews.   Why didnt the filter see that as some kind of manipulation?  There has to be something they do to prevent it.Am I wrong?The only cringe worthy thing about the video is that is shockingly true.  That is exactly what happens you cant deny it because YELP doesnt either.  Jeremy himself agrees the filter is NOT perfect and sometimes legitimate people get caught up in the system but and I quote That is a chance we are willing to take.HE is willing to take a chance with OUR businesses?  Do you see the flaw in that statement?? He figures since it works for most people that the ones it doesnt should be sacrificed and feel good to know that others are ok?  Even the numbers he gives.  He will say only XYZ businesses are affected.  He sees people as numbers.  What is worse is he is SO defensive when people attack YELP. I think that is hilarious.  He punishes businesses for trying to maintain control of their brand online and defend from untruths yet watch how defensive he gets when someone attacks YELP.  The video is meant to remind people that there are REAL people and even if it is  people going out of business that is  too much when YELP could be doing better. They could put people in place to actually fix the failings of the filter but they cant because they already got in trouble before for extortion so now they are painted in a corner.  They have a filter they cant control and they cant fix it without getting in trouble for what they were doing early on which was selling services to manipulate your comments. There is NO way a business model like YELP can be fair and make money. It is that simple.  Everything they have done to try to fix this whole outcry is make it worse.  They profess that they are here to help businesses and that so many businesses are happy.  If that is the case why are there SO many people complaining?  Why is it making news?  I challenge you to go out for a week and start asking businesses what they think about YELP.  I will bet you that dont hear many good stories.  And it all that isnt proof enough than I dont know what to tell you.  Go start a business and put your blood sweat and tears into it then wait until the day your competitor plants a review and all your reviews get filtered and suddenly your phone stops ringing while your competitor gets away free.  And your only option is to pay  a month for a listing in the hopes your reviews might get unfiltered someday.   You wont know until you experience it and that is the sad part.In business most advertising is a choice.  Never until YELP did it become a necessity to save your business.,smallbusiness,cjg45hh,2,t5_2qr34

1619943,0,t3_2cti9s,Is there a way you could start by getting your first customers without spending the money on the rent for the kiosk? The rent could easily swallow up any profit you may make. Also even though your family may not charge you for waiting at the kiosk they are still using their time which can be considered equivalent to money.You may find you rent the kiosk and nobody turns up. Can you reduce the risk by renting the kiosk for a short time say  month or do you need to sign a longer contract for the kiosk?Perhaps your family could use their time to try to get you your first customers in another way?Here are some ways you may be able to get customers without renting a kiosk first. Put an advert on Craigslist. Put an advert in the local newspaper. Hand out flyers where the kiosk would be and see how many people respond to the flyersIf you can get a few customers without the kiosk then you will be able to see what its like to service the customers what problems arise and how much average profit there is per job. At this point you may decide its very tiring and you dont want to continue or its very energizing and you want more.

Youll need to do your due diligence on timecost on this.Ive been a PayPal developer for a while  the fee is decent they even allow for micro payments and you can seamlessly integrate them fairly easily from a programming standpoint.

For various Germanspecific reasons it is hard to find people willing to work in this sector service fastfood etc. and I am limited to shortterm lowpay students etc. I have to accept that every month something like three employees go away and three new ones come.Human consumption? hmm once you are selling something that people will put INTO their body. This is very intimate and sensitive issue. Invest into your kitchen team get some good chefproduction manager from the beginning. Think about who will and after you open see who is buy your food and how to make them feel good and happy.Another obstacle is growth but being nonbusiness educated it is hard for me to explain. As you grow you need more supply workers tools etc.. Problem is your growth is gradual and investment isnt always. Example I have a cutter of  liter. It is the biggest I could afford in the beginning. We used to work with  liter of material a day but now we use . I dont want to have to replace this cutter again in a year so I want to but a  liter cutter. It costs k. This is too much for me.

2277908,0,t1_clt9a75,Houses are appraised at their market value. If you default on a loan a house is still worth a fair amount of money. A business idea is just an idea. Even with solid credit there is nothing of value to lend against. Credit is just a measure of your determination to pay it back. If you took k and lost it all there would be no mechanism in place to get their money back. Just about anyone would ruin their credit score for  years easily before they went and got a job to pay back k over the next  years.On top of all this a mortage gets paid for x over by the time the loan is finished. If you tried to borrow k on a house it would require an appraisal of around k. In the first year youre going to pay in k and still owe k on the loan. That means that if you defaulted in year  they could sell the house for as low as k AND BREAK EVEN on the deal.Of course there was some shady stuff going on in the late s where they would loan more than the value of the home but the fact remains that the bank knows how to get their money back on a house really well.In contrast if you borrowed k on an idea and paid back k in the first year before calling it quits they would be out k.

Weve all heard the horror stories about web developers who disappear never meet deadlines dont communicate well etc. Ive probably hired or tried to hire  different people and literally none of them work out.And before you say my hiring skills stink  youre absolutely right! I tend to put too much faith in people and take them at their words. So I outsource my hiring now. I bring a couple trusted associates in to the interview process and make sure we all are on the same page. Even then the number of quality web developers who are looking for a fulltime noncontract job is pretty low.So longstory short I find people that can take the other tasks and do them well. So I have a writer a photographer a graphic designer an accountant etc who do work while I focus on the SEO and web development  and theyre great at and passionate about what they do. This has freed up a TON of time and allowed me to serve more customers without getting buried in all of the other details that arent my strongest suit anyway.TLDR dont hire more web developers hire people or contractors to do the nonweb development work to give you more time for web dev.,smallbusiness,cltp0be,2,t5_2qr34

Not necessarily based on how much money they potentially bring but how good of a fit they are with you and you are with them.  Focus on the top group.  Dont be afraid to let bad fit clients go regardless of money or longevity etc.  In any transition you will deal with attrition  dont take it personally and dont try and make everyone happy.  Make a list of non negotiables for yourself.  if you ever find yourself considering bending on the non negotiable that you previously set  dont make that decision quickly.  Examine why you set it in the first place and take time to strongly consider why you are willing to go back on that btw  it is never just this once.     Here is something that i am dealing with right now that I wish someone had said to me at the beginning  Be in business to make money. If you are in business to make friends or do favors your business wont be sustainable.  If you want to do something charitable  then charge a right amount for your work and then choose when to donate something for free.  If you have a tough decision to make  the quicker the better. Get it over with and move on. In the end  you are buying it for a reason.  Dont lose sight of that.  Congrats and best of luck!,smallbusiness,cm31b39,3,t5_2qr34

I am not sure if you are being purposefully vague but other than knowing it has to do with social media targeted at bars interactions with the bar and patrons and analytics  I have no idea what this is  consequently its hard to understand why bars would use it or why you would get an influx of resumes based on the description here.  what market research have you done? Have you sold any? It seems that it would cost you the same to get  sales as it would to give away free trials if it is strictly software based. If you are offering a competitive advantage for the bar owners it seems like theyd happily try it for a free period and then theyd be hooked once the metrics kick in and they see the ROI.  how much are you charging and on what type of contract?  what kind of incentive are you offering a sales person?  The type of salesperson you are looking for probably already has a job and is making money  what are you offering that would make them consider leaving? do you have multiple offerings with the product?  Like a freeentry level version with basic features a more advanced version with a few more features and a pro version? If not you might consider it.  if you have seen other similar products whats your differentiator?From a sales persons perspective I have some insight and maybe more follow up questions. ,smallbusiness,cmqkpmh,6,t5_2qr34

I was expecting amishrustic style traditional rocking chairs.gtMy customers have told me pointblank that if my chairs were priced like my competition ie in the  range they would not be buying from me.Do they mean that they wouldnt be buying a chair at all at those prices or that they wouldnt be paying that for your chairs? Theres a big difference between those possible meanings. Im not saying your chairs arent nice I just dont understand furniture prices at all most of my stuff is from Ikea minus my couch and recliner which I paid like  for  years ago.If theyre saying they wouldnt buy a chair at the higher price point then your competitors are probably selling less then they could be. If theyre saying they wouldnt pay that for your chairs as they are then maybe theres additional upgrades material? that could allow you to raise the price.gtTheirs are available widely in retail store while mine are not could that be the difference?Thats a huge cost difference between direct sales and retail theyre probably selling to the retail store for less than youre selling for. The retailer is taking the risk unless its some consignment thing.Regardless your chairs are nice and it looks like youve got a lot of components that are reusable so you might be able to prebuild some things and finish on demand. Strangely you can probably charge more for the quick delivery items than the truly custom items that take longer even if they might be considered more assembly line than hand made.I just thought about something else. You said new parents are a common customer. You might want to see about putting together some type of gift card style system where people could purchase a chair as a gift but the then allow the receivers new parents to customize the actual product.,smallbusiness,cnk4om1,2,t5_2qr34

In a situation like this it would probably be beneficial to incorporate or set up an llc to protect your personal home and assets in case you defaulted and for whatever reason they attempted to pursue your personal items.

We also have a stronger weft which gives us industry leading standards in terms of shrinkage and durability. Most importantly weve developed a custom fabric out of the extralong staple cotton that has shown to be far and away softer than anything else weve felt were looking to compete with  tees. There are a bunch of other minor technical points but those are the large ones.The long and short of it is we werent happy with what was out there and when we went to create our own solution  was as cheap as we could possibly make the tshirts at the quality we wanted.,smallbusiness,cpbpyaj,1,t5_2qr34

3377367,0,t3_2yurze,Hey thereI dont mind the design  it doesnt look too bad. Well done if youve done it yourself without any prior knowledge! But heres the things I would change I am a web designer without distancing to much from your look. They are mostly really small things  Fade the background pattern a little  looks too busy.  Too many fonts on the home page. The rule of thumb is to use only  fonts preferably a contrasting serif and sansserif. You have different fonts for the header About Us title content and below the  images. Try to stick with just  throughout the site.  Centre the logo vertically.   Add a Favicon the little icon that appears in the browser tab  Your headings on your pages eg Classes are too close to the left edge of the content area. On some pages they are encroaching onto the back ground. Same with the pencil icon on Contact page and the first product to the left on the product page.  Contact Us menu button is encroaching on edges of tab background  Missing image and link in footer.  Connect front page calltoactions SASSY STYLE SALE GET COZY STUFF WE LOVE to their relevant pages.  Be careful about using white in your tan content area  I can only barely make out the hearts near the subscribe form.Ok the most important thing though is to eventually move away from Wix and drag and drop platforms and get a dedicated site and full disclosure I am a web designer so technically they are a competitor.Wix is particularly bad for SEO Search Engine Optimisation. I ran your site through a SEO checker and saw that there can be many improvementsSome of these you may be able to do your self via Wix.,smallbusiness,cpd8tvy,3,t5_2qr34
3377627,0,t3_2yurze,It isnt terrible. However I do find myself wondering why its colored the way it is. Its all sand color. I would change that. I kind of wish it had more white in the theme as it looks cleaner.Next Sassy style get cozy stuff we love doesnt link anywhere. Thats odd. I was trying to click on them because I wanted them to link somewhere. Biggest problem was the menu. It has  tabs but only  are complete? The programs and classes tabs arent finished yet. The products tab only has a few products in it. To be honest it makes your whole site look VERY incomplete. Kind of like you arent taking having a business very seriously. It looks unprofessional. Finally why dont you have a blog? Or a newsletter? I would say your site will not even be in the running when it comes to similar more put together brands. ,smallbusiness,cpd9wde,1,t5_2qr34

I still think the k is extremely low though.Problem with postal is you see its only bringing in around k a year. Its a decent reliable gig but its not enough to support a full time shop on its own. If I would decide to buy and get rid of the beds Id probably buy it and immediately shut it down and start selling the assets off. Im interested to see lease terms.

Thats why most paperwork from used car dealers is stamped ASIS CONDITION in bold red font. For private sales where the seller isnt a dealer and no written warranty was included in the sale then the car is by default sold in asis condition. The only caveat to that is if the car is still under the original manufacturers warranty and is defective but then the buyer would need to take it up with the manufacturer.Anyway if you let us know what state youre in someone may be able to give you better advice. ,smallbusiness,csgf31t,2,t5_2qr34

This means some employees will have to carry out tasks related to a sale that they did not receive commission for but it should even out over time since theyll eventually end up being compensated for sales despite missing followup work due to a sick day.The only reason I can see for avoiding this is if you have a lowvolumehighmargin business with long sales cycles where sales are large but infrequent and its easy for an employee to predict the timeframe when a deal will be finalized allowing them to strategically show up on closing day and miss other days.  In that case you may want a more complex scheme where you calculate the total number of workdays or man hours dedicated to each sale and reduce commission for employee absences.  For example if your team spends  full days completing a sale an employee who missed two of those days will receive  of the commission he or she would receive under your current system.  The remaining  would be distributed evenly among workers who were present on those missed days and picked up the slack.,smallbusiness,csmgz1k,6,t5_2qr34

Last week I went to buy a Tesla Model S and they wouldnt accept Likes Favorites Retweets or s.  How well do you know your customers? Usually each social channel is home to a different customer persona with some overlap. Duplicate posts across all social channels can put the wrong content in front of your customer which is bad.Youre at the stage where youre going to have to start delegating some of this stuff. Agencies are great if you direct them. If you can approach an agency with detailed customer personas and say I need to reach persona Jenny and I want her to  . a good agency will be able to hit the target. Thats when its worth every penny.       Sure you could do it yourself. But should you? My guess is with a second location youve got plenty of other things to do.

5187624,0,t3_3m21dt,Seems like a great opportunity.  Given the business is already in a large growth period I would say focus first of all focus on accounting and financials. Getting all the accounting and financial information in order is really important and will inform your decisions going forward. The accounting and financials can be a stressor for small business owners and just getting that aspect of the business in order should be a relief for your boss. After getting accounting in order you want to streamline the order process and every operational process you can. Look for any repetitive task done at the business and see if there are ways of automating or outsourcing that process at a cost less than the time you would put into it over the long run. If you have these systems and processes in place it will be much easier to manage high levels of growth and bring new people into the operation. A wholesale catalog will definitely be important but your priority should be getting the operation in full working order. Start creating the catalog as you focus on the other things and will probably find what you learn from the accounting and process streamlining will help you in developing your catalog. Or you could go the opposite way and do the wholesale catalog straightaway and get it shipped out then scramble to get the order process streamlined. Save the accounting for last there will just be some extra numbers to deal with. The only real downside to that is you will be less financially informed with the upside being the extra business you could get by having your  catalog out earlier. You can run it by the owner and see what she thinks You are right you definitely want to have some sort of ownershipprofit sharing. You will need to get confirmation for this but I think you could still be apart of a profit sharing agreement as a . This might keep the administrative burden lower but still maintains the incentive to work to growing the business as much as possible.

Yes you can get insurance to cover you in either case the LLC protection is there but it is very easy for someone to pierce the veil.

5414202,0,t1_cw3kwso,This is a really good suggestion. We have two businesses and run them quite efficiently with our phones google drive and a spreadsheet. Anything I scribble down I just snap a photo and upload  straight from the phone into an order folder on google drive so it never runs a risk of being misplaced.  Basically I use a spreadsheet to log the orders and set up one folder per order on google drive under a master folder per year.  From the field any photos get uploaded right away from my phone. We pay someone  an hour to just transcribe data into different places forms receipts invoices etc. When shes out of the office I can do her job myself in about half the time and we never have to ask where anything is ... it is in the folder on google drive for the particular order.So if you could JUST show him how to upload photos from his phone you might get him over the old school hump. My partner resisted the switch to paperless but  months later we dont own a fax very very rarely print anything and the learning curve was easy because google drive is accessible from anywhere and just so damn easy.

5746941,0,t1_cx9fpkd,Good question. I am a very very hard worker. I always have been. Which for the most part has left me more frustrated than accomplished. It is easy to be a hard working guy. What is not so easy is knowing what is worth working hard on. I know I know I said Hard on.... lolBut seriously that has always been a difficult thing for me. I worked on Wall street when I was younger I worked in insurance then here. Its all the same. I have often been way more aggravated to have so much desire to bust my ass and nothing to bust my ass on. That being said I work as much as I can on what I know is going to be worthwhile. I make mistakes here and there when I say something is worth it and it turns out to be crap or when I say its not worth it and somebody proves me wrong. An example of this would be that I flew to Georgia to meet a very large merchant. I would make a very nice income on their account and I can save them a TON of money. North of K a year. However if I dont get the account I have to ask Was that worth going to? If I didnt go I would not even have a chance of getting it so maybe it was worth it?. What im getting at here is that I guess you can say no matter what you do you always learn and like everybody else I hope that all that learning pays off.I have not really bought myself anything. I recently bought two new cars I am a big car guy but not lamborghini which my dream car. I am putting as much money as I can back in to my business hoping to build a serious empire. I do vacation in Hawaii and can afford to do some things that I may take for granted.

Also when you do get more customers instantly hit him with a longerterm commitment or Fk off revision. Literally be prepared to throw him under the bus if he wont pay more or go longterm. This helps you know his business is secured longer periods of time. He may threaten to leave but to be honest more often than not the type of customer that leaves will be more shocking like I can be and just tell you they no longer require your services. There is never a conversation to be had once I decide Im leaving its not that I might but that I am. I Would never have an okay if you dont do X ill leave before because to me its just aggressive posturing. Of course I highlight issues with service providers and partners but nobody serious about business has the time to be issuing threats.     .  Now comes the sting in the tail. You have to get better at not needing to apologise and fix. This means making sure qualitycontrols are inplace before things get to your client to stop things that toxify the relationship and other relationships. This will mean you will be less fast and that is okay your client needs to deal with it or leave or sign a waiver which you will charge a premium for.  .  I work in IT and  of my clients do not. Most of the time as well as IT Ill listen to them about other aspects of their business including complaints weird processes and things that go wrong. I also offer solutions to help them out with these and what I consider basic BCM like taking before and after pictures of visually noticable jobs requiring outside contractors to read and sign contracts representing the quality of their works etc so they can evidence works completed and ensure if plan A gets fried there is a plan B or you know when to call it. I ask for and encourage accreditations or signs of CPD to be communicated to me and via marketing services and by doing all this I like to think I am helping my clients. As a side effect they grow and involve me in more and more or I eventually get rid of them. It helps nobody to have a static nonimproving clientrelationship and sadly these are the ones that might pay a bit more in early days but it is the successful relationships that bring in more longterm as they lead to better conversations. ,smallbusiness,cxmt3nb,1,t5_2qr34

They hold services on New Years because who doesnt amiright? and found the citywide touristmoneyattracting familyoriented fun time to be a disruption for them. Instead the entire downtown area was a ghost town this year. Which means what? More people on the road traveling longer distances than usual spending their sales tax at the RVA DC and CVille celebrations instead because they need the revenue risking local lives which would not have been otherwise risked. And thats not just the revelers. The regular vendors and bands who would have normally been able to stay local had to travel for their livelihood. If I didnt have a sufficient day job we would have had to risk our lives on the road for a gig. Or been more responsible and less profitable by spending more money nonlocally on a hotel room.Do I sound bitter? Its probably because Im a little bitter. But honestly mostly utterly astounded that the city was so quick to accommodate such a small congregation. The damage it caused is probably probably not just for the year. Once you get a better gig out of town why would you come back nearly everywhere pays better?

6169983,0,t1_cyqt93m,Well the way I explain it youre going to get greater value out of assigning an hourly rate to the labor your partner puts in. If you require  hours of sweat equity to be put into the company before he vests and he spends  hours on the business over the course of a year and you increase from  to  in revenues at the end of the year then youre much further ahead than if you just made him earn  for the company before he got paid an equity share. You managed to use his labor to gain MUCH more value and its fine for him because he owns a  stake in the value he helped create. If the company didnt do that great but he still invested  hours as you required in my madeup example here then he would still own a  of the company. If you fired him before he vests which you NEED to be sure to stipulate that you can terminate the agreement if he is slacking off or being sketchy then he gets zero even if he puts in  hours and this is why he needs to consider this offer as well  He has to consider if YOU are worth taking a risk on and partnering with.The only thing is lets say in the above example you made  in profit. You may or may not decide to reinvest part of that keep part as cash in the business for expensesinvestments or hand out dividends to the owners. If you did pay dividendsbonuses before he fully vests I do believe he still has a right to his  of those so keep that in mind before you do anything shady lol.Hope this helps clarify things.,smallbusiness,cyqyoo0,1,t5_2qr34

Learn what you would have to do. Would you be responsible for actually selling? Or are there employees handling most of the daytoday?If you cant do the work yourself or dont want to then you and your father should consider hiring someone. This person can handle the parts of the business that you cant. Youll have to check the finances and figure out a way to compensate this person but it could be a way to keep the business running and keep the value of the business in the family. Your father might want to talk to an estate planning attorney who has experience with business succession planning.

Unless youre on page  of Google for the keywords that people search for when looking for your product youll get virtually  visitors  and this virtually  sales.Do you know how many potential decal purchasers visit your site?

6362990,0,t1_czcv6gx,To be sure about anything you should have a taxbusiness lawyer look at the details of your situation. But based on what you said heres some general informationThe real issue with something like this is figuring out how your husband will take over the business from a legal perspective. Is there an entity like an LLC or corporation he will receive? If so is it a gift? Is it a purchase? If theres no entity how will the business assets be transferred gift or purchase? Will his father be involved in any way in continuing the business? If so does that mean its a partnership now? Who assumes responsibilities for what debt?From the IRS perspective if this is a sole proprietorship without an LLC or a Corporation the tax liability is entirely with the individual running the business his dad. All income and deductions are reported on his return. There is no other taxable entity involved from the IRS perspective. So there is no entity that has a tax liability that your husband could be impacted by. This would get more complicated if there is in fact any business entity.For a transaction like this whether its a gift or a sale I highly recommend that your husband has an attorney to advise him on his rightsresponsibilities. An attorney can also help plan the transaction to minimize potential liabilities of all kinds. You should look for an estate planning tax or business attorney or someone who practices in more than one of those areas. I would think the most important thing is that going forward your husband does things bythebook and avoids as much liability as he can. As a side note are you sure the writeoffs are questionable? You might want to consult a CPA to be sure either way when your husband does take over the business.,smallbusiness,czcwgr5,2,t5_2qr34

6414394,0,t1_czi894h, These are reasonable breakdowns of used car segments. I specialize in the very cheap up to about k Gross profit on used vehicle sales is probably about  up to a max of about k A good used car salesperson must have faith in his dealer and product and must have some ability to bring in his own customers I am a franchise of a national chain so we benefit from national advertising campaigns. We also spend a good amount of money online. Pay per click and Social Medial especially. But thats for BHPH. For traditional sales a good website and inventory sites like autotrader are key. Every dealer is different. As a BHPH I have to make sure the car stays running for the customer so I spend a good bit more than a trditional dealer might car I am unique in that I buy  of my cars from a network of local wholesalers. They give me the opportunity to inspect a car before I nuy it and they drop them off and pick up the rejects. I pay  more per car but have very few headaches. I dont do auctions. It is hard to justify buying another dealers rejects. There are good deals to be had off lease etc. but they dont fit my criteria.a I dont have to worry about this Most of the trade ins I get are junk and go straight to the scrap man. The ones that run get sold off my back lot as buyer beware cars In BHPH I would never reject a trade because it is importnat to me to make sure the customer does not have another car to fall back on if they cant keep up with my payments. In tradidtional car sales it is spometimes hard to get trades because customers have over inflated ideas as to their value. I have no obligation in Ohio to warranty my vehicles or give any customer a recission period. I do warranty all of my BHPH vehicles and it is usually in my best interest business wise to take back a BHPH car from a customer if they change their mind in the first few weeks. It is not important to have an in house mechanic It IS important to control your spending and make sure you are not being sold items that your vehicle doesnt need. Sometimes in house is the best way to make sure of this. Setting up an inhouse service department is EXPENSIVE! In house detailing is not a good idea. Somemost cars do not need a full detail to be ready to sell. A decent car washer can handle this. ONly cars with serious interior stains or exterior scratches that require buffing need to go to a detail shop. I only pay to have about a third of my cars professionally detailed I handle the rest in house and my guys are NOT detailers. Body work is going to depend on the price points of the cars. Some cars must be repaired fully to sell. Less expensive cars may be better to have some cosmetic blemishes and a cheaper price. It is important to have a reasonable body shop you can trust. Previous body damage is not an issue for me but can be an issue for more traditional dealers. As long as body work was done properly and corners were not cut I have no issue selling a car that was previously damaged. Higher dollar cars definitely need a clean carfax but I dont deal in them. I provide a  month warranty on all my BHPH cars free of charge. It covers engine trans drive axle suspension battery alternator starter etc. My customer pays a  deductible for any covered repair.  Absolutely. I have nothing to hide. I encourage my customers to have any car off my back lot trade ins etc. inspected before purchasing. Those cars are a gamble. We fix most anything fro free within the first  days or so. We offer no written policy on that however.  Never been sued.  We are  bhph except for the back lot all cashNow for a bit of Buy Here Pay Here... Big cahones or stay out of the ring right? Our sweetspot is cars we sell for k Our average down is about . We also set up deferred down payments so our customers can give us additional down payment after the sale and before their regular payments start. All of our deals look about the same. Our cash in deal is about deal. This is the cost of the cartax title platesdown payment. It costs us  to put a car on the road. We carry  accounts and repo month. The important thing is how far into their loan they got prior to repo. A repo in year  hurts me way less than a repo in month . Our repos are about . Half are junk and half are pretty clean We usually outsource our repos but we will go ourselves occasionally Up to  depending. We pay less when we have a working GPS tracker We call home work cell  references go to their house and knock on the door and leave letters on their car prior to repo. We call our late customers starting at one day late and may be  days of no contact before a repo. Sometimes more. We cannot resell their car to them. It is their car. They can redeem their vehicle by paying current  repo fees and the terms do not change. We can lso make any deal we want like giving it back or less or taking a short lump sum payoff especially around income tax time Yes and no. The repo that a customer does not get back always is a negative entry accounting wise. Most of the cars dont come back nice enough to resell. Yes and yes. All customers sign a GPS disclosure statement. The devices we use do not shut down the cars. They are GPS trackers only. We lose  carsyear. More likely is a customer has a car that we do not wish to repo due to the age and mileage of the car vs. the cost of repo. We stay on top of our customers insurance. Any customer that does not have insurance pays us for coverage. We have a program that will cover the customers car for about month it is not liab covg. We have about  customers participating in this program. So we bring in about kmonth in premiums and pay for ins losses from that. It is a profit center for us as well. We require comp and collision with  max deductible. We assume that a customer will be participating in our insurance program so we do not make them get other coverage. We would rather them pay us the month Credit score is not important. Job is vital. I like jobtime but have had to sell to customers with increasingly less time on the job. I dont sell to customers who have had more than  previous repos. I like customers that filed bankruptcy recently because they cant file again for years. A lot of the underwriting depends on my face to face interview and how I feel about the customer. Only no license previous repo from us or one of our franchises our  repos are automatic deal killers. Also less than  monthly net income is auto decline Only  in  customers wants to negotiate. So no we dont negotiate anything. We present our program and you are in or out. I dont know what finance fees would be exactly. Our customers pay a fixed . rate on their car loan Neither usually Our average term is  months. It depends on the types of vehicles. BHPH dealers selling older cheaper cars have shorter terms No. We take trades and hold the title to the vehicle being purchased. That is all I do not finance negative equity so the car would need to be worth all or near all of what is owed to be rolled in. Mostly straw purchases.

7072248,0,t3_4cgh5w,Ok it seems as though you are talking about two different things here to me anyway and I could be wrong but incorporating vs. DBA. Going back to business structure  and I am NOT a lawyer these things differ by state regarding what protections are had by each form and how things are viewed for tax purposes  main general forms corporation LLC sole proprietor. These can some times be separated further scorp vs. ccorp LLPs etc. and there may be other options like nonprofits...but for the sake of the question were talking about these three in their basic form.As soon as you decide to go into business for yourself even if it is just as a subcontractor delivering newspapers you are now a soleproprietor. Anything you do or say can be held against you directly in the court of law...so if you screw up your assets are vulnerable to legal actions. You are also responsible for FICA taxes and the like which as an employee were covered in part by your employer. Lets say you wanted a clever name like Benson Bits...you would then file a DBA ...or fictitious name. Your legal form does not change you have no protections here. You will not be allowed in most states to use things alluding to a different legal structure Inc. corp. LLC etc in your fake name.Forming an LLC limited liability company offers a bit more cushion to your assets if something goes wrong. You would need to talk to your accountant and attorney regarding what these are bc I dont have enough experience here.Incorporating creates your business as its own walking talking being. If someone screws up...you could be accountable for some things look at the gawker foobar as an example but the companys assets take the main hit. Your income becomes more complicated between shares and possibly wages. You have more paperwork to do. You will not have a DBA but the corporation may have dbas for things like subsidiaries Benson Bits DBA Bensons Garage.

7278535,0,t1_d25huio,My parents have been business owners for most of my life. I have seen what it entails and the tolls it takes. While I do not believe that I am solely ready right now I do feel like I am properly equipped. I will also have my parents as an asset to solidify my independent success. This particular business is successful enough to allow them to live a very decent lifestyle. They travel out of the country often and spend on luxury. I do not have much interest in that. My interests would be primarily to buy them out and fully staff the business. Id like to have an asset that for the most part pays itself off and all the while will provide to me a place to live food to eat and some money to spend. This would hypothetically set me up by my retirement age and I will not have to struggle in the mean tim as far as a job a house and food is concerned.

If its signed and the terminal approves it its good.That being said Im told the credit card companies havent completely shifted liability onto merchants that have done everything they could to be chip n pin compliant. For example were completely setup for chips but its not working because our processor hasnt been approved yet. Not that they are getting denied but the verification system is so backlogged that theyre just in queue. In this case we may not be held completely liable for something we have no real control over.

So for example if I have a merchant and Chase has a merchant we can both offer the same pricing and both make the same amount of money. This is the same for every provider of electronic payments because the costs of the industry are defined by issuing banks of credit cards along with fees that the card brands charge. Therefor there is nothing that one can offer that the other cant in terms of pricing. However big name banks vs dedicated processing companies are usually more expensive just because they get free leads and dont need to compete on that end.My business model revolves around making it lucrative for a sales rep by offering them a big bonus. I calculate what I am going to earn on an account.

Donations to a for profit company are gifts and not likely deductible. I dont know if nonprofits can earn a surplus which carries from year to year but I would expect a cooperative which would be organized as some kind of limited partnership would have to declare that as some kind of profit.

When the current owners handed the business to their son he took a new approach to the whole business plan even going as far as changing the logo.  to me that ruined the business.   If you were to ask me the biggest gamble in running your own business is knowing whether those customers from this year will be back next year.  That can make or break you.     Id say if your restaurant has been open  years its already doing better than most.  So instead focus on the customers you have at the same time start to cut out less efficient practices there.   if you can do that and not affect quality and your customers are still coming back your ahead of the pack.

I actually like the site from a technical and design aesthetic point of view so unlike other reviews here Im going to comment more on the business model side of things.Firstly youre in a very spammy niche. Did I say very? I meant EXTREMELY. Youre in the same neighbourhood as a whole load of unethical get rich quick work for home bizop spammers and blackhats. Youre hanging out in the internet equivalent of midnight on an inner city street corner with hookers on your left and drug dealers on your right and some guy passed out with his wallet stolen in an alleyway behind yall.And youre very identifiable with that domain. Not only is it spammy but theres a problem with the missing s. It should be Earn Six Figures. That adds even more to your spamindex and makes it look worse. The only thing youre missing is a couple of hyphens a .net extension and slicked back hair. This domain screams Send me just  and Ill send you a report on how to make a million dollars. In fact you can see that clearly even in this thread from the way your post was downvoted unlike other everyone else who posted their site up for review.However from reading a couple of pages on your site you actually seem like a very genuine guy with ethics and everything! You sound like you genuinely qualify to be a member of the human race... apart from that domain  Where Im going with this is I think you need a rebrand. Which is ironic given your last blog post. Theres a couple of domains I think you should lock down. If youre not ready to niche down to the Kindle thing yet then move your site to yourname.com if you are then go to KPT.com from the title of your book but spelled out or something along those lines and concentrate on that angle. On the niching down thing heres my logic people are mildly interested by someone saying what youve said Heres me documenting my attempts to make money doing a bunch of things. Its a whole lot more compelling when you say Heres me showing you exactly how I made  in X months with Kindle. Learn more about niching down theres a lot of good stuff written about it out there.When I looked at your blog I thought it was PLR. I googled about  different sentences to see where you copied it from again remember that domain inspires absolute cynicism and mistrust in anyone with a clue. One of the sentences matched another blog the rest came up as unique so you probably wrote this yourself. If you did you need to do a better job of showing it in the writing  more I think this my opinion is that. Make it more personal less you should... lecturing style. People want to get to know the person writing the blog posts.Email subscription Subscribe to our mailing list is not compelling no one wants more email. Get my free guide to earning  with your first Kindle book is way more compelling and make sure you deliver on the promise.Display ads are you making money from them? If youre not making a lot then ditch them. Not worth it. They devalue your site and brand.

Regarding your comment its definitely an unusual approach but my shop is comprised mostly of single garments in only one or sometimes two sizes eventually Id actually love to stock more of the fair trade and handmade clothing in all sizes its just too expensive to do until the shop starts producing a return.The principle of Scarcity does apply to the single garment thing though in kind of a cool way which means that because theres only one people would be more prone to buy it because A its unique and B it will be gone if they dont.  I suppose this way of selling oneoff items feels natural to me because thats how it works with authentic vintage clothing each dress is unique.Thanks for that link really cool!  It looks like they are actually a clothing label though not a boutique which sells a bunch of different brands.  Really pretty stuff though and I love their photography!

8583664,0,t3_4xcle2,I run a service based business in a large market. Im  on Yelp with all star reviews. I have a buddy who has the same type of business in another large market and with similar reviews. We both pay Yelp and we both get a lot of business from it. The ROI makes sense for me. I increased my budget from month to  and eventually . Each time I saw increases in calls which in turn increased sales. Ive also increased SEO and PPC over time. Its hard to track exactly whether the lead was solely generated from Yelp because they may have gone to my website first and then my Yelp page or vice versa. My advice would be not to put all of your eggs in one basket for any kind of marketing. I did Angies List marketing for  months at month then cancelled. I get as many views on my Yelp page in  weeks as I did in an entire year on Angies List. Weve fallen down and climbed back up by things like responding to reviews responding to messages within an hour adding pictures offering deals etc. Stay active on the page and report fake businesses in your category if they pop up. I get beat out some times by competing national companies which Im sure throws Yelp a ton of money.

We got some constructive criticism and some general feelings about it. When we figured out what some people liked we started a small run. . years later we re full time employees at our company and we still ask nearly every customer for feedback and suggestions. We have even made color combos chosen by customers. Its really about asking as many people as you can but in a way that doesnt make them say oh ya great idea. Start by asking something about the problem you are solving and lead them into your solution.ExampleIf you were to invent the shopping cart you wouldnt ask hey do you like this cart. You d ask something like hey what would you say is the most annoying part about grocery shopping in hopes they reply I cant carry enough groceries in my handsIn our case we solved the age old problem of having to wear pants.

I do not mean to sound snippy when I say that. But a lot of people get confused with the ubiquity of simple web builders. There is a false sense of what building an effective business website and using its full capabilities really entails. You are not just using tech here you are building tech. I know how to use a blowtorch but I am a long way from knowing how to build a ship with it. With that being said the ability to gain knowledge of building is just as accessible. You can certainly take it on yourself but take the effort to actually learn the mechanics. Wordpress is an excellent start. there are many templates to get you started.

The DBA means doing business as which is an assumed name. Once you get that paperwork approved you can take that to the bank and open an account under that name. Now you are in business. To get an LLC go to you states website for me it was Michigan.Gov. Search for Business Registrations. From there you can register an LLC. If costs only  in Michigan. You will get paperwork in the mail  weeks later...which is basically the same as a DBA but registered in each county of your state. When I started out I never thought I would make the money that I do. It was temporary which now Im in my th season...I kept track of all my accounts using Excel and Word. I did that for a few years until I had to hire an accountant which now does everything in Quickbooks.So dont fret about what you need to start  just get something going then you can tie up the loose ends as you go.

11493226,0,t3_63wbhc,As a minor I cant do a ton as far as money goes.Its an interesting legal gray area for sure. Suffice it to say that the courts have given you so much power with regard to disaffirming a contract that its stacked life against you. I understand that in order to do this I need to basically have an adult own the business and pay me and others a salary. As far as I know if you have a Social Security number you can have a sole proprietorship. Folks at this level usually want to formally incorporate for liability purposes but again...youve got a lot of power when it comes to contracts. I would be starting off with me and possibly  or  other friends working on this. How would this work? I need to be paid at least minimum wage in order to run the business legally right?Your profits are going to be treated as regular income in a sole proprietorship. As far as your friends go how much money are you realistically expecting them to make off of this? Can you pay them by the job and just  them? The IRS doesnt even require that you  anyone that you paid less than . in a given year. What if I make money from the business and decide to treat myself to a nice meal? Can this come out of the money the business made?No. You cant take writeoffs like this unless you have a reasonable expectation that the meal will result in some sort of material benefit to your business. Where the hell can I learn all of the financial side of this stuff?Major in Business Administration when you get to college. Ive been reading about Warren Buffet and he just ran around doing little ventures with his friends selling pinball machines to business owners and such but nobody questioned him for it. I feel like its different now. I dont feel like I have that freedom. Am I wrong? Not really. Sales is still sales and relationships with people are still relationships with people. A lot of things will open up to you when you reach the age of majority. Im not saying it never happens but there is a considerable amount of risk to a corporate buyer to enter into a contract with a minor.Where can I look to learn things about the bookkeeping part of business business accounts running stuff as a minor etc.? Bookkeeping is simpler than you might think. Its a very straightforward process. Accounting is the more difficult subject. I recommend you take the free courses on Financial Accounting and Managerial Accounting from saylor.org if you wish to learn more. Also you can take tests on both of those courses at that website for college credit. They cost  a piece and you take them from home using a webbased proctor. You might have to check and see if the college you plan to attend will accept credits from ACE or NCCRS though. Good luck!,smallbusiness,dfyr8ci,1,t5_2qr34

Working with my clients last week we received proposals from  landlords. Outlining the specific points we wanted addressed then used it to compare appletoappletoapple each location. By sharing with the brokers that we are considering multiple locations the landlords tend to be more aggressive. Two proposals were very close in overall costs. The second came in almost  less over the  year term. They also were willing to give us TI dollars and capital improvement dollars. Considering this is  sf this  is an aggressive offer. Dont get me wrong shopping it on your own seems to work for many business owners. It might work for you. But if you want to know where the market really is compared to what the market is asking.
