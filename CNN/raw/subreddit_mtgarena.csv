7295764,0,t3_4f4tj2,I would play it that whatever the stats are of the creature when you flip the stats it takes those stats.When i play attack bonus cards on a creature to increase its attack and play that card i assume i would get the increased attack rating as defense i dont see why this would be different.  If she moves out of water after the switch i would either assume you reduce the attack to what the normal defense was before the bonus. Or decrease the defense even lower until the cards effects wear off and everything goes back to normal.I noticed a lot of situations in this game dont have clear rules for how to proceed you will have to house rule whatever you think is best.,mtgarena,d27h8w7,1,t5_39lw4
