1950045,0,t1_ckn2m45,For what its worth rraisedbynarcissists has had a longstanding problem with its name.  Unfortunately they cant exactly just change the name  its the address to the community.  But rraisedbynarcissists is actually a space for talking about all parents with toxic self absorbed or abusive personality characteristics  and it is intended to be just as much for children of borderlines as for children of narcissists.  I got the sidebar edited to explain this recently as this has never been as clear as it ought to be  however even with sidebar writing the name of the subreddit is a problem.  Its a problem that all the mods know about and are concerned about but we dont really know what to do about it.All of that to say  even though your mom isnt a narcissist rraisedbynarcissists and all of its network of subs including rtrolledbynarcissists are totally appropriate places to talk about borderline parents.,BPDlovedones,cko6njb,3,t5_33dd6
2063052,0,t1_cl1yuom,gt  manipulative behavior? I used to think that but I dont anymore. People with BPD dont do it at that high level. Another way to say it everyone sometimes gets angry and yells and accuses falsely others. I dont think they do it to manipulate.gt And do you think that her communication style could be characterized as aggressive?Yes. But I learned how to have strong boundaries and it stops it. She hated it at the beginning but now it works like a charm.gt Does the underlying issue ever get addressed?It does! By having strong boundaries she is forced to change her behavior. She might not like it she might not say she was wrong but she changes her behavior. Surprisingly months later we talked and she has admitted that after I starting with the healthy boundaries she brought up some issues to her therapist and she knows she wasnt doing things that were not nice to me and she is committed to changing them. Trying to explain this to her before never worked but changing the dynamics did work.gt It sounds like youre likening your relationship to a battlegroundwar. Have I got that right?No you are over stretching the metaphor. I just meant that sometimes some of the conflicts in the relationship were like a battle. They were nasty. But I decided that they were like that because SHE liked them like that. I dont. So I only negotiate like loving adults. If she doesnt want to engage at that level I dont engage with her. I have a lot of power over this and she is forced to come calmed to the negotiating table. The more I did this the quicker and easier it got to get her to stop the aggressiveness because it didnt work for her.gt Why do you think she is always fairer and betterbehaved at Couples TherapyBecause everyone is fairer in CT. That is the point of it. There is a referee and people feel compelled to be more reasonable and fair. If they arent a good CT changes the dynamics to enforce it. That is their role. gt Committed to what kind of action though?If they want to fight then they want to fight. But a fight needs two. I can deny them that with good boundaries and force them to come to the negotiating table. If they want to fight Ill give them adult mature negotiation. That is all Ill give them. So if the issue of the fight is important to them they will be forced to comply. It is hard work but it is working for me and it gets easier with time.,BPDlovedones,cl224zj,1,t5_33dd6

2381848,0,t3_2mmj16,Frankly it is sexual abuse and also emotional abuse.  I think theres this pervasive idea that sexual abuse is only bad touch.  Its not.  You were a child and she took advantage of her complete power over you to be extremely sexually inappropriate with you.  Thats basically the definition of child sexual abuse.I understand how it can be confusing.  I struggled a lot after I was abused although not by a family member because it didnt fit a lot of strict definitions and it didnt fit neatly into those online Are you being abused? checklists.  The fact is that every relationship and every dynamic is different and not everything goes neatly into boxes.  In some families leaving the bathroom door open and cuddling are perfectly fine and normal because the context is love and closeness that is consensual by all parties.  In your context it was inappropriate not only because it made you uncomfortable but because there wasnt that same context of love and closeness with your mother especially with the contradictory slut shaming in the background. Your mother took advantage of you for inappropriate emotional support and to act inappropriately sexual treated you as an extension of herself and her needs rather than your own person and it has left you with some significant trauma.  Thats all that matters.  My therapist helped me understand that and helped me understand that everyones trauma is different but equally valid.  And youre definitely not alone  I think this is why a lot of kids slip through the cracks where abuse is concerned because its incredibly difficult to create an accurate and alwaysreliable checklist that will identify abuse.  If you havent seen a therapist yet I highly recommend it  but if youre afraid or low on money you can also try support groups.  Dont shy away from being part of a healing community because your abuse wasnt textbook enough let yourself heal and dont worry too much about labels.,BPDlovedones,cm63rsa,2,t5_33dd6
2427657,0,t3_2n771z,Others are giving you action itemslegal advice and thats good listen to them.  I just wanted to share one piece of insight about BPD.  Jane is telling the truth as she knows it when she says the things she says.  The problem in understanding her is that you experience reality and then form emotions based on your experiences.  A borderline does this in reverse. They have extremely strong emotions about a person place or thing and then the create a reality that fits those emotions good or bad.  This is what leads to their splitting behavior where everything and everyone is either  good or  bad.  Even though her version of reality is not real to you or anyone else it is as real to her as yours is to you.  That she really really believes her version of reality is why she will fight tooth and nail to defend her version of facts.If she doesnt admit she has a problem and isnt getting treatment for her disorder you cant reason with her.  You cant possibly see the reality she lives in and she cant see the reality that you know is real.gt In what way can we make Jane clear that I am not a threat to the children but that I really do have the best interests at heart?Not while she is untreated.  She sees you as  evil and theres no way to convince her that her version of you and reality is wrong.gt In what way can we ask Jane to say those kinds of things to the kids make clear that it upsets them without her saying Im evil again?You cant reason with an untreated Borderline.gt In what way can we communicate without involving the children? Would a notebook that we give along to the kids be a good idea? Or would that possibly upset her even more?Same as above.gt Is there a way we can tell the children what is going on with Jane without making her the bad person? I dont want the children to think that I feel the person who gave birth to them is bad because it would influence their self esteem too much at later ageYou said the children are in therapy.  Have this discussion with their therapist must be a therapist who works with borderline patients.  If their therapist does not do a LOT of work with borderlines find a new one NOW.gt How can we help her to have a stable relationship with the kids? What are possible red flags that my husband and I should keep an eye out for?She needs help.  If shes not being treated do everything possible to keep the kids away from her.gt How can we explain the children what is going on with her once they are older and start having questing about her acting funny without badmouthing her?Again a therapist experienced with BPD is the way to go here.gt Is there a chance that one day we wont have to worry about her harming the children?Only if she gets help on her own.gt Is there a way to see when there will be a bad period coming up?No.  Anything can set her off at anytime.,BPDlovedones,cmbrkgy,3,t5_33dd6
2763506,0,t1_cnhwdnq,Thanks for this message. You are right on about the real validation. it is hard because she has to calm down enough that she can say things clearly. She said some in the story above but then two nights after we really talked and we were candid  but communicated well. It is weird this stuff. She needed to first feel i was strong and there then calm down and only then we could really talk. This came as an onion of digging deeper and deeper. I am exhausted. I think we reach the bottom but i am never surr.Things are still a bit strange and she is a bit distant. But she sent some emails I perceive as peace offerings. Only time will tell. ,BPDlovedones,cni77g4,3,t5_33dd6
3062729,0,t3_2v70lf,No there is no way to get distance between you and her without causing her to feel abandonment.That said you need to distance yourself from her toxic personality oryou will get sucked into the black hole she has created as an existence.She needs to get help and she needs to be internally motivated to get help. This means she needs to come to the realization that either she saves herself or no one will. For her to do this her support network you and anyone who cares about her needs to essentially leave her on her own and not continually act as caretakers.As a caretaker youre enabling her to be more and more out of control. You need to stop caring stop rescuing her. She needs to understand that she can not have a friendship where shes constantly depending on you to be there for her. That you dont have the capacity for infinite understanding infinite energy to be there for her. That you have limits.The down side of not caring and not having a support network around is that she may choose death over life when it comes down to it. You need to be prepared for that.What you need to think about is yourself. You need to save yourself. If you keep being there for her she will continue to use you and get closer to you until you realize that you and her are tied at the hip and going down together.The lifeguard analogy works best.Youre the lifeguard and you swim out to a drowning swimmer.She latches on to your neck and pulls you down so you cant swim.You dive and she lets go.You surface away from the drowning person.Again you swim toward her and this time you warn her that if she latches on to you youll leave her to drown.Again she latches on to your neck and pulls you down so you cant swim.You dive and she lets go.You swim for the shore.,BPDlovedones,cofg63x,3,t5_33dd6

3322062,0,t1_cp6smqm,There are  things that really put me into a tail spin.   The day to day check in. We would talk about everything and I would be in constant contact with her through out the day.  Sometimes it caused me serious issue with work and I wanted it reduced.  But when its gone its so quite its deafening.  Its really unsettling to not report to someone any longer. The caretaking.  She adored me and I took care of her.  I got a lot of joy from doing things for her and a ton of self esteem from being her savior.  It eventually became to the point that she didnt do anything for herself an expected me to do it or she started raging.For us there was no cheating just a constant rage adoration loop that got worse and worse as the years wore on as she learned how to hurt me deeper.  Finally I stopped trying to make her stay with me when she wanted to leave.  It took four reconciliations before it was done and none lasted over a week but each stopped my healing and put me back to step one.  At the stage you are at I kept my sanity by reading books on stopping caretaking and codependency.  It helped me see all the bad patterns and keep me from caving when I wanted nothing better than to send her an email at  am declaring my love.I looked at dating websites and saw that there were women out there that I could date when I was healed.So  months later.... I dont want her back and actually want her to find someone to make her happy.   I have dated others and noticed some patterns that I want to stop.  I really want a close relationship again but this time Im strong enough to make sure it is healthy.,BPDlovedones,cp6xz25,2,t5_33dd6

3371109,0,t3_2yp66g,gt I havent read the Stop Walking On Eggshells book yetIm listening to it as an audible audio book in my car on my long commutes. It makes the time spent in traffic bearable.I figured out that my undiagnosed BPD wife had BPD after our rd and final separation after seeing a therapist and getting the DSMIV criteria for BPD. My undiagnosed BPD wife fit  out of the  criteria!Even though my marriage to my undiagnosed BPD wife is over the advice this book gives is invaluable.I feel that even if I had figured out that my wife was BPD during my marriage and had gotten and read Stop Walking On Eggshells at the time it would not have made a difference in preventing my marriage from collapsing.In my situation all the self change of myself and coping strategies that the book teaches would have made  difference in keeping the marriage from collapsing and  difference in my wifes denial of her BPD condition.However the book Stop Walking On Eggshells would have made a tremendous difference in me and my choices in the marriage. Had I read the book I would probably have gotten out much much sooner year  of the marriage instead of year  first separation not the third I would have seen the unwinnable futility of the situation I was in.Long storyI had an undiagnosed BPD wife who was thoroughly enmeshed with and codependent to her undiagnosed NPD mother. Imagine having someone who is undiagnosed BPD and who is constantly validated in her accusations of you by her undiagnosed NPD mother. Instead of having to deal with the undiagnosed BPD individual  on  youve now got another mentally ill individual who validates all the BPDs false emotion based accusations toward you and calls you out on them. Imagine this denial of reality projecting making reality fit emotions getting validated by an undiagnosed NPD individual who does so because in return she has her daughter to admire her and be codependent on her.When youve got this sort of motherdaughter alliance in denial of reality the two of them enmeshed in an extremely dysfunctional relationship and when a strong part of this alliance is to blame you the husband for everything you certainly start to believe all their accusations. After all two people are making assertions and theyre more believable than one. The two of them would be on the phone all day while I was at work.My undiagnosed BPD wife was definitely externalizing all of her emotions she never self hurt or internalized She learned to externalize later in life after high school since she had told me that she had been very quiet and marginal  invisible to everyone around her as a child.Although the advice that Stop Walking On Eggshells gives is great for on relationships with minimal parental involvement on the side of the BPD I feel that a lot of this advice with regards to affecting change in the BPD SO via changing oneself and ones behavior and response to the BPDs behaviors was useless in my particular marriage situation.While I was married figuring out that my wife was undiagnosed BPD and reading Stop Walking On Eggshells would have helped with shielding myself and my two children my inner emotional functioning choices and coping strategies.It would have helped with how I reacted to her and my undiagnosed NPD mother in law choosing to deflect choosing to not absorb like a sponge but be a mirror for their accusations choosing to go out more and live my life more independently of the prison that my wife created for me in our relationship and household choosing to take more personal responsibility choosing to be less codependent finally choosing to leave earlier than I did because my marriage with two undiagnosed indenial mentally ill people who were emotionally enmeshed and validating each others paranoid  delusional theories was not really going to work long term. I realized that my marriage was doomed from the start in that particular family situation.,BPDlovedones,cpcj4kh,3,t5_33dd6

Im not saying you are but Im saying to focus on YOU instead. Instead of wondering why hes doing this stuff wonder why youre tolerating it. The worst thing I couldve done was told my ex I was not going to stop being friends with another ex and it was the best thing I did.

3759703,0,t3_33cvt3,Youve been so helpful to me with your advice Cookie. I dont know if I have anything to give other than my empathy and support. You are in an incredibly difficult situation thats for sure.I wonder if you are contextualizing this particular experience as an escalation that raises the bar on what you expect from her in the future? I wonder if it actually is or not. My experience with my BPD inlaws is that like your wife any great deviation from their regular routine like a vacation is incredibly disregulating. When something like this happens they can get back to their normal environment and go back to their normal state of being as if the whole thing never happened. Back home in their normal controlled environment the chance of another blowup at that level is probably not very likely. Of course you know your wife better than I do so maybe this isnt the case.Thinking about practical things I dont know if youve done this already but have you considered talking to a lawyer in your home country and seeing if theres anything you can do to establish a case where you could bring your son there and not face any extradition? I cringe at this even as I write it. I think this would be a very very last resort. Maybe the recording idea could be used to prove what you are saying to the legal system in your home country?

4311826,0,t1_cs9um9p,I remember one fight in particular. She just had her own flat by that time because we agreed living together isnt a good idea when she packs her suitcase every two weeks and leaves strange how she understood that. One thing that was still missing in her new flat was a bed. In the week of moving into the flat she had an episode and once more told me to go to the devil and that its over of course saying its all my fault. I remember how she once more emotionally destroyed me with messages and emails. She also tried guilt tripping by telling me she will have to sleep on the floor because theres no bed yet. I was angry hurt frustrated tired... but even in moments like that i felt responsible... its one of my biggest issues i think that i have a helpers complex. What does a normal person do after their SO just walked out on them and gave them an emotional lecture about how you are the worst person in the world and they wouldnt care if you are dead?Well heres what i did I left work that afternoon and spent the afternoon moving an old bed from the attic to her new flat she was working i had a key. I didnt just bring it there... i moved it including pillows and blanket set it up put new covers and everything. That evening she wrote me shes sorry and how cute it was that i put the bed there... she was the nice girl with puppy eyes again... i took her back of course. A few days later she stumbled over the next mistake that made me a horrible person again and the cycle repeated once more. I have narcistic tendencies but much more i struggle with having to much empathy and with this helper syndrome.

4338533,0,t1_cseo440,This sounds like my SO too.  The only time I remember him being overly happy was the first two years or our relationship. He was happy all the time and it was one of the reasons I fell for him since I had previously been in relationships with people that tended to be more depressive.  Then a falling out with his family about . years into our relationship triggered him into this downward spiral and Ive rarely seen him happy in the . years since not even for our wedding or the birth of our child.  The BPD has also come out in full force since then. He went on antidepressants earlier this year which has helped the depression considerably but happiness didnt replace it only this numbness. That could also be because our relationship is in such shambles.,BPDlovedones,cseokpc,2,t5_33dd6

Remember that all Cluster B NPD BPD etc are very interrelated so there is no way to separate these very well. In RBN the mods are clear that Narcissism is very broadly defined. It doesnt just mean NPD but more generally parents that put themselves first before their children. This definition can include BPD parents. RBN has a very strong community with lots of contributors and good moderation. Also without sidebar linking from rbpd or one of those it might be difficult to gain traffic for the sub.I do wish the best for the sub and I cant think of anyone better to moderate it than you. Im just wondering about the logistics and how it all fits within the other communities.I think the mail problem with rBPDlovedones and how BPDs are participating in a triggering way here is that the mod hasnt provided any guidelines nor is active.

5043993,0,t3_3jzsik,Several years ago my supervisor told me about BPD in a random conversation about psychiatric disorders. She said if it didnt quite fit in any category like schizophrenia bipolar or if I just couldnt put my finger on it then it might be borderline. She told me people with BPD are incredibly difficult to live with but didnt really elaborate on it. I wish I would have paid more attention to her that night.Fast forward to a last year when her words came to me after a particular awful fight between my boyfriend and I. I started researching BPD and it described him to the letter. It honestly felt so good. I had been blaming myself for his behavior and at that point I was feeling pretty suicidal.It took a few more months for me to realize that he had no intention of seeing a therapist much less acknowledge there was anything wrong with him. ,BPDlovedones,cutzqr4,1,t5_33dd6

5106816,0,t3_3kqx0a,As most of us here can I can INFINITELY relate to what occurred once you moved in with her.  My wife was this beautiful latina passionate freespirited fun and recharging to be around when we dated.  We met at church.  I had two years earlier turned my life around from something similar to codependence we didnt have sex or move in until after marriage which was a first for me but I was trying to be a different good man.  Anyway the minute THE MINUTE we were married.. everything changed.  My awesome girlfriend was bodyswapped with this BPD wife Ive lived with since.  Ive been reamed about leaving a wet sponge in the sink numerous times different inane things.  Ive found the humor in her bashing and demeaning me about an insignificant thing then OBSERVE her doing it THE SAME DAMN WAY AS ME at a later time...  The first night in the same bed she swung her legs and arms like a toddler in a tantrum because she couldnt sleep and wanted to go to an old guys house she previously lived at.  From that moment forward our stories shared similar arcs.  Ours started at married so I was already hitched.  Being this new good man I believed in treating my wife like myself but I thought it meant putting her first.. It doesnt I wasnt treating her like me I treated myself like and let her absolute crap at the time.  I just wanted to say that your experience is incredibly relatable.  You arent crazy you arent wrong you arent the problem here but it is extremely useful to do as you are and look at  be responsible for your role or how you respond and handle things.  You are in fact tremendously inciteful and self inspective.  You are very much on the right track and you see this problem with the clarity it cost me years to purchase.  Also I think you are right.  As much as I shake my head at myself and my actions in past I am actually angrier at myself.  I cant be mad at my dog for being a dog and peeing wherever I let him get away with it.  I cant be mad at my wife for having the distorting perspective of her disorders she is diagnosed CPTSD and since she HATES that I think shes BPD her therapist reassured her forget the disorder in BPD just know you have A LOT of VERY STRONG BPD traits.  I can only be mad at myself for letting her shit all over me.  Im not even mad at my wife anymore not as a baseline I get mad when she acts unacceptable then I deal with the act and process that usually.  But I am mad at myself.  I cant help but look at your and my role as grownass men and see that I had a STRONG role in all of this.  I was NEVER a victim unless I chose to be.. how screwed up is that?!  I was always in control of myself and when I felt she controlled manipulated hurt and used me every time was only because I GAVE her that power and then LET HER.  Me.  I chose it every step of the way.  My wife can be deranged.  She has real issues that I nearly let destroy me but I would be lying though if I didnt say if I wasnt the cause of the problems in our marriage they are things I allowed.. Most importantly I am the ONLY ONE responsible for my emotions how I feel and what I let influence or in my life words and actions.  We are only as much of the problems we talk about in these relationships as these spouses are IF we let ourselves be and you are NOT anymore.  Not only that but shame on us since presumably we dont have a personality disorder.  Then when I really accept that and I read posts from some of the AMAZING users here that were BPDs children it really hits home.  If my son is ever abused or neglected.. if he ever deals with these challenging behaviors and the untenable situations of her construction.. the loselose options.. being made responsible for her emotions before he learns how to or is old enough to healthily decline..  Everything he might face is MY FAULT.  Im the one without a personality disorder who ALLOWED the same codependent qualities you described undermine my life and in that I CHOSE those things for my son IF I allow them in the future.  The longer we wait the more time we are NOT responsible for ourselves the longer we are the victim the harder it is and more consequences to take over when we get back in the drivers seat.  Its like waiting to grab the wheel until the car has spiked tires and is moments from going over the guardrail.  I am SO glad for where you are now Im extremely happy that you see the things you see at this stage.  You are ahead of the curve buddy.  Its never too late to stand up and start living a life we can respect and enjoy but I am so happy you arent legally married dont have kids it hasnt been years of abuse hollowing you out not to minimize one year of abuse.  I just think you are at a very good point to keep learning about yourself from the lessons she gave you to turn things around and to benefit from this whole shitty experience at relatively little cost or consequences hopefully.Sorry to ramble.. I believe that tagline apology is pretty worthless of me since I always do anyway but your post was very well done.  You are very wise and on the right track to so strongly be looking at and accepting your role.  That is what we need to do and it is very difficult.Please dont keep putting off moving out if you believe this relationship is not worth the toll it has and will take.  ,BPDlovedones,cv1k94l,5,t5_33dd6

I was the asshole somehow for caring about her offing herself and wanting to prevent it but still not be with her. That said aside from the freak out with the cops you got out clean.

5444634,0,t3_3pmsxd,I want to ask if you are me in totally cliche redditstyle.So many of these things ring true. I ended up diagnosed with PTSD last year. Leaning towards CPTSD with avoidant tendencies. My relationship was a little shorter. Not much.gtI would feel like this was a nobrainer if it were one of my friends asking me. I would say look shes great and all that I get it but shes ruining your life and you only get one. Do you want to be a crazy scared old man who has been emotionally abused by a woman his whole life? No? Then you gotta leave her.This is how I felt too and I understand how you feel here. I spent a long time thinking my situation was different. I think each person has to address this part individually and decide when enough is enough.I was not a kept person but I understand what you mean. I treated our finances as a partnering and that was a mistake. She cleaned out our accounts when we separated so I may as well have been.Does she know? My exwife was aware she was BPD and hid it very well. This is a really interesting distinction that I think will change how things go forward for you.Would she be receptive to counseling both with you and on her own? My experience with my exwife was she was receptive to anything she could control. Couples counseling decidedly out of her control she made into a shitstorm and if I was required by an act of Congress to go back through it with her I would have figured out a way for her to do a minimum of six months on her own.The child plays a huge role in all of this. I spent a great deal of time focused on her actually still do and I had to learn the lesson that I couldnt set myself on fire JUST to keep her warm. You really do have to set yourself up for success and good health here in order to do the same for your kid.gtIts done so much damage to me emotionally. If I left today I feel like Id need  years of therapy to be anywhere close to normal ever again. So many years of having everything Ive said twisted and contorted into some evil hypercritical jab having her defend herself with claws out during events that basically werent even happening having her tell me that literally everything I think is wrong being shut down any time I open my mouth about anything.  years.You do. You need therapy support etc to get through this. Dont think of it as failure. Dont think of it as one more awful thing. You need to figure out how to do this no matter what else you do.The eat a bullet thing has to be addressed. You cant lay your existence on your kids back for long. Been there done that. I know Stop Walking on Eggshells is the big recommend. I also am aware those guys have eyes here. I am not going to bash that book but it was a mistake in my situation. The books that helped me more in hindsight or after the fact completely were I Hate YouDont Leave Me. and Games People Play.I also am still reading about the six pillars of PTSD and I am constantly reading about my kids relationship with her mom my exwife and constantly trying to find ways to deal with Boundaries. I dont have a great Boundaries book recommendation yet but I am working on that.You are in a precarious situation. I have stood in almost exactly your shoes and I am out on the other side alive and keeping a positive attitude keeping up with my therapists using an antidepressant rebuilding my social group learning a new career.Start with Does she know? Would she be willing to do anything about it? Then start making choices....do you take the left fork in the road where you go through counseling and try and make things work or do you take the right fork in the road where you separate and move on?Editing to add this The reason you have to start with Does she know? based on my experience and watching a friend who has an NPDBPD wife go through diagnostics is. If they dont know and you have any level of PTSD or CPTSD the very first thing you are going to have deal with is six months to two years of YOU being the one with a problem. This is actually true. You probably are suffering from some form of disorder but I have read countless internet stories of the projection being the biggest problem with selfawareness. If her mom had it and shes aware shes prone to it theres less of a delay in theory.,BPDlovedones,cw7lruv,5,t5_33dd6

5530943,0,t1_cwim47x,Ive snooped a little over the last ten or twelve years. Glancing at things I usually didnt want to see etc.She just admitted most everything to me. It was like pulling teeth in terms of the conversations but it would dribble out. Its messed with my head enough there was never any reason to stalk. I have looked at phones before but that was about my limit and that was usually just to confirm that I was not imagining that something sketch was going on. I have yet to be wrong on that stuff.I did have to hunt her down in a weird foreign city once to serve her with papers but the way it works with me is Once you are gone you can come back but I am not looking for you unless I need to serve you with papers or it relates to my child. Beyond that...dont let the door hit you and peace.I guess thats why I get fascinated with people hunting people down. I mean Ill make the immediate effort to fix thingscontact someone if a relationship has just ended but Im not going to come looking for you to do something like this. I dont look at their social media. In fact if they want me to see what they are doing and I feel uninvited almost every single one of my friends know you will have to find me take me by the hand and walk me to what you want me to see or email or mail it directly to me. Otherwise...I got Batstuff to do. LOLEdited to add My exwife worked for a major IT security service company and knew I would not only not monitor her but that I didnt give a crap about my own stuff. She would set up forwards on old emails etc as recently as late last year and do all sorts of weird ass shit to I knew how it felt to me and I just didnt do it back because its one thing to read my blog or look at my public Facebook its another ball of shit to go and read stuff that is not only an invasion of my privacy but used to her advantage to continue to manipulate me because shes sociopath. ,BPDlovedones,cwimkdg,1,t5_33dd6

5700206,0,t1_cx3aaao,gtI am alarmed at the frequencyYea.. Recently Ive been struck by it as well.  It certainly isnt everything she says but the times that my heart starts pumping and spidey sense is saying DANGERDANGER  conflict incoming... Not all the accusations not all the criticism not all the misconstrued perception of who I am..  but whenever Ive been feeling myself about to bubble up at her pokes Ive found it is typically during her projections.  I used to not see it but I believe on a more fundamental level what is highlighting it to me is that smack in the face that of all the things shell accuse and treat me as guilty of is her thing damnit!  lol.Hey guess what.  Just got back from a session with my wife and my therapist after a break midresponse here.  He spent awhile talking about how strong her sociopathic traits and while she probably isnt a sociopath he is totally sure she is also full blown BPD as he put it.  He also keeps trying to instill in me that it may soon be time to pull the pin grab the kid and run.  Not literally or as he put it.  He strongly believes she married me and has been exploding ever since for the exact same reason she said she this weekend before I told him.  That it is because she didnt get what she wanted my help on a specific legal thing.  That is and always was in reality a consequence of her behavior as I couldnt do it with her rebelling against me and pretend divorce all the time.  Anyway even aside from times I note her cold calculating emptyeyed empathylessness vacuum.  lol  Aside from those times.. he thinks and she admitted on her own she abused me because of AND prior to married me for that legal thing she wanted.  My wife even said because I didnt immediately do that amidst divorce threats and abuse even in the beginning and worse than now well because I didnt give her what she wanted was why she had to have a child as well.  She did it to help her legal position and to anchor me and in turn manipulate me.  Seriously.. She said these in a seemingly rare honest moment and he told me he believed that of her before I told him her admissions.I still feel like she loves me.. sometimes maybe?  I dont feel like she never has the capacity for empathy though she seemingly does never have the capacity for self reflection yet.  What is shocking to me is how her overarching behavior seems so intensional and poised for selfabsorbed reasons opposite to consideration or love or respect.  The times between the bad times the GOOD things getting married having a child even those seem to feel like they were in love but in her admissions and her therapists... have at least been partly motivated by sociopathic seeming drive toward her desires.,BPDlovedones,cx3nz8v,2,t5_33dd6

I know its easier said than done but try to separate the behavior from the person.  Sometimes this will be easy to do but there will be relationships where it will never be possible.

5735490,0,t3_3toi0n,I really enjoyed reading this Im still working my way through  As Im reading I keep wondering though  ...what dynamics make the psychic defense strategy or whatever different for the child of a BPD?    Like I so relate to not having had object constancy as a child and how that affects me today  as well as that anger which i conceive of as the instinctual reaction to being trapped in the impossible bind of being left with other peoples pain that inconveniently inhabits heir bodies  to me Ive always thought that such anger was appropriate and part of my healing requires i n theoryactually connecting to that anger which is mine to feel but which Im not actually in touch with...or dont feel entitled to andor dont want to feel because I cant tolerate feeling helpless anger towards others or something...Anyway  but Im curious what is it that affects whether that anger gets turned inward or outward?Or maybe that only FEELS like my question and maybe its not maybe its really a matter of rigidity??  Like what is it that makes this defense so rigid and what makes the difference between someone who can have these early psychic defenses and then play them out with other standins in their life...but ALSO learn to differentiate and release those feelings and experience new people in new ways...as opposed to a BPD who...cant?  Is that even accurate to say?I dunno...Same question with narcissists  how come theres a narcissist and then a narcissists child can be the inversion not automatically produce another narcissist....Or maybe  that part makes sense to me  what Im still trying to think through is  but how are the factors that created the N or BPD person different from what the N or BPD person enacts on their children?I mean if my mother aggressively displaced her stuff onto me and I struggle with misrecognizing other peoples anger and feelings as my own  is the only difference that...the BPD is actually PROPERLY angry at the correct source!!!? whereas I am too peoplepleasey to dare let my anger point outward and instead the defense mechanism working inside me leads me to buy into this mistaking other peoples shit for my own and blame myself instead??!In a way that makes me...upset and infuriated in a confusing way...like the BPDs defense mechanism  seems more...healthy in  that such anger is an accurate response to reality than my defense which seems to be imbued with denial !?  even though the resulting behaviors hurt others and are problematic in a way I wouldnt wish for.But I always say that if youre poisoned youre SUPPOSED to throw up  it looks prettier if you hold it in your mouth but its fucked up to blame the person throwing up for making everything messy...and suddenly Im confused like  Im also jealous because the BPD defense mechanism seems better at survival than my turnonmyselfandselfannihilate one....and Im angry to have those feelings because I wouldnt want to be a BPD or N...but...AAAAh.Ok just thinking aloud through those things theyve come up before...I hope that made any sense...Im not sure Im actually asking those questions or just theyre rising up out of some other particular point of confusion I cant yet identify to clear up...EDIT AGH I meant to PREFACE to say that Im still in process of reading and this was what was starting to come up  for me...so maybe more will come as I continue to read!,BPDlovedones,cx81l78,2,t5_33dd6

But if you do decide to leave the hardest part will be getting away from your wife. I dont know how much you know about bpd but very few people on here have had an amicable breakupdivorce. I imagine that it is going to be very bad for you Im sorry to have to tell you that. Better warned though right. Very seldomly do borderlines let go. Theyll Hoover you before during and after the split. But youve made the first step by realizing you cant live like you are for the rest of your life.  And I understand why youve stayed too. We all have. When shes normal it seems to excuse the times shes not. Right? Maybe your thinking of the beginning when everything was perfect? Well that time isnt coming back. It didnt even exist. Scary to think about huh? But what Im going to say next is pretty important. EXPECT THINGS TO GET VERY VERY UGLY. Divorces are difficult with normal sane individuals. With personality disordered individuals they are a nightmare. There are several members of this sub who have been falsely accused of DV thrown in jail had their kids and houses taken away their lives utterly ruined. Once you make the decision to leave youll need to plan. You really need to plan for war. I really feel this quote sums it up nicely. Rest assuredif your wife has shown you little to no empathy has treated you unfairly and made outrageous demands during your marriage she will be the same if not worse during your divorce. Even if she is the one who initiates the divorce this kind of woman typically has a seek and destroy attitude. You know too much about her and for that you must be punished and discredited.Good luck. ,BPDlovedones,cxfhxd1,14,t5_33dd6

But she has allied herself now with her father NPD possibly ASPD  who is the monster she hates the most in life and hasnt really talked to in more than a decade. Those in her family that know me but she didnt like spending time with and talked shit about well now she has reingratiated with them so im sure the smear campaign is deep. She even lied about my job situation and even custody status of me and son to the pediatrician and now he looks at me like im a horrible person even though son adores me and i took him regularly to the doctor. She has talked badly to our common friends really badly about me full of lies. One of them started asking around to see if it was all true he didnt know whom to believe. I just told him We have a high conflict separation and what she is saying isnt true. I could tell you my version of events but i dont want to talk badly about her because i dont want to affect your relationship with her and i dont want you to have to pick sides.. This friend came later to tell me that he thinks wife is crazy and thinks im the nice and sane one so he has decided to distance himself from her. I didnt have to say anything to convince him nor i wanted him to do this but damn it felt good to have at least someone see through her bullshit. Still she has tried very very hard to destroy my reputation and i can tell people are distant and look at me strangely.

6351984,0,t1_czbn5tl,My views regarding relationships have now become this  You must always be working to maintain your own stability  Anyone you pursue in a relationship should be doing the same for themselves  Your relationship should be in supporting the other person maintain their stabilityIn other words if someone cannot maintain their own stability the foundation of the relationship is going to be shaken from the get go.  It will be naturally unhealthy as one person will be lifting more weight eventually resulting in themselves being unable to maintain their own stability as they did previously.  There are cases yes where with help one can become better but you cannot help someone unless they know how to help themselves first.  That is very rare in pwBPD.  ,BPDlovedones,czbnewt,2,t5_33dd6
6360324,0,t1_czcfxtx,Ive always liked helping. Im also a problem solver Im very good at my job and solving problems. What I have learned is other people hate it when I try to solve their problems. At work several months ago a colleague was struggling with something I took a look into it and solved the issue on my own and emailed it out to a group. My colleague flipped out on me what I took from him was his chance to learn and grow. I probably did this in my relationshipmore thanI realized and my wife probably resented me for it. I was approval seeking and thats why I got married to begin with I wanted this womans approval so that was my codependent mindset do all I can for her to prove my worth however over time I lacked self worth and if I didnt value myself how could anyone else value me no matter how good i was to them.,BPDlovedones,czcljau,4,t5_33dd6

6709592,0,t1_d0crfhg,Wow! Love this post. bitterloaI guess Im kind of looking at her friendships she keeps with people in general. Her friends are always playfully yelling at her because she never firms up plans answers texts or phone calls.. Basically all of her friendships are based on when SHE wants to do something and when SHE wants to be there for people. Shes not a good friend to anyone. I guess I thought I was different. I mean hell even the person shes seeing now she blows him off and comes over here because I am currently the one she needs for her own selfish reasons. People with BPD are usually attractive its a common fact I think.  I dont date unattractive women but my ex was my dream woman. I cant stress that enough. It was like I made her up. Looks voice sexuality.. everything about her was just what I desired.. Boiled down to it though? It was just her looks everything she else she faked until she couldnt fake it anymore and I saw the real her. Shes so off target from what I want. Ive seen her exes and maybe one of them was on my level they broke up and he came out all the other guys no. Maybe thats why she never went back to the exes when she was with me. I wish I had a better understanding of my brain because I would love to know how to stop putting her in this light where she could be all I wanted her to be its just not her. ,BPDlovedones,d0dbv54,1,t5_33dd6

6879299,0,t3_49zadu,gt Would you recommend the Stop Walking on Eggshells book to someone like me?Yes definitely. This book is not only about dealing with pwPDs its about facing and accepting your role and actions in the relationship. Our relationships with pwPDs can teach us many bad coping mechanisms as well as symptoms reflecting both PTSD and CPTSD. I was attracted to few items in your post. The first gt I still walk on eggshells in my closest relationshipsandgtno amount of intellectual understanding of the situation seems to undo the developmental damage she put upon me from birthandgtUsually I just panic insteadAll of these speak to me of hypervigilance and of course walking on eggshells. Both of these are symptoms of cPTSD. Can you relate to this?Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is a psychiatric condition caused by severe lifethreatening trauma such as witnessing a death or natural disaster. Complex PTSD describes a more severe and longterm condition that can occur after prolonged and repeated trauma particularly in childhood.I would say you qualify for the second.

But then again if it that were the case would she have reacted like this? You didnt say you accused her of something you asked her something. Unless you were loudly accusing her of being a hypocrite? If my boyfriend asked me something unless he was giving an edict or was angry Id be sensitive to his feelings. Unless I had something to hide. Even if he was being an expletive I wouldnt suddenly dump him or block him out of my life even early in dating. Now that I think about it if anything she wanted the freedom to explore and was being passiveaggressive about it she found a reason to blow a fuse so she could freely explore her sexuality. While having the benefit of keeping you on ice for later. And while her behavior is clearly BPD this type of a blow up in a LTR as an excuse to date others is not even a BPD thing thats common experience in LTRs.

Hah. Hes protective like I am. I love my dad. But months later shed spout off about him not liking her. About how my dad looked at her funny or some other bs she made up in her head. At some point trying to be supportive of her insecurities stopped being cute and I saw it for the disdain and disrespect that it really was. My family treated her like royalty and sadly as I look back she never had one good thing to say about them. Then again she spoke negatively of her family as well but I spent a lot of time with them and they were such wonderful people. Its hard because on one hand you want to try and make your SO feel comfortable but at the end of the day I had to realize that basically fk her...my family means a lot to me and while it must be hard thinking everybody hates you at some point this way of thinking just makes you plain disrespectful to people who have only shown you love.

Then starts guilting you since you proved hes unlovable.  How lovable he is or not is solely his responsibility.  Then he baits you by implying hes already over you and ready to take the next major step in his life.  As if he couldnt do that on his own anyway while he was with you.  Its also a scarcity tactic so he appears more valuable.Then he goes back to guilting and also shaming you saying you became a worse person with him and now need to grow into a better person now that youre not together.  Then the coup de grace he simultaneously guilts obligates blames invalidates and baits saying you lied because you left him for any reason besides cheating.The rest is just reinforcing his scarcity tactic.  Oh and of course he couldnt end it without one last belittling insult in case you dont take the bait.These are all my opinions of course but Id say dont respond at all.  If you cant help yourself then only say something terse and unfeeling Actually I dont need any luck. Ive done fairly well without it but thanks anyway! Bye! jvalkx.

7793314,0,t3_4m0u20,I think it was you that makes some of the gambling references and its true. You keep playing because youre going to win again some time even if you end up under water. Those good times were so good for me I felt like it was logical that it could be sustained long term in a healthy relationship. What it really was was that I needed my fix and I would accept the punishment for it.To me it relates to the idea that if you love someone you do anything to make it work which to me is toxic and contributes to the victimization cycle. Statements like that are not really used as often as you would think in the healthy sense meaning that you dont just break up because of a fight. Especially bad with people that are already vulnerable to be victimized. It puts the onus on the victim to stay until things get better not the unhealthy person to actually work on themselves.I mean the true healthy meaning behind the sentiment is that you do everything to make it work within your power you dont just leave because of a fight or they get cancer and you dont wait for them to magically get better themselves. But there are a lot of subtleties within there such as whether other person loves you back how you define love how they treat you how they view you if they respect you if they actually like you whether they are actually invested in making it work or whether they are just staying around because you are.Working on it is a twoway street.,BPDlovedones,d3s0yrl,5,t5_33dd6

7941807,0,t1_d48p0fr,From personal experience it can get really really fucking bad.  It could also not be so bad.. but my money is on bad if she has BPD.  I cant reiterate enough  Document every single thing she says and does.  Record it if it is legal to do so.  Once you gather sufficient evidence against her take your baby and run.  Dont buy into suicide threats guilt trips or threats against you.  Dont let her be unsupervised with the baby until a judge orders so.  This marriage is over the only thing salvageable right now is your baby.  I think I attract codependent men in relationships either that or the majority of women are massively fucked up I hope not.. The reason I say this is because nearly all of the men Ive dated have had exes use their children against them in various degrees.   of them had to give up and drop contact with their children altogether.  Including my current husband.    Theres only so much a person can take before they break.  Remember this  Mothers with BPD have no boundaries.  She can and will do anything in her power to absolutely wreck your life and that includes wrecking her own child as well see rraisedbyborderlines for examples.  I hope that eventually the legaljustice system catches on to this shit to BPD type behavior and that more men are granted custody of their children.  Until then fight and dont give up untilunless your own life is on the line I say life because sometimes this shit drives fathers to suicide deep depression substance abuse jail or homelessness.  If it comes down to that you have to let go and have faith that your son will see everything clearly in time.  If it helps or brings comfort remember that I believe you.  Im guessing everyone reading this post also believes you.  We all know what its like.  Even if your ex has gaslighted everyone around her into thinking you are the bad guy or that you are the abuser.. We all know better.  Stay strong!  ,BPDlovedones,d48qejk,1,t5_33dd6

Its just that even with the drama and maybe some stabs back and forth both parties process their emotions at the same time and genuinely try to move on with their lives. Even then gestures of anger arent nearly as big or harsh. Even when it goes the other way when people split amicably they take a break from each other.

Especially when the person effected by BPD wont go to therapy?A desire to change is a necessary condition of successful therapy. You cant help him. Hes going to have to want to change. Even then if he has a personality disorder hes facing an uphill battle. Theres no therapy that will fix an unwilling participant. The good news so to speak is that you can begin to establish and enforce your boundaries. Ultimately you get to decide whether youre going to tolerate his behavior. If he crosses the line you can respond. I highly recommend you seek individual counseling and focus on your well being. In the case that someone might point to an intervention Id point out that an intervention is a sort of extreme boundary enforcing. Youre getting a bunch of people together to say were no longer enabling you. The success of any resulting therapy still up to the participant. ,BPDlovedones,d4qoq1u,8,t5_33dd6
8106758,0,t3_4q83cv,I can really identify with the its all about me attitude  continually.   In fact I have a mantra I repeat to him every time he evidences that mentality by his actions  I will say Its NOT  all about you.  Well  lets  see  lots and lots of yelling about basically nothing.  Like because I ate the last brownie  when there are still  brownies left. I refuse to walk on eggshells anymore  and I have basically given up on trying to please him.   He sets me up for disappointment.   Example I visit him at his store workplace and ask him if he wants me to bring him some food.   So he says  make me a pie   so my daughter and I go home  make him a pumpkin pie  which  I know he loves  and bring him a slice of it.   Upon giving it to him  rather than Thank you like a normal person  he whines about how small the piece is.   His coworkers even noticed it.   It is constant nowin situations like that that make me just want to give up and quit trying to please him  at all.  He has dragged our family through numerous moves  some without a job to support it.  He has made several major financial debt problems for us.   He even forced us all to go to several churches with him  which I never would have wanted to be in.   Conservative Mennonite  Charity plain churches  home church fellowships.   He basically forced me to apply for a job in his workplace by setting up the interview  for me with the PR  person when I didnt want to work in the same place he did.  It resulted in me getting the job  being injured therebroken wrist and then fired for being injured.   The company put me on their do not rehire list because I took the same unadvised shortcut to the bathroom at breaktime that several other workers also took and I cant get a job because of him  now.   note that this was my first job in over  years and it was forced upon me while I was still dressed like a Mennonite basically Amish and recently after leaving those churches which teach that a wife must be a stay at home mom  also recently after having aortic valve replacement surgery  finding out that I had hypothyroidism  moving to a new town because of losing our home to the bank and his new employment and shortly after a miscarriage  as well.   I was ridiculously  stressed out at that time  and he took literally no care for me or my health  and my medications needed adjustment and since I had been a homemaker and homeschooler before that.   Not too promising.   He signed himself up for online college classes and health insurance when we were still in the Mennonite  church by the way  a really big nono  for members of that church ..  Anyhow  as you can see  the mindfuckery was real!   Also a couple years after that  he drops out of his online conservative  Christian University   leaving us another  thou in the hole  with no degree  and then starts sexting other women.  I found out when he accidentally sent a text to my daughter meant for the other woman even calling her sweetie  honey  baby  and her name.   My daughter sent me a copy of this text  so that is how I found out he was having an emotional affair.    Of course this wasnt the first time.   He had one time moved without a job to another place to avoid physically cheating on me to protect the marriage  kind of like Joseph running from Potiphars wife.   Anyhow the lies and deceit gave me a nervous breakdown  and I was in bed for about a week from a panic attack  .   I finally asked him in a weak calm voice why does he hate me so much?  He lied to get me to marry him  he has kept on lying throughout our marriage  and I have done nothing but good to him.  It was killing me.   But..  Christians stay married and work on their problems.   So  I am mostly over that.   It has been  years since that  and we have both worked on it  but mostly  me  because I still have PTSD and trust issues  from all of that.   I recently got on here and discovered that what he has been doing to me is emotional and psychological abuse  with gaslighting.  I figured out that he must have BPD  although he wont get a psych evaluation  because he doesnt believe in psychology  and thinks Jesus can change him.   Never mind that he has done nothing to work on this change.   It is wierd  but with all our debt  I know I will be required to pay it if we divorce  and I am unemployed.  We have  teenage children.   They know about Dads problems  and cant wait to move out when they are old enough and ready. Until then  they think I am their hero to stick it out for their sake.   Anyhow  educating myself on what has been going on all these years with him has been the best thing I have done to see what is really going on.   All the gaslighting is now easily visible to me.   I am learning techniques like medium chill and emotional distancing. I swear I should win an Academy Award for acting sometimes  and setting up boundaries for myself walking out of the house or car if necessary to get away from his yelling and BS. ,BPDlovedones,d4r9t9u,5,t5_33dd6

8194453,0,t1_d51u8vy,My ex went through  lawyers during our divorce.  Because of her sister I have insight into what happened.  Each time she changed lawyers it was because the lawyer didnt want to deal with her anymore she was too irrational and wouldnt take their advice.  Even the final lawyer quit on her and delegated her case down to a junior lawyer in the firm so she also used four different lawyers.  You could tell the lawyer was just going through the motions by the end.Your situation sounds bad but I can tell you my ex had her sister on her side through the divorce but after the divorce after dealing with my ex her sister demanded she get therapy.  When that didnt happen and her behavior only got worse her sister went no contact with her at that point too.  So I guess Im saying dont be surprised if your exs daddy gets tired of her shit through this divorce.  You can only see your side of things but behind the scenes when her lawyers tell her how to get the most out of the divorce and she just wants you and everything else to burn down the lawyers and her daddy will tire of trying to counsel her.,BPDlovedones,d51ux40,6,t5_33dd6

8338681,0,t3_4tr49a,Watching porn makes me feel loved.This one has a storyWe grew up in a conservative NRM and had an arranged marriage. Within a year of us living together on our own I started finding evidence of pornwatching on the computer. It was never something I was outright searching for I would just get assaulted with evidence of some sort of aggressive binge every once and a while and bring it up with him. He would say he had a problem and needed to get help and then that would be the end of the conversation. I dont know what he meant by help but he certainly never got any. Then a little while later Id get hit again with it only it was in a new way every time so it was clear that he was making an effort to hide it but only to the extent that he knew I had found out the last time  e.g. he started clearing his viewing history but not his search history and then he would clear both but forget about the fact that YouTube pulls up suggestions based on your viewing habits on its front page etc.Thing was  I didnt personally have much of an issue with porn. I am nonjudgmental by default. If he had owned it and decided that thats something he wanted to engage in I likely would have been OK with it. Maybe even joined him. It was just the inability to have a discussion about it and the yoyos of denial and selfpity that were starting to scare me and wear on me. Its like if your husband had a female friend most moderately secure women would be fine with it in principle  but it gets worrisome when they are obviously actively hiding any calls or texts or meetings with this friend from you especially when if you call him out on the several hourslong conversations they apparently had at am this past week he then resorts to apologizing for having female friends at all. I eventually started to press him on why it was happening.He then told me he typically went on porn binges at night at times when I was sick or sad because he didnt feel loved. What? What? I should point out here that he was apparently exclusively watching girlongirl gonzos. I couldnt figure out how it all jibed. I also was rather hurt by the insinuation that I was at fault somehow  I mean I had been right there and these were at times when I clearly was in need of care and attention. I had been sending for a while that his affection at those times was unfulfilling somehow I was clearly right. He was emotionally shutting down while making all sorts of racket about caring for me and then abandoning me to binge porn at the earliest opportunity.But that became his regular line  I wasnt feeling loved I was lonely It makes me feel loved.Meanwhile I was the one getting slowly and covertly starved for affection.,BPDlovedones,d5jw14l,2,t5_33dd6
8500864,0,t1_d642z87,gt In the only future with them I want to be a part of they have learned to take care of themselves and express their emotions and anger more in line with what is expected of adults or at least is constructive communication. This is very familiar to me. I spent the last year hoping this of my stbxBPDh to no avail. I begged pleaded threatened and saw absolutely no change in his behavior. He has no interest in changing so I changed and got out. I had no alternative. The energy your spending on your BPD will grow over the years. I pretty much gave up on doing anything other than go to work and come home. My home was a disaster and all I wanted to do is sleep. Hes been gone for about two months now and I feel so much lighter. The best advice I can give is to move on and find a good therapist to help you understand this relationship and how to avoid it in the future. It will be hard because you love them but please understand that unless they get some heavy duty help and are willing to do the work to get better they cannot love you back no matter how many times they say they do.I wish you the best in your journey.

8716578,0,t1_d6uz8ep,Forgiveness implies repentance.Christ forgives sinners as they offer sincere repentance. He calls for repentance in scripture. Otherwise if you have forgiveness without repentance you get the Ill just accept Jesus on my death bed after a full life of murderin and whorin conundrum the Hitlers in Heaven thing which leads to an utterly foul in my opinion theology whereby only blind faith matters and works character and intent absolutely do not.People in our culture these days tend to browbeat abuse victims with relentless pleas to forgive especially the abusers themselves do this they want off the hook. Theyll say things like Why cant you just let it go?! But hes faaaaaammmilyyy! Forgiveness is about you not them or you cant drink poison and expect the other person to die. Stuff like that. And then look down on you as if youre a little bit less ethical than them if you so much as hesitate to do so.So they push forgiveness on you. Enablers want to avoid any discomfort and abusers want off the hook and they like any opportunity to appear holierthanthou narcs are attracted to religion like flies to stink for this very reason.Without sincere repentance however to forgive is to empower the abuser by minimizing ones own selfrespect. It is to say I dont value myself or what happened to me is not that big a deal.But sometimes you do matter and what happened is a big deal goddamnit!!! And in my opinion without repentance no forgiveness should be given. Ive thought long and hard about this. To do so is a position of cowardice. Its a giving up of ones right to assert ones claim to safety and freedom from abuse physical or otherwise. Its choosing the easier path. It is a giving up an allowing oneself to be defeated.I say NAY! Without repentance I will NEVER FORGIVE NEVER FORGET.Without sincere repentance if I die today and Jesus shows up and asks me to forgive my ex before entering Heaven I will choose an eternity in Hell rather than spend one minute in paradise with that vile conniving clovenhoofed hippopotamus. At least Satan is a rational narcissist  him I can deal with. He has better music too. ,BPDlovedones,d6v7lv4,5,t5_33dd6

8930628,0,t3_52lvov,Just a warning people dont end up on this board unless something is seriously wrong in their relationships.  Many people on this board have had police called on them while their BPDSO makes a false police report of Domestic Violence or Assault.  Many careers here have been lost or diminished because the BPDSO needed and needed and needed.  My wife used to make me feel guilty for going to work because she needed me on X or Y day for different things.  She still tries to make me feel guilty for not taking more time off to do things that she considers more important than making sure I keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.  She doesnt work mind you.  No one here disputes the fact that pwBPD are humans but many here have been physically and emotionally scarred by their past experiences.  When people show up to this board they are often bewildered and confused wondering if things will get better if they just love their BPDSO more.  Weve been through months and years of verbal and emotional abuse isolation from friends and family sometimes physical abuse.  But the most common thing you see over and over is that the people here still want to try to help their SO they are willing to bend over backwards if it would mean their SO would get the help they need.  And one by one each of us comes back here and posts the story of how BPDSO continues the abuse pushes back the issues on us cant even handle being told by us that we think they have a problem.  You see over and over how people are pushed closer and closer to their breaking points while they try to figure out how to protect themselves and their children.  The healthier the users on this sub get the more their SOs lash out the more their SOs try to guilt them.  Not because a BPDSO likes to see someone else in pain but because the BPDSO can only see their own pain and not really feel the pain they are inflicting on the rest of us.  Almost all of the BPDSOs you see posted about here are undiagnosed and aggressively refusing treatment of any kind.  The fact that you have a diagnosis and can even admit to problems you had in the past puts you in a whole different field than the pwBPD who send people to this sub.  As for my own experience Im married  years now to a person who might be bpd or it might be cptsd with bpd symptoms.  Either way she had me convinced enough that if only I could show her I loved her more than things would be ok except the more I tried and tried the more I found out it would never be enough.  I didnt feel right again until i stopped listening to what she said and started searching for the truth.  I used to walk on the tiniest eggshells imagineable thinking I was the reason she flew off the handle so much.  I used to accept that her cussing and belittling me were a valid form of her expressing herself to me.  In a giant twist of irony now that I dont put up with her guilt trips anymore now that Ive enforced strong boundaries about profanity and belittling she actually seems the happiest shes ever been.  But inside I have to handle her like I handle my children you dont feed the tantrums and you explicitly model good behavior because they dont know any better.  Its exhausting but at least I feel whole again.People here need this sub to help them climb out of the FOG and if part of that is letting out all the hostility theyve kept bottled up for years then it cant all be positive.

She said shed be willing to kill her whole family for me. I think she would have.Not that its a hard classificationanalysis but I think those MBTI things are impressively predictive. She was ISTJ Im INFJ. I think we superficially represented a complement for eachother. She was preppypopularconfidentperfectionistinternally traumatizedslightlypsychopathicat uni I was greasy hesher townie in community college that I think projected an air of innocence.I think she was able to idealize me and I was able to see her largely for what she was. The contradiction being I didnt match up to her vague idealization and psychopathy doesnt have an off switch.  I think we made an emotional connection across the superficial stuff but the evil in us resonated. Im some sort of narcissist and the lookingdown aspect of her idealization of me always rubbed me the wrong way from the start.  Strange thing with sex that seems to jive with BPD is that it died down but then I got in shapecut hair. She went from  to  and I went from  to .. Sexual intimacy was basically evaporated but she became way more into experimental kinky shit. I guess I became man on the side or something around then so she was able to objectify me for freaky shit.I dont want anything to do with her but honestly.... if I had the choice even if I was with someone else Id probably want her genes for reproduction.Ive spent last near decade as vagrant with her as my only lifeline to society. Getting into a good uni and thus not needing her seemed to accelerate the apocalypse. I feel like I encountered too much concentrated evil to love another person.Id like companionship but next relationship I think Im just going to lie about everything and cheat every opportunity.Look at redpill ignoring the overwhelming stupid bullshit and deadbedrooms BPD is just human nature exaggerated and anyone thats been with one of these demons needs to learnaccept that if they dont take what they want from other people its not going to stop other people taking what they want from them. ,BPDlovedones,d8az1ay,0,t5_33dd6

Someone would get branded as such after committing specific typically very heinous crimes. To this day researchers describe psychopathy in contradictory terms  they cant seem to decide whether a psychopaths cant feel anything or b feel only negative emotions but very strongly. Some conceptualize psychopaths as hyperrational and talented at scheming some say they are emotionally unhinged and are very poor thinkersplanners. Some say sociopath and psychopath are two different categories some use them interchangeably. Some think sociopath  NPD and psychopath  ASPD.

I just plan my out my time better and dont dink around like she does.  She actually jumped ahead of me in a questline once because I was doing something with the kids then complained I wasnt at the same part as her so I went to catch up but accidentally passed her because she didnt tell me exactly where she stopped.  This left her on a hard to do part for her chosen character she had the gall to get upset at me because I left her behind.  At least Im making her more self aware because in talking to her I got her to admit that she didnt really think I did it on purpose and that she was only really upset because she was having problems with the hard part and because Id already passed it I couldnt go back and help her.  Thats progress from how it used to go.  But she will do the watch ahead thing with animes we download too.

9515216,0,t1_d9lxfu4,Now yes but it is not the ideal happiness. It is the happiness you get when a headache stops. I wont ever be the type of happy that a healthy couple experiences but I made my peace with that. Acceptance and making peace with ones self is critically important to recover and make the relationship work. Im working a lot on getting to understand BPD and my wife. I also worked a lot on understanding myself and how I can better protect myself emotionally while not requiring my wife to change too much. Ive grown immune to the things she says and it helped BOTH of us. For example when shed criticise me or insult me I would get angry and wed have this cold war for a week or worse if a feedback loop has started Insulting each others forgetting how it even started. Now when she does something BPD that would normally anger me I stay cool. Because I stay cool and go on about my day she has no stimuli to continue being upset and that defuses her and she returns to a neutral composure within a reasonable amount of time.That being said I only tolerate the relationship because I am now more in control and it would be healthier for her and the kids that I play the role of a dad and caretaker. I managed to protect myself after all. Had you put me  years back No kids no marriage no house I would have ran as far as I could and never looked back.In your case you have nobody to protect except yourself there is no reason to stay with him other than to protect the next unsuspecting woman that would get into a relationship with him.

9551835,0,t1_d9q8cn0,A lot of people who provide additional analysis dont believe in personality disorders in the first place. More importantly there is no challenge in analysis to change their behavior. Uncovering past traumas is helpful to anybody but with BPD it does not change the unconscious process. DBT is not perfect and there is no actual cure. However it is one of the few therapies designed for BPD and its therapy evading weaknesses provides tools for their specific problems and and forces patients to confront their own behavior in group therapy with other people with BPD.I guess you have to practice radical acceptance a DBT Buddhism and other sources based concept. You have to accept that this is who your partner is and theyre not willing to change and you have to accept it or leave.,BPDlovedones,d9qglpb,3,t5_33dd6

It takes the right combination of styles personalities interests. With BPD the need for a specific combination or set of traits in our partner is even more pronounced. Its not about you being less than worse or inferior to a guy who your ex may be compatible with. Hes just different in some way that enables it to work. The people who can make it work with a BPD partner didnt know something you didnt or try harder or were stronger or smarter. Their natural way was like having the right key for a very unusual lock. I can promise you that some of the traits you would have needed would drive a nonBPD partner nuts but are calming to those with BPD. Really do not think you did something wrong. This also applies to relationships between  healthy people. Both can be wonderful but together it just wouldnt work out. If they end up happy for the long haul dont let it eat at you. You are perfect for a lot of women and youll find the one who makes you glad that you let this one go. I guess one last thing that is maybe worth considering. When someone feels rejected by a disordered person the healthy person can find them self thinking They are so messed up and IM not good enough for them? Dont fall into that.

My pwBPD was important to me too so Ive been down this road before. This story isnt all woe is me however. I blew things a bit out of proportion. The night went fine it just seemed off for a bit and I carried those vibes along with me. I ended up feeling really really anxious for a while. I can only identify this anxiety with the last year that I was with her and she was basically ignoring me while I was worried sick because she kept telling me how depressed and lifeless she felt. It also doesnt help that she had several inappropriate emotional relationships with people that I knew and perhaps physical ones with others? Sex had completely stopped and she showed almost no affection towards me in the last  months. Meh.My main thing is that my ex already has flung off of the handle. I dont see how anyone could think that her behavior in the last  years has been appropriate and Im dubious about the severity of issues. In my mind she could be a total sociopath.

Which regard to your friends it can be isolating day for you you will not lose them all it will just be awkward for a little while. Even if they have some knowledge they dont understand BPD completely. Think about how hard it is for people to understand it here. In the beginning its easier to be suspicious of you because that seems more logical given how emotional she is.To be completely frank what will happen is that provided you keep firm in your no contact she will start to irritate and grate on people in her obsession.

10256275,0,t3_5mlec6,Reading this has been really validating. My SO wBPD has struggled with unemployment for the past year. They have been having a rough year dealing with substance abuse amp the death of their best friend overdose. They have aspirations about being an actor they are talented but not the most motivated. They are great at landing roles that they want but not great at applying for grants or creating their own work.Over the past year I have encouraged and supported them to look for regular work to get off welfare or Centrelink as known as in Australia. Its only been recently through a lot of pushing from me that they have landed a festival job amp have had several acting gigs popping up that arent well paid. My pushing towards them getting a regular job for an income often seems to get interpreted as me telling them to give up on their dreams amp that they arent good enough. Even when I reassure them thats not what I mean at all.All the whole so much of what they have been doing is getting high playing video games or doing theatre related work for free to keep them humble. They are constantly talking about the things that they are going to do when they become rich amp talk about how their odd jobs that they do now will be brought up in magazine interviews. Whenever I challenge how will they get super rich or be successful they tend to get really hurt or question why I have to spoil everything by putting a dampener on their dreams.Its so frustrating.,BPDlovedones,dc6lsb5,2,t5_33dd6

A lot of what she has done has made me uncomfortable and scared sometimes but I always chalked it up to her being an artist and being wrapped up in the emotionality of her art. At times before I found out about BPD I thought to myself Am I being abused? In a relationship you shouldnt be scared to want to ask for time alone and you shouldnt be afraid to advocate for your needs. What always bothered me was how I tried to advocate for my needs and she would very craftily explain it away to the point I would apologize and backpedal for being unreasonable.

10378371,0,t3_5ojyb7,Youve helped me tremendously.    After the painful separation from my uBPD ex I went to therapy.  I was codependent and didnt know it.  I had no idea I had been married to a BPD spouse.    I had a huge emotional knot of pain and confusion.  My therapist helped me identify my ex as uBPD and gave me your book.    I read your book and  of my exs behavior during the marriage started to make sense.  The relief I felt after putting a framework around my exs behavior was tremendous.    I went on to read Splitting Protecting Yourself While Divorcing Someone with Borderline or Narcissistic Personality Disorder  because well... my uBPD filed for divorce preemptively she split started distortion campaign projecting etc.    While I feel that Ive been able to get out of the toxic relationship with an indenial uBPD I feel  like Im a failed parent for the following reasons    . During the marriage I decided to have kids with my then uBPD wife.  I now feel that was a wrong decision  because my kids will not have a normal childhood and may even develop BPD because of their mothers  parenting behavior and genes.  I didnt know about BPD during my marriage.  Nevertheless I feel responsible since  I should not have had kids with a woman whose behavior was obviously not normal.    . I havent been able to rescue my kids from my uBPD ex.  The current child custody court order stands at .  My kids spend a lot of time with their mom and are exposed to her toxic personality.    I try my best not to feel discouraged and live my life one day at a time.  I try to be a good father to my kids.  I know that I will have a hard life and very hard decisions to make if one or both of my daughters develop BPD  during adolescence  puberty or later in life.    I feel tremendous guilt for the choices I made in life.  I feel that I havent done enough so far for my kids and  that I may not be able to deal with whats coming down the line in the lives of my daughters.    I try every day to love my daughters and to give them a peaceful positive and loving environment in my home.  Time will tell if my love and parenting will be enough to rescue my daughters from the genetic and parenting  legacy left in their lives by their mother and their maternal grandmother.  Their uBPD mother is constantly  trying to distort and poison my kids relationship with me from a distance    I have hope and prayer.  Its very hard to try and find a silver lining in all this.  ,BPDlovedones,dckgahc,13,t5_33dd6

10493526,0,t1_dcxe8jz,I have a hard time imagining my wife would respond in that way. Anything I say against her she basically treats as an attack and gets extremely indignant. But considering that my intention is to divorce her as soon as its feasible I guess I have nothing to lose. I have a longingrained habit of trying to avoid rocking the boat and trying to avoid saying anything that comes across as negative to her because I know that anything I say can come back to haunt me again and again for decades when she runs down her list of complaints. I think I spent years try to please and appease out of some idea that I had to keep her and had to stay married as if getting divorced would have meant some kind of failure. I didnt feel like I could emotionally afford to lose her. But now its gotten to a point where I cant emotionally afford to stay with her. That sort of changes the equation since if I imagine in the future that shes not going to be haranguing me until the end of my life the future cost of me saying bad things to her is actually quite low.

If I can keep learning from it and apply it in meaningful ways I dont want to trigger anyone but Id almost say it was worth it. Itd be like being shot and while on the operating table the surgeon discovers an otherwise undetectable tumor that was slowly draining my life the whole time. I dont know how I could have come to so mush selfrealization so quickly otherwise without being cast into the flames of post BPDSO recovery.

You dont know shit about my life you dont know shit about me. You proclaim to love me even more in the beginning. If you hadnt noticed I had friends then that didnt seem to bother you. I have given you no reason not to trust me . You were the one that decided to go look for replacements within minutes of me leaving. So maybe take a look inside before you lash out at me. I get it. Im not wanted. I get that everyone just wants the problem to go away. So seriously can you give me time to make that happen so you can finally be free of your psycho ex girlfriend or do you want my blood to cover the bed and floor again. Keep posting shit like this it will be the latter. Carry on with your life and move on with it then its the former. Without you knowing Im already doing what needs to be done to make sure you you dickhead sometimes are happy. I dont make attempts to be with people I dont let them make advances on me. Whats the point. By the end of this month I am gone. So maybe have some humanity in you to let that happen without going overboard. Im sorry you wasted a year of your life on me. I wish I had died the first time so none of this wouldve happened. At least this time you wont be broken. Thats all I can hope for. I will remove myself like the curse I am and Ill make sure I do it right this time.But thank you for your honesty on what you see me as. Spiteful cow. Pyscho ex. Shit person. The list is endless. And btw you wouldve been the one to cheat. Ive always been more loyal that you because in the beginning I didnt run. You did. But when you get abandoned over and over and over again and then get told its your fault it starts building up this instinct to run because of that person. Also I spoke more about my family than I did about you. What I feel for you is no one business and it will go with me to the grave.EDIT Also if youre going to vent about shit get your facts straight. I hated that you lied to me and you always use the same excuse of It was to protect you. Lying on reddit doesnt help you any. So if youre going to paint me out to be the bad guy maybe inform everyone that reads this the colourful things you have done to provoke many of the fights or do you want to blame that on me too?

10661999,0,t1_ddfogaw,Ill see my doc pay my bill and walk out thinking Well that was a waste of time. Usually a few days later or sometimes on the drive home something he said will resonate with me and I have an Ahhah! moment. I keep meaning to ask if he leaves me these little thought grenades on purpose or if Im just slow but usually all it take is for him to plant a seed and the thought will usually occur to me on my own later. I absorb it better that way. A lot of my milestones of recovery have just been the points where I finally internalize some advice Ive read dozens of times. I think sometimes it doesnt take much we just have to be in the right place to accept it. NC is what I credit the most for turning around. It started off just not knowing what to say so Id put it off. Then Id realize that Id never have the right thing to say and it got easier. Just taking it day by day. I think it works it just took me a long time. Though to be fair  months seems to be kind of a standard length. Not to completely get over things but enough to feel like we can live both ourselves. I dont think I see more than a handful of regular posters who have been NC longer than  months here. I wonder what difference it would have made if I had discovered BPD sooner than  weeks post break up. I wonder if recovery would have started earlier or if the timeline is relatively standard regardless of whether we have any awareness or not. Recovery feels like it comes in stages. All I can tell you with confidence is that there was a point in time where I felt completely ruined and broken by the break up. I knew I had to go on but I really had no idea how or if I ever could. But I crawled out of bed every morning and I crawled back in every night. I assume I did things in between though I find it hard to remember. I just took it day by day. February th will be exactly  months since I got my dismissal orders from the relationship. I struggle to recall exactly how many months its been now. I just know it was the day before the  anniversary. I used to know the exact number of weeks before that the exact number of days. I remember when I was having panic attacks after the first  days of No Contact. A week felt like torture a month was an absolute nightmare and to think I could come close to  months made me long for the Apocalypse. And now? I honestly feel better day by day. I should probably quit this place as I debate with myself how useful it is. Obviously I still like to assault you all with thousand word essays but it feels like mostly habit at this point. When I think or talk about my ex now she feels like a troublesome coworker not someone who had once been THE One. Youll get where I am soon enough I know youre on the right track. While I certainly know that I still have a lot of work to do and a long road to travel I dont feel like Im lying to myself anymore when I say to myself Im doing okay.It gets better. ,BPDlovedones,ddfpcry,4,t5_33dd6

10689586,0,t1_ddhtabf,My first therapist was like that and it wasnt really for me. I felt like sometimes I came in repeating myself because I didnt know what else to add. I switched and told my new one that I wanted a more active session. She had me do CBT exercises to work on my anxiety had me record my feelings and what triggered me to feel that way observe my behavior in my relationship etc. I liked her a lot but TBH it was a little too active for me. I found myself zoning out during some CBT exercises because wed do them for the full hour of therapy during times I actually needed to talk. I had to switch therapists when I moved out of state and I found someone who is right in the middle and perfect for me. I go in and talk and shell ask me questions to get ME to figure out the root of the problem. Then Ill ask her how to deal with it and shell give me techniques or thought processes to go through when Im feeling that way. Her sessions force me to actively participate by making me figure out what I want to ask instead of answering the unanswered question if that makes sense.It took me a few tries but its important to find a therapist that really works for you. I liked my first one enough she was kind and had good input but after switching and really clicking with someone it has definitely changed my perspective. ,BPDlovedones,ddijvqo,3,t5_33dd6

10823146,0,t1_ddw7soi,Start with taking therapy for the abusive relationship. Tell the therapist that you know you are in an abusive entanglement but you feel paralyzed at the prospect of letting go. The issue of your depression will inevitably come up. It could even be that you are stuck in the relationship because you are scared of your depression. And it could well be that you are using the abusive relationship as an addiction to escape your depression.So if you solve the relationship issue I am quite positive that youll make tremendous progresses also with your depression. Whatever you decide your depression needs to be tackled at some point or it will present you the bill later in life in a dangerous way.

10852092,0,t3_5v4ybw,How badly does she treat you? Overall are you more happy than sad in this? I never knew about BPD with my ex but I tried everything I could possibly think of. Nothing worked.Only they can help themselves and if theyre not willing to try theres nothing you can do. Set out in your mind what your strong boundaries are and get out of there if they are exceeded. I put up with being hit and verbally abused over nothing every week. It was almost a part time job fighting with her. I was always stressed and it was really impacting my life and work. After I gave her everything I had she cheated on me and ran off. Cheating was my hard limit in this crazy situation but I should have ran away much sooner.What I mean is I have a very strong caregiver personality and it sounds like you do as well but realise when youre being a doormat and an emotional punching bag. Try to help her if thats what you want to do but mentally prepare yourself for what youre going to do if it gets worse and stick to it. Treat yourself well and agree with yourself when enough is enough. BPDs will guilt trip you and make it feel like its your fault.

You just happened to be in the way and he is incapable of controlling his emotions or understanding the effect that his dysregulation has on other people. You tried to appeal to him with logic and this attempt failed because there is no logic to this situation or his world.You apologized to him for yelling because it was the right thing to do because thats what adults do when they realize they are wrong. Your man is a child. There is nothing wrong in dealing with him like any other person in your life and that also includes standing up for yourself. You achieve nothing by sinking to his level but gain self respect and strength by dealing with things on your own terms.Constant vigilance is the only way that I know of not to be caught up in the heat of the moment like this.

It might trigger a source of panic because lets face it we experienced a ton of trauma with our pwBPD.The last year of our  year relationship was LDR so thankfully I dont fear running into him. However though hes blocked on most of my social media certain things can trigger anxiety for me. His phone number is blocked but I can still see his voicemails via blocked folder on my iphonehes left  in the span of  weeks  of them were on the same day but each time I panicked a TON. I think one time it was to the point of tears. I can go days without anything and then out of nowhere hell like a picture on Instagram and BAM! anxiety. I had mutual friends but they were closer to him stay with me in my new city and just being with them gave me a ton of anxiety. He was blocked on my FB account but I was scrolling through my messages and his picture still appeared?  I saw his FB picture change nothing bad just him and a good friend and again freaked out. Little things.I too can talk about him most of the time without any issues. I see a therapist weekly and never feel anxious like this its only when I fear being in contact with him that i get that fightorflight response. Some of it might have to be a control thingif I am the one initiating conversation about him I am fine. If hes brought up out of nowhere and Im not prepared I react. I think its just posttrauma reaction. I fear being around him. I fear falling for him again. I fear the relationship we had. I fear his reaction.  I fear him in general. I think Im just generally afraid to have to talk to him again. Therefore my body has been trained to just have this overwhelming fear around him.I hope it one day subsides. Im only  weeks out so I expect it to. It seems to get a little better with time but I do have those crushing moments too. So I suppose its normal.Edit I had major anxietypanic attacks while dating my exwBPD. Its subsided GREATLY since breaking up but like I said above its triggered by unexpected mention of him. My therapist also said its the whole walking on eggshells issue. Breaking up was the hardest thing for me to do and subconsciously I may still be trying to avoid confrontation with him. Which is fine.Edit  Now that I realllly think about it the anxiety truly is the most overwhelming when Im not in control of him being mentioned. Like when he comes up in conversation.

The only reason she left me at all was because I finally put up a boundary and said no to her once and for all.Yes you are correct. This also explains the pushpull dynamic experienced in a relationship with a pwBPD or BPD characteristics.I also finally said No more and the switch was flipped. They became a different person after  years. It was surreal to witness. I wasnt alone because my teenage sons saw what was going on.Everyone is different but it took me  months of weekly therapy and another  months of biweekly therapy to get through it. Im in the process of moving to monthly therapy with the goal to eventually stop in August of this year.

I really dont know what to say because it sounds like youre walking on eggshells with him.,BPDlovedones,demxg2u,3,t5_33dd6

11188303,0,t1_df032nu,We cannot jump from relationship to relationship with the mindset of a gambler. It is a pretty passive if not reckless advise. And as you say intimacy and high risk sports are not exactly comparable. Wed better learn from our mistakes if we want to evolve. Relationships can teach us a lot about ourselves and our fellow human beings  if we are willing to listen of course.,BPDlovedones,df06ixp,1,t5_33dd6

11300139,0,t1_dfctpaw,This helps immensely because a lot of times Ill believe that something hes telling me must be complete bullshit but then in some cases not all Ill find out that it was true. But then he definitely melodramatizes everything and youre left wondering if youre the asshole for thinking Im sure what youre going through is hard but seriously youre making this all about yourself...I have caught him in  madeup boldfaced lies though that he told to other people which I know to be false. ,BPDlovedones,dfcur5b,5,t5_33dd6

11405896,0,t1_dfothgs,This is an interesting perspective. A lot of people in relationships with narcissists or sociopaths completely lose their minds and actually start to behave similar to borderlines. Not sure about the selfmutilation and emptiness though along with the great show in public  those seem like pretty ingrained personality traits.Either way I agree that no one deserves to be in a loveless relationship like that.,BPDlovedones,dfoudwk,5,t5_33dd6

11442289,0,t3_63btyp,Ok since the restraining order is failing for him you need to get an Injunction on him. An injunction is a court order requiring a person to do or cease doing a specific action. Temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions are temporary injunctions. They are issued early in a lawsuit to maintain the status quo by preventing a defendant from becoming insolvent or to stop the defendant from continuing his or her allegedly harmful actions. Choosing whether to grant temporary injunctive relief is a discretionary power of the court. Permanent injunctions are issued as a final judgment in a case. Failure to comply with an injunction may result in being held in contempt of court.In other words if he contacts your friends or have your friends talk to you about him because he talked to him or that there was some form shape or way that he was able to harass you or verbally harm you he can be found in contempt of court. Injunctions are used when restraining orders dont clue in the specific party to leave you the hell alone. They are a more permanent ruling and has serious legal action that can be taken against you. Never think that you are alone with the law there are ways to get help.  ,BPDlovedones,dfsz1b7,5,t5_33dd6

My wife taught me that the next sheet on the toilet paper roll shouldnt hang against the wall side but on the outside so its easy to grasp. The last few weeks for fun Ive been switching the rolls around to see who would be the first in the family to point it out. So were in Costco and she says Do we need TP? Yeah I reply But make sure you get the kind that faces out the last batch we had faced in and I really hate it. Icy triggered glare. So that was YOU.,BPDlovedones,dg020i3,13,t5_33dd6
11556921,0,t1_dg5ymfa,Thanks for the tips. I dont know about then domestic violence lawyers...our relationship was  physical abuse  psychological abuse. Blackmail suicide threats stalking. Technically what he does falls into the category of a Misdemeanor but I dont want it to become a criminal case but HE will try to make me seem like a criminal by taking things out of context e.g. he has texts of me defending ISIS this was back in  when ISIS was small and had first emerged and I thought they were just freedom fighters and another few texts where I was telling him i wasnt sure of my HIV status when I was dating a woman before him and he claims that it was endangerment even though I tested recently and Im negative. Im worried that after I deliver the serve to him hell call  to get me arrested for accusations hell trump up then play dumb when it turns out Im innocent absolving him of anything and making him seem like he was just trying to be a good samaritan meanwhile I would lose my job for missing work due to arrests....He has said NUMEROUS times that if hes going down he would take me down and he doesnt mind sinking both ships if it means making me pay for leaving him. He is unemployed and lives at home prostitutes for cash I have a graduate degree live on my own and have a successful career. I have more to lose than he does.,BPDlovedones,dg5zbpu,3,t5_33dd6

11660159,0,t3_6621z5,I bet Bill OReilly is wishing he followed Pences lead today.Jokes and politics aside I think its a good rule of thumb. Ive worked service blue collar and now a more professional career and Ive never needed to dine alone with a member of the opposite sex. Im not so old but I remember when spouses were routinely invited to such things. It certainly limits the avenues for potential problems down the line.,BPDlovedones,dghozj7,1,t5_33dd6
11664304,0,t1_dghclp7,Of course never just one drug. Just from her prescriptions alone she had uppers for when she wanted to focus or be distracted she had downers for when she got too much anxiety from her mind racing or other things bothering her and a bunch of other stuff. She would mix things crush things anything to make herself think she was in control of her feelings and emotions.And yeah she claimed she knew how to avoid a come down through her own symphony of drugs. No... all you are doing is prolonging the come down.And then she would get so angry at me and blame it on her coming down. Or she would get pissed off and blame me for ruining her high. All I wanted was a nice happy high and you always ruin it!!!!These words are coming from a grown adult woman with children.Yeah the problem isnt the drugs the problem is why they are taking the drugs. All the stress factors in their life. But there is ALWAYS huge drama in their life. So unless some big changes happen which wont they will never come off the drugs. ,BPDlovedones,dgi5wo9,2,t5_33dd6

11688591,0,t3_66sa9h,This wasnt going to feel good. Stories of people walking out of a breakup high fiving are so much more rare than reported.gt but I still feel like I owe her something. You care about her you dont want to see her in pain. Id try to think of this as emotion to the fact that you cant ease her suffering. Although its not on purpose this whole emotional melodrama is precisely designed to do what its doing to you right now. Tearing at your heartstrings.Not only do you not owe her anything but nothing you can give her will make up for this imagined debt. You can do everything she wants and she will still feel this way. No matter what you do she will always feel shortchanged. There is nothing you can do to feel even in her mind and yours. ,BPDlovedones,dgkx494,3,t5_33dd6

I will let you in on a secret.Whatever your gf or wife or bf or husband brings to the table as far as exes listen carefully to the adjectives and nouns they use to describe them.

11776239,0,t3_67yhc3,Im not a professional Im not an expert. As others have suggested Im probably dealing with some sort of PTSD and need therapy myself... so take this with a grain of salt but heres my advice.I just opined on another thread that I sometimes wonder how much of this problem is a disease and how much of it is merely the result of the person being an asshole. Ok so maybe thats a crazy untrue and ignorant thing to say... but maybe it helps if we think of it that way. Maybe it would help people like yourself or myself a couple years ago break away from really shitty and abusive relationships. I mean who wants to be partnered with an asshole?Im still trying to figure out why I stayed with a woman who cheated on me a dozen times beat me destroyed my reputation destroyed my possessions etc. These are all terrible things why did I stay? She was an asshole. She locked me outside in my underwear on a cold and rainy day because I looked at her the wrong way before she had her morning coffee. She was an asshole. Why did I keep coming back for more? I am still not sure but all I can figure is that I felt sorry for her... stop feeling sorry. They dont have ANY pity for you. They dont care if you live or die so long as they can keep doing what they want to do. Heres how you move on... recognize that this person is an asshole and find someone who isnt. Thats what I did and Im enjoying life so much more than I was.,BPDlovedones,dguvg1w,6,t5_33dd6
