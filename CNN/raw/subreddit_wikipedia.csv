Indeed you can see for example that derives from or is derived from is the standard tense in this context. Using the present tense to discuss etymology does not suggest that the word still has the same connotations.

My point was for you to mentally go to Walmart and imagine what the average person there thinks on the issue.In my completely anecdotal opinion  the people of Walmart for good or for bad are the typical character of America.Even Reddit itself only considers the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on anniversaries of the event. Of course that spill is recent enough that all Americans could have watched events unfold in real time. But you know what? I bet after a day or two of real time coverage some most? Americans basically ignored it. Its just a spill after all.Tell me the last time you heard any state or federal level politician mention Deepwater Horizon. They avoid the issue entirely.

822512,0,t3_23itbk,To be more accurate its a Sanskrit word and part of Hindu philosophy long before it was adopted into Buddhism.It comes from the Sanskrit achintya  which is itself derived from the Sanskrit root chintan meaning thought or reflection. Adding the a prefix turns it into without or beyond thus beyond thought or beyond comprehension.This has been part of Hindu Vedanta philosophy since ancient times. Nor is it a dead word its use continues unchanged in Hindi in the same form with the same meaning to this day.To put this into context Buddhism is an offshoot of Hinduism and Pali the language mentioned in your link is an offshoot of Sanskrit.

They traded goods and formed social ties between the three islands despite the long canoe voyages between them helping the small populations on each island survive despite having very limited resources. Eventually important natural resources were used up interisland trade broke down and a period of civil war began on Mangareva causing the small human populations on Henderson and Pitcairn to be cut off and eventually go extinct.    Just think it sounds like these people most likely didnt know of the existence of any other people or places in the world. As they died out they must have perceived it as the end of the world.

I was  when the law passed but we didnt speak of colonisation before anyway. I actually have little idea about what transpired in the Algerian War of Independence despite the fact that grandfather fought there. The bits I know about French colonial history come from my own interest which is a bit sad to be honest.Im also convinced very few people know the extent of the French empire in North America and how and why we lost it. I did not know a lot before last year myself until a graduate seminar about Atlantic History taught by an American provided me with somewhat solid knowledge and even then New France was only used to highlight the method of colonisation of New England.I dont know if this situation of not teaching about colonisation is common across the former colonial powers but its a bit sad and basically destroys anything we might learn from the experience.,wikipedia,d0bumls,1,t5_2qh3b

9629094,0,t1_d9zyl1t,This is the ultimate question that you have to answer that is at the heart of the entire debate When you vote for mayor to represent your city everyone gets one votes. When you vote for a congressional representative to represent your district everyone gets one vote. When you vote for a senator to represent your state everyone gets one vote. When you vote for president to represent your country should everyone get one vote?gtWant to live in a state with less regulation and government oversight? Move to Wyoming or Texas. Want to live in a state with a stronger social safety net? Move to California or Massachusetts.Yes we have a lot of tiers of government that have control over various subsets of the people for that great reason.  However for each of the those tiers everyone affected by that vote gets exactly one vote except when we vote for the president. The president is someone who represents all of us and no matter what state you move to they will be your president.gtreacting emotionally to one very unfortunate situation without considering it in context with all the other benefits conveyed by the current model.The current model was not a rational distribution of power. The power being held in the swing states is a consequence of winnertakeall being adopted by some states wanting more individual power in the s while most other states were still assigning electors proportionally. It doesnt inherently favor any political party it just happens to have overruled democrats twice in recent memory. The current system introduces an element of randomization when there is a close election  out of every  nonlandside elections in fact.  When that randomization doesnt make a difference too often and happens to help you twice in recent memory you dont see a reason to change it.  However to be a fair and rational system it must be changed.,wikipedia,d9zzfa4,6,t5_2qh3b

If there were one person per each of those  states so one candidate got  votes and there were  million people in the other state so the other candidate got  million votes.
