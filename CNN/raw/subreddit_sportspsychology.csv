Fixed mindset people like to feel good about their talents and abilities so they need to keep their ego high by only accepting challenges in which they can succeed. They rarely put themselves in situations in which they could lose and primarily care about looking good. They dont take criticism well dont believe that effort will help improve their abilities and dont like seeing others succeed at things that because it questions their abilities and status. Growth mindset individuals see effort as the key to mastering a skill. They accept many challenges rather than avoiding them because they know that itll help them improve in the long run. They take criticism well and seek it out so they know where they can improve. They like seeing others succeed alongside them because it means that theyre on the right track and can learn from observation. This mindset sees people seeking more challenges rather than avoiding them and having a higher ceiling of success and happiness as opposed to those who have a fixed mindset.Growth and fixed can be an overall trait of an individual as well or also a state where it depends on the task. Ex. A tennis player may be growth mindset to improving his serve and fixed mindset with a twohanded backhand.It goes deeper than that but hopefully this entices you to read up and do some further Google searches for current literature. ,sportspsychology,d2rt1oj,1,t5_2x669
