4452429,0,t3_3c0e3m,Twice a month the city of Groningen sells bikes that they confiscated for being left at the central station for too long. These are sold for little money you can get a reasonably good bike for . This is probably your best option as far as bikes are concerned. Relevant information can be found here The link is in Dutch here are the key points Address Oude Boteringestraat .  Data in September th and th.  In October on the th and rd At . am everyone in line gets a number. From . am onwards these numbers are called and the people with these numbers can go in and pick a bike. These sales are quite popular I suggest being there as early as . to get one of the first numbers and thus best value for money.  You can only pay by card cash is not accepted. Make sure you bring a card that you know works in PIN machines in stores and not only at ATMs. It is a good idea but not a necessity to ask a Dutch person to come along. In my experience the sellers English is rather limited. ,Groningen,csrwvot,3,t5_2rwix

5700521,0,t3_3swtin,SSH is fine. If you go looking for a room in a student house you WILL find a better deal but it will be considerably more effort. I dont know where you were looking at in the UK but the accommodation in Groningen is cheaper than most UK halls. Also being in an international student house is great for getting to know a group of people who are in the same position as you international.SSH is the easiest way to get a room and stay in the city for your first year as long as you dont mind a little less bang for your buck in terms of quality.,Groningen,cx3pdz7,1,t5_2rwix
6002558,0,t3_3xlb02,I feel like there is a general neglect for standards of even the most basic things  in Van Houtenlaan there are enormous cracks and missing pieces of walls in many rooms the bathrooms are pretty disgusting and everything generally smells. I think the worst thing though isnt the accommodation but the fact that people dislike it and then mistreat it like they are entitled to. If it is your kitchen duty dont expect anyone that day to have cleaned after themselves  the surfaces will be filthy microwaves full of dried on food etc. There is also a stealing problem it seems for food for many also. I think my RA is pretty great and I enjoy the people on my floor but it is in now way value for money. ,Groningen,cy6grln,2,t5_2rwix

8155551,0,t3_4qwtsw,First thing I heard when I said I need some easytoget summer work is working on a farm or something just harvesting crops. Im actually Dutch though so dont know how that works for English speakers but maybe somebody might need you? Its hard labour though but at least its a job. Dont know if they only look for low minimum wage though.PS Your Username is pretty great. If you were able to type that yourself without a translator I think your Dutch will be good enough to get around. Remember that almost everyone around here understands English to a certain degree.,Groningen,d4wzpwx,1,t5_2rwix

And any bar or pub has something special planned what are you looking for? Kokomo has usually good parties. ,Groningen,dbpu586,1,t5_2rwix

10795710,0,t1_ddtgxvv,gt The tip of my toes can barely reach the ground while riding my bike and Im doing fine In the past I have lost my balance and fallen off a bike and injured myself so I feel a bit insecure about not being able to comfortably touch the ground with my feet but I hope Ill get used to it in due time.gt people walking on the streets appear to be a Groningenthing.I myself do that too mainly because the streets are often cleaner to walk on compared to the sidewalks. I see a municipal vehicle cleaning the streets sometimes but I think the sidewalks arent cleaned.,Groningen,ddti15y,2,t5_2rwix
