2942557,0,t3_2tsy47,Second year Eng here I got in with  when the requirement was . Youre fine just do well.And yes do Scholarship because first year engineering will be an absolute breeze for you then. A large portion of a couple of papers is stuff that CIE has already covered,universityofauckland,co2kyj5,1,t5_2spg7
3305166,0,t1_cp4zq15,Also since engineering at UoA requires math and physics at Alevel do these need to go towards my UCAS points? Can I just choose to count AS physics? Ill still pass Alevel it just wont be part of my top combination.Thanks,universityofauckland,cp50k6h,1,t5_2spg7
8528418,0,t3_4wg4bs,Im not an English Lit student but I am currently on Exchange here at UoA. The cost of living is very high as the person above said  Im paying  NZD for a July July  contract at UniLodge and for better accommodation you can easily be paying around  NZD. Not to mention that groceries are pretty expensive  Im pretty good at eating cheaply  pweek but depending on what you eat you can spend a lot more. In terms of finding jobs its fairly straightforward. Assuming you have a Student Visa you can work up to  hours a week and as the minimum wage is . you can end up earning a good amount of money or at least enough to cover your basics. In terms of studying here as an experience its incredible. Ive visited PihaKare KareWaitomo etc. already and the scenery just doesnt compare to other places in the world you have to see it to believe it. If you plan on heading further south you have Lake Taupo Rotorua etc. and just an endless number of incredible places to visit. The help from the University and the Law Faculty for me has also been extremely generous and they really go out of their way to make sure youre doing well. Everyone is really friendly and youll meet loads of International students here if you really want to socialise Id recommend Carlaw Park which is around  NZD per year and the rooms are significantly better than UniLodge. Overall if you have the money I cant recommend the experience enough. In terms of the job market I honestly cant give you any help there  sorry! Best of luck with your decision. ,universityofauckland,d67m6h9,1,t5_2spg7

10315563,0,t3_5niy58,I would probably say that comlaw  has the most content that was completely new to me having done accounting and economics at high school so I spent much more time on comlaw then other core subjects. You have to take Business  and pass it before taking Business . So sem take Bus and sem take Bus,universityofauckland,dcdbpvv,2,t5_2spg7
