5247070,0,t3_3muf83,Maybe Im a purist but reggae is the one genre where I really think playing with a pick is unacceptable. Reggae and rocksteady are often played so far behind the beat and the tone you get from playing with a pick has such a sharp attack that it just sounds wrong. Good choice of reggae bass lines wrong technique for these genres.,basslessons,cviglln,2,t5_2sr7g
