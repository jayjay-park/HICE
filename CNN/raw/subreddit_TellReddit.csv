3846778,0,t1_cqrw92y,So I didnt call at all. I went to the closest Comcast customer service center and talked to a person there. Basically they acknowledged that it should have been shut off. Then they asked if Id returned the hardware. I didnt get any hardware. It was internet only and I had my own modem. Which seems like they should be able to tell this from looking at their screen but whatever. They said they would shut it off and would issue me a check for a refund of past charges which I would receive in the mail in about  weeks. So now I guess I just keep an eye on the account and make sure theres no more funny business. Im kinda skeptical theyll even send me a check but I guess if they do Ill have a little extra faith in humanity.,TellReddit,cqurmbn,4,t5_2qhvz

11037002,0,t3_5u35xo,If you live with mental disorders I dont think its crazy to enjoy them. You might just enjoy who you are what makes you unique and even a mental illness like bipolar or multiple personality disorder can be outlets for that.    But you should be okay with who you are mentally. If you arent then seek medical help. You dont have to be a perfect mental image of what society thinks you need to be or live up to anyone elses expectations. But you should exist to be okay with yourself.,TellReddit,dej0wg9,1,t5_2qhvz
