8689565,0,t3_4yy341,You just have to find a technique that works for you. Heres what I do you can try it yourself and adapt as necessary.When I mash B for the rising cyclone I change the position of my right hand. I place the end of my pointer finger the one closest to the thumb on the B button with the right side of my finger facing down. I also place my right thumb on top of the finger for stability. While doing this I also have to rest the right side of the controller on my leg. Once in this position I mash by twitching the entire lower half of my arm.Its also important to note that using the control stick during the mash actually affects which direction you travel. So after initially holding down to start the cyclone you should move the control stick up to gain more height or to the side to gain more horizontal distance. Another tip always buffer the down input if you can. This is so you can avoid fastfalling before the cyclone actually begins. You can do this easily by holding down during a green missile or by immediately holding down after using a double jump.There isnt a lot of this kind of information out there I was thinking about making a video series about this kind of stuff what do you think?,LuigiMains,d6rtnl6,3,t5_38dqx
