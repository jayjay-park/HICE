624590,0,t1_cgb9bxz,gtProof? Relevance?I posted proof above. Its relevant because there was a generalization made about white men being the reason that women couldnt get abortions portraying it as a men vs. women issue or a womens rights issue when really the people who care about it the most on either side are women. While its an issue affecting women exclusively the opposition composed mostly of women opposes abortion on moral grounds not anything related to gender. This can be seen by looking at demographics of the protests.gtSomething I not only didnt say but doesnt even make any claims about all white men or even all old white men.Whoops my bad thought you were the OP. There is a glorious tradition in Virginia of white men telling women what to do with their bodies. Its heritage!There we go. You say its part of the heritage of white men.gtOutlawing abortion would be somewhere in between in that it is an arguably more intimate and complete use of the body than slavery typically was Presuming that slavery didnt usually involve hormonal craziness forced birth invasive medical procedures and such but only lasts for a duration of about  months maximum rather than a lifetime.Forced labor ! not allowing someone to abort their child Im finding it hard to comprehend that you actually believe that not allowing a woman to have an abortion is worse than the institution of slavery.You seem not to acknowledge that a fetus is a separate organism from its mother not necessarily part of their body. Many consider the life of this organism to have the same value as a human being depending on its point in development.gtAll that was being implicitly claimed was that there is an observable pattern of white men telling women what to do with their bodiesThere really isnt though. Its mostly women who spearhead the movement not white men. It isnt a men vs. women issue. I feel many prochoice advocates try to blame men as if its a civil right men are taking away from women when prolife advocates are focused on what they believe to be equivalent to the life of a child.gtThey are just an example of the dynamic being enumerated so calm the fuck down.I am calm this is the opposite of being calm.,gmu,cgb9m2j,2,t5_2r1fn

College education just shows employers you can be educated! For their generations college degrees were rare. Now they are the norm everyone has one so employer weigh students based on degree relevency versus deciding between applicants with degrees versus those without. I would strongly recommend this fivethirtyeight article gt Psychology is far and away the most popular major despite paying a belowaverage median wage of . gt But many sciences particularly the life sciences pay below the overall median for recent college graduates. Students who major in neuroscience meteorology biology and ecology all stand to make  or less  and thats if they can get a fulltime job which many cant. If you stick with those majors you are most certainly looking at graduate schoolgt In some fields the graduateschool premium is even higher. Premed students technically health and medical preparatory programs earn a median salary of  if they successfully go on to medical school or other graduate programs but just  if they dont.

I was in your same position when I was deciding between taking Bono or Dill for  as others have said Bono is probably a great teacher but he has a reputation for being a tough grader and he is the guy who grades your Midterm and Final exams about  of your total grade the labs are graded by the TAs and the Lab quizzes are just multiplechoice on the computer so they are graded automatically. The advantage of taking Bono is that he selectsmakes the Lab quizzes and also makes the MidtermFinal so he knows what will be on the tests and he can focus more on some topics while the other teachers can only assume from previous exams. I can also tell you this going into  with Rissi I met a few students there who would tell me that they had to retake  with a different teacher after failing it their first time with Bono because they felt that he would not give any partial grade or just in general would penalize them too much for small coding mistakes on the exams. Ive also met a few students who were retaking  with Dill again but usually because they knew that they had not put a good amount of effort on their first time with him. I dont think Ive never met anyone who voluntarily retook a class with Bono either  or  so I think that tells you something... But again it all comes down to how you approach this class as long as you genuinely put enough effort to study the material and practice coding you should be fine with any teacher good luck.,gmu,d9fcxam,1,t5_2r1fn
