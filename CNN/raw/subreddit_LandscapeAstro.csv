1148935,0,t1_chypraq,Thanks! Batch editing when using the timelapse rail is pretty difficult so I found it very important to get the exposure right in camera for those. You have a little more room when shooting off a tripod to mask areas out.If youre ever interested I do night photography workshops in NJ!

3398961,0,t1_cpfotcq,Thanks! I used a Canon EOS D and the kit lens mm at mm f. The exposures were  seconds long taken every  seconds. I used Magic Lantern as the intervalometer and I took the images with the experimental silent picture which enables me to take photos without using the shutter at all. It saves both the shutter longevity and the battery life. I was able to shoot for  hours on one battery in C.,LandscapeAstro,cpfphfq,1,t5_31x8q

4103292,0,t1_crnymqk,I would argue that even though you didnt manipulate colors with HSL sliders the colors are still an artifact of processing.  Note curves also enhances colors similar to saturation.  For example there is a regular cloud toward the top of the image that shows as green.  Some of the green in the image might be airglow but not the cloud.But photographers are free to color their images any way they want including making a red sunset all blue just dont call it natural.To me your image has a lot of potential if processed better.  There are wonderful colors in the Milky Way and in the night sky airglow. ,LandscapeAstro,cro00ui,1,t5_31x8q
4303881,0,t3_3aalm9,These are my first real astrophotography images and Im quite happy with them. They were taken with a Canon D with a mm f. Rokinon lens for the widefield shots and a mm standard Canon lens at f. for the closer shots on the core. ISO values vary between  and . Postprocessing of RAW files in Adobe Lightroom.When I got to the PC I realized the focus was a little off on the wideangle shots but overall I am quite happy with the images.  There is a lamp post behind me hence the yellow tint to the foreground plants.Im fairly new to processing images like these so any critiques are welcome.  I just did some alterations in Adobe Lightroom.,LandscapeAstro,csartc4,3,t5_31x8q

4649558,0,t3_3ej35m,Excellent work! I am loving the cool objects in the foreground. For the next time you go out shooting always keep your foreground in mind when composing. Try to align it or misalign it depending on the given circumstances with the galactic core. It is what makes us strong landscape astrophotographers!,LandscapeAstro,ctgn0rl,1,t5_31x8q
4741974,0,t1_ctraxyg,Wow just be aware that all  of  these videos are teaching methods of processing night sky images that produce completely unnatural colors.  The Milky Way is not purple and blue.  Also use of high ISO and shorter exposure times in one is a recipe for noise.  ISO does not change the amount of light gathered.  ISO only serves to reduce dynamic range and saturate more stars so the image shows less star colors. Only aperture and exposure time determine how much light the camera records.A daylight white balance gives natural white balance.  ISO  is all you need for night imaging with most cameras and a fast lens ISO  for cameras with banding problems the Nikon should be very low banding.,LandscapeAstro,cts9qtg,2,t5_31x8q

5072413,0,t1_cuxacrk,Thanks for the link! According to one of the commenters this rule only applies to video and jpegs as it is a result of how the image is processed whereas it does not have any effects on RAW ,LandscapeAstro,cuxf1v1,1,t5_31x8q
5077490,0,t1_cuxntnh,I understand all of that and the rule of  is probably the first thing all astrophotography shooters learn even though its highly inaccurate. If I could go back and relearn everything Id have done things much differently instead of just buying a wide lens with a . aperture Id much rather go the route Im going now a moderate lens  or mm with a more open aperture f. and take multiple exposures and then stack. The pictures Ive put together doing this method are substantially better. I can take several shots with my mm at f. and an  second exposure in the same time I can take one shot with my mm f.. I lose a little angle but stacking results in a significantly better signal to noise ratio and adds almost no additional time to post processing if you know how to use a stacker or photoshop well. My advice to new astrophotography shooters now will be to do that method and teach them how. It might be a little extra work but you get a better understanding of all this madness in terms of technical details and the end result is your pictures look better.,LandscapeAstro,cuy12ie,1,t5_31x8q
5099935,0,t1_cv0p8z0,This is what I could pull out of it. Id say your ISO was waaaaay too high. It also shows your exposure duration was  seconds far too long for a mm and a TiThe Ti has horrible Noise ratios in lowlight conditions and should rarely exceed  on that model of camera.Also using the  rule if you want to maintain sharp stars shouldnt exceed  seconds  before you start experiencing some blur.Which is great if that is what you are going for but if not its mucho bad.I find for the milky way Tungsten is a little too blue. I usually leave it around k but can depend on the lighting and situation. For your timelapse how long was the duration Between shots? for Timelapse of the stars or if you are going for star trailssame setup it shouldnt be more than  seconds inbetween each shot. This will reduce the skippingor just use a framerate more than  fps also in general it seems your focus is a little soft. try digitally zooming x on the brightest object you can find and see if you can find the perfect zoom. Then mark itif your focus ring doesnt spin after hitting Maxmin focus That way you know where it is for future reference.What is the minimum aperture on your lens? . is alright but .lower would have suited a bit better and allowed for more light and less ISO.Anyway if any of that is overwhelming or you have more questionsor even want to go out shooting! hit me up!,LandscapeAstro,cv0qdrd,2,t5_31x8q
5103838,0,t1_cv0rmye,Thanks! Its a long learning process thats for sure. Ive been doing it for a few years now and Im constantly learning new tricks. Best thing you can do is just read about different techniques online and watch videosread tutorials on processing.,LandscapeAstro,cv17b2s,2,t5_31x8q

5402490,0,t3_3oy4cp,Very nice what post software are you using? My advice would be to add some more luminance probably about  to  to your photo to rid of some noise. Presuming youre using light room try adding an inverted radial filter around the milky way and upping the clarity a bit. Also Im personally not a fan of the dark upper section because it loos as if the MW suddenly cuts off. Itd look better lightened up or maybe cropped out but thats just my preference. ,LandscapeAstro,cw287rp,1,t5_31x8q

I like your version but Ill have a look at it on my house computer as the screen has better colours.

6607356,0,t3_465rhb,Nice composure and solid attempt given the lens and camera you are using I would suggest raising the ISO to  but not beyond that. You appear to have the correct white balance which is good. After that you could use a little bit more post processing to bring out the detail of the milky way.

This is a pretty big pano two rows of shots one for the sky and one for the foreground. Each row is  shots each shot is a  minute exposure at ISO  and f. shot with my Nikon D and Rokinon mm f. lens on my iOptron Skytracker mount turned on for the sky off for the foreground. ,LandscapeAstro,d4dzipw,2,t5_31x8q
