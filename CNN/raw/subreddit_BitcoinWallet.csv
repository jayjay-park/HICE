441680,0,t1_cfq1rk2,Its funny that you mention the documentation with the Hive wallet since I posted elsewhere asking them why they have no documentation and got the reply that  they made it easy enough to use that you dont need it.  nobody reads that stuff anyway. Riiiight. Sounds kinda lazy and unprofessional to me. As well as presumptuous to think that no one will have any questions about how to use their app that they entrust with their money. I mean everybody understands bitcoin right? Its pretty basic and commonplace to use at this point right?,BitcoinWallet,cfqjmir,1,t5_2wj0o

2049367,0,t1_cl0ajtb,So the transaction never got to the network otherwise you could see the txid as unconfirmed on blockchain.info. Perhaps it was just an intermittent connection issue. Can you try it again?If it still wont work PM me and Ill investigate further.,BitcoinWallet,cl0bifb,1,t5_2wj0o
