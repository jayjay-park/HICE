247002,0,t3_1wvjbc,Hes always been my favorite the way he avenged Felix Leiter and his wife captured the realness and ruthlessness of  perfectly in my opinion. And I know most of you guys on this subreddit will argue for Connery but I mean I just cant forgive Diamonds are Forever. It should have been so much better I mean HIS WIFE HAD JUST DIED but half of the screentime is devoted to Mr. Wint and Kid two flamboyant henchmen. If they would have focused on Connery really sticking it to Blofeld then it could have been one of the greatest movies in the franchise. I just feel like they wasted Connerys strength and hardness and had him driving lunar landers around Nevada instead. But that being said From Russia With Love is one hell of a film one of my favorites and the real ruthless spy that is  shows his true nature multiple times in the film. So Im not saying hes bad by any means just that as a character Timothy Daltons Bond was more like what I expect someone who kills for a living to be like.,JamesBond,cf6cs94,9,t5_2rsg9

309550,0,t1_cfcrjnw,An upvote for you sir as you bring up an excellent point. James Bond does not drive like an asshole and in reminding me of that I feel Ive misspoke. James Bond is not an asshole driver. He is a reckless driver. The difference being that when he puts peoples lives and architecture in danger it is for the greater good of king and country rather than getting satisfaction.I CAN be a good driver. Im a good driver  of the time. The remaining  is when someone else is being an asshole and I get caught up in a one up competition with them or a pissing contest if you will. Thus lowering myself shamefully to their level. I get an adrenaline rush and as a result feel like Bond while doing it which makes my actions worse. I forget that Bond would never act that callously and Im doing better at keeping that adrenaline in check.Cheers!P.S. I havent played that game yet but I did just put it in my gamefly account on your recommendation. Sounds interesting.,JamesBond,cfcuplo,-1,t5_2rsg9

If you want to make a movie franchise that has none of the essential characteristics of a Bond movie fun being one of them then why not create your own franchise?

Daniel Craig showed the emptiness in Bonds heart throughout the film due to Vesper. Marc Forster said The desert mirrors the psychological status of Bond. It brings with it isolation and loneliness. I think whats going on with Bond this psychological state that hes in is isolation and loneliness. Theres a struggle to survive within him theres a constant struggle and I think thats what the desert represents. I had my heart broken around the time the movie was out so this Bond really spoke to me. Also this builds the trust M has with Bond and that relationships carries onto Skyfall.

3260442,0,t1_cozvq31,Id actually argue that theyre both more or less stealing from the plot of Goldfinger. I think A View to a Kill is a tiny looser of an adaptation of Goldfinger since there are simply too many elements of Octopussy that exactly mirror Goldfinger. On the other hand A View to a Kill has the zeppelin scene that mirrors the delta scene. And theres that aircraft escape at the end again after the bomb threat has been neutralized...I cant help but wonder if theyd decided at that point in the franchise to just hone in on the easiest variation of the Bond formula to reproduce. You dont want to do anything too risky when people are already making fun of Roger Moore for being old man Bond. But I singled out Octopussy because I think it was the first Bond film to totally cannibalize the plot elements and characters of a past film  TSWLM amp Moonraker had done something similar with YOLT a few films back but they didnt come close to the shameless ripoff that Octopussy or for that matter A View to a Kill ended up being.,JamesBond,cozyfhz,1,t5_2rsg9

But yeah i jus replied to an opposing viewpoint and while I respect it I just cant find any validity in it. Ehh I guess part ways about the code name theory. I find it to be held together by a thin thread at best. Its refuted many times in the series. The film canon is there is no canon. Its just a bunch of filmmakers readapting an old idea into an updated new idea. But I do agree Skyfall is just not as much of a fun movie to watch.

Of course he was a Nazi only because it was absolutely mandatory of everyone in Nazi Germany to be a member of the party. To me I just find that so amazing.

Tom Hiddleston  Maybe too much associated with being a villain marvel filmsDamien Lewis  Cant actually think of a particular reason why not Im a big fan of Homeland so maybe I see him as a villain. With regards to Idris Elba he is a fantastic actor but for me James Bond is an upper class white man of Scottish heritage I think his mother may have been Swiss?.

The real problems of Moonraker are actually way more serious and way more damaging than space and outlandishness could ever be.The only way for this film to make coherent sense is to have both Bond and Drax either be psychic or consulting the script from time to time. Why does Bond immediately investigate Drax despite not a shred of evidence of him stealing the shuttle? Why does Drax try to have him killed? Why does Bond immediately know the glass blueprints have something to do with stolen shuttle? Why does he even go to Rio? I mean he gets to the Amazon through a clue he found in Venice that orchid vial Nothing he does in Rio is of any importance! Why is Jaws converted when Drax hasnt actually done anything to him? Its literally converting him with the vague assurance Drax will be a jerk. Its like this for the entire film  nothing happens for any particular reason. Just because it has to happen. Id point out more examples but I wanna keep it brief. I tend to ramble.So yeah if you focus on the space and the silliness its just misdirection.

Beyond that  its got a great performance from Roger Moore some interesting characters in Colombo and Kristakos and a down to earth realistic spy story thats straight out of Fleming. I like that.

5103979,0,t3_3ku6cf,George Lazenby left for a combination of reasons some well documented others more speculative. He was managed by Ronan ORahilly an infamously rebellious and antiestablishment businessman. He founded pirate radio station Radio Caroline on which the film Pirate Radio was based.  ORahilly was on board with the peaceandlove counter culture growing in the mid to late sixtes and so opposed the  franchise for its violence misogyny and for being a hugely lucrative institution in film. Lazenby latter says he was convinced by ORahilly that the  franchise couldnt survive the counter culture revolution the franchise would soon be dead and it would ruin Lazenbys career to remain in the role.  Ronan also instigated several difficulties in the negotiation and management of Lazenbys role as .  So in short ORahilly created professional tension between Lazenby and the Broccolis and then persuaded Lazenby the franchise was doomed.  However  Blaming everything on ORahilly ignores some obviousif less well documentedcontributing factors. George Lazenby was a male model not an actor making the work challenging. Sean Connery was beloved as bond and considerable backlash was focused on Lazenbys casting. Lazenby was also notoriously difficult to control as an actor. He got the part because of brash behavior such as showing up uninvited to the EON offices and punching a stunt coordinator in the face.  He also jokesconfesses that he wanted the part of  because it would get him laid. When he left the role of  he cited getting laid as his motivation again Everyone that was getting laid had long hair and bell bottoms...I was the only guy in London with short hair.

5395904,1,t3_3ou666,A review I wrote as a Facebook post...sigh... take a letter pleaseDear Thomas NewmanI just listened to the soundtrack samples released this morning. Before we go any further I still stand by my statement that you absolutely crapped all over the Skyfall score. I mean that was just an unmitigated disaster. At least ric Serras Goldeneye score was so fully unashamedly s that its got some endearing quality to it. Skyfall was worse than that. It was banefully mediocre. It was an average action movie score at best and a total letdown as a Bond score.But  were not here to talk about the past were talking about SPECTRE the here and now. Lets start with the second clip on that page with the DJ giving the intro for the first . It fades in at that point with a good pulsing energetic bass line and plenty of strings coming in on top. Pretty decent swells and lulls decent dynamics for the next couple minutes interesting but not captivating. par for the course.Then at  MAGIC!! IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A GOOD BOND THEME MOMENT FOR THREE YEARS NOW! The Bond Triad climbs from the depths proudly stepping out front for its first  measures cycling through those  elemental notes that say Bond is Bonding right now with the low brass pounding that contrast on the rd beat of each of those measures. And then the next  measures IT GETS BETTER! The Bond Triad repeats but the major chord on that th measure that holds oooouuuuuttttt reveling in its own ingenuity. AND THEN THE CHORUS. I dont think a choir has ever been used in a Bond soundtrack before but it is  and I hate this word Barry  it is EPIC! That very instant they come in at that last measure in the phrase at  instantly transformed my hopes for what the SPECTRE soundtrack could be.And even still...! the rolling swelling choir and orchestra for the next  measures set up and lead into the most interesting and intriguing set of chords Ive ever heard paired to that thankfully relentless Bond triad. Seriously with as little time as it showed in Skyfall you owe me double Bond theme in SPECTRE. And still seriously those  seconds starting at  are truly inspired.Then were back to that pulsing bit again pretty exciting. Lots of quick heavy drums. But wait......whats this......it happens around the  mark. It sounds familiar.Is it...?It sounds pretty similar to... yeah thats it. Wait false start nope definitely yeah.At  minutes and  seconds into that clip you have note for note quoted yourself from Skyfall. Specifically track  Grand Bazaar Istanbul at the  mark. Now while at  in this clip your quoted piece does indeed quote the Bond theme Ive lost it.Do you think youre writing a brand new Bond theme that will play in movies to come? Are you trying to do a modern  theme a different piece of music from the James Bond theme  la John Barry in From Russia With Love?Ill tell you what I think theres two possibilities. Youre either lazy or youre arrogant. You are either rehashing the exact same chase music from your Skyfall score because you expended your entire creative capital in that one minute before or because you think you somehow have the right to waltz in to the longest continuously running film franchise in cinema history and write your own new theme song. Either is unacceptable and I dont think you fully grasp or appreciate what youre a part of. My guess between those two though? Remember how all the commentary so far has been for the second clip on the page?Well lets now review the first clip the full track Donna LuciaIts a near carbon copy of Skyfall track  Sverine. The End.Out of  minutes and  seconds  of Donna Lucia   of Backfire there is perhaps  very lean minute of truly new inspired interesting music. The rest has me wondering if this might be the first James Bond film score I wont buy.You had damn well better deliver. But with the way things are sounding right now I wont hold my breath for it. I really hope this is indeed Sam Mendes last Bond film so that he can take you back with him.Then with any luck David Arnold wont still be pissed off at getting booted out to make room for you and we can get a real Bond score again.Most sincerelydictated but not readA dedicated Bond fanI cant believe I just wrote that much stone cold sober.

5637593,0,t3_3s63kb,Extrapolating on my nested post  M was on the tails of SPECTRE. We know this because of the videotaped message.   M knew that she was being targeted  hence the video that she left with a contingency  If anything happens to me...   SPECTRE is a fairly loose organization  firmly under the power of Blofeld but we know that they rarely meet. Based on the reports given by SPECTRE associates in the meeting their aim seems to be to make global organized crime easier for everyone. This aim is nearly realized in the global intelligence unification  sharing all information but doing so under the thumb of Blofeld so that they could all stay one step ahead. We start to see M fighting against things like this in Skyfall and the new M is doing the same against C in Spectre.  Thus with M on the trail and an active opponent of Cs iniatives she needed to be removed just as Blofeld needed Mr. White to be removed. Who better to ask to remove M than Silva?He already has a reason and a motive for revenge and certainly SPECTRE doesnt want their organization to be revealed in the act of killing M. Silva is a perfect operative for the job. No one would consider his motive as being otherwise. SPECTRE would be hidden by confirmation bias  Silvas main reason would seem so obvious so no one would ever look to find the TRUE reason for his involvement. ,JamesBond,cwvwb4q,2,t5_2rsg9

6368521,0,t1_czcjfsq,Dude its grand and suited perfectly! Probably one of my favorite credit sequences as well. It also seeks to bring the audience back into the film as if to say Okay joking aside this is still James Bond. In fact. That seems to be a big theme in the movie reflection on the past. Bond looks over relics from his past adventures shows interest in delving into his family history tries to make up for his recent failure to bring Blofeld to justice puts aside his past life of espionage and womanizing to get married. Because ironically or not its also sort of in juxtaposition of looking forward to the future of the Bond franchise. One potentially without its inaugural star. Reflecting on the past looking ahead to the future. Makes the clock in the early part of the sequence seem a whole lot more significant. Bond is not exempt from time.

The underlying theme would be government corruption reviving a sort of Cold War and seeing Bond globetrotting as he puts out fires in one proxy war after another. It has a lot of potential because  many of the stories were so heavily altered when they were adapted in the Connery era that the original material would still seem new if EON made a faithful albeit updated adaption and  some great Bond films were episodes of Cold War intrigue Dr. No From Russia With Love For Your Eyes Only.,JamesBond,d0f52ct,1,t5_2rsg9

While I wouldnt trade years of Bond films like it I do wonder what would have happened if this toned down more book style Bond had really hit it off. This is the film that most feels like what the original intention of Bond was to be. Hes a rough and tumble guy trying not to get murdered by the soviets using gadgets that were about as real as the actual wetwork gadgets that were employed at the time. Yes of course we have to have SPECTRE begin to show their hand god I love a good SPECTRE goon murder but thats all part of the Bond camp fun. Its not that I lament it more that Im so impressed one series can sustain something as straight forward as this film and still have something as gloriously ridiculous as The Spy Who Loved Me. It has some of the best Bond elements around including one of the best Bond buddies Karim Bey and easily the most terrifying preCraig villain Red Grant. I love this one for its slow methodical pace and even keel. I love how fun Bond gets later but its nice this film exists.

The pretitle sequence is an impressive stunt though it speaks to the other main problem with this film  that its a carbon copy of The Spy Who Loved Me in outer space. The script follows SWLM beat by beat and feels like a less entertaining version. Its a shame Hugo Drax was wasted in such a dull retread.The real problem with this film of course is how far it attempts to stretch credibility. The main plot a wealthy businessman builds a secret space station to populate with the most attractive people he can find in order to wipe the human race clean and start over. When Bond gets word of it a battalion of laser wielding space marines are launched into orbit in a military space shuttle at a moments notice to stop the plot. Never mind the fact that the secret space station has artificial gravity which does not exist that can be turned on and off with a switch.

Hes handsome but also looks like the everyman rather than a Hollywood star.Based on that sketch Fleming had done of Bond Dalton is probably the closest in appearance to Flemings idea of Bond of the six actors to date followed by Brosnan. gt Has a lightness to him  He can be brutal and murderous but unlike Craig he can also have the smile good temper gentlemanly behavior dinner party manners and he takes his dates out to the carnival with a giant teddy bear.I think that Dalton is a bit weak in terms of charm but he compensates with an air of sophistication and elegance. In my opinion Craig has neither being far more brutish.He used his marksmanship skills to win Kara a prize at a carnival. I dont think you can get much more gentlemanly than that.gt Respectful to women  He shifted the character from cliche womanizer and avoided oversexualizing women. Overall he treats women as equals never condescending or being lenient with them.To be fair having women who are Bonds equals is part of an ongoing trend since the midMoore era but youre right Bonds attitude is far less chauvinistic here. In a similar vein  I know this is a Dalton thread  Ive seen Brosnan described as a sort of transitional Bond or a placeholder which I think is a big insult to Brosnan and his accomplishments. ,JamesBond,d57k3ul,2,t5_2rsg9
8254692,0,t1_d57xjoh,I agree with most of those except about Nick Nack and Roger Moores performance. Nick Nack has a completely different personality from Odd Job and he is neither murderous nor threatening. His only similarity is that hes a servant to the villain.And whats wrong with Roger Moore being serious and tough? People complain that hes too funny and light but he does an excellent job at playing a tough Bond. He gives a wellrounded performance containing both humour and toughness in this film. Hes more dimensional and I dont see whats wrong with that.,JamesBond,d59e5rp,1,t5_2rsg9

10888583,0,t1_de318ot,I would think it to be a bad decision to give the role to Idris. He doesnt look like James Bond and it would be difficult to explain the extreme change in character traits from one film to the next. But dont get me wrong I would feel this way about any character not just James Bond. Shaft Madea Indiana Jones etc... I guess I have an imaginary rule of thumb where if I didnt have my glasses on I shouldnt be able to tell that one actor has replaced another. If the traits of the new actor are so extreme that even a blurry eyed Velma could tell the difference you probably made a bad choice in casting. If you like the actor it would be better to cast him as either another agent  supporting character or give him the lead role in his own film about a different spy. If we lived in a strange desolate wasteland of a world where actors were limited I would feel differently. But right now society is booming and there are way too many talented people out there that look more like Bond then Idris does and I feel that that those people deserve a shot at the role first. Plus like my extreme examples were saying it just doesnt make sense to me to argue that appearance doesnt matter. I firmly believe that it does. This is a movie not a radio show. If they want to reboot Bond again and cast Idris Id support it. Id be annoyed at having another reboot... but I wouldnt care that Bond was black at that point. However from that point on I would expect all other Bond actors to not only be black but also have similar builds and attitudes... for the same reasons stated above.But right now there are just too many other actors better suited for this specific role... so why not give it to one of them? John Goodman would be a bad choice. As would Jenifer Aniston or DJ Qualls DJ as a name not a Disc Jockey although a music DJ would also be a bad choice probably. Schwazanegger in his prime would have also been a terrible choice. Accent aside he was just too huge. The Rock is not a good candidate for Bond nor Mark Whalburg. Its not that any of these people couldnt do a good job as a BondLike Spy theyre just not right for the actual James Bond.,JamesBond,de32vvr,1,t5_2rsg9
