3637549,0,t3_320buz,One interesting thing Ive noticed portal wise.  if youre outside when a group opens the vault there are tons of small earthquakes all around that area even a screen or two beyond the waking ruins.  Ive always sort of wondered whether that gate outside of the vault entrance to the right near the overgrown swampy spot is notable.  You can feel the tremors there and that portal seems to be the only one around there that has these metal lit up shields that when you get close you can hear them humming with electricity.Otherwise back on topic  i assume you mean the portals in Atheons room where one is open and you can walk inside.  Presumably the team could stand and open the other closed portal?  Of course you start going blind the second you walk in but Im curious if there is a way to prevent the blindness from occurring.  Its strange that its not the portal Atheon sends you through but rather the one you go through with the Gatekeeper.,raidsecrets,cq6wp10,1,t5_3560n

3644317,0,t3_323lap,While were talking about the different generations of Vex Ive always found it interesting but not entirely interesting that the precursors look much more futuristic and clean than the descendants. The precursors seem to be made of the same quartz that Atheon and the crystal arch is made of. Now Quartz does become cloudy over time hence why the arch is darker in the future portal presumably but it doesnt explain the descendants being much more primative and cheap looking. The present vex look like they started creating vex armor out of larger proportions of metals iron? which maybe got all rusty or something for the descendants? I dunno this has always irked me. Important edit that I cant make sense ofThe oracles in the templar phase are the same color as descendant goblins eyes. The templar himself has blue eyes akin to the precursors. Atheons oracles are red like the present goblins eyes. All Harpies and the and supplicants have red eyes. Gorgons have blue eyes. All hydras have blue eyes. Sekrion has a yellow eye like descendants. The undying mind has a red eye. Cyclops have red eyes. Zydon the gatelord has a yellow eye and a dark hull. Atheons eye is white like he DGAFPerhaps these are supposed to serve as indications of what timeframegeneration each vex are from?EditAgain I know Ive gone crazy at this point but Its an elementary conclusion but Atheons eye is white because he is the conflux of all timestreams and mixing three primary colors results in black when painting white when discussing light. Ergo past  present  future  whitePSA there are white lights in the Vault. ,raidsecrets,cq7oga6,3,t5_3560n
3644491,0,t3_321e65,These are all super basic things things it takes about a minuteand about  wipe to figure out Im not sure anyone would credit the lore for the idea of cleansing stuff.  I think more generally the stuff your talking about is raid mechanics and yes the lore does talk about alot of them so does the scoreboard though.  However the biggest credit to understanding raid mechanics is actually just playing the raid itself and learning it.  The lore and scoreboard are just a good starting point.  The Benefit to the scoreboard is that it is very easy to interpret the lore has sooooooo many different cards to consider so many interpretations the odds arent with you that you would end up picking something relevant.  Seriously though bungie made a fantastic lore its depth and complexity is however our downfall in this case.So in the end Im going to disagree with pretty much everything.  Im only going to agree with the statement about how scoreboard stuff should still be tested because I think lore stuff is equally valid for testing. ,raidsecrets,cq7p5xf,2,t5_3560n

Saying they remain unknown and that it will reveal itself to us in time states to me that we need to find out what it does and that in fact it does do something. And as not everyone plays VoG nor has the Vex Mythoclast it has to relate to the VoG and the VoG only.

I am standing on the left synch plate but you can see that neither it nor the right synch plate is active. Although you cannot see it I can also vouch that the center wasnt active for that tower raise either.I have now raised the tower  times by myself in patrol mode using a simple mythological mechanic that I posited early on but never took the time to test.Whether it leads to a chest IDK. But this is a mythlore based design element that you would have to be specifically looking for to find although a couple other people have experienced it as a glitch because they didnt realize the trigger. It allows you to raise the spire alone based on your faith in a certain God. Unfortunately it doesnt open the door in Patrol mode  just raises the spire. The mechanic is time consuming so I have not tested it in raid mode. However after last night I think I know how to do that finally as well. However it is also possible that there is a second part of the ritual I am just missing. I know how to invoke the tower but as of now not the God himself.Cake. Words like cake I say!

Yesterday during atheon i tried to manipulate the inicial teleport just opening the portal and go in before Atheon teleports  random fireteam members. Only tried it twice first time only  were teleported to the same place has i  second time  were teleported again same place i was. I wonder if we are suposed to manipulate the teleports or i just got lucky or is some bug. Anyway just wanted to share what happened to me.

4138320,0,t3_381y2c,gtYou will remain dead if you were dead when the mission ended. That will be addressed by a future patchThis one has always caught my eye. Its as if youre supposed to be alive or at least revivable after the raid ends for whatever reason. Given that this hasnt been fixed yet it points me to one of two scenarios.Scenario A There is something to do after defeating Atheon and being dead means you arent given the chance to do it. This seems to support a claim floating around a while ago on the B.net forumsgt. People have triggered the chest multiple times!. A TON of raid teams progress through the vault complete the necessary triggers and do not take that one final step to getting the chest. Consider it a race that you quit at the finish line.. IT IS NOT as complicated as people make it out to be. This would eliminate unrealistic triggers like flawless runs with all Vex and raid gear. listening to the tune of the oracle kill a gorgon with NLB etc. orScenario B There is nothing else to do yet but there will be at a later date which explains why Bungie havent fixed it yet. One could assume they dont want to tell people when theyre fixing it in case it draws attention to them patching in something else to do,raidsecrets,crrzjhv,1,t5_3560n

Since there are  Gorgons in NM it could fit to their ruleset. The old DeeJ slip up as well that it has been activated but chest not found or along them lines could be due to people killing some random gorgons by the path they took..they just happened to kill   and  whichever ones they may be.The main challenge to the Labyrinth isnt really the Gorgons but you and your team not messing up and working as a good unit to get through unspotted...but then again every Gorgon is of Boss level health and Demos immunity mechanics guide shows Bungie did put a lot of work in to make sure that a difficult optional battle became more difficult with each optional encounter you choose to take on.

4700782,0,t1_ctn0amf,Thanks for the offer.  Im ps at the moment unfortunately I plan on upgrading to x for TTK.  Ive only ever solo tested because getting a group is basically impossible.Should have found it by now is definetly the crux of the argument.   If we havent found it by now we have two choices it doesnt exist or its a very complex hidden trigger and is nearly impossible to find.  Neither is worth looking at by comparison to simple tests with half decent odds.Ive searched up and down that room underneath way up high.  Solo at gatekeepers shooting everythingto determine potentialIf theres a passage I dont think it exists in the present but I mean I can only check so much so I could have missed it.Id be more interested in the past and future versions of the room.  I didnt get a chance to get into where or what to do after because this post was running really long.  But I think it would involve at least one of the portals and some time stuff. If you test atheon stuff remember to save the checkpoint on an alternate guy.  Because you might not get a second chance because death is permanent and a lot of stuff involves risky jumps or entering potentially blinding portals without a relic. Might have to beat it a few times.Start with Supplicants it should be easier way easier. With  ghallarhorns you might not even notice not killing the Supplicants. ,raidsecrets,ctn2m5c,3,t5_3560n
4709056,0,t1_cto2vam,No problem bud I have much to ruminate on anyway.  Lets answer some queries.You dont have to go down to the little cave although hunters may have to go this way.  From up top before the big jumps down to the little cave jump onto the second block to spawn from top not the first of two on the third spawn as shown and then jump immediately left to the rocks under the left passage cave and up.  I just want to check the cave on route and possibly meet up with party hunters.Killing the Gatekeeper does create a soft lock but you can still go outside just not up to where you jump up from.  This needs a little more looking into though because if this is the only area where you get lost in time then that in itself is interesting EDIT Its not.  Also having another team member stay in the Throne Room not a clue but makes sense definately.  Most of my exploring is done alone so hard to test most people dont think there is anything else to find in the vault so its sort of hard to find people willing to spend huge quantities of time testing ideas.The Vex spotting you is line of sight problem being as you get close to the Gatekeeper every man jack one of them is facing right at you.  Best way Ive found is from the central platform.  You can get right up to the Gatekeeper without waking any of them and the Gatekeeper just stares you down in a sort of quizzical what the hell are you doing here!? stroke youre no threat to me you little moron sort of way.,raidsecrets,cto450v,2,t5_3560n

As for the alternative Im fairly certain there are six platforms not too sure about fakeouts.There is also a floating platform up high and one down low. So I guess another two?

4785360,0,t3_3gfsal,This was fantastic really nice job!The fact that the ALupi plates are each slightly different to each other is really interesting.The Vex Architecture is of great importance to me. It seems there are two mysteries here. Not only what Osiris was up to but the Vex as well. Given two sets of remnants and ruins we must remember not to treat these scattered pieces as the same puzzle despite them being found in the same box.There are a few extraordinary examples of Vex Architecture here that we havent seen anywhere else in the game The horizontal Vex portal in the hidden room with the small living quarters. I dont remember any other portals like that in the game. The only thing that comes close is The Juncture on Venus but even thats totally different. The very large passage with blue barrier. That thing is ominous as fuck. We know of a few other similar structures complete with blue and white barriers around Venus near the Endless StepsCampus  and even The Black Garden. But this one really seems unique. Ill check out the rest and document them soon to make sure. The glimmer rooms obviously are very interesting. Whether they were built andor filled with glimmer by Osiris or the Vex they remain very mysterious and eager to be opened and claimed by Guardians of the Light. Im glad you pointed out the generator and its cable passing through the barrier. Youre right to assume that its powering the barrier itself but then why would it be on the outside? To keep people out? Or keep something in? Try not to deny other possibilities as well such as powering something else inside that we cant see or perhaps siphoning something out or even being powered from something inside. The ship there was nearby perhaps the generator was used to rechargerefuel his ship or tools or weapons.....??? The loot chest area of course holds significant.... uh significance. Unique chest unique architecture the actual loot itself Osiris books generators and decoration all on top of an Alpha Lupi plate? Bungie wanted to make it obvious for this to be the most important area of The Lighthouse. They say smaller puzzles are harder to solve because you never seem to have the pieces you need despite them being laid out in front of you. Theres not a lot of room to work with here but those walls and unique symbols plus the little moving Vex machines... its just screaming significance.This is a tough cookie but the first steps of solving any puzzle is to identify all the pieces note individual importance and highlight the differences. Keep up the great work guys! One step at a time....,raidsecrets,ctxqg3q,3,t5_3560n

Take enough killing to feed your worm and a little more to grow. Tithe the rest to the Acolyte who commands you.You Acolytes lead your Thrall in battle. Take enough killing to feed your worm and a little more to grow and take the tithe of the Thrall you lead. Then tithe the remainder to the Knight or Wizard who commands you. Thus you pay tribute.You Knights and Wizards lead your followers in battle. Take enough devastation to feed your worm and a little more to grow and take the tithe of your followers. Then take another portion as much as you dare and use it for your own purposes. But if it is too much your peers will kill you and take it. Then tithe the remainder to the Ascendant you serve.An Ascendant will be those among the Hive who gather enough tribute to enter the netherworld.

Thats at least how I tried to explain the count to myself. Independent of how many guardians were marked during one conflux phase it will count  I think in that run all markings happened during the same phase. Two oracle sets marked us so . We were not marked during Templar phase so . That makes x marked for negation. But I would really like to further investigate that.It would be awesome to run VoG again with a raidsecrets team and check the sounds and vault states.,raidsecrets,cxrok3b,1,t5_3560n

6628008,0,t3_46d1pz,Hello again udoughnutcake! Glad to see people are trying to move forward with our Vex circle documentation. Honestly when I read The VoG Vex circles ARE the MIDAs multitool I thought you were joking. But dang I cant unsee it now! Now I have no idea what to do with that information but thats crazy how similar they look. Also that the Gorgon circle is the only one that matches up. Even if it wasnt designed to match Mida thats a really cool find and theory!Whats bothered me back since theorizing the circles could be transistortype structures for Vex informationenergy or MOSFET designs like you point out is the existence of both horizontal and vertical Vex circles. It really screws with the potential for mapping these things or figuring out if they represent some sort of map or... something.gtDo these circles appear outside the VoG area? Anyone found them elsewhere on Venus or maybe Mercury? Theres no Vex circles at the Lighthouse though like uVonZeppelin and uSeventhCircle pointed out there are lots of Alpha Lupi. There are Vex circles in the Vertigo PvP map on Mercury. There are lots of Vex circles across Venus as well as in the Black Garden on Mars I guess it might not really be Mars? But it sounds better than saying the potential Vex pocket universe on Mars haha.Heres an album I just uploaded of a lot of the Vex circles in the wild  I might build off your post here and post all these images as a separate post in a clean table format...

ToM? maybe the exception but the items needed were resources that could be found in the world. Nechro? Random drop to upgrade purchase of orb from Eris. Exotic Sword? You were handed the quest. with the OP we were given hints on how to unlock the quest. ,raidsecrets,d9wyoj0,1,t5_3560n

9756052,0,t3_5dxcm7,I was playing around with them today. I think it may have something to do with lighting all three and then hitting the middle with a slam from the relic axe in the splicer cave at the back. I almost did all three before the relic ran out with Titan skate but I couldnt quite make it. After it seemed that some of the stacks were no longer lit and it could of just been me but when you hit the middle forge button I heard an audio cue of of a ringing bell....,raidsecrets,dafnh1y,1,t5_3560n

10118752,0,t1_dbqgkfw,Just theory crafting at this point. Ill try to throw out my though processes hereRandomly picked out a Vex origin theory that the Vex evolved out of human tech at some point our base computer systems are binary base. I figure since the cloak is a thing binary may still be our base system in the GoldenPostGolden Age. So we could still use binary in the future whenever the Vex are born.As such since Binary is about the most simplistic language you can get at its core and assuming Vex are at their core binary I figure that if we could find a base correlation that can extrapolate into larger systems like how you can make letters with binary it might be possible to reverse engineer that into some sort of applicable pattern?It might not be anything at all. I was just trying to think of ways base data could extrapolate into something and base is about the simplest I could think of.Long shot but since the Vex have a lot of ancient Greek mythology have we tried fitting it into a decimal base system since thats what ancient Greeks used?I need to go find that thread that collated a bunch of theoriesdata again.,raidsecrets,dbqhbox,2,t5_3560n
