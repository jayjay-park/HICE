6712458,0,t1_d0dkyuf,yeah i thought about buying an old S phone with micro SD.Turns out similar pricing and way long battery life.,FiiO,d0dmjcn,2,t5_349aj

10205071,0,t1_dbz6363,I dont think itunes is a problem. None of the files came from the itunes store and they work fine under different programs. I even tried ripping cds through windows media player and ripping youtube videos to mp and adding them to the fiio to see what would happen but still having these issues. Ive been ejecting the sd before disconnecting as well.Im thinking it may have something to do with the fiio not being able to read the card properly for whatever reason. Ill just have to try a different card out I guess.Thanks for the replys.,FiiO,dc0svye,1,t5_349aj
