2250238,0,t1_ci5tbx9,Yeah I think the problem for a majority of IFTTT users is that this app has the methods in place already to enable the triggers from certain events Tasker doesnt have these things you need to specifically know how to check for these events happening at a base level rather than click a button and it just does it P I myself use tasker and wouldnt be able to set up a trigger that activates if for example I made a new post to FB.,ifttt,clpunxt,2,t5_2stey

7571302,0,t1_d32sva5,Im not sure thats true.For example I wouldnt use Tasker to Save all my Tweets to a Google Drive Spreadsheet because those services have nothing to do with my local phone and itd be very convoluted to implement in Tasker. IFTTT is a significantly better option for that type of connection between internet services.I would however use Tasker for Silence my phone when I get to work even though IFTTT can do that because those functions are all local to my device and dont need cloud services IFTTT in the middle.My favorite stuff actually integrates Tasker and IFTTT via the Maker channel. One of my best automations is IF my phone detects high light levels while Im at home after pm all via Tasker THEN tell my Wink lights to dim via IFTTTs Maker channel to receive the Tasker command which triggers IFTTTs Wink Shortcuts.,ifttt,d32tj8p,2,t5_2stey

10107997,0,t3_5kg09i,There are definitely ways to do what you want but all of the ways I can think of involve a computer that is on all the time.On a Mac you can create a folder action. This will basically trigger an action any time a folder is modified. So if you had an ifttt recipe that saved a file to a folder in your dropbox and had a folder action on that folder you could write a script that would do exactly what you want. Unfortunately this is a multi step process.I do really with Ifttt would introduce an advanced mode. ,ifttt,dbp3052,1,t5_2stey

10510647,0,t1_dckg0f7,Im back! Im now using premade applets that I found through search. Still dont have a share icon for any of them. So this doesnt appear to be the solution.Can you let me know your experiences with sharing via URL? What happens if I share the URL of a applet created with the Applet Maker? Sorry I dont have a partner right now that I can test this withCheck now doesnt appear to do anything I read somewhere that this is how you manually trigger your recipes now but I did that about eight times this morning and  hours later havent received a single notification on my phone.I dont understand why all this stuff was changed from the way it worked in  as in my experience it was easy to use working correctly and offered functionality that somehow seems to have vanished.
