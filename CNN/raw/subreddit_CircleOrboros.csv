I played it at the Seattle Open a couple weeks ago and likely will bring it to Kingdom Con. At ATC I sadly went  with him but  two loses were on failed assasination runs so that easily could have been . I played vs Amon twice pKreoss and Harkvich. Had the dice gone my way the  wins would have all been vs Menoth.Originally the list was conceived to be antiUna but the list turned out to be such high pow shooting that I continued to play it. Wolves of Orboros mirage threat  which is great and with Mohsar using sands of fate to get the wild argus animus on enemies to drop defense you can totally just delete heavies or casters. All of the guns are magical and with all the sprays and access to blessed the list also basically ignores all conventional antishooting tech.I play the list basically as an allcomers when paired with Wurmwood.
