1107556,0,t1_chu6ko3,I have about  blushes not including indie blush. I know that itll take me a lifetime and a half to get through all of it so a little yeah. Im sure that some of them are really similar to another such as all the dusty rose blush trend that appeared a few months ago and Im hoping if I ever get pregnant I have a daughter so I can at least not have to throw it away hopefully. Reading stuff like this makes me feel a little guilty too because apparently I have enough blush to last  years,BeautyAddiction,chu6q9b,2,t5_31ura

1127372,0,t3_271bvu, RAVE decided to try out creamgel liner again but this time with a super skinny brush similar to the Haku H and I may or may not be in love. The fine point brush is what Im used to using and makes gel liner soooooo easy for me RAVE really enjoyed wearing Bites bb for lips in tawny at work. Smells like a cinnamon cupcake to me RAVE finally comfortable with a nonmatte face. With my oily tzone I used to feel that I had to be matte  but now that my cheeks are drier I feel that a slight satin or sheen looks good. Plus my oil doesnt look as glaring when it peeks through RANT skin needs to still fully recover from its freak out about the  weather we had a few weeks ago. Its almost there but god damn is it a slow process.  RANT kind of want the nude lipstick from MACs Kelly Osbourne collection but fuck if I know if itll look good on me. Nudes arent my forte RANT its my birthday month and Im already getting birthday emails from some companies.

1133797,0,t3_273s6u,Ive been wanting to get an Ikea Alex for a while now and my fiance is studying for his first board exam in med school. Last weekend I went to try to get the Alex by myself aiofjeoaijfdjflbswhat? which was a major fail because I couldnt move it onto my cart. I went home for a resounding LOL from my fiance and he told me hed help after his exam which is in a couple of weeks. This weekend he was nagging me for a massage and I told him Id give him one in exchange for him going to Ikea to help me out. I guess he was really hurting because I got an Alex this weekend! It was so easy to build unlike some of the furniture from Ikea that we have and I now feel so much more organized.I have three drawers just for lip products.

1354171,0,t1_cim16wm,Little to no fallout  well I did experience some on the darkest shade but it was really minimal. The pink shade and the darkest shade kicked up a bit too much powder in the pans so the gold next to the darkest would get contaminated.They blended quite well but I feel if you want to use the pink or the golden shade youd need to either foil them or use a white base on my lids they dont show up without one. Lasting power was pretty good! They didnt crease at all D I think it was about  before I saw any minor fading which is good enough for me. I just wish one of the bronze shades was a different colour because they arent different enough to both be in it imo.,BeautyAddiction,cim1bk6,3,t5_31ura

1616861,0,t3_2cs69u, I read beauty blogs pretty much daily. My top three are ViviannaDoesMakeup the great Mrs. H and xoVain but I follow quite a bit more than that. I use Bloglovin. I greatly prefer it to Google Reader RIP. I like honest reviews of products bloggers truly enjoy and I love thoughtfully curated edits. I do like tutorials as well. When it comes to bloggers personal lives it honestly just depends on what the blogger is comfortable with. Id considered starting a beauty blog for a few months before I finally did last month. I thought itd be something fun to do to help me blow off steam. Makeup has been a fun outlet for me and I love learning all I can about the topics that interest me so I figured I might as well. I wanted to cut through the marketing and just talk about products that are fun and effective. My blog is called lilac  gray. Ive loved purples and grays for quite some time and I wanted the name of my blog to be something simple that I liked and knew Id like for the foreseeable future. Lavender gray and various permutations thereof was taken so I finally settled on lilac  gray. My blog is mostly holistically beautyrelated but Ive also featured some lifestyle posts. The way I see it beauty is everywhere even where we least expect it so why not talk about it all? You can find it here and Im on Bloglovin too. I use Blogger. Im not wellversed in web design so I find it simple to use. My blog isnt fancy but Im content with it for now. One of the coolest things to me is seeing how people from all over the world look at my blog as tiny as it is. The Internet has shrunk the globe and its clearest to me when I check my Audience tab. The only real difficulty is sticking to a schedule. This has been one of the craziest summers of my life but I want to post consistently. Im a new blogger myself so I just tell myself to do it for myself. ,BeautyAddiction,cjiyzxv,2,t5_31ura

Piercings since retired five microdermal anchors and three nostril piercings. I HAD a second high nostril piercing but had to take it out because it was slightly uneven with the other one and because it wasnt healing well due to Accutane. I desperately want to get it redone so that my face is symmetrical but Im applying to jobs and...well you all know how that goes. Its great that society is more accepting of body mods now but I still feel like interviewers will completely discount me because of the beautiful jewelry on my face. Next on my list is a full sleeve tattoo but Im broke as hell and the tattoo artist Im going to go to is booked until  anyway.

That and if youre using creamsolid concealers under the eye make sure you warm them up first! I wipe a bit onto the back of my hand for a little and then make sure I use my fingers to put it on. I think its probably just an inevitable tradeoff for undereye concealer though if it holds all day its going to be drying. If its comfortable itll vanish.

2400847,0,t3_2mw0px,So I decided to take a gamble and bought what appears to be the new Nars all day luminous weightless foundation that will be released in Spring  off ebay When it arrived I thoroughly inspected the packagingamplabels. The bottle is a nice qualityampthe cap was sealed with a clear plastic sticker like other Nars products Ive purchased directly. The bottle is labelled just like their other liquid foundations and was also marked as made in the USA which is where sheer glow is made. The label on the bottom matched my other Nars products  and the batch number came up as manufactured in  with the appropriate shelf life when I looked it up on check cosmetic.net.     So that passed my scrutiny of believing it wasnt counterfeit and so I patch tested it on my hand. After a successful patch test I went ahead and decided to take the biggest leap of faith and try it on my face. Its surprisingly similar to Kevyn Aucoin sensual skin fluid expect I actually think its a bit heavier coverage. Its a very fluid serum like texture. The bottle doesnt have a pump or dropper more like a glass rod similar to the YSL fusion ink. It buffs on nicely with a brush or a beauty blender and one layer of  drops is enough to cover my whole face in medfull coverage and one more drop will suffice in place of concealer to cover my hyper pigmentation. It looks really natural with a demimatte finish. Less matte than sheer matte more demimatte than sheer glow. It blended soooo much easier than sheer matte and isnt drying on my drynormal skin. It wore nicely throughout a llong day including a nap and looked a bit more glowy but not oily at the end of the day. Seriously almost exactly like the KA SSF but with a more mild scent will be cheaperoz and heavier coverage.     And there is now what looks like a press release image of the new foundation with identical packaging to the one I bought of Ebay. So based off the product quality labeling batch number and press image I am almost  certain the product that I purchased is authentic and that the new foundation is awesome.    I can add pictures later if anyone is interested.     Edit felt the need to add I did not pay  for it it was listed for less at the time and I made a lower offer. ,BeautyAddiction,cm8gblu,3,t5_31ura

If bangs  sideswept or blunt straight across?  Long short or medium hair?  Etc etc etc.  Thanks in advance!!!P.S. I know my brows are wayyyy too thin and Im working on growing those in.

She missed a couple of days of work because she apparently was in an accident however thats all from what she has texted coworkers none of our department managers have heard anything from her. She missed those days right before her scheduled days off so she has now been gone for  days. I hope shes OK but I cant help but be a little skeptical due to her past behavior. Im just really frustrated that it seems like shes never at work and Im there all the time busting my ass. RaveGot a new haircut and I love it! I have always straightened my hair but decided it was time for a change so now I just add a bit of curling mousse after showing and rock my natural waves. Its so different from what Im used to but I think it really suits me. I lucked out getting this cut too. I moved away from my stylist my grandma about  months ago and have put off getting a cut because a new stylist is fucking scary. I decided to make an appointment at the best salon in my city and picked someone at random. Luckily she has similar hair texture concerns and length as me so she was able to give me something awesome. ,BeautyAddiction,cnwpb64,2,t5_31ura

The other formulations vary a bit at least in additives but it also looks like there are different clays. But the general idea is that they are clay masks targeted for different skin typesconcerns and you add whatever liquid you want to further tailor it to your needs. Ive used water rose water and yogurt. Its messy.

Lavender Sugar and Honeysuckle Lemon Curd were also a good find its nice to mix up and use a different perfume according to my mood Didnt do much with my makeup. My week was pretty boring looking Didnt wash my hair for four days and it felt good. It usually looks like crap after three days but I guess its the cold weather helping My face had stopped burning but its back again. I think the problem is in the waiting period between washing and applying moisturizer. My morning face wash is Benzac benzoyl peroxide and that shit is drying so Im just trying to slather myself in moisturizer while my face is still damp.Next week Gonna be on Poland grinning like an asshole because Ill be on vacation.

3529627,0,t3_30ngvi,Last week After being inspired by Cinderella I pared down my base makeup and used shades and tones reminiscent of the soft golds taupes and mauves used on the eyes in the film. Partly because of this I have hit pan on Light Bronze in my LORAC Pro palette. For my base Ive been using a combination of MUFE Full Cover concealer with Maybelline Instant Age Rewind concealer blended together with my RT Expert face brush. I set that with Hourglass ALP in Ethereal Light and move on to blush. I dont know why but I have been feeling the pinky corals and the peachier pinks. I have two samples of MUFE HD blush in  which is a very pinktoned melon and I dig it. Im also really into NARS Deep Throat which I have recently rediscovered. Both of these shades work well on my neutralcool skin theyre pink enough without too much orange. Love. Speaking of orange though I have been on a hunt to find some way to wear orange on my lips. Again I have very neutralcool skin but I have a lot of redness so the wrong kind of orange can look pretty wonky on me. Ive been trying the Revlon lip butter in Candy Apple which is more red than orange and I think I quite like it. Finally I did a tiny drugstore haul yesterday. I havent done that in a while so it was nice. DThis week I should probably paint my toenails. Its properly spring now even if it doesnt always feel like it. My toes could use some springiness.

10395320,0,t3_5opts5,The police officer who ticketed me  a few days ago because I was going  in a . I had looked down noticed I was at  amp slowed down to the limit of  but I was kind of in duress so maybe I did hit .I WAS speeding but it was because I was on the phone with  trying to tell them the address of my friend who had told me he was going to kill himself in a text then never answered me after I had replied multiple times and had tried to call him.The officer said he was letting me off because he wasnt marking this as my nd violation in the last  months which would be another  dollars. In August of last year I hit a surprisingly nice mans car when he was in my blind spot. The man changed my flat tire for me and was insanely understanding and a total sweetheart. My car is still damaged to the point that one of the doors doesnt open because I couldnt afford my insurance deductible to fix it. Now this officer has obviously seen my past violation. He has also seen the damage to the passenger side of my car. I am sure he put two and two together. But you know  is nothing right? Little does he know that I havent held a steady job in over  years because I was suicidally depressed myself.I said thank you I tried to be personable after breaking down crying when he asked me why I was on the phone with . I had some tissues because I had just gone to the doctor earlier that day because I am sick so I wiped my eyes and moved on like a man. Its not like I was some drunk blithering idiot driving down the road weaving like a... a WEAVER!!! Jesus christ. I was paying attention to the road but also anxious. SORRY for going  in the middle of a  call. Excuse me sir Im aware that I am such a seasoned criminal. Irony is when you are calling  for one suicidal friend while you are driving down to meet the friend that just got out of the hospital because of her suicide attempt for dinner. Dramatic irony is when that officers last name is the same one as your th grade D.A.R.E. officers name. My th grade dare officer was shot by a man who had just committed a robbery and my whole hometown loved him myself included and I am VERY weary of law enforcement because I do not trust people with a ratio of that much power to their minimal supervision.I was SO UPSET. My insurance is going up in  months. But I can pay because Ill totally have a steady job by then....,BeautyAddiction,dcmdjo7,2,t5_31ura
