In this email a hyperlink listing all of the schools affected by Department of Educations decision to terminate ACICSs recognition as a nationally accredited agency was provided. In error University of Advancing Technology is is listedI would like to assure you UAT is accredited through the Higher Learning Commissions. We have not been a part of ACICS for some for some time now and was named on the list in error. Accreditation information is available for you to view online at  . Please feel free to take time to view our accreditation information and if for any reason you have additional questions please contact me immediately. As always thank you for your service and we look forward to helping you reach your educational goals. This message is just to inform you that DOE decision to terminate recognition of ACICS does not impact UAT students. SincerelyAnnette K. BullockVA Certifying Official University of Advancing Technology W. Baseline Rd.Tempe AZ ..You may have received the below email in error if so please disregard and we regret any confusion this may have caused.  The University of Advancing Technology is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools which is part of the Higher Learning Commission.  The University of Advancing Technology is not accredited by ACICS.   This email contains important information that may affect your ability to continue to receive GI Bill benefits at your school.  You can see if your school is affected by clickingDear Student I am sending you this email because our records indicate you are a current or recent GI Bill student attending one of the approximately  GI Billapproved campuses of education previously accredited by the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools ACICS. On December   the Department of Education ED withdrew ACICSs recognition as a federally recognized accrediting agency. If they execute new agreements with ED affected schools can maintain Title IV Federal Student Aid e.g. Pell Grants and federal student loans eligibility for a period of up to  months to pursue alternate federally recognized accreditation. How does this impact me?Recent legislation also allows the Department of Veterans Affairs VA to continue paying GI Bill benefits for up to  months following the withdrawal of recognition of an accrediting agency as in the case of ACICS while the school seeks alternate accreditation or program approval. You should be aware that should your school not achieve new federallyrecognized accreditation or receive approval from your State Approving Agency SAA as a nonaccredited educational institution the approval to use your benefits will end after no more than  months. VA is working in close collaboration with the Department of Education to monitor the progress toward accreditation of each school affected by this decision. You may want to consider your education goals and decide whether your current school and program will meet your need for the next  months or if you should consider other options courses andor schools. Remember Even if your school remains approved for GI Bill benefits it is no longer accredited by a federally recognized accrediting agency. This may affect your ability to transfer credits to another institution or sit for state licensing exams as well as other potential impacts. Always keep in mind details such as whether other schools will accept that schools credits what kind of accreditation regional or national another school has and whether that school provides you the flexibility you need for your career goals. Where can I get more information?If you want to learn more about what happens regarding student aid from the Department of Education Pell Grants federal student loans etc. when ED withdraws federal recognition of an accreditor please read EDs blog post What College Accreditation Changes Mean for Students on their website.    Who should I contact with questions about my benefits?As always please feel free to contact our Education Call Center at  Monday  Friday  a.m.   p.m. CST for any questions about your GI Bill benefits and remaining entitlement or join the conversation on our Facebook page and Twitter pages.
