Make physical contact with her  obviously not in an inappropriate sense when the times appropriate  ie touch her arm in conversation  physically face towards her when Shes talking  look and be Interested! . Body language is everything.  Best of luck! ,BiWomen,cpp6jve,2,t5_2y12s

11092460,0,t3_5ybh4c,I feel I have a very different perspective on gender and sex than monosexual people and its one I would never relinquish. Having a whole range of experiences and being able to compare things that other people can only imagine. I feel that being bi is one aspect of my favourite thing about my personality which is that Im very open and willing to try to understand different views and have new experiences. That part of me wouldnt be complete without being expressed sexually as well. ,BiWomen,depbjl0,3,t5_2y12s
