284091,0,t1_cfa476o,A objection in the first  seconds of your call isnt an objection to your product or service it is an objection to having received a call.  Early call indifference.  The reaction the prospect give once they realize youre not someone they know anticipate or after they identify you as a sales professional. Theres no magic bullet here.  But instead of justifying your worth and spilling your guts at the first moment someone says whats this about or are you selling something  deal with the indifference had on. This is called CHAT.  One technique I use to get around early call indifference. C. Connect. I can completely appreciate that we havent spoken beforeH. Hook.The reason for the call is that I read an article that you were quoted in and had some questions or a much more generic hook.  The more specific the better but for high volume outbound calling where you dont always have an individual hook for every prospect have a generic hook.A. Assume.Would I be right to assume that insert whatever fact you can...You have a copier In the office? T. Transition.OK well let me just share with you the  ft. View of why Im calling and If it resonates then Ill send out some information if not not no harm no foul at least you know what were doing. Is that a fair way to spend a couple of minutes? Your possible responses are going to beok go ahead greatIm busy send me something try againNot interested he wasnt going to buy from you anyway go onto the next prospect.Chat helps you move around early call indifference and continue your mission to deliver a credibility statement and move onto the questioning phase.   Unless you can get there your sale is going to be nothing but a transaction based on price and only if your prospect thinks its worth it.   Totally taking you as the sales consultant out of the equation,sales,cfa7ko2,3,t5_2qib3

347679,0,t3_1y1v0p,Dropins are highly industry dependent they work in some they dont in others.  In general the higher the level of your prospect the less likely a dropin will be to work  its just harder to luck into a slow time when a Clevel officer is willing to speak with you.This is my favorite tactic for getting appointments in a brand new territory  has worked in completely different parts of the country for me thus far. Find a contact name use Google receptionist etc. and an email address.  Any salesperson worth their salt can at least get this far.. Email the contact with a quick introduction tell them you are new give them a taste of what you offer and tell them that you will be calling to followup in the next few days.. Optional but recommended Call in the next few days but try to make it at a time when you are likely to have to leave a voicemail early morning works great for this.  Leave your name and number reference the email and tell them you will try again in the next few days.. Call in the next few days but this time during business hours.  Hopefully if you are lucky you will get your prospect on the phone.  If not you can either repeat this step again or tell them you are going to drop some information by their place of business.. If you choose to drop information go during business hours and see if the prospect has a moment to meet with you.  If yes wonderful.  If not leave the information and followup via phone again.If after all of this you STILL havent made any live contact it might be time to cut bait unless they are a highvalue prospect.  With so many prospects in a new territory you dont want to waste too much time with someone that is simply nonresponsive.  You can always continue to followup but on an every few weeks basis or just do occasional inperson information drops if you think that may be more effective.  You need to walk that line between annoying and persistent that every experienced salesperson knows all too well.,sales,cfgszsa,3,t5_2qib3

Also Id recommend a change in perspective and approach for you. The customer shouldnt feelknow you are a commission salesperson. You shouldnt be pushy or obvious about this.

I could make in a single day what I made in a week working my other job earning minimum wage at a hardware store.Here are my tips for you. Walk  Dont drive to peoples homes.  If youre in a rural or suburban area park down away from the driveway and walk.  You will appear less threatening and it will be easier to build rapport with your customers. Once you have your sales process worked out it becomes a numbers game.  Find a pitch that works for you and stick to it.  Not everyone is going to buy but if you stick with it it becomes a game of statistics. Build a relationship  rapport with your customers.  Ask them how their day is or if they have a problem related to your productservice. Get them talking.  The more they talk and the more you listen the better your relationship with them will grow and the likelihood of getting a sale will be.Cold calling and coldselling doortodoor will teach you invaluable skills about selling and help you grow in character as a person.

I was fortunate since a lot of my career began with a very formal training and very structured methodology.So I say start with Sandler hes well structured its a road that pretty much every sales person understands and almost all modern sales tactics are built off of it. Id recommend a Sandler seminar or a sales trainer. Metrics. For metrics you want to track your dials and conversations and get in the habit of working towards something on every call.  I use the following shorthand   CWPSEPT conversation with prospect want me to call back in September NI Not interested told me no DQROLE Disqualified they wouldnt be involved in the thing Im selling DQCOMP Competitor they also sell what I sell I didnt know LEAD They want to have a meetingconference call about my product  I note every call and note their disposition I then cycle back through and keep thorough notes.  Keeping people in your funnel and removing them when they arent interested and circling back when they ask you to is how you can go from a terrible sales person to an average one or an average salesperson to a good one.  Keeping these notes will allow you to make calls at the right time and speaking to people when they are buying. Lastly what you arent asking what type of results are normal? Cold calling is hard incredibly hard however its a fundamental skill in sales. You will feel  on fire some days and others youll wonder why you even bother.  The death of a great salesperson is when they ARE ON FIRE AND DOING WELL. A fat sales funnel can build comfort and getting too comfortable can put you in  place to keep building that funnel.  The secret is to always be hunting never get complacent especially when things are going your way.,sales,cqirk8u,2,t5_2qib3

3963112,0,t3_35ujg8,My answer assumes you are not new to sales or the product you are selling your manager isnt along to train you.  I have used my sales manager and other members of management during various parts of the sales cycle.  You want to leverage them to a specific end and ideally you should retain control of the meeting.  By doing this effectively youll demonstrate to the client that you have command of all your companys resources to solve their problems. Here are a few ideas that have worked for me Bring your manager in to gain access to a higher level decision maker.  Typically companies will match power to power when youre bringing in a Director VP etc. If youre stuck in the midtolate sales cycle bring in a manager to help you get the deal unstuck.  Use a visiting exec from your team to leverage meetings at prospects or clients.  Ive had great success using my VP is in town next week and would like to meet with you or for prospects  my companys President is in town next week and is a real thought leader on XYZ...heshe would like to meet with you while theyre here.To answer your last question Yes only use a manager for a role to which they are suited.

Let him know that you are done with him stepping over you and to stay away from your customers you are helping or you will have a serious problem. Get you anger out in a professional but stern manner. Then just stay silent and let him react. Do this in private I would hope. Hope for improvement and hes not a dumbass and if he does it on the show floor again I would just tap him on the shoulder and give him the stare of fucking death and I would hope he got the picture. Then ask him to go grab something in the backregister help or go elsewhere in the store so the customer isnt wondering whats going on. If you do this in private there is nothing to be scared of. If you dont do this in private eventually you might just get so pissed it might lead to a scene in the show floor which wont look good to your manager.I had to have a discussion with a fellow financial advisor at a trade show. I was getting plenty of Prospecting leads but my approach was more laid back and friendly letting people take their time to check out our booth..

4802689,0,t1_ctzn160,Ill be honest. Im disappointed by this answer. How to attract a salesperson and fairly compensate them is a question all new businesses have. Its especially difficult to find an answer in the BB SaaS space. I know because Im in the same business as the OP selling software as a service to businesses not the gas station service industry. Your statement that you are a business consultant got me very interested in your views. Unfortunately for me I didnt read any of this instantly disqualifies what you have to say. And thats a real shame as this is a question that new business owners desperately need assistance with.Looking over your subsequent comments you make some good general points  especially with respect to long tail sales  although Im not sure that you understand OPs market.  At least that seems to be what you are saying in your black hole analogy. It looks to me as hes viewing a salesperson as an independent contractor hence the requirement to cover their own expenses provide their own office equipment. OP comes from an IT background where this is very commonplace. It appears to me as though hes simply drawing from his own experience with staff extension and general hiring practices. In one comment you even comment that the compensation plan isnt bad if its coupled with a salary. It would be helpful to indicate whether that is in addition to the commission or if its a draw. Also what area of the country is K considered sufficient? Does it need to be adjusted for the coastal or midwestern states? Also is it correct that you are suggesting he immediately jump into hiring  people at a base salary cost of K before benefits payroll taxes and more? Im asking because I have similar questions. Is the proper course to start out of the gate with a VP of Sales and an underling with an approximate cost of K in salary benefit and tax obligations?Again Im asking because I have similar questions.

They have tried to hire me many times there were a couple of close calls but the planets just didnt line up for me once and I didnt make the cut for their global accounts team when I was young.  My experience with these huge companies is that they have company culture criteria that they use to evaluate candidates.  So you have to ask every person that you speak with a lot of good qualifying questions starting with What are some of the traits of an ideal candidate for this position?  Recruiters are usually happy to spill their guts.  You have to ask them What is your best advice on landing this job?This is an internal recruiter so you dont have to worry about it as much but be careful with rd party recruiters.  They will always tell you that youre a front runner for the position and anything else they can so you wont look for another job.

5435541,0,t1_cw5s7v6,The vast majority of sales jobs logistics or otherwise will have you partitioned off from operations duties. Yes youll generally have to do some administrative work for your pipeline and AR as a salesman but TQL is fairly unique in the fact that their salespeople are  responsible for the operational end of the business. Most other pls will have the account execs dealing with customers while the rest of the team covers the freight and ensures delivery.Just a big word of warning here logistics sales is about as shady and cutthroat as you can get. There is little to no barrier to entry youll work absurd hours and in the end youre selling something with very little value. Any shipper can get the exact same service from TQL that they get from Coyote Suntek freightquote.com etc. A pl is just a middleman between the people who pay for the service  and the people who actually carry it out. So the sales here is really just about volume. You have to call enough people until you find someone who needs an extra hand or is angry at their current provider. Youre not selling value and youre not providing anything that your customer cant get from literally dozens of other providers often at a better rate than TQL because they pay a very low commission percentage relative to other firms. Once again Im not explicitly telling you not to do it. If youre just starting out in your career it might be a good experience grinding out  cold calls a day to rough blue collar shipping managers. It certainly helped me cut my teeth out of college. But remember  of the people who get hired at TQL are gone within  months and IIRC its something like  after  years. You will have a poor quality of life you will be stressed out and you will most likely move on within a year. Even if youre successful there youll still be working  hours a week and getting late night phone calls from angry truckers. Just know what youre getting into.,sales,cw6g0z2,2,t5_2qib3

5830178,0,t3_3uvd9y,Being on the other side of this as a CxO  VP  Director at tech companies over the years I can tell you I had days where it felt like I spent  of my time saying no to recruiters.  Seriously.  And frankly it sucks.  I always tried to be as respectful as possible but you need to realize you may be recruiter cold call  for the day.I never took meetings knowing Id cancel but I know a lot of folks who did  just to get someone off the phone.You need to do something to stand out BIG TIME.  The I have nothing to sell you lets just meet to build a relationship line is used by everyone. Heres a few things that stood out to me over the years.... Meeting on my terms  Can I meet you at your local Starbucks on the way in to work Thursday or  I know restaurant X is right down from your office can you get out a few minutes early one day next week for a drink?Anything like this always stood out as long as it wasnt lunch which always turned into a  minute time suck.. Actually know what the company does and what the needs are.  Spend  minutes looking at the About Us and Products page.  Look on linked in at current employees and see what roles we have.  If recruiting for technical folks understand high level what tech stack we use and what our recent hires have looked like hint well probably need more folks just like that. Provide some value up front this mainly lets me know you did your homework on .  Saying I saw Jane Smith started there in March doing X.  I dont know if you still have similar reqs now but I have a candidate with skillsets XY amp Z that seems like a perfect match if you did.  Would love to tell you more about them....Doing something like this gets you in the top  EASILY.  Just NOT feeling like another random cold call where zero effort was spent up front learning about my needs was huge.  I almost always met with folks like this since it hardly ever happened. Timing  Catch me an hour after a key position was vacated or a new project landed on my desk with new headcount to fill and Ill probably take your call and meet you that afternoon.Standing out  amp above means that I probably called you instead.

6337852,0,t1_cza0qiw,Not a problem.  Im happy to help.. I believe the managed services industry will continue to grow but theres some evidence to suggest that some larger companies are bringing IT back in house.  By larger Im not talking about enterprise but on the upper medium size businesses.  Full stack managed services isnt for every client.  The cost savings to a company really depends on the size of the business and the maturity of their IT department.  One of the benefits of MS is  of the work we do can be handled remotely so theres very little need to send someone onsite on a regular basis.  Some of the larger companies I work with are moving or have moved their storage into the cloud and are in the process of moving their servers into a hosted environment as well.  Most of the smaller companies I work with lt  employees are reluctant to move to the cloud simply because they dont full understand or trust it.  . The biggest challenge we face in the industry is building trust in the solution.  Most of the DMs I speak with arent technical people so the concept of managed services is foreign to them.  Most of them are also at a point in their companys growth where they have to make a decision on how to approach their networks.  Do they expand their current staff if they have on do they hire an in house staff if they dont have one or do they hire a MSP?  Our job is to show them how outsourcing to a provider is the more cost effective option. . Security is huge.  Its an easy way in the door.  No one is nearly as secure as they think they are and everyday we see news stories about Enterprises having critical data breaches.  My company offers free security assessments.  I dont know if I could put an actual figure on the total revenue dedicated to network security but I can tell you it is at the top of most peoples priorities.. For me prospecting is a ritual.  When I begin reaching out to a new target company I have the entire communication path planned out.  I get in  touches in the first  days.  Each touch is planned to the point that I dont need to think about what Im going to say when I call or email.  Just to be clear these arent spam type calls or emails. I call on specific topics each time.  It takes multiple touches to turn a cold lead warm.  Not hot.  Just warm.  ,sales,cza1krj,3,t5_2qib3

7422284,0,t3_4gt88m,Generally I like your posts uCyndershade yet I might have some disagreement here.First of all basically I am not sure if solar is profitable or something Id like or not which may depend on the specific product. If it is profitable then its something I could get behind and would want to sell to others. I also like the idea of having energy independence or being off grid which according to some of the posts it suggests some of the solar products being sold are maintained by a centralized group and not the user which is less appealing to me.I disagree with this statement there is not a single consumer in this entire country that has a legitimate and required user scenario for solar panels. The need is energy and this provides energy independence again depending on the product I guess. Again here even if this is simply a want rather than a need as in a desire for having an alternative energy source so long as the product works I find no moralethical problem selling solar. This makes me wonder about your thoughts on environmentalism and political philosophy as some people believe decentralized solar power is better for the environment and safer than a centralized power plant which can be vulnerable to meltdowns and government regulation. This seems to be in the realm possible of debate and personal opinion rather than objective fact it reminds me of the debate between GMO foods which supposedly can feed the world with higher yields but have the danger of possibly creating all kinds of genetic harm versus organic foods which have lesser yields but which we believe can still feed the planet. I guess one could argue there is no need for organic foods in the face of GMOs which produce more but personally I have no interest risking my health needlessly and do believe its a need Im willing to pay more for I see a similar logic with solar vs. nuclear power.Now some talk has been about if solar salesmen make six figures or k or how much they make. Again this can go down to an ethical point personally for me Ive read that buying a new car is usually not an optimal idea because the value of the car goes down immediately upon purchase so for me I would have difficulty selling new cars and would probably be more interested in used car sales though of course every used car was once a new car!. But anyway the point is that maybe less money is being made with solar but this isnt always the top goal so long as some money is still being made. Someone might like biking to work because they get good exercise from it even though it takes double the amount of time. The pay may be half as much for solar but if its something the person likes they may enjoy selling it more than other products they dont like.As far as the solar industry being different from other industries I cant say much on that though it still seems like its sales so there must be similar skills being transferred.I certainly do appreciate vigilance over possible snake oil being sold and think skepticism and debate is healthy so overall thank you for your post!If the power goes out in the expletive deleted grid you do not generate power for your own house.Wouldnt this depend on how many panels you have andor what kind of panels or arrangement you have? I imagine the entire goal of some people is to be off the grid so it must be possible to buy this kind of thing.edit maybe rsolar might have some info relevant to discussion,sales,d2lv5pb,1,t5_2qib3

Clearly someone in HR said this. No sales manager would be this stupid. Ive been a sales manager at two different companies and I refused to let HR screen my candidates. Two thingsAdd a sentence to any of your sales jobs in your resume that indicates that you also provided account management to support  retention or whatever just to cover your bases. If you ever hear that again deny it. Tell them that after you closed a prospect it was your job to maintain them as a customer so your job was half hunting and half account management.

I was terrified of upsetting people.  I spend  weeks Prospecting new clients and booking meetings driven by the idea that these are all going to be new clients new terms etc.  During my prospecting activity I qualify for pain really hard and ensure that we have clear ground rules for the meeting. When where how long for what we will discuss what to prepare ideal outcomes and complete agreement on next steps. The summary of all this sounded like    OK so we will meet for an hour next Thursday in my office. Im going to ask alot of questions and youll prepare your top  problems with X. At the end of the meeting we will decide together if there is or isnt a fit between our businesses. If there is we will decide clear next steps and if there isnt we will call it a day there and then. Are you comfortable with all of that?  ampnbspI do this with and go to meet a VP of Supply Chain at a very large and successful company. Realistically I shouldnt have been meeting her as I wasnt ready to go with the new system yet but you gotta learn sometime right?  I sit in her reception area for  minutes into our meeting she comes out and waves me in. She apologizes for being late but her last call ran over.  I curl my toes and...ampnbsp I understand these things happen. Can I share something with you Im worried about? Sure Im worried that we only now have  minutes and we might not get through the agenda we discussed on the phone. Im worried if we dont get through it all we might not have enough information about each other to make a decision at the end. What should we do?  Thats fine Ive got nothing after this so we can do the full hour.ampnbspI could have said nothing and just taken the fact that she had broken our contract. But it took me  seconds of guts to remind her we had a contract and she had broken it but I did it in a nurturing way. ampnbspAnother time I hard qualify and get understanding over the phone with a guy at a pretty small company less than  employees but they were domain experts and doing business with an existing client of ours who recommended them. The meeting starts with small talk walking to his office he sits in his chair and saysampnbspCan you tell me who you are who else your company works with and how you think you can help me?ampnbspBlind sided me completely but this was clearly his process. He wasnt being an ass being difficult or trying to flip any script he was trying to run the meeting. ampnbsp Sorry you caught me a little offguard there I feel like youre on page  and Im still on page .

7938846,0,t3_4ndpiy,Tldr at the end. sorry its long and Im tired so it may have typos or things that dont make sense.I currently work at one of the major carriers in the US and have for the last almost three years. hint its the magenta one.BackgroundIm in college about to graduate in December so I work part time which for me is about  hours per week in four shifts. I really like my job overall. I started in  as an in store technician who basically just did troubleshooting took payments for customers and all the busy work so the reps could make money. I had only worked one previous job in retail target and it was only for a few months during the summer. After  my months my manager asked if I wanted to move up to be a rep and I thought about it for a day and then told him I did. To move up I had to sell  mobile internets tablets hotspots sim cards for their current tablet. So now I started asking every customer during every transaction and I did it so I was promoted to a sales rep. I was extremely lucky because I was hired at a high volume store and was able to stay there when I was promoted. Ive been there ever since.The basics We have quotas that we need to hit every month Post paid activations pre paid smb mobile internet and accessories. Smb and MI are types of posts post paid activations. Then we have smaller quality metrics like paiddata feature attachment rate insurance attach rate. Ex if we sell a post with no upgraded data with a phone that has no insurance then that hurts our quality metrics but helps our activation goal.Our goal is like  attachment rate for data and insurance.Overall this month my quota is about  activations and around k in accessories with  smb  MI.As a rep you can waste your day by waiting for customers to walk in. However you can make the most of your day by being proactive. The last few months since I decided I want to pursue sales as a career after graduation so Ive been working on making calls and reaching out to customers to generate foot traffic and bring business into the store. We have out bound calling campaigns that were supposed to do that most like  reps just ignore or pretend to do. Ive been hitting it hard making calls and branching out to do actual cold calls to businesses that I find by googling so I can get better and be ready for a bb position.The job itself isnt hard once you get used to it. The general formula goes something like thisCustomer walks in and you greet them. They dont have your service and are inquiring about switching. You ask them discovery questions to find pain points with their current carrier and you right fit them into a plan with phones appropriate data plans accessory package etc. Making sure to address their pain points so you minimize your chance of a hesitation. Overcome any hesitations and close the sale hopefully.. Questions about their account bill payment you audit their account during the transaction and upsell them stuff. Phone upgrade. You help them choose a phone and sell them other stuff too.Its not too hard to hit quota consistency is key. You wont make crazy money if you just do the minimum though. Like I said Ive been making lots of calls to set appointments for people to come in so I dont have to rely on foot traffic and so I can make more money.The badIts retail hours can be annoying weekend shifts night shifts like pm  etc. The general bs that comes with all retail jobs like annoying customers.Semiunrealistic quotoas how can you get a  data attach rate AND a  insurance attach rate AND k in accessories AND right fit your customer without slamming them and pushing things on them that they dont want. Answer you cant.Its the most annoying thing for me personally because Im trying to get better at real honest sales techniques and its hard to do that when management makes us shove things down our customers throats that they clearly dont want or need. I.e. bundling tablets  gb of data  in accessories etc. for someone who just uses their phone for emails and some light Facebook use who would actually benefit from a gb plan no tablet and maybe a case for their phone. Obviously I like making money but Im not a fan of some of the sales techniques management wants us to use.I found a happy medium with keeping both my managers off my back and my customers happy while making good money and not resorting to unethical methods.The goodPay is great. Like I said I work part time and I made  hour last year total money  total hours for the year.We get  hour plus a good commission structure pm for details if you want.Benefits are amazing for a part time job PTO which accrues based on tenure. You start off at like . hrs per pay period I think which is basically one shift per month or about  weeks per year full health dental vision insurance tuition reimbursement k matching employee stock purchasing program yearly  stock grants  off my cell bill I have myself parents and gf on my plan so I save quite a bit yearly plus a couple others I cant think of right now.Overall I really like my job its not too difficult you can make good money but personally Im ready to move on. Im very glad I found sales though because I love sales as a career field.My advice is to work for a corporate store.

It was a total beatdown. Even though they tried to give me everything I needed to succeed it was veery difficult for me in my first sales job because of the discouragement you deal with everyday n sales the commrodary with your other coworkers is what keeps you going if your in a company thats structured that way.

8662036,0,t1_d6o1ixd,Thank you for the response.If I may Ill counter with thisI disagree with the premise that the salarycommission deal is equal to the straight commission deal. I believe that former is better in many instances. However I will concede that it is not equal in all instances. I was offered those options and they were equal I would take the former. However I would use my time to find a sales job that offered me a greater opportunity. And most great opportunities come in the form of commission only. To be fair I know Im wired differently than most people and think differently.But I dont think my original post about go out and sell was in anyway out of line.Whether you are salary or commission guy you should be out hitting streets everyday performing the activities of a salesman. When you perform those activities you will eventually make sales.

8794287,0,t3_50ilb5,Wont be a popular answer but you already know this is common in med device. Part of the reason is the builtin residual sales especially if youre selling disposables. The way the company looks at it theyve already paid you to acquire that customer the first year once a doc trieslikes a new disposable product they tend to integrate it into their practice which creates a stream of revenue thus their subsequent orders are built into your next years quota. This way retention and growth are encouraged. Otherwise a rep making K selling an implant can just keep the same surgeons using their product at the same volume and make the same amount year after year...no incentive to grow the business. Because were generally paid well the tendency is to go on autopilot.In your case the company could give you some sort of quota forgiveness for losing a client that wasnt your fault but that sort of thing happens...doctors retire or move. Your fault or not the company needs to grow their bottom line and are accountable to shareholders or VCs that expect that lost account to be replaced and grown. In anticipation of downvotes and only a shitty company would do that Ive worked for a top  device company who changed commission plans a few times but always incentivized growth first and foremost. You will be hard pressed to find an established med device company that wont.The lab issue that caused your customer to leave in the first place would be more concerning to me.,sales,d74yd36,3,t5_2qib3
8799774,0,t3_506dsm,ucyberrico posted on an old AMA the following I would determine who my ideal customer is. How big are they? What industries? Then I would go to Data.com and do an advanced search with that criteria. Save that search. Sort it alphabetically. Work that list.Depending on what you sell and what your average deal size is would determine for me what my prospecting strategy would be. If youre going after really huge companies then cold emails are very effective. For companies with  or fewer employees I would hammer the phone.I would build my strategic partnership network immediately. Find companies that sell to the same decision makers in the same industry as you but dont compete with you and partner with them. Many of them. Keep around the ones that send you leads dump the ones that dont and replace them with more that send you leads. Work hard to find opportunities for the ones that send you leads. Take fantastic care of their customers.I dont use social media for much. I use LinkedIn to connect to prospects whom I have spoken with existing and former customers strategic partners vendors etc. Its important to build that network.

8858624,0,t3_51ksnc,My VP says call when you have something new This translates to call several times when you have something new and maybe send an email or two. This became easy when I realized every new customer that is similar every big event were an event based company every time the prospect is in the news anytime something we have talked about comes across my desk etc. I have a reason to send a quick note or give a quick call. It has become much more natural now that I have something to bring up and talk about. Edit I just read your actual post instead of just the title. If youre doing the same thing over and over youre just banging your head on the wall. If there is nothing new to bring up to them possibly try to set a call to talk about everyones favorite topic themselves. Ask to set up a call to discuss what theyre doing their goals and how they plan to get there. You can even ask under the context that you want to better know their business so if there comes a time that your solution is a good fit you can reach out to them. On the second listen learn everything you can and try to get to their pain pointchallenge. I usually ask them outright saying it sounds like youve put a lot of thought into xyz.

I would begin with doing thought experiments of the worst case scenarios and what solutions you could provide.  If a customers service is down can you provide technical troubleshooting help?  Do you just sell it and bolt letting the VoIPISPIT guys sort it out?  Or do you play an active role in troubleshooting network testing incoming data service manage their ISPVoIP service etc.?        Ive ran across folks that ended up doing a  person VoIP shop reselling Ringcentral x etc.  They do ok if they do some channel partnership with internetvoice resellers too.  But cloud is far from perfect and Id have a backup plan for worst case things...if you dont youll ultimately get a bad repuationreviews and then any business model youve built will have been a waste of time unless you sell your base to a competitor i guess.        Final note youd be what some call either a trunker or flybynight both of which are very easy to compete and win against in a VoIP sales deal.  You have no inhouse tech support no service department for tickets no accountant for billing issues etc.  youre go to line will be call your provider which is honestly nothing a customer would like to hear.  If a customer is savvy enough they will realize beforehand they should either go with a VAR with service department that resells cloud offerings via a channel OR go through the direct reps of the cloud provider itself.

9114234,0,t3_54ymu7,Scripts are a great way for new sales people to get started. For our new sales reps we had them think of answering three questions. It was applied after listening to our reps pitching in all sorts of ways without having a descent framework to use.  When building you script you should consider answering the following What answers do you want to learn in the call? What attitudes do you wish the prospect to feel? What actions should occur after the call?AnswersSince your product is solution focused and made only for those specialized machines  bringing up the painproblem your product is solving early in the call will create instant authority for your sales people. If you highlight the pain straight away your new sales people will know instantly if the product is a fit or not. AttitudesSince you have  years with experience your pitch is naturally solid and experience heavy. Incorporate industry terminologies reference cases and new insights regarding your product.

9521814,0,t1_d9m4kct,I started selling medical equipment when I turned . In my twenties after graduating college I was an english as a second language teacher over seas.  My first job was in the training group for a surgical laser.  When a system was purchased i was the guy who would go in and train the department on using the system.  When a sales spot opened up I moved into that and the rest is history.  I went from selling a  laser in the OR to selling .MM equipment in a different department in my second job to now selling MM equipment in my third.  I was not nearly as confident or proficient in that first job but knocking down bigger and bigger deals teaches you what you need to know.  The worst part about it at least in what I sell large capital equipment is that the deals take  months and at any point the customer can change their mind a key person can leave any number of factors can evolve during that time and my project dies.  Winning a deal pays great but i may only get  a year.  Other medical sales people especially the disposable folks build relationships over time to the point where their customers only buy from them.  Their product is more of a commodity that can be bought from  other companies so they have to be involved with the key folks to a higher degree but the upside to that is they can build their territory over time to pay out steadily.  For me this isnt the case  I close a project I need to move on to the next one in subsequent quarters.  I feel like Im on a treadmill that is steadily getting faster a lot of days. When I started I wasnt a natural salesman I was a teacher.  It took some time to learn the skills the process of hospital budget cycles and how to navigate the hospital without getting booted.  Brick by brick I built up the chops and my confidence to do it well.  You can too but that is something you will need to work at.  You identified it yourself in your first paragraph here so its something you know you need to do.  Id suggest finding a sales mentor somewhere in your industry.  You have a cousin selling medical now right?  He could be a good start.  Eventually you will be introduced to others in medical  when you meet someone who has it together that is about ten years ahead of you in their career ask them if you can take them to lunch or meet for a coffee and pick their brain.  Be honest with them that you are looking for a mentor  theyll love it.  You now have a contact in the industry that will look out for you someone who will keep you in mind for opportunities as your career progresses.  As they rise they can bring you with them as long as you demonstrate that you are capable of doing the job.Sales isnt for everyone but it is a great way to make a good living.  Id suggest throwing your hat in the ring here and at least trying to get the interview.  From there you need to ask  questions to your cousin on what he did to land the job so you can come out positively.  As to your confidence fake it till you make it will get you far in your first years.  You will take it on the chin most days but if you learn the lessons of those beat downs you will be one of the guys making the fat commissions and having new guys ask you to be their mentor.Good luck.,sales,d9mrkl7,2,t5_2qib3

If the principal of an agency is enthusiastic about insurance as a career and seems genuinely excited by their job its a great agency.

Back in sales now for a national third party logistics company and I have to admit... Cold calling and sales is very difficult. But if you really believe that what your product or service is good than selling it shouldnt make you feel like a pest. I would maybe recommend finding a product or industry that you have a particular passion with and want become a part of and work for them. Marketing and sales go hand in hand. If youre good with communication and like talking to people and helping solve problemschallenges you will do great and can make a ton of money. If thats not what drives you Im sure you can find a marketing gig that will pay you an average of about k a year. Not terrible but not great either. I have a friend who is a sales consultant for huge tech firms I sold CLevel software for a while and he told me that I am working for the wrong companies which is why I have a bad outlook on sales. At the time when he told me this I thought he was full of shit. Now that Im with my current company he was absolutely right.

It is actually a fantastic way to start networking also so try to choose a field you will be interested in after you have graduated. If you have found a great sales person they are worth their weight in gold in regards to knowledge and learning so be attentive and respectful. And afterwards send a hand written thank you card and stay in touch with the person.

What impressed him so much is my ability to truly ASK for the work with a sense of urgency while remaining tactful and polite.

Its like joining a club and youll jump through quite a few hoops at first. Its easier for if you have a sound grasp of what businesses want and you are able to market themselves to businesses. Industry expertise and technical experience is a must making this harder to enter.With BC you really need a charismatic brand persona. This is easy for some and for others it is very difficult. You dont need to write white paperslengthy technical content but your brand has to be persuasive and bring out all the purchasing triggers in consumers.

It just means youre lacking the knowledge.Im not being literal when I say you need to stand at an angle. It doesnt have to be a perfect  degree angle you dont have to get out your protractor and measure the stance of each person before you talk to them. All Im saying is that its a big nono to stand directly facing another man. If you dont believe me go and stand face to face to another man you dont know and tell me how uncomfortable it is. Tell me how uncomfortable you think he feels.Then shift your position so youre at an angle and tell me how much more comfortable it is for the both of you. Im not making this shit up. Go test it out.Then when youre directly in front of a woman about two feet away tell me how strongly you feel in rapport with her. Itll feel like a connection from one human being to another and be very comfortable. Then shift your position and face her at an angle and notice how that level of connection decreases. It wont feel wrong per se but the rapport could be stronger and youll feel that.I hope youll do some research and read a few books and take some action and trying things out before you discredit someones knowledge next time. People hate what they dont understand and I get that youve probably never heard that before and it might sound wacky but sometimes wacky works.Im not just regurgitating that information about your stance in building rapport from a book I read. Im telling you from real world experience. If youre standing facetoface with another man its going to be extremely uncomfortable because its confrontational.So meet at angles.

You DO have skills that others dont or else everyone would be doing your job.Youre being a little too selfcritical right now. Just go in imagine a wall moving with your back and you cant go back and you must get the sale. Suspend critical thought for a little and keep your prospect and the momentum going. Just like a battle no sale is over until its over.Ask broader questions to the doctor not rhetorical ones. His mind just needs to be reframed. What are you trying to achieve here? Is it more important for your office to diagnose the test correctly or diagnose every kind of test? what kinds of tests do most of your business come from etc.If you just ask well isnt my machine more specific? hes already taken that into account. Get him talking about the ins and outs of his business so you can deliver one clincher like so you said  of your business comes from T anemia and potassium tests bear with me I know nothing about your space and youd like those to come out right  of the time. So isnt a machine that does just those things and does them with the best accuracy on the market exactly what you need right now?This may or may not work Im just coming up with this on the fly but thats really the key. You said youre not quick witted since you seem like a rational person if Im reading right who thinks and reflects a lot instead of going with a gut intuition. Few people think exponentially faster than you they just trust their guts more.Try saying well let me ask you a quick question every time a prospect comes up with an objection for a couple of days then challenge yourself to come up with the right clever question to lead them in the right direction. Shouldnt be too specific or vague youll get the hang of it.  Trust yourself to come up with something fast and since you know your product very well it shouldnt be hard. Soon enough youll be getting your prospects talking up a storm and coming up with questions faster than a lawyer. Hope this helps.,sales,deeldeo,1,t5_2qib3

11342988,0,t3_61ui9m,I can offer you some advice here. I took the same path university to sales for a bit and moved up to Sales Manager very quickly . years.First off dont worry about the age factor or objection. It likely wont come up. Pretty sure its against the law to ask that question anyways in that manner. What you do need to be prepared to answer is how youll coach people with more experience than you. Think hard on that before the interview.A sales manager should be a great mentor know the product better than anyone on the floor know the systems well enough to troubleshoot basics without tech getting involved be able to motivate in order to get the most from every rep and not be afraid to do whatever it takes to ensure the health of the department. Theres many other duties and Im on mobile so Im not typing them all but thats a good start. Sales sets the tone for the company are you confident you can lead your team to success knowing that pressure exists?Its incredibly rewarding but there have been many times I have wanted to bang my head against a wall too. Its not about you anymore thats a hard concept for a lot of newer managers to grasp Ive now trained two of them. You cant play hero mode and save anyone you have to be more creative than that.Seeing your reps be successful is the most rewarding experience ever. But take note they will make more than you or should at least. Be comfortable with that or dont even bother.Interview and see where it takes you. If you are educated and dedicated youre most likely qualified. Good luck!,sales,dfhphv5,1,t5_2qib3

11556078,0,t1_dg5ih3n,Its a multibillion dollar company and they spent a ton of money setting it up so it works well but I work in a small satellite office where my manager doesnt care what I use in terms of tracking things.  I will still use CRM to claim prospects and move into the client stage but Id prefer to have my own separate CRM for a few reasons.  being I like things simple and  being if for some reason I ever move on from this position Id like to have access to my prospect list since that wouldnt go against my noncompete and not try to dig everything out of salesforce ifwhen needed.,sales,dg5vvre,2,t5_2qib3

11661233,0,t1_dgddbsl,I used Hubspot until my company recently switched to Salesforce...we previously had no CRM so I was the only one using any CRM for a while. Helped a few other reps set their territories up in there as well. Salesforce is cool and all but after a few months we all miss the free version of HubSpot.,sales,dghtddv,1,t5_2qib3

You should be building hype and funding through venture capitalists and learn sales as you go. What does your app do? It integrates suppliers with their customers through a communication tool?,sales,dgq8vok,1,t5_2qib3

11808866,0,t1_dgyfewa,Great! Im wondering how Id get connected with a supplier what I would make on a sale and what the process would look like? I merely speak with a lot of people going door to door who are on a fixed income and in poor health diabetic arthritis etc. on a daily basisso I dont know the economics of the industrycommissions. I read Id need to get a letter from their doctor and could get a commission if they bought diabetic shoeswraps and other stuff like thatwhich they get free through Medicare. Does that sound close to right?   ,sales,dgykqt1,1,t5_2qib3
