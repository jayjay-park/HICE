8875,0,t1_ceerzpf,You have to remember that Egoraptor has been around for a really really long time. Like Arin is an internet legend and Im really surprised to hear so many grump fans not know that.The Awesome Series was insanely popular and actually helped shape a lot of animated internet comedy today. You have to remember that Egoraptor is still the most viewed and popular artist on Newgrounds he pretty much paved the way for a lot of guys like Ross and Oney and while those two have their own specific style it is hard to not notice a lot of raptor influence in their earlier works. Just watch Egorapture it pretty much satirically sums it up. Ive personally grown up watching Egoraptor hell I still know him as Egoraptor as opposed to Arin and I dont think that will ever change.What I am saying is Egoraptor is a much bigger deal than Grump if youre over the age of . A lot of people if not most people are subbed to Game Grumps because of Egoraptor so when Arin releases a cartoon as quality as Luigis Ballad you can expect a large audience that may have left him in the past to come back.,gamegrumps,cefg2o4,2,t5_2ulfu

A lot of us in this subreddit know who he is and would love to see him on the show me included but were not representative of the fan base as a whole. How much does the average YouTuber know about a guy who became popular with GG animateds? Is his fan base large enough like somebody like Stamper where Polaris would be willing to help him appear on one of his shows?That being said Id kill to have Greg on the show. Him and Esquirebob are my favorite animators for the show and he definitely deserves the attention in my eyes for accomplishing such skill at such a young age to the point where not even fucking Egoraptor could draw as well as him.

232636,0,t3_1wqnjr,Wow what a conversation but I agree with both of them on certain points.You can perform homosexual and heterosexual acts without identifying as either sexuality. Some might argue that anal is a homosexual act despite the fact that any combination of gender can perform it. Theres also gay men who marry women and have children. Having sex with a woman doesnt make him straight having romantic feelings and desires for sexual activity with a woman and not because society wants him to does. Same deal for porn actorsactresses. A straight man might need to suck a few dicks to earn a paycheck but hes still straight because for him its just a job and probably not something hes really into.Arin insists that the DClub dick touching thing happened because its funny and I can see that. Arin and Danny are guys that find dicks funny hell I think itd be harder to find a guy who didnt think dicks were funny to some degree. I see guys drawing dicks everywhere because its funny. Being half hard when they did it doesnt make any of the members gay either. A penis like any other sexual organ is built to respond to stimuli. Anything can stimulate a penis without the sexual attraction from the owner being there hence the no reason boner. If a guy masturbates and gets hard is he attracted to his hand? Nope.As for the pull out your dick and lets get the awkwardness over with bit I can agree to this too. Weve all had an experience where we dont necessarily want to see something but our curiosity keeps us wanting to look anyway. Its like seeing a terrible car accident. You dont want to see all of the gore but a part of you keeps wanting to watch the scene unfold anyway. Its reverse psychology as well. If youre hanging out with your dude friend and his dick pops out youll probably look anyway regardless of how much you tell yourself not to. Just starring at it until that curiosity gets out of your system is better than trying to sneak peeks to satisfy that need.I recently went down to Fantasy Fest in Key West for the first time last year. For those unfamiliar one of the big things at Fantasy Fest is body painting. Whether you go in the day or at night youre gonna see painted titties flopping around. So long as the nips are covered its aokay to walk around during Fantasy Fest with your boobs hanging out. Same thing goes for the lower parts. Men and Women can flaunt their stuff so long as its painted. No matter what you do though youll probably have the misfortune of seeing an older womens breasts while youre there. Eventually you get used to it. Hell the body painting is so good that its easy to mistake someone for wearing clothes when theyre actually naked.As for my own DClubesque experience I went swimming with a bunch of my girl friends one time and we spent more time stealing each others tops and bottoms than swimming. It was a mix of bisexual and straight girls.And thats my first post on Reddit.,gamegrumps,cf4v0vv,7,t5_2ulfu

238109,0,t1_cf5d3xw,Yeah looking back on my comment i was getting a bit defensive...First of all With arin making money off the videos sure he makes money off of the videos. But just the same im sure he sees the situation as more of a hobby then a job. Like hes sitting on the couch playing video games with his friend. That sounds a lot more like a good time then it is a way of making pay.And i didnt really mean that everyone on the show is an asshole i just find it kinda annoying how arin is supposed to be grump but any time he says anything remotely rude despite the fact hes just making a joke you can see people in the comments saying hes a dick. I just think these comments are kinda illinformed as the dynamic between danny and arin is really as strong as ever since arin and Suzy were wed. In all of the videos where hes being a dick to danny hes just doing it as a joke and its very obvious to tell hes doing it as a joke through his voice and diction. Knowing dan from years of watching him and ninja brian if arin truly IS just constantly a dick to him he would speak up about it. Hes not the type to stand around.,gamegrumps,cf5fi05,1,t5_2ulfu

308895,0,t1_cfcqqln,By sheer content alone this particular Sonic  moment is the most widely known and trafficked piece of Game Grumps knowledge. This moment is probably what you would go to first if asked to choose a single allencapsulating definition of Game Grumps if you were only allowed to show somebody one clip.Now personally I remember within  hours of the episode coming out that I was sick to death of all the remixes and flash animations. Too much of a good thing really. It never really left the community either.Id like to know WHY this clip isseems to have such staying power. Arguably  asses was a popular bit but it only topically relied on the game it spawned from  you wouldnt get the joke out of context. Nothing in Megaman really hints at why this is funny it was just a special injoke. I think the Precious Little Moment is the perfect storm for a joke. Its humorous even to an outsider because with only a minimal understanding of game mechanics one could understand visually that something was wrong with the clip. Speaking of which the joke stands on its own with or without audio. The interpretation can be different but when it comes down to it the surprise and emotion over the top might trigger you to laugh.,gamegrumps,cfcs9f4,69,t5_2ulfu

That series explored a game that was good but basically nobody had played. They were funny but they talked about the game and tried to solve the puzzles. I actually got the game and played it with a friend after seeing how much fun they were having with it. I do not get that feeling at all from watching them play Fire Red. They are hardly talking about the game and are talking about it less as the series progresses. They are stumbling around not doing anything for whole episodes like this one. They just do not care about the quality of their gameplay in this series and Id argue in many games that require some level of engagement.

Its a fantastic school many experienced players amazing faculty and a lot of opportunities to play music in a vibrant music city! For me a good music program is one that not only concentrates on the music itself but the industry as a whole. Theres quite a bit of music degree programs whether it be classical jazz etc. in my area but the school that Im at has really innovative and practical applications that I can use in the real world. Though if your focus is on a specific type of strand of music totally go for it. The school you go to in the end wont really dictate your status after the fact but it will definitely put you ahead of the game.In regards to the tune I created a band with some of my friends that are also in the program. We actually have a professional studio in the school as well and used top notch microphones in a great studio room and a full on professional interface. we used Pro Tools HD to record the tune.,gamegrumps,cg00too,1,t5_2ulfu

892783,0,t1_ch5rcha,gtI am not really sure what you expect of Arin to reinvent his personality and humor every time he sit down to record?Actually Im asking the opposite. Compare his relatively tame Holy shit its a Whismur! in Emerald to the ITS WEEEEDLE! in FireRed. Its like hes really trying too hard to get the same level of energy he did in Emerald.gtI would call this a very cynical view of a running joke or call back. Were those two as funny as grep no but I still thought they were funny and I dont think it is fair to frame it with such suspicion of Arins motives.Well see thats the thing. Arin doesnt make callbacks to the Jon era. Hes pretty much buried all references to the Jon era so Gorp and Drump just seemed like attempts to make something similar to Grep without every acknowledging Jon. I dont think its cynical.

964660,0,t1_chdwh1r,I think its the exact opposite. When I watch the older Grump series like Super Mario Sunshine I like to look at the threads for the episodes as I watch it to see what other people mention. I regret it almost every time. Almost every single thread for every episode is everyone whining about how Arin plays insulting him or saying hes terrible. Its ridiculous how everyone whines.,gamegrumps,chdxvuv,3,t5_2ulfu
964716,0,t1_chdvua7,I commend you for making this thread but I think we are seeing different things as far as discussion. Perhaps that is because I feel very saucy towards the subreddit community right now so maybe Im looking through angercolored goggles or something or I am just not participating in as many discussions as you are.Of course its perfectly fine for people to dislike an episode or any of the Grump content. Whats not fine is the blatant disregard for Reddiquette and the rules of downvoting which downright annoys me. There are tons of opinions here that I dont agree with but I dont downvote unless they legitimately do not add to further discussion. However this community seems to love to break rule number  in regard to voting Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you dont personally like it.Theres way too much of that here! I used to be able to say gtIm just here for the discussion. But lately thats turned into Im only here for the fan art because I cant even have a reasonable discussion anymore without getting downvoted to hell or stuck in a petty immature argument. I very quickly became tired of getting downvoted by  amount of people yet not one response as to why I was being downvoted. Same goes for anyone who asks a question in the sub and everyone who knows the answer would rather downvote that person instead of answering them  because zod forbid youre a Grump fan you better know anything and everything thats going on. And I think a lot of that comes from the poor way this community voices their opinions Ive been at fault for this as well judging by my responses the past few days. I cant realistically believe as much as Id like to this community is the preferred demographic same age range as Grumps with wellrounded heads on their shoulders so I have to succumb to the idea that I may be dealing with a younger audience who still needs to learn a thing or two about reading comprehension and what it means to provide constructive criticismhave aan matureintellectual discussion. ,gamegrumps,chdy43r,5,t5_2ulfu
964720,0,t1_chdwxey,Yeah I definitely have that impression as well but some of the backlash against them is just as bad if not worse. I get the passion people have for the show but it seems to cloud peoples judgment sometimes. Yesterdays episode was one of the very few that I really disliked and Ive never even played the game. I actually enjoyed todays a lot more because Ross wasnt screaming the whole time and they eventually thought to check the key bindings that nearly every game has.

969604,0,t1_chegsoh,In the vein of that discussion...I think the simplicity they call for in that Demons Souls episode would be incredibly limiting to the scope of complexity a game can achieve. If there needs to be like ten minutes of button tutorial so I can be prepared for hundreds of hours of playing then so be it. Teaching through conveyance is one way to do things and a pretty cool way to do things but I do not think it is diametrically opposed to just showing the player what the buttons do and then giving them the opportunity to give it a shot especially in the passive way the Souls series does it.,gamegrumps,chei538,3,t5_2ulfu

993237,0,t3_25betd,I think there are a few problems with TableFlip that could make it infinitely better. Im sorry Suzy but sometimes you need to chill out. There are tangents some of the players go off on ieDanny from time to time and Suzy always does the glare with a Dan please! or speeding the game along. It makes the show feel tense and awkward.. Have prerecorded explanations of the game. Suzy or Barry are usually trying to explain the game and dont get across all the rules or confuse the other players and often times tangents happen in the explanation that prevents gameplay from being shown. There are a few episodes that show them playing out the game with clips while they voiceover how to play. Those are good ones.. Editing. Its made like grumps to where EVERYTHING is recorded. I dont think Board games really play like that and even Grumps sometimes do things off camera like grind or speed up segments. We need to see highlights of the game play funny moments and skip parts where theyre confused whos turn it is or other hiccups.But thats my two cents.,gamegrumps,chh6seb,1,t5_2ulfu

1055169,0,t1_cho7zjp,Exactly its about the combination of good game play and good commentary. When both are bad people complain. There have been some good moments from the past several episodes but for the most part the game play was lack lusterusually due to incompetence on the grumps part and the commentary was for the most part lazy or trite. Same complaints came up during the last several episodes of Sonic  Jon and Arin got bored at not knowing what to do so they rambled. While this produced some really funny shit most of it was boring chit chat that would be less riveting than an informative podcast about the eating habits of snails.TLDR Grumps has a very specific formula and when not followed properly leads to shit videos.,gamegrumps,cho878v,1,t5_2ulfu

Its an issue Ive struggled with since middle school and have had trouble coming to terms with and seeking treatment. Its great to see something that works to eliminate the idea that depression is as simple as a sadness or ungrateful attitude. By fighting the stigma of suffering from it or seeking treatment for it hopefully many more people will start to seek help. Its an everyday battle and open discussion and support is a key to overcoming it. Thank you,gamegrumps,chou73g,1,t5_2ulfu

Mega Man  had a stage that was pretty easy and had a lot of easy enimies that you could get drops from and Mega Man  had MTanks scattered throughout the castle stages.

1168568,1,t1_ci11lao,Well he isnt filling in. That implies Jon is expected to return and Dans just covering until he does he wont. I understand that maybe they dont want it to feel like Dan is a replacement but he is and thats okay. I agree that now that its been a while it should be okay to occasionally acknowledge old times but its their choice. Frankly with the way the fanbase refuses to just let it the fuck go I dont blame them a bit for giving the subject a wide berth.In fact maybe if everyone just dropped the why did Jon REALLY leave? are Jon and Arin friends? and its because of SuzyNicoleMimiJacques threads theyd stop being so uncomfortable with it. I really wish the mods would create and enforce a no discussion of Jons departure reasons related to it or his continued relationship if any to the Grumps family rule. Seriously its getting old. They have already told us why and if they havent told us the whole truth thats their right. It really is none of our business no matter what justification you come up with.

Hell MGS takes it one step further by having the story mechanics repeat itself youre given your mission at the beginning of the game you encounter several bosses and characters and THEN BAM twist story element that changes the nature of the mission end game.CoD doesnt change itself every game it only changes the setting. The game the core gameplay remains exactly the same rungun duck and shoot.

Fez is hardly a game sure its pretty but its hardly a game its impossible to lose its incredibly shallow as a result. With no replayability once youve seen it youre done.His opinion seems to be coming from knowledge of that mindset that he made a game thats incredibly shallow seeing it once ruins it forever  and he resents that hes not making more money off of it.Its nowhere near the current  sticker price on Steam and if the game had less footage on Youtube he probably thinks it would be more inclined to sell.Add onto that things that he said during his AMA on Reddit like this completely rubbed me the wrong way.,gamegrumps,cibccpl,1,t5_2ulfu

1333083,0,t1_cijksme,I agree and as I have said there are many plausible possibilities to how it could have gone down Jon essentially selling his rights to his grump episodes seems like the most likely though.PS Well I write equally as many fanfics of Jon so there is that.  My favorite was called Tonguing Up in Jizz River. despite the title being grump references it was actually just him and his girlfriend so pretty boring in terms of a paring in my opinion but sometimes I like to make them simple so I can focus on other things.  Basically he just preformed some cunnilingus on her after giving her a creampie it was good practice on writing acts without relying on the taboo nature of unusual ships to make it interesting.,gamegrumps,cijl6r6,2,t5_2ulfu

I enjoyed the motion controls finding them interesting and cool albeit annoying at times kept becoming unsymced which made me rafequit while playing the harp in the pumpkin bar placeThe story I love with Fi and Zelda and Sheik and Ghirahim. The imprisoned boss fights were a bit tedious but I did enjoy them.The goddess trials were scary which I enjoyed. I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible being on the edge of my seat at all times during them the final one I did not expect.Overall I did enjoy it but it could be improved.

1342241,0,t1_cikfjcj,The thumbnails for the videos used to just be the orange background with the games logo and a pair of grump heads. Lately theyve been using click bait in the thumbnails. Like with this one the slapped the words TOO HARD! in it too or when they did DoA they put a pair of tits and the word BOOBIES! or some synonym thereof on it. Its kind of a new trend they started sorta recently like how the video for Its Dangerous to Go Alone on Arins channel doesnt even have the name of the song in it and just says BEST Zelda Rap EVER!!Im not sure why I hate it but I know I do. Maybe its just cause its what everyone else does maybe its because they never did it before and now it comes off as shameless. I guess in the end it really doesnt effect the videos themselves but it kinda makes the grumps look trashy. Like before there was some level of artistic integrity and now its kinda feels a bit like theyre whoring themselves out.,gamegrumps,cikm8xl,9,t5_2ulfu

1354661,0,t3_29lazt,FINALLY!Thoroughly enjoyed the video while there were some points about Ocarina that I disagreed with most of it hit home. Especially all of the points about how exploring should be the main aspect of a Zelda game. It reminded me why I love Wind Waker so much. I know pretty much everyone hates the sailing in that game and feels its one of the most singleminded Zelda games but its one of the most open world experiences Ive ever had in games. This coming from a guy that despises shit like Skyrim for being one of the shallowest most boring turds that could be considered open world mostly for attracting so much respect for something it does not accomplish in my eyes. Whenever Ive played Wind Waker when it first came out over a decade ago or sometime between then and the present I always made it a point to just go sailing to see whats out there. It was one of the most fascinating and exciting things growing up to be sailing that expansive ocean and see land on the horizon wondering what it might hold. I cant speak for everyone but for this guy Arin you did good.,gamegrumps,cim3izw,1,t5_2ulfu

1354994,0,t1_cim27wy,It looks like the outside of Lost World. In that level there were little moving panels on the walls which you could stand on to change gravity and if you positioned yourself correctly you could leave the panel area while still having a different gravity direction. Its possible to continue through the level by jumping through the level sideways.,gamegrumps,cim50wr,2,t5_2ulfu
1355176,0,t1_cim474i,But again the goals and punishments of the game are really different. Dark Souls is a game about pure challenge. Overwhelming odds brutal combat and expecting the unexpected. you die a LOT because of this curve and thats understood. As such you respawn quickly and have to redo very little. Zelda is about exploration and puzzle solving. You get a TON of hearts can be hit over and over and over and over without punishment but when you DO die you have to endure a long death scene and usually need to redo a lot. At least in my experience. So DS is about gritty combat and learning from your mistakes but Zelda is about figuring out puzzles and adventure. To me those necessitate different things. I think thats why being able to see the entire room top down was so effective in Zelda but would be CAUSTIC to Dark Souls. Dark Souls is a game about knowing very little and having to be cautious. Zelda is about exploring and figuring out puzzles. Its different at least to me it is. ,gamegrumps,cim5uey,2,t5_2ulfu

I love Skyward swords art design its gorgeous and I wish I could have borrowed the wii long enough to have finished it.  That said I always found that in what I did get to play there were many problems in progression and the overall predictability from boss to boss and if the overall exploration and discovery aspect of Zelda is what Arin cared about most I can see why Skyward Sword would piss him off.

I dunno Destiny has a lot of RPG elements in it and the overworlds are pretty cool even if they are underutilized tbh.Its not just a go down a linearass hallway and murder everyone game like Call of Duty. The game opens up quite a bit at time and there are plenty of side quests to do. I havent played Borderlands but a few friends of mine say Destiny is like Borderlands but with a more space opera look and Haloish combat. I dunno  Id actually like to see what Arin thinks of Destiny. I mean  its not a uberlinear Call of Battlefield Modern Wardude game and I dunno its got a big RPG element to it. ,gamegrumps,cj7m88n,1,t5_2ulfu

The problem is with people who are so inundated and accepting of actual hate that they become incapable of differentiating between the emotion known as hate and the words that describe it.Sometimes its because theyre so overcome by actions spurn of hate from others that they are constantly afraid of it and sometimes its the exact opposite where they so fucking spoiled by never ever suffering it that they fill the gap in their knowledge by assuming that some mild harmless things like spoken words may equate to hate. Im not going to insult you by saying understanding the difference is necessarily common sense. But be it common or highly specialized its still sense which you apparently lack.

1636401,0,t1_cjlegd9,Well i was just mainly making a point about the nostalgia argument with that comment rather than specifically saying anything about the games. However I will say that there is a big difference between the grinding in Zelda and Simons Quest. In Zelda the combat is far deeper and a lot more fun. Not to mention that all that time you spend fighting things in the overworld gives you reason to explore and find some of those secrets which all at least seem to follow a pattern of involving either bombing burning or pushing something. And you always have unlimited burns and pushes and bombs can be dropped or bought which also means that the whole  rupee limit really shouldnt be a problem considering the prevalence of stores throughout the world and you can always just buy a bunch of bombs to stay under the limit. Dont get me wrong its still annoying but when the problem only arises from having too much money you have to admit its much less of an issue.Meanwhile in Simons quest the grinding is annoying cause you can lose all your hearts the world is linear so you cant really explore much and the secrets are far more obtuse without following any good patterns. Its much harder to accidentally find a secret in that game especially if its required to advance the game Meanwhile you can always try the same sort of stuff in LoZ in lots of places and considering that there are so many spread out across the world youre bound to come across at least a few of them. And of course theres the people that tell you where some of them are. They even teach you how to find some of the secrets in the game early on in the first dungeon. Im actually putting the beating the original LoZ without a guide thing to the test right now. Ive never played it I hardly know anything at all about it beyond what Ive played so far and Im trying to beat it without using any help or anything. ,gamegrumps,cjlflu4,1,t5_2ulfu

It inspired me to get my head down because better days would be ahead.Dan is a fountain of happiness and wisdom and seems like one of the most genuinely nice guys I have ever had the pleasure of listening to sing about dicks.

Also the fact that it took them all of  minutes for them to finally see I whip my hair back and forth  Lisa coming after them was interesting Ive seen playthroughs of her showing up at least half a dozen times. I could tell Arin was hoping to see her behind them in the bathroom mirror but I really would have loved to see Dans reaction to her on the balcony I also thought they had a glitch when waiting for her to slam the bathroom door shut as I usually see it triggered within  seconds but it was much longer this time!Also a little bummed that they didnt see it to completion so I hope Arin figured out how to trigger the phone ringing offcamera so Dan could see the game trailer ,gamegrumps,cjta3vl,19,t5_2ulfu

From my perspective its all about the aftermath of fan outrage and that yeah he does allude to the fact that theres something theyre dishonest about that theres something hidden there but it doesnt have to be something bad. And the second thing while it may hold water doesnt sound like him and Arin to me. From what I saw behind the screen they were the best of buds and while Jon seemed to have all kinds of fun he wasnt completely comfortable. I recall at one point he mentioned he didnt like being live being unfiltered and showing how much of kindaadick he can be. I take him for all he is and loved it but maybe he was a little uncomfortable about it. But hey we can disagree and stuff.

1714363,0,t1_cjv8jrh,I dont think you understand the process of academic research. Much like science you go in with a hypothesis a starting idea. However if you find data that contradicts that you change your piece. Ive done it before and I imagine Anita has too.If I recall she has a specific section in her Damsel in Distress videos that illustrate positive examples of the damsel trope or at least ways people have used it subversively.Her videos are not carefully edited to generate controversy. Theyre carefully edited to present and idea that happens to be controversial.She uses a huge variety of games both new and old popular and notsopopular. She posts a list of all games discussed in the description of her video and its quite diverse. For every Mario theres a game Id never heard of before on the list.I cant speak for her other videos but her Tropes vs Women in Video Games videos are not monetized. The videos arent being made for cash she already has that. Theyre being made because she believes they are important pieces of cultural analysis theory and criticism.Shes presenting an opinion based on observation and research.She posts a link to significant sources she utilized in the description of each video. Plus she doesnt cite studies because her videos ARE the study and shes thoroughly explaining the results of said study and what she believes it means for gaming as a whole. The evidence is all she needs and she presents said evidence consistently in all her videos.Media theory is by its nature based on exploring how media affects us on a nonsurface level. Its based on exploring what the deeper effects of said media is. When youre a kid watching a Disney movie you dont think of how the movie portrays gender love violence sex etc. You just enjoy the movie. However those movies inform our actions opinions and mindset on all those topics and more. The same goes for games.Media from the moment we engage it to the moment we stop engaging it affects us on more than just a surface level. As such its important for people like Sarkeesian to try and explain how it may be affecting us and what problems may arise from such. Does that means shes automatically right? No certainly not. Someone could come along tomorrow and prove her wrong with better examples and better analysis. And thats awesome. But you dont do that by arguing about whether or not shes a real gamer or saying that I disagree so I cant see how anyone can believe this.There is no reason she gets flack for her videos other than the fact that she is a woman who dared to speak about gender on the Internet. If she published the exact same script in a standard research paper or thesis instead of in Internet videos she would be receiving no flack. The people irate with her views are not her academic colleagues game designers game critics game researchers and the like. The people irate with her are gamers who arent interested in hearing what she has to say and arent willing to do similar levels of research and work in order to make an equivalent case against her. Instead its far easier to call her a liar and a scam artist.She has put out five videos. She did not ask for k she asked for . She was given that much because enough people wanted to see her content.Her videos have absolutely helped because its making people think. I know Ive learned things from Anita I hadnt previously considered and there are a few points albeit not major ones Ive disagreed on as well.,gamegrumps,cjv9a6h,0,t5_2ulfu

A few people would like it and a good amount wouldnt.And I dont hate Suzy its just that I dont find her funny which is why I watch game grumps and then people say they want a date grumps where Ross and holly join Arin and suzzy and I wouldnt mind it for say it was the next valentines specialbut honestly I would be really disappointed if it were anything more than that. I honestly come to game grumps for Arin and Dan of course same towards Jon when he was on with Ross being a pretty cool dude himself. Barry is pretty cool but of course its only with the other guys and it seems when Suzy joins I just dont feel that its as funny or if at all with the others.

He only understands the idea of public versus private in that hes perpetually angry with the publics disagreement with opinions of the a small tightknit subgroup of a subgroup of people hes friends with. Hes easy to hate because hes abrasive enough and inconsistent enough that you can superimpose just about anything onto your idealization of Burch and have a pretty reasonable rough draft of Anthony Burch.

Its always been cool to not give a shit about things people give way too many shits about.

Sorry if the jump in logic from my reaction to your comment to what I consider a similar situation college students demanding that you support their political conflicts wasnt evident.The only thing I demandyour word not mineis that if you dont know something you keep your opinion to yourself until you inform that opinion.What Jontron is saying in that video couldnt be more simple and goes according to what you ask. He is not giving his opinion on things he doesnt know about. He is giving his opinion about what people should expect of him who could possibly be more informed about his actions than himself?.He is giving his opinion on whether people should care what he thinks. I dont care. And you should not care what I think about it.When your answer to that is how ignorant you dont realize how loaded as fuck your statement is.Its akin of calling an agnostic ignorant or fence sitter.,gamegrumps,cllx72q,1,t5_2ulfu
2219976,0,t1_cllztqk,With how seriously they took that original promise back when GG started and all the way until recently I would consider it a massive Uturn. I mean the Tshirt adverts arent overtly pushy and at least are funny but stuff like that recent Anki driver advert made no sense to me half because I didnt know what exactly they were advertising and the other half because they didnt really go for as much humour just two guys spouting weird shit to sound like theyre anime characters. I get that GG needs money to sustain themselves but they were already making money doing what they did before selling shirts and playing olderweirdcult classic games. When I see that Game Grumps are livestreaming Destiny dont even know why Arins playing it thought he got motion sickness from FPS and Destiny is heavy on bobbing I see everything that GG stood for means nothing at this point and that really hurts especially as a fan from the beginning.

2524317,0,t1_cmni8j4,Unfortunately some people dont think that far when it comes to entertainment. All some people care about is Do I find the thing I am currently watching entertaining? They dont care about what theyre supporting by watching it or if its unlike the usual content of that channel. Its those people who leave especially mean comments when they dont like the video and who will blindly defend it if they like it but someone else doesnt. Since the content creation comes down to a small group of people per channel while the people who watch videos on YouTube fodder games are in the millions I think it would be much easier for the people who make the channels to not contribute to this type of game by not making videos about them.,gamegrumps,cmo2d4a,1,t5_2ulfu

And while I would like Dan to play more games Arin does have more experience with modern games. Weve all seen the dislike bar shoot up when they make zero progress in an episode. He can make more total progress in a game that hes played before than Dan could make in games that hes never played.

2538864,0,t3_2orwl2,I might be in the minority here but I think there should be a rule that before they play any game made before  they should read the manual.  Game manuals for just about every game ever made are easy to find online and the older the game the more necessary these manuals become.  When I watched JonTrons review of Nightshade one of my favorites of his I wanted to play the game.  So I got a rom and a copy of the manual.  The manual itself is HILARIOUS and perfectly sets up the tone for the game as well as explaining some of the more hidden features of the UI and gameplay.  Its VITAL to the experience.So many times they waste time dying or just not making any progress because they dont understand basic mechanics that are explained in the manual.Games released after ish started having more and more in game tutorials and manuals began to be phased out.  Not understanding how to play a modern game without reading the manual is a failing on the games part and partial Arin not reading anything.  What do you guys think?  Is it funnier to get that I dont know anything about this game lets go! feeling or would you rather they have a basic understanding of these games before the episode even starts?  Was the Simons quest playthrough awful because they used a walkthrough or was it enhanced by it?  Maybe have the grump who wont be playing read the manual and the playing grump goes in blind?  That way one grump has to explain the game to the other and you get that interaction and the feeling of I have no idea what is going on for some of the weirder games.,gamegrumps,cmpyrro,1,t5_2ulfu

Saying Look at those blacks is not racist because it never has anything to do with superiority.

These days he can fly and run faster than the speed of light as well as benchpress planets.

2720794,0,t1_cndbxji,That is totally true. Trans people tend to be treated disgustingly when they shouldnt. HOWEVER...If a trans person intentionally misleads a cis person into thinking they are a cis person and waits until the last minute to tell said cis person how do you really expect the cis person to react? As far as I know when most people are lied to they dont react in a very positive manner. This is especially apparent if the lie involves something as important and major as gender then theres a problem.Basically if a cis person treats a trans person like absolute trash no matter how they met with no respect and making offensive jokes or anything that shows discrimination because of their gender that cis person is a complete asshole. But if a trans person deliberately lies just to get some salt of their hot dog they too are an asshole.Thats just my two cents. Be honest with your partner and accept them for who they are. Nobodys obligated to have sex but you are obligated to be respectful. And your partner is one of the most important people to be respectful towards.Im normally not one to say something like this all the time but Ill get it out of the way here. If I offended any transgendered people in the comments Ive made Im sorry about that. The subject is touchy and can be difficult for a lot of people to understand since everyone has a different interpretation. I just wanted to say that anybody can be disrespectful.

You can envision them so clearly on the couch halfdead asleep too tired to get up and end the episode.Still I kind of hope Tired Grumps doesnt become too consistent a thing though because while it may be hilarious for now a its not healthy for them and b it will eventually get stale or cliched.Its like videos of people getting drunk and then filming themselves playing video games. I watched part of some video doing that that had Jon and Stamper in it cant remember where I saw it though.  Its not going to be funny if its intentional and I didnt think that particular video was very interesting.

So they let the chips fall where they may and try not to police it as much so that a fan doesnt run online and talk shit about them because they didnt want to recite a stupid line or give them a hug or didnt call on them when during a panel or didnt respond in they way they think they should during a panel.It totally sucks but I understand why they do it.,gamegrumps,co12lct,15,t5_2ulfu

He likely thinks a consumer grade CRT is as good as it gets for old games without realising that with the right upscaling setup a modern HDTV can do a damn fine job.  Or if he really wants to stick with CRT he should be using a Sony PVM or BVM professional video monitor for the best image quality possible.That or its just not a priority. Which is a shame.

3051531,0,t1_codwfws,Theres also the fact that Link to the Past is a game thats a lot more fair and a lot more adventurous. Zelda  isnt based on an adventure its based on trial and error and guessing. Its why players have to constantly bomb random unmarked walls in order to finally move forward or in a worse case bomb a random rock to access the final dungeon. Players have to live with the fact that they probably missed a major item because the game gives no communication that an item is even needed sometimes.Link to the Past is a different game from Zelda  because it communicates with the player. It allows them to explore and do whatever they want while also not keeping anything from them because of the nonsensical excuse that it encourages exploration. Link to the Past completely changed how Zelda games can be played. Its nothing like the original.,gamegrumps,coeafea,3,t5_2ulfu

3113694,0,t1_cokmoot,Okay I just judge a game by my experience playing it. And I found the lack of temples and bosses to be annoying. It seems to be a theme in zelda to make minibosses really fun and bosses super lame for some reason.But apparently a lot of the game is sidequests which I found ridiculous because of the randomness of being in the right place at the right time. I honestly wonder how many people did the kafei quest without a walkthrough. I imagine it would require absurd amounts of trial and error especially as you dont know when you have all the tools to complete it.I think Zelda  is still a fun challenging game with a walkthrough. The walkthrough doesnt really ruin the game unlike other games.,gamegrumps,cokqf4o,1,t5_2ulfu
3113774,0,t1_cokqaxy,Even with that Arin is someone who almost actually chooses not to read dialogue or pay attention to the screen when playing. There are many times during this Pokemon playthrough where you can actually hear him mashing the A button because he doesnt to read or wants the game to go by faster. Thus you have him doing things like trying to use Ground type moves on Pokemon with Levitate trying to use moves that arent very effective on a Pokemon sending out Pokemon with a clear type disadvantage resulting in it being hit by a super effective move causing it to faint. Not only that but he constantly leaves nearly half of his team fainted doesnt heal status effects and doesnt bother to actually train any of his Pokemon except for may one or two and drops them at the drop of a hat because it keeps getting beat in battle as a result of that. The game not be hard but Arin sure does try his hardest to make it look like it is. Arin doing a Nuzlocke would be the equivalent of a one armed man trying to play professional football. Sure in some way it might be doable but lord knows why you would even try in the first place.,gamegrumps,cokqpwc,4,t5_2ulfu

Then people start asking you why this thing is worth the price youre asking and you dont want to say Because demand is so damn high so you tell a fib.

Just because you can tell between an opinion and a fact doesnt mean everyone else can. An opinion piece thats written like a report can honestly confuse people that cant so easily tell the difference. Or it will bring up the problem of making ones own opinion seem like its a opinion held by a majority. By acknowledging  its an opinion first you rid yourself of all of these problems. And its not this huge issue or inconvenience to specify that what one is stating is indeed an opinion.,gamegrumps,cq16fhd,1,t5_2ulfu

3621310,0,t1_cq51io9,Okay Im not going to write a long response because all of your arguments in regards to selfdiagnosis are based on one thing the idea that doctors medication and all that goes with that are easily accessible. A psychiatrist costs on average  per hourlong visit. That does not count multiple sessions which are almost guaranteed since one hour is often not enough to get a proper diagnosis. My own diagnosis took months to get and it was real fuckin simple  Im autistic. Thats it. Theres no medication involved and theres no therapy involved. It took  months of biweekly visits. At the  figure I listed earlier thats . If youre in a financial position where K is something you can just shell out GREAT. Im genuinely happy for you. But most people arent. Im not saying dont fucking get a doctor you can do it all yourself. but I am saying If you have a reliable source of information like I dunno the fucking DSM you can get the general idea of what might be wrong and learn to cope from there. And thats where things like kin feelings come from. Coping with mental illness youre not in a position to treat. ,gamegrumps,cq5218d,-1,t5_2ulfu

3665459,0,t3_32ay0c,My initial reaction was that I smelled bullshit.  High quality recording equipment and speaking candidly about business and personal life then suddenly crap quality video thrown together and silence.In retrospective I think the thing that is most true is that they handled it in the worst way possible with the initial video and then with doubling down on silence and gag orders.When Jon was negotiating leaving the partnership he apparently ceded . Profits from older videos and . Talking about the terms of breaking the partnership.  Whatever this might have even been a good idea.  But heres what wasnt for meRebranding Dan as Not so Grump in the opening sequence.  Although I would say hes kinda earned it now replacing someones persona not played character was a bad choice for transitioning.  Grumpcade wouldve been slightly better although they wouldve lost some branding strength.  I get why they did it but I think they shouldve been way more transparent for the fanbase.  Launching Steam Train at the same time.  WHY.  I get that they didnt have much of a choice but it wouldve been better to launch steam train and a video saying Game grumps is on a brief hiatus or something.  A video like the discussion that Ross and Arin had for the April st episode wouldve explained a lot.  So would having Jon actually being a part of the farewell episode.  ,gamegrumps,cqa358w,1,t5_2ulfu

3804424,0,t1_cqpbq2n,I dont think his hatred for the game is justified at all. The camera is frustrating and some of the controls take getting used to. Occasionally Mario does a little round instead of turning on the spot and that shit is annoying but Im pretty sure Arin hasnt dealt with that yet.The controls are very responsive. They give you a tonne of options and with a little effort you can be scooting around incredibly efficiently. Arin has just forgotten how to do like the most important move the side flip. And he never tried using things like the dive or anything to platform better. could be better if it was done now but its not at all a bad game mechanically. ,gamegrumps,cqpxo1k,3,t5_2ulfu
3806136,0,t1_cqpfea7,The level of precision required for several of the box platforming segments you need to clear to get all of the gems in the game depend on the controls being pretty welltuned.

3811296,0,t3_341r83,ArinWe or at least I do not hate the fact that you hate this game although thats probably hyperbole andor jetlag talking. I dont hate the fact that you keep failing at the missions I mean Ill be honest Mario  does not seem to tell you exactly how to beat each mission it just gives you an obscure clue as the Mission name plops you in the level and says you figure it out.  What I do have a problem with is that youre blaming the game for the more obvious screwups. And youre not frakking learning. Ive not played Mario  I had a PS but I figured out early on that you had to walljump off those rotating platforms at the start of Tick Tock Clock. Granted you were jetlagged at the time of recording so that may have hindered your ability a little but pay attention to the level.I mean who was it again that said you should stop and take in your surroundings before continuing on? Oh thats right it was you . Sure Mario  is no Castlevania but take a leaf out your own book sheesh.

Either Arin does something impressive to kill himself or he just dies out of stupidity whatever is the funniest. after that consider a CinimaSins style Bonus Round where you shoot off death shoot off less interesting death shots in rapid succession jut showing the point where Arin died and nothing leading up to that like one second clips or lessIn said Bonus Round...definity play the Can Can or something and make the quick fire deaths match up with the music in some way. If youre going to do a ding sound effect either remove it for the bonus round or make it something that sounds nice to hear in rapid succession.Those are my two cents consider it what you will.

3930584,0,t1_cr49cfc,gtYknow Ive never really been a fan of the guy watched his stuff just wasnt my thing.Hmm. Yeah I know what you mean. I felt the exact same way in the past. And when people explained why they didnt like him I said yeah I think thats exactly why I dont like him either.But then I watched his Dead Space  playthrough and then I watched his Alien Isolation playthrough and I kept watching more and more of his videos and to be honest Im not at all sure when I started really enjoying his content but now I watch him about as much as I watch Game Grumps.Like its not like the Dead Space  or Alien Isolation playthroughs were what convinced me that Markiplier is more entertaining than I first thought... Its just that like... Jeez it really is weird. Im trying and failing to figure out when and why I got hooked on Markiplier. Like I remember clearly all of the points people brought up when they explained why they didnt like him and theyre all pretty much still valid its just that they dont bother me nearly as much as I thought they would.Oh actually I just realized something. I think I started to appreciate his content a lot more when I first realized that Mark is actually a really intelligent person. Like he acts goofy a lot but he has incredibly frequent moments of... maturity I suppose? Like he has those silly moments where he puts on a silly voice and he makes immature jokes and all that but at the same time he has serious moments where you really get a look at who he is as a person and when I got that look at him what I saw was a person I greatly respect.I dont really consider myself a fan of Markiplier though. Like there are videos he makes occasionally where he addresses his fans and I dont feel like hes addressing me in those videos. Im writing this post at  AM so Im sorry for rambling and I guess I should stop typing and just post this already.PS I dunno if Id actually recommend Dead Space  or Alien Isolation as good first Markiplier series. I mean theyre the first I watched and they eventually brought me to the perspective I have now so maybe thats a good place to start. I know Markiplier has a great fascination with space and so do I coincidentally so maybe you might enjoy seeing that. Though I might also recommend his playthrough of The Witchs House because it really marked a significant change in his perspective on RPG maker horror games. and it was a good series iirc,gamegrumps,cr4bm66,6,t5_2ulfu

4068458,0,t3_374n2y,Context guy here! A supersurprised context guy who did not expect Arin to win first try! Welcome one and all to Byrgenwerth sacred place of learning. In these posts for the past week Ive said a lot of maybe the answers are in Byrgenwerth? to things that have popped up. And now were finally here. As Arin gets farther into this area we will have a lot of stuff to talk about! This may even be the last time for a couple days where we have more questions than answers spring up!yesterdayWELCOME TO GIT GUD SONMy goodness this boss way to go Arin! So the generic mechanics to this fight Arin mostly got right. Its not timed but based on the HP pools of the boss as a whole. As soon as the players dealt enough damage to mostly finish off a single enemy is when a phase change will occur. It counts damage across all enemies so if you bring down like all three of them to  phase two triggers. This is why Arin learned to focus out one of them as well as why every single strategy ever for these guys says the same. The best strategy for this is to take out a melee guy first then the other and save the mage for last. Its easy to hide behind the gravestones to block the ranged attacks allowing the player to v and v for the first phases rather than needing to deal with all three. This also leaves the enemy with the weakest melee for last which is useful.The Tonitrus was more useful here than the Saw Cleaver so Arin was pretty smartlucky to be using it. We can see the damage he does per shot with this and its actually comperable to the cleaver with charged attacks actually being a bit faster. The Lightning resist on these enemies is also fairly low. I hope he keeps using this weapon through the rest of the game its more his style than the Cleaver.Theyre named Shadows of YharnamBesides that they are just riddled with snakey goodness thats all we know about them at this point. Well be able to think about this more indepth soon but for now heres a thought We can be fairly sure theyre not shadows of the Yharnam we know that city had no snakes whatsoever or Nazgul either. So where does this name come from? These Nazgul guys were very obviously guarding entry to Byrgenwerth so the core to understanding them will be finding out what exactly they thought was worth guarding here.How far are we now?Depends on how much optional content he does or even knows about. For required areas were fairly well over the halfway point. But as the game has progressed many optional areas have become available and including those then wed be not past the halfway point yet but still fairly close to it. Both of these estimates Im not using Chalice Dungeons for Ive said this previously but I highly doubt hell do them on camera.Let me explain why these things are the worstJUST LOOK AT IT. Especially when it has the players souls those glowing eyes are hideously creepy. Alfred white church guy lots of dialogue had once said that nobodys heard from Byrgenwerth in a while and nobody knows what has happened to those who were still there. Well guess the answer is that theyre all bug people now. The why for this is perhaps really obvious in a way thats easily missed. We know theres obsessions with two things in this world not including snakes fuck snakes. Blood and eyes. What do these bugguys have lots of? Eyes! So perhaps this is somewhat intentional. Whether it be that these guys kept their sanity or not after being turned into bug people thats something Im not sure that could be said in any concrete way. At this point it appears that whether it be the transformation or the night theyre no longer sane. Why eyes are important is something weve yet to discover but we can be pretty sure here that the reason for Bugpeople is for more eyes.The Subscribe bar hid something!That attack steals Insight. Arin will have a few less next time we see him. Lorewise this is pretty straightforward Cthuluguys are stealing Insight. The eye stat in the topright corner of the screen. We havent found what the importance of Eyes or even what Insight is lorewise but the relation in theme here is not ignorable. Nothing more I can say on this front at the moment but were close very close to where I can finally open my mouth about this stuff. Byrgenwerth is a place of learning both for characters in the world and for us!Something to ponderJust a tidbit to throw out there. Byrgenwerth is really famous yes? Its been linked to so much stuff thats gone in this world. So...why exactly is it so small? Arins path today kind of showed the areas entire size. Its a single building. Looks to be two many three stories and not very large. This is the legendary college the place of learning that has apparently been so very important. A kind of birthplace for the Healing Church even this is where Laurence studied guy who started the Church. How very odd that it would be so...small.,gamegrumps,crk16jd,28,t5_2ulfu

Just really gets me every time he is so legitimately affected by the situation. I love the current ALttP playthrough but there is definitely something to be said for the times when they play a game without already getting familiar with it. Its too bad that a lot of people give them really malicious shit for not making progress in games because their response to those criticismswhile very efficientmakes for less moments like the Argo one. ,gamegrumps,crkiilf,2,t5_2ulfu

4222446,0,t3_396uot,I kinda feel like  of Arins problems are that he started this thing completely disengaged from it and didnt really have any interest in learning.

I dont get the feeling that Arins really ever.. you know.. tried.Its a shame really. The whole thing is for charity and they kind of were just like lets just screw around and fuck with Ross But thats kind of a dick move to whatever charity they picked? I mean at least try for  whole days. One of the disadvantages of this expansion is that you can hit  super fast if you have a basic grasp of the game.The one thing Ross did wrong was boosting them before the expansion hit i think? He set up all their hotbars but if you boosted post expansion the game gave you abilities along with the quests so that you wouldnt get overwhlemed and you would learn easier. I suppose it might not have helped in some cases but it would have been a better starting point. Hopefully now that they are out on their own they will get less baby sitting from Ross.

4244503,0,t3_39k7fv, Traditionally TV shows and movies are meant to be timeless which is to say they want you to be able to watch it today but also for someone else to come in and watch it in  years time and get the exact same joy. In other words you want people to keep buying your product and to never look at it and say Thats stupid. It doesnt make sense. It was prolly funny in the XXs when president X was in the white house but now its just dumb! Its part of the reason that In the not too distant future began to replace In the far distant future of !.   Do you remember The Simpsons episode where they go to the Superbowl? Homer and the other characters talk about their favourite football teams and the president of the united states but when they do they raise their beer mugs in front of their faces and say the names very clearly and slowly... Thats a joke about Dating an episode It looks like the show creators made the episode in a fashion where they could easily replace the names of the teams and presidents without having to redraw the lips  The joke being how utterly out of place it would be in normal conversation and how starkly it showed their forward thinking TV demands.

4361183,0,t1_csgq8am,Arin is good at linear games. Ninja Gaiden is hard as balls but its really simple. Theres no way to misinterpret anything or get lost. Even the basic ability to read isnt necessary.Contrast that with Wind Waker. Wind Waker is incredibly easy. Enemies literally drop piatas full of health and magic replenishers. The telegraphing of the bosses is incredibly obvious. Only real difficulty comes from the puzzles and even then its pretty easy. But Arin sucked at it for the sole fact that he approaches every game as if it were Mega Man X. Pokmon is another example. Its like a babys first JRPG death means nothing and you can just build an overpowered team and grind until you win. But it also requires a a lot of reading and b a willingness to experiment with what works and what doesnt. Arin is stubborn as fuck. When he decides hes going to approach something one way hell never try anything else and then Dan has to look up a guide to bail him out.What Im saying is that Arin isnt bad at doing things hes just really bad at figuring out what to do. The fact that hes good at linear games just means that maybe he should pass the controller to Dan if he doesnt know what to do.,gamegrumps,csh8mfj,3,t5_2ulfu

4593009,0,t1_ct9btz0,When I first heard folks berating the treasure hunting sections my favorite part of the games funnily enough I was angry and confused. I always thought that the hint machines were a good balance of vague and specific that was best suited for people whove explored all across the field aka people who were stumped on their search. Why is it bad game design to cater advice to the group that would need help the most? Then I realized something if I played the same levels  times a conservative estimate but I digress and the unnecessarily cryptic hints always correspond to certain spawn points then I wasnt really paying attention to the the hints after a certain point only noting that x hint always correlates to x spawn point.  Additionally the hint system is terrible in that its only somewhat useful if youve explored every nook and cranny of the stage several times over...which would almost certainly lead to you finding the shardskeysemeralds without the help of the hint system in the first place but not without having explored the often fucking massive map in frustration and fighting that horrible camera all the way. ...And I still cant bring myself to say that I dont love this game and wouldnt replay it if I sill had the Gamecube disc. ,gamegrumps,ct9jj0q,2,t5_2ulfu

Not only do they probably already know what happened but theyre also not idiots and theyre used to not talking about touchy subjects on camera because its pretty much their job to talk in front of an audience.Nobody in their right mind would ask their friend in front of thousands of people yo by the way I know its unrelated but did you punch your friends wife in the face?.,gamegrumps,cta9e39,14,t5_2ulfu

4631550,0,t1_ctdvzv4,gtIt could be their personalities. Danny has been so warm and cuddly as a person to listen to who has been almost too cautious about peoples feelings and Arin has always been a straight shooting say what he meanswhat he feels kind of guy.Thats certainly an aspect of it!  One moment that still stands out to me as Im sure it will for a lot of other viewers is that episode of Mario  where Arin was practically delirious and trying over and over to get this jump that hed managed to do a hundred times before and Dan is laughing just absolutely aghast People are watching this Arin!  Theyre taking time out of their day to watch this!  That moment kind of turned into a bit of a joke later on but it really hammered home for me the fact that Dan is infinitely more conscious of the notion that yes people are choosing to spend whatever amount of free time they have clicking on a Grumps video and so its like hes worried theyll disappoint us or let us down if they dont accomplish something of note in the episode.  I have to say I think its ridiculously sweet and thoughtful of him that he is just so determined to make sure theyre not wasting our time somehow.Arin on the other hand has said flat out that he doesnt care if people get pissed off and that I think is the polar opposite to where Dan is.  Im not saying Arin doesnt care full stop  because I do think he does give a shit about GG being worth watching but sometimes he just gets really... lackadaisical about things and that can get super frustrating to listen to.  Of course it doesnt help that the more Dan tries to sort of usher Arin back to the task at hand whatever that is it seems like sometimes Arin will redouble his efforts to fuck around just because he can.  I mean sure Arin might be much more familiar with the more modern consoles and their trappings but its not like it makes him that much better at games than Dan.  Im not saying that to be mean but just saying it because its one of those things thats out there and even Dans said it himself  theyre just not very good at video games.  Between the two of them they have all the tools and resources and knowhow they need to be genuinely kickass at games but their personalities and approaches to things are so different its kind of hard to find a happy middleground that doesnt wind up with technically capable but stale playthroughs where everything goes to plan and not a whole lot of fun is had Link to the Past or absolute clusterfucks where nothing goes to plan and its crazymaking in the bad way for both the Grumps and the viewers see the coin missions in M.  Either way I do and have always appreciated Dans efforts to make any time we spend with them worthwhile.  ,gamegrumps,ctedkuy,1,t5_2ulfu

4720378,0,t1_ctpipaa,I had originally given just over two months when I posted it and I spent the last month accepting submissions and as I mentioned worrying about whether I should post it here due to the Grumps sometimes perusing the subreddit. I eventually decided to suck it up and post here risking one of them seeing it.  The  mil mark will likely hit around DecemberJanuary possibly February though I believe itll happen sooner than that just based on their growth unless they randomly get a boost in subs out of nowhere. I can understand why you may be concerned about only having a month but I hope you still consider getting involved. A  second video can be made in fairly short time so even if you rush it its fine   Also with school coming back in September for most people I figured it would make sense to have people send things in before that happened to make it easier for them.  Another reason I made a deadline for September rd rather than later down the line is because I still have to wait on the music to be composed before I can render the final video and thats not something I have control over so Ill have to work alongside the musician to make sure it all works out and doesnt need to be changed in any way which could take a while.

He said the Knuckles levels arent designed well around Knuckles fast movement and glide abilities except the pumpkin one and that the hunting radar thing locks onto one specific gem so you can easily go past a tonne of them because the game just isnt ready to tell you theyre there which slows the levels down considerably.  He also said the gem locations are randomised so you cant even burn through them once youve done them before which makes replaying the game contingent on your patience regarding those stages.  You cant just cheese them to get to the sonic levels.  They honestly sound like the complete opposite of fun.   ,gamegrumps,cu41etr,-1,t5_2ulfu

They arent exaggerating when it basically says play the game to win. Also its really unintuitive the way its laid out. Turns out it does have a portion for the over world exploration its just in a completely separate Adventure Section. As opposed to Action Stage section. Also some of the items are numbered wrong.God Im being really hard on this. Its probably just something a teenager typed up in his free time. Really doesnt deserve any hate.

The main difference is you two are inherently funny and talented so watching you guys do your thing is engaging and entertaining.  That plus great editing work makes for an entertaining show.To you guys youre just sort of doing your thing and to your fans its this SHOW that has become a large part of their daily routine.  Such a crazy thing when you have to consider the level of disconnect you probably have to maintain to do what you do while trying to remain cognizant of anything and everything you might say that could set off a viewer. Love you guys love the show and always remember i think the majority of us know youre just real people doing your thing and were happy that we get to enjoy it too. ,gamegrumps,cu9hy7m,1,t5_2ulfu

4887695,0,t3_3hrw4a,Judging by the title I thought you would have had the exact opposite opinion about yesterdays shitstorm.Im still a bit confused by it people say he leaked a guys name while it was on the first page of the walkthrough and people had already googled and found it its literally the first link when you google sonic adventure DX walktbrough. I thought you would talk about how Dans apology was a great example of how the fanbase overreacts. The fact that he needed to make a lenghty apology for joking about someone which is what they do on the show truly weirded me out. Im still unsure how it was different from any other time they make jokes about people or things. Its like the fanbase decides upon a day once a month where they momentarily forget its comedy to have a reason to freak out about something.I mean for gods sake the top comment on the thread for episode  was did dan just encourage sending hate mail?? And if you saw the episode it couldnt be less true.We just have to remind ourselves that this fanbasd is pretty young and that this is an anonymous forum in the era of words being treated like weapons. This is the recipe for this sort of stuff people who fool themselves into caring enough will pick sides and those who are neutral about it will let it boil over.Dans apology was exactly what we expected. If you want to call something a wakeup call it would have been them keeping the episode up because it has no reason to go down all the info he gave was already known and he absolutely did not encourage hate mail or whatever and them putting out a statement saying its comedy.

4890551,1,t1_cuazjfv,Something tells me you hadnt actually read any of the comments that are being made if you think they all come down to simply you guys fucked up or Wow Dan thats really admirable that you owned up to it. Saying one comment is all there needs to be is actually rather stupid and goes against the definition of a community. This is a community you know. Not a hivemind. Its obvious that there are going to be different people with different thoughts and opinions so why do you feel that we need one person to speak for us? Theres always going to be different criticisms that not everyone is going to point out. You think we need ONE?And yes I know they apologized. If you actually read my comment youd probably notice that I pointed that out. If you read THEIR apologies youd also notice that this whole thing was noticed thanks to the fans.The fans helped this situation. If they hadnt the name would have likely still been up and the Grumps might still continue to shit on the author of the walkthrough.Please stop with the strawmen argument and actually take a step back to look at the community youre shitting on.,gamegrumps,cuazr57,1,t5_2ulfu

His nonshiny armor to me is much more a nod at how Manny isnt lovedadored like the other knights and doesnt care for public opinion only caring about helping people.  For example Whisper his armor is shiny cause else he wouldnt be able to see himself in it.   It has nothing to do with Whisper being rightous  If anything the dark armored knight so far has been their biggest bro.  The shiny ones have mostly been douches.  Manny also wouldnt have had any reason to convince Graham to keep fighting for Achakas sake if he was evil.,gamegrumps,cusp1ph,5,t5_2ulfu

5097060,0,t3_3ktjee,This would be a great and insightful analogy if Kevin was the first editor for Grumps but hes not. A better analogy would be going to McDonalds ordering lets say a McDouble with Med. fries and a dollar sweet tea no ice My Usual and when they give you its a Small fry single patty. Your still getting a burger and fries just slightly less So why would you be upset about that? You know why its because weve watch GG for about  years now and those  years have taught us what to expect in an episode. When you suddenly remove one of the things you come to expect youre bound to get well deserved backlash. No one is going to RoosterTeeths or Markipliers videos and complaining about the lack of editor interaction and rightfully so because thats not what those channels do. The reason the fandom even knows Barrys name is because he wasnt just an editor but an actual character of the show. There are tons of people who hire editors and their names wont ever be known by the audience and thats fine. But thats not what it means to be the Grumps editor because the Grumps editor is just as important to the humor as Danny or Arin or Jon was. Also the napkins analogy was pretty bad comparison. Napkins are not necessary to a meal just like crazy editing is necessary to make a good video but it is necessary to make a quality GG video. Like I said before if youre missing a part of your hamburger you would complain about it. Just like how people complained when Jon left. They lost a crucial part of the viewing experience. In the end its all up to each individuals opinions and you have no right to say that people cant have those opinions. There is no factual proof as to which editor is better therefore let people think what they want. Remember different strokes for different folks. ,gamegrumps,cv0dwup,18,t5_2ulfu

5193954,0,t1_cvc1qnr,I remember in one Mario level cant remember the game for the life of me I think it was NSMB there was a gap behind the start that was literally one block to a pit. If you went backwards there was no reason for you to GO backwards in this particular level since youre starting it you would be rewarded with some coins a power up and a vine block to get you out of the pit. There was no indication the reward existed as it was completely off screen and even progressing in the level wouldnt reveal a secret there that you could have found like being on the other side of a wall where theres an obvious way to get in but you didnt find it. I said that the vine door in that one level was bullshit but the fire flowers arent that difficult to find. The second one is actually on the platform right after you beat Bowser Jr. the first time you take the spring go to the left a little then jump on it. Not nearly as unintuitive and much easier to find. I imagine Ross designed his levels in sections. He is completely unable to beat a level like Fast in one go so he designed it section by section so once he beat one part he would design the second part in a checkpoint style system of level designing until he got the end he was satisfied with. Then knowing that checkpoints dont exist in this game and knowing he couldnt beat the level in one straight shot made the hidden door. I also argue that the fire flower doesnt make a level whose main hazards are instantdeath pits easier. It makes a small minority of the level easier but the majority of the level requires rhythmic precision jumping...and screwing that up means you die regardless of what power you had at the time.,gamegrumps,cvc2d3i,-17,t5_2ulfu

5546679,0,t1_cwkm3mz,Exactly my point. It didnt skip the Game Grumps. The Game Grumps fucked up somehow in scheduling. And at this point it cant have anything reasonably to do with the time change sinceIf they simply set it correctly to autopost it would have been out by now. If not set correctly a if they forgot about it it should have come out an hour ago b if they knew about it and did it correctly it should have come out on time c if they knew about it but accidentally did it the wrong way it should have come out two hours ago.Those are the three options if they didnt just set the autopost to do its normal thing.Its just a fuckup. Its fine! Itll come out eventually but it cant actually have much to do with the time change if you think through the scenarios there...Edit someone else just now saying in a self post that YouTube somehow is at fault.

They should extend the campaign and continue to send out more feelers to try to get some more promotion.So the upper level tiers are pretty interesting and they start pretty low.  For  theyll let me design an NPC and you get even more design influence going up the scale.  The problem though is while I totally have the money for that Id be too scared Id fuck up that responsibility even with their help.Meanwhile there are a shit ton of indescribably creative artistic people who probably couldnt afford those upper tiers even though theyd produce amazing stuff.  In a way Id like to crowdfund the cost for some amazing artist or game designer to grab one of those top slots...in this crowdfunding campaign.Hmm only a stupid tired engineer like myself would come up with an incepted crowdfunding idea like that.

5656295,0,t1_cwxxy9b,Im inclined to agree. Ive kinda stopped watching this series regularly and Ill pick it up now and then to watch an episode but it is really frustrating. I love Dan as a host dont get me wrong but I was psyched to see him play Link between Worlds not because of the gameplay but because I thought Dan was THE retroZelda guy and I thought all the familiarity of the game would tickle him. But he hasnt really picked up on much of any of it. Not the music not some of the overworld similarities etc. And honestly I could forgive the gameplay flaws if it seemed like they were having fun with the game but at this point its obvious they arent. Dan is so tired and nervous about letting the viewers down that its blocking his video game chi and Arin doesnt flow well without another receptive host. Id prefer they just put the series down and come back to it when Dan is more relaxed or even just pass the controller to Arin and let him take over so Dan can enjoy the retroambiance and pick up on the queues in the game to talk about and have fun while Arin does the major legwork and gameplay.We know youre a good gamer Dan you dont have to prove anything to your viewers.

Slightly out of sync audio completely ignoring edits etc. None of it is going to single handedly ruin Game GrumpsAs much as Id hate to say it this is more or less the reason why people like me roll our eyes and write them off when threads like these pop up.The reality is it doesnt matter. Its not even the fact that the Grumps are being attacked like some people get pissy about I mean seriously fuck those guys Im sick of them too. Its the fact that these little editing mistakes really really dont matter in the grand scheme of things. When they get pointed out to this extent Im not going to lie it comes off as a bit stereotypically Poindexterish like I noticed a tiny bit of artifacting in the pixels and MY ENTIRE VIEWING EXPERIENCE IS RUINED!Like yeah itd be super swell if Kevin got his shit together. From my own experience editing audio Id go so far as to agree with you that hes probably just not reviewing his work when he finishes going through the motions which is bad practice.But at the end of the day its not like hes uploading half complete episodes or the quality is so bad its unwatchable. If the numbers were showing that the shows viewership has been suffering ever since Kevin came on THEN Id give cause of concern.

5767995,0,t1_cxbz2ys,Hi there. When I say editing I mean in the cut down to the funny bits or highlights. The video doesnt need to be  minutes long. A good example that springs to mind is Continue Show. Theyre funny guys but their uncut stuff is not nearly as entertaining as the episodes that only show the good parts.As far as the commentary yeah game grumps ramble about whatever comes to their heads too and dont get me wrong they have a lot of garbage episodes too but generally speaking they know how to be ON for the mic if you get my meaning. I guess they just need to push it a little more maybe listen to some sports commentary first push the characters a little more but as it stands theyre not entertaining enough for  straight minutes. The kind of commentary here reminded me of the early mornings after a party where people are watching movies and trying to be funny but theyre super low energy. Just describing what we can already see isnt great content.Obviously these are my opinions and Im under no illusions that my opinion matters but I really liked the idea just feel it needs work if you want it to reach a wider audience. Talking over games is understandably a tough skill to learn and get good at and theres some obvious potential. But it wont get better if everyone just tells you its great all the time. Final thought I guess a big problem is the game itself isnt very entertaining when it goes on this long and the commentators arent very invested because they arent actually playing.,gamegrumps,cxc2n3h,3,t5_2ulfu

5934239,0,t1_cxxhqo6,Yeah the grumps have come very close to doing exactly that at multiple points to this subreddit especially. This place can be absolutely toxic at times.gtSo wanting ethical and unbiased journalism makes you an asshole?See now youre doing the exact same jumping to conclusions thing to me. No matter what opinion you have on that whole thing I think it can be agreed that there were plenty of assholes on both sides of the argument. Note this doesnt mean Im saying everyone involved is an asshole because thats not what I said nor is it what I intended or implied just like nowhere did Felicia Day say that all gamers are assholes and I have contempt for them all.You need to stop thinking that its a slight on you personally or to the entire community or whatever. Im not saying that avoiding people cause of bad experiences is a good thing to do its not but Im saying I guess I understand the anxiety no matter if its irrational and dont see why anyone should demand an apology from her for anything related to this one quote. In no way do I feel this statement was implying she thinks all gamers are nasty people she doesnt want to associate with its pretty damn clear from all the rest of her career and online presence that this isnt the case but that because she does receive a lot of flak her own insecurities have kicked in harder than before. This is her own problem but she doesnt owe anyone an apology for it. If you got punched randomly in the street one time by some dickhead and then out of anxiety didnt want to go out into public again nobody should demand an apology from you on behalf of the rest of society for you being anxiousscaredsuspicious or whatever.,gamegrumps,cxxiceu,3,t5_2ulfu

6099629,0,t1_cyiyjdy,Question are you the one downvoting each post I make? It doesnt really matter much Im just legitimately curious.Couple things though in response to that. Number one Im a product of the environment. I grew up aware and every day Im continually made aware that there are some racist ass white people. As a kid I never really knew any white people well as I do now. There also wasnt YouTube for me to watch white people like through Game Grumps and shit. And so my initial hatred of white people as a kid and surprisingly for a lot of other people who havent had the chance to interact with white people as much as I have was mostly ignorant.Now Im very good friends with a lot of white people and I know a lot more and I watch a lot of them on YouTube so I feel like I definitely have foundation when I say that. The vast majority of them are racist. Either openly either subtly either subconciously theyre racist Ive found.And yeah Im being racist sure. I just confirmed that Im racist. Thats just what it is and no I didnt say all of you were racist just the vast vast majority.EDITAlso sorry for the ramble.

6115947,1,t1_cyktaix,I agree however it could very well be possible that theres more to it than whats on the screen. For example the grumps could write down what edits they want made for each episode and that missed edits could be the grumps forgetting to write it down. I only think of this because Kevin has to edit a metric fuckton of stuff and writing down what edits to make helps him do his job faster.But I am willing to accept that he just flubs it every once in a while. I just like looking at every possibility before passing judgement on someoneEdit an example of what I meanKevin sits down at his desk with the notes of start times end times etc.All right do they want me to make any edits for this episode? No. Intro endslate next episode. Any edits for this? No. Intro endslate next episode. Oh they want an edit in this episode. Ill watch it and make whichever edits they want me to. All right edits are done intro endslate next episode ad infinitum until Kevin reaches whatever quota for the day hours worked episodes done whatever.,gamegrumps,cyktj07,2,t5_2ulfu

Also Pokemon Art Academy had like nothing but visual jokes and Ross drawing skills as far as the game goes but the discussion was interesting and it made one of the best Grumpcade games.

Maybe it wont get kicked as much.From what theyve said it doesnt sound like Arins ADD isnt as serious as Rosss. I think Arin just REALLY believes that games should just be gameplay gameplay that doesnt require explanation no less as opposed to a more total experience with a lot of words.  I think thats one of the reasons he likes Bloodborne. You can basically skip the lore and without too much complicated dinkling around with items and upgrades you can just get out there and start hacking.I think also his entertainment philosophy with their playthroughs is to always try to keep things moving.  This is very apparent in the ALBW playthrough. The problem is that by constantly trying to push forward instead of just letting the game take you along they miss critical information that would actually make them solve things faster.  This ironically leads to the consistent complaint that they dont accomplish anything in episodes.The idea that slowing down can make things faster is VERY REAL and a HUGE life lesson. I have truthfully seen with my own eyes millions and millions of dollars wasted because people wanted to crank work out as fast as possible as opposed to taking some extra time to see if its done right optimally andor in the right order.,gamegrumps,cyz9nwb,5,t5_2ulfu

If you havent played Mario Maker lately or didnt buy it because you were turned off by dickbag sadistic levels ie Ross levels make sure that you revisit it. The community has really started to come into its own with people making much better levels levels with actual challenges but still fair. It is so much better now IMO. Also check out the subreddit for it the added functions of the official Nintendo website lets you add levels to your account from online which is great for finding new fun makers and actually fun levels. Dont let this game be held hostage by sadistic bastards like Ross. Support good makers and help their stuff to get out.I will warn you though that the  Mario challenge is mostly still shit because of Ross and those idiots like him. Mario Maker is meant to be fun not something that makes you want to kill yourself. I would also recommend that people do everything to shame Ross and his horrible levels. Ross needs to remove his levels and then commit seppuku along with all the other sadistic level makers. TLDR Mario Maker has gotten far beyond the horrible sadistic bastard levels that Ross made. The Community has grown and makes great levels now. Ross and those like him still need to delete their levels to make  Mario Challenge fun though. ,gamegrumps,cz271fs,4,t5_2ulfu

6479508,0,t1_czp2sbm,Man I dont agree at all. The Grumps seemed pretty miffed that the game didnt have a happy ending but that kind of doesnt make sense. For all its goofy gameplay Dead Rising is at least in plot terms a pretty depressing horror game about people going insane being eaten or being swept under the rug by the government. The canon ending saw Dr. B Brad and Jessie become zombies Carlito be mortally wounded by a cannibal and every single survivor they rescued in the game be executed by Special Ops Franks method of escape blow up before his eyes and Frank learning that hes terminall infected with zombie plague. I dont know what happier ending you could hope for than You get to murder the guy who covered up Santa Cabeza and is going to cover up Willamette you manage to escape alive and the zombie plague doesnt spread across the world at that point. The ending isnt perfect by any means. I dont think its that great. The final boss is introduced right before you fight him which is way too late to mean anything to anyone who isnt already  on board with the plot and the text dump at the end a nono in and of itself completely dispels the ambiguity of the closing cutscene. But still skipping about an hour of plotheavy game and seeing the final fight and closing scene completely devoid of context is obviously gonna leave you scratching your head and calling the ending shitty which I think is pretty unfair. ,gamegrumps,czpj1kh,3,t5_2ulfu

Are you an avid fan of DampD or tabletop RPGs in general?If the answer to either of these is no its almost a certainty that you wouldnt enjoy watching them do a session. Tabletop roleplaying games fall into that strange realm of fun to play if youre into it but boring as sin to watch unless youre REALLY into it. Its not the kind of game that you can just pick up and start playing without any prep and if the group isnt harmonious in regards to knowing the general rules paying attention for their turns and the story in general coming up with creative solutions and all things of that nature it turns into a clusterfuck very quickly.Now if they just say screw the rules and do some sort of campaign while making things up as they go along it could potentially be entertaining but Im not sure how youd even begin to make that work.,gamegrumps,d0kh0j1,2,t5_2ulfu

Dan is nicer more positive has more life experience talks about sex and everything around that the jokes are different and its noticeable that Dan has more experience in improvising.I feel like Jon made it more possible to make fun of a little single statement of a game. e.g. Protoman told us to go to the forest and burn it with fire Is this a health sword? Dan makes more different jokes or they do running gags for a whole episode.Maybe I will look into the things you mentioned because I have a lack of jonstyle stupid humour.

I guess I just dont like how it feels like they recreated LTTP on D without much thought but i suppose It could be argued they were more worried about creating a game in D rather than a new and creative Zelda experience. It just doesnt feel like they added much to the lore from LTTP and just rehashed the story with a different spin on some of the characters.

Yeah I saw the tutorial helped me a lot when I was learning Premiere but I genuinely dont think a lot of people know how much work goes into editing especially adding in graphics and animations etc.        As for reading too much into the  you could be on to something there but I see people giving out about Kevin not doing these edits practically every day. So hopefully this will spread that info a little further.        I didnt intend for this to be a thread on Kevins quality as an editor overall more a PSA.,gamegrumps,d15zfgk,3,t5_2ulfu
6970934,0,t1_d16hcp8,Yeah the process is pretty much identical. Only factor I could see taking a bit longer with oneoffs is that theyre in a new game so if theres something to do with capturing it that might cause audio drift or other technical problems you dont have  episodes of experience with footage from that game if that makes sense? Like technical issues might be more of a surprise.That being said I cant seem to recall a oneoff that had technical issues. Most of the problems the editors run into come into play with long recordings. Its just that the issue used to be behind the scenes and videos didnt go out desynced. Which isnt to say Barry was infalliblethere was apparently a brieflyuploaded silent episode back in Jon Erabut until Kevin this stuff didnt really show up at all much less with this frequency.,gamegrumps,d16hqpt,3,t5_2ulfu

Anyway like I said my OP was just in regards to what Ive read from the psychiatrypscyhologist community on the subject not my personal feelings on the matter. But personally I do agree with them that telling someone dont worry youll be happy again or any similar variant comes across as a silly thing to say to someone in grief. Its actually kinda offensive if you think about it.Yes I have indeed lost people close to me Im much older than the average reddit demographic so I have a lot of experience with death and everything is certainly not fine nor will it ever be. Sure Im happy again but I dont have the mindset of yeah theyre dead but thats fine because Im happy and thats what matters.But I could see how a religious person might think differently because then itd make sense to think theyre in a better place now or youll be reunited someday or their soul lives on.

7174509,0,t1_d1tlrkt,Many Souls players completely forego using shields except to use them as parrying tools or strictly for fashion or in the case of the stam regen shield thats in every game for the stat boosts. Rolling is much more efficient than blocking and helps you to maintain more advantageous positioning to counterattack enemies. Turtling behind a shield can work in these games if you build around it and get a high stability greatshield but its not the best recipe for success. Arin would likely do much better to just adjust to the different roll timings in this game since hes already used to the concept from having played Bloodborne.,gamegrumps,d1tob3v,4,t5_2ulfu

Also when you use a website like that a third party one you probably have a contract to sell there since they only use laugh stub. I doubt anything could have been done. I live like  minutes from the mall its been in it for several years and is a pretty decent venue. I been there several times and while its a bit pricey and I dont like that they make me buy food its my only alternative to the cesspool of a city that is NYC. Theyre not evil or incompetent they were clearly not expecting such a huge crowd to want to see this show. They were most likely ill informed of the volume or couldnt believe it. Theyre like borderline a small business that got slammed and could not keep up. I can only imagine Danny and Arin did not expect such a huge sellout for whatever reason. The SECOND I heard the venue was levity live in west nyack I knew the site would crash and this shit would happen. Me and all my buddies went to the mall in person to get tickets and there was some douche who bought like  tickets to every showing with what was clearly the intention to scalp. At the end of the day this is a good comedy club in the mall and its not a shitty place or business and I look forward to the show there.,gamegrumps,d1woxf9,2,t5_2ulfu

Arin and Dan were both baffled by how difficult the first part looked then they were in shock after finding a video of someone getting past the first part. You could listen to that episode but you dont know the difficulty of the level until you take a look at the screen. He clears the first part after a while only to get stuck on the next part. Again you can hear the anger but you dont understand the anger until you look at the screen yourself and try to figure it out yourself. Until you look at the screen it sounds like just another generic rage at the game.And its not the first episode like that.,gamegrumps,d261czf,1,t5_2ulfu

7392789,0,t3_4gkyn4,man Arin is really wrong about the dodgesheild thing. Sheilds have huge trade offs you have to constantly manage your stamina and if it drops to  you are open attacks. you even have to watch out for guard breaks and shield bashes. Even then youre not invincible to every attack. things like fire lightning and magic still do chip damage. on top of that you need to learn when you raiselower your shield otherwise its going to be worthless. Also youre mobility is compromised because every attack will stick you in place for a little bit.Rolling on the other hand you are sacrificing a small amount of stamina and you are actually invincible. you dont have to manage your stamina since its not getting constantly drained by attacks and all you have to do is dodge at the right time. ,gamegrumps,d2iie3y,14,t5_2ulfu

7402439,0,t1_d2jlavb,Because in Monster Hunter if you use up too much of your stamina you risk getting hurt by a monster by possibly losing the ability to block an attack or roll out of the way. In Skyward Sword if you use up too much of your stamina you pretty much just have to sit there and wait without any real danger in places like Skyloft. Its not like saying why doesnt Mario have a power up. Because if Big Mario gets hit and turns into small Mario theres now a greater chance of dying. If SS Link runs out of Run energy you have to sit there and wait. The stamina energy works in certain situations Im not denying that. Lanayru mining facility running on the treadmills by needing to get the stamina fruits and dodging the other stuff is a challenge. Fighting Imprisoned places a lot of importance on the stamina in that place too because the time spent waiting for your stamina to replace becomes detrimental in that situation because thats just more time for the Imprisoned to get closer to his goal. In other places youre just waiting for your stamina to recharge for the sake of waiting. ,gamegrumps,d2jlx2x,2,t5_2ulfu

Actually finish the project first its really easy for fan projects to just sort of die off even ones you started out really excited about... life often gets in the way actually having the finished product shows they wont be wasting their time. You cant really want them to make a promise and use that as your primary incentive to continue. Imagine how awful youd feel if it didnt turn out and you blew that one chance...Really make it because you want to and love the work. If nothing else surely some fans around here will appreciate it.

7588612,0,t1_d34gdpt, Thats two cents well spent! D     Okay so heres what Im thinking If you look at the Wiki the only source of information I have on this they say that season  had an average of . Million viewers. Now thats as far as I know Americans only because at least here PayTV owns the rights to Game Of Thrones and puts it out a few days after the US and defends their ownership with savage dogs and well trained seals. If we circle graph that there has to be an overlap of gamers in there somewhere... Its a fantasy setting that was originally a book series all traditionally the realm of gamers and nerds but lets be pessimistic and say ? Thats just under  Million people who are regular internet users who likely watch YouTube and who might give Game Grumps a try.     Lets be pessimistic again and cut that number in half and say that represents people who either already watch the show dont like the show already or just arent interested in video games enough that theyd watch a YouTube show about it. Lets call it . Million untapped watchers. Lets be SUPER pessimistic again and halve it once more and say that represents all other unmentioned cuts like people who are racist people who hate the character Grey Worm and hold it against the actor people saw the word Grumps and thought it was going to be a super negative review of the show or something... Just general stuff. You should have around  untapped viewers who would get a search result for it. Does that sound like a fair reduction?     But the poor video is sitting at  views.  Thats only  of the existing viewership. Im just gonna put the most videos from their video section on my screen at one time and do a quick standard deviation skipping the Table Flip episodes because they are depressingly small It was fun to watch folks! and the SteveO Episode as it was so huge... Which is odd because I would have expected Game Of Thrones to top that. Maybe Im biased... Anyway     Dark Souls  Average Views from this sample     Standard Deviation       O.o.T Average     Standard Deviation       Middle Slot Average     Standard Deviation       Now for those playing along at home a Standard Deviation is roughly what we would expect any increase or decrease in the videos to be on a normal day. So for example if you saw  extra viewers on a show that was in the middle slot you would say that the show hadnt gone outside of what youd expect from any normal show in the middle slot. It didnt increase or decrease viewership in any relevant way just the normal number of people who tune in or out regularly based on whatever makes them want to or not want to watch. Now for the totals     Average Viewers    Standard Deviation      Now obviously this is a shitty and small sample but we can see that anything that is Game Grumps and not Grumpcade or Steam Train picks up the big views and Im willing to bet OoT and DS does even better than a normal Game Grumps. So lets look at the Game Of Thrones episode.     Viewers at this time    Increase over the average      Now thats a huge pick up. D Thats awesome! In fact its nearly double the viewership!... But the SteveO episode is . times the standard deviation where as the Game Of Thrones episode is only ? Meanwhile and with no disrespect to Claudio Sanchez who seemed like a great guy his episode is . times the Standard Deviation and hes GOT to be far less popular than Game Of Thrones right? He isnt pulling . Million viewers each week right?     I dunno it FEELS small to me... Which is what she said. Also these numbers shrink again rapidly if compared to the most popular current play through Dark Souls . Now there was never any doubt that the game was going to pull viewers its freaken huge and great fun for those who are considering playing it. But with a google search as of two days ago it was only  million sales. Assuming not everyone whos got it wants to watch it or wants to watch Game Grumps and assuming there are people who dont have it who do want to watch it itll have a larger market slice but it still cant compare to . million people right?,gamegrumps,d34sdnf,1,t5_2ulfu

7598519,0,t3_4jb7hl,I wouldnt say so. Unlike a lot of let play channels their content isnt oriented around the game itself rather the game acts as a catalyst for what is the main act that is the grumps themselves. I wouldnt say they are becoming or ever have been like Pewds I think they are just changing as they see fit to keep the show running. Creating a less inclusive environment for their show to be enjoyed. If they werent consistently alternating their programming then they would quickly become in the eyes of the audience boring uninteresting or otherwise their dried up. Thusly they continuously try new things in all areas of the show. One may not always like them and if it becomes an issue with the community then they would be the first to reprimand their own content however if it is generally allotted or otherwise the community is conflicted or neutral on the subject then they assimilate the thing into their future works.

7707532,0,t3_4kuqwm,I value information and simplicity more I think thumbnails should just be a tool to show what the video is about in as clear away as possible. Game title amp whos playing is good enough for me.looking the thumbnail example you used I actually had to do a double take to see what it was if it was smaller like on the side bar on YT Id be hardpressed to know what game it is at all. I can only recognize one of the guys in the thumb thanks to the bandanna but the other person looks pretty generic without knowing who he is before hand.Often times if Kevin can he puts the grump heads over the characters and I appreciate the effort thats more than good enough for me.There was a time like.... last summer or maybe the summer before where they changed it up. Thats where we got the Arin head exploding checkers thing and so on... yea those were pretty bad thumbs. Its too much of a thing now to have special cartoon thumbnails or thumbnails where its the person photoshopped to the extreme. I think the cleaner style is more appropriate and rare enough to make it stand out today.,gamegrumps,d3iamjz,2,t5_2ulfu

Bombs got some nice new uses that make you rethink what you can do with them the limited tool set you get is really solid except the slingshot which kind of becomes useless after not too long deeper combat mechanics and higher difficulty are very welcome contrary to what many think stamina is actually pretty solid as a new addition the extra mobility is greatly appreciated and the ways they reused areas youve already explored were actually mostly great. I especially liked the very tense sequences where you collect the colored drop things. I never failed once but every one of them provided some tense and memorable moments completely unscripted.Theres just a lot to hate between the empty and boring sky the limited amount of truly free exploration below I felt really boxed in to whatever the game decided was the area I needed to explore at the time and it also required that I explore almost every corner of it to proceed. Nothing was left to discover on my own the touchy motion controls and by far the series most annoying and unlikable sidekick. I found a lot to love as well but the negatives will always have their mark on the game and keep it from being one of my favorite D Zeldas. It does seem like Breath of the Wild is on the right track in terms of how theyre choosing to evolve and dig up old ideas so Im really looking forward to it.,gamegrumps,d4kjuc2,1,t5_2ulfu

8127511,0,t1_d4thsmr,I think the main difference between these games and Nuts and Bolts is that Nuts and Bolts was still a relatively welldesigned game. It was wildly different but it still obviously had a lot of time and care poured into it and designwise it would still make sense if some new IP came out featuring a cartoonstyled pair of animals driving Lego cars. Shadow suffers from an extremely strange combination of the cartoon hedgehog mixed with the realisticallyproportioned human characters and the wide array of guns. On top of that its controls were mediocre not terrible just not as tight as they should be and the delivery of its story ranged from slight amounts of cheese to ludicrous. If Shadow was a new IP Im pretty confident that it would have been praised somewhat for the ambition behind its branching storylines as Shadow itself was but overall would have received overwhelmingly meh review scores as Shadow itself did.I would however agree with you that Secret Rings and Black Knight might have been better received as new IPs. They wouldnt have been seen as great games since the controls are wonky at times and performances are corny across the board but I think that seeing Sonic characters take over Camelot is distracting to the point of directly making the game worse. If it were a new IP and every character were just some random cartoon animal aside from Merlina and the Black Knight of course everything would be consistent. You wouldnt have to deal with the silliness of haha Tails is a blacksmith but he isnt Tails thats just crazy. The gameplay itself is decent enough just decent enough the games themselves arent masterpieces of gameplay design that it could hold up under unique characters.TLDR Not so much on Shadow but otherwise yeah pretty much.,gamegrumps,d4tlthv,9,t5_2ulfu

Of course they were going to rediscover their crew go pull Knurttt out of daycare etc. It was actually a nostalgic and delightful introduction to a long abandoned series for those who were really into it. Kind of like running into an old friend you havent seen in years and remembering time spent back then.Throughout FireRed it was never a laughaminute series. There were ups and downs. Some episodes were just grinding or wandering around. Others had edgeofyourseat battles. Admittedly often because Arin wasnt employing any particular strategy and was gaming RNG. Weirder ones had Dan reacting to Pokemon in hilarious and exaggerated ways.But really to answer Why were people begging for this? probably more than anything because after  episodes Arin was finally at the Elite Four and then just stops because he cant pull it off.

8607629,0,t1_d6hf4fk,Youre inferring smugness when its comedyset up and Dan doesnt take umbridge to it at all.And we can only hold so many episodes of Inside and Dannys got his performance anxiety. Cause unlike Arin who only rarely cares about the quality of his gameplay or how long it takes him to accomplish something Danny is aware of the viewers and what ticksem off is squandering their time.  Arin does what he does for purpose and reason.I mean the OoT shit people rip into Arin for is whatever to him but if it was Danny playing or messing up and he had to be on the receiving end hed feel guilty.Any impatience you sense is Arin parsing progression trying to prevent any situation that might mitigate Dans enjoyment Dan doesnt really seem to mind the spoilershints otherwise Im sure hed have said and also Arin working in entertainment factor.  Not all of the events of the game are equal in terms of whats going on or providing equal comedic opportunities. The kid swimming the submersible for an entire episode? Not much to do there. The kid surviving a death child? Thats riveting exciting and can lead to hilarity.I mean look at Arin pre and post having played. His buttsniffing tirade that people were kinda eh at came from a pause in gameplay due to puzzlesolving something. Also even if Arin has played the game now its also puzzlesolving on two fronts if theyre both there. Two minds. Many people are of the mind or saying Id want to see Danny figure it out. but prior to that Arin was also there and solved a puzzle or two alongside Dan discovery and the like. The two of them worked in unison and the discovery was on both their parts. So I pose that question again with another aspect. Are you here for Dan playing a game or the Grumps playing a game? And did you prefer Arin not knowing anything and them getting stuck with buttholes or Arin progressing the series and this nitpick of yours being the only complaint?  How engaging is Dan when he doesnt know what to do besides when he finds the solution? Yet now Arin knows. And that is perfectly fine hes a grownass man who can play games whenever the fuck he wants. And sure I can lend to you that outright spoiling it is something some might find annoying. But generally he gives time to tackle the puzzle and if its something thats not logically apparent or not necessarily engaging as content then its not going to be that bad. Theyve generally only got  slots daily and this is the critical decisionmaking they have to look at. They have to look at entertainment value at what content in the game is the most blatantly stimulating and comedic rates of progression Dannys comfort with showing ineptitudebeing unable to figure things out. Any display of this generally gets ripped to pieces if any other Grump does it their attitudes aside.But people want Arin to have been blind for them to have been stuck for the potential of the series to have plummeted by some of the puzzles presented.We received Portal earlier from the Grumps and that demonstrated puzzles and their dynamics and how often they got stuck or how long it took to resolve them and thats Portal the main premise is puzzlesolving with little else to offer. InsideOut is a narrative with puzzlesattached. And Arins giving the spotlight to the environmental story while also acknowledging with Dan the puzzles. Something Arin himself has said is something he enjoys like in a Souls game. Yo this lady was pregnant cause look I got this item twinsouls. I love subtle background stuff like that.The series has been them engaging in it reactions to how the Child reacts how clever that kid is and how scary it must all be to how fearful they are in some situations and looking at the mindless drones marching their line worms in pigs or the like the tight timing in sequences that exhilarate them. Its one of Arins favorite types of storytelling and if theres any impatience thats what Arins pushing Dan toward. And isnt that in itself something remarkable? People often berate Arin for hating story but this is what hes given the focus to by trivializing some of the gameplay components when they dont add much. Story. ,gamegrumps,d6hjrt1,-5,t5_2ulfu

Ubisoft stated that they wanted one strong launch for the game but there was a lot of talks about Microsoft refusing to have the game on their platform if the Wii U got it half a year earlier.The most likely reason for the delay is definitly that it was Ubisofts own idea and that they decided to develop ports cause they feared the Wii U sales would be low and that they delayed the Wii U version so what they assumed would be the weakest selling version wouldnt stop the excitement train before the moneymakers hit shelves.,gamegrumps,d6kz874,2,t5_2ulfu

9369471,0,t1_d93ku4c,The Watchmen comic is a core text of its medium. One of those things that if youre in the field of comics regardless of whether you liked it disliked it lauded it as a masterpiece or othwerwise youre expected to have at least read and given consideration. An adaptation had a lot to live up to among the people who saw significance in the original work.This idea of core texts was one I was introduced to in school for those wondering if Im talking out of my ass. A few universities have comics focuses and there are some comics considered essential to have at least read that are brought up. Things like Watchmen works of Osamu Tezuka Astro Boy Princess Knight Blackjack works of Moebius fucked if I remember I wasnt that into Moebius Maus works of Will Eisner The Spirit A Contract With God and perhaps unexpectedly the Scrooge McDuck comics among others unllisted.I personally didnt dislike the Watchmen movie but the movie probably cant be considered a core text of its medium while among academically inclined folks like my professors the comic is an example of the outstanding within its medium so much so it can be considered essential.So maybe that shines a light on the why of the situation.

They arent clear on the rules and mechanics for a game for a reason and it actually takes a few nights before you get the hang of things at which point they add more animatronics! It adds to the feeling of being helpless and confused.

Jon and Arin actually mentioned this back in one of their LttP episodes. You get these people who have shitty menial jobs they hate and they look at creative people who get to do what they want for a living and theyre jealous but instead of reflect inward on why their own lives are miserable and what they can do to change they try to convince themselves that those creative peoples successlives arent legitimate or dont count. Get a real job. That sort of thing.uTheBitterScience has to convince himself that the life that hes unsatisfied with isnt his fault its just luckchancefate. To admit that Arin worked his ass off to get to where he is would be to admit that he himself is responsible for his own life meaning that its his own fault hes miserable. And that would mean hed have to start working hard to improve his life.

Jon on the other hand always came off as the guy who enjoyed playing games for a narrative. What Arin complained about the being given a tour of the games universe always seemed to be something Jon loved. Danny always came off as a very casual gamer to me.

9898325,0,t1_daxrav3,No my ideal society is the one from  years ago where sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me.  The argument is always x group has been treated in a way you cant understand and thats pure bullshit.  Identity politics like this is why I cant stand the altleft.  I can absolutely understand that homosexuals have it worse then straight people blacks arent on equal footing to whites etc.  What I cant and absolutely refuse to understand is why we should be overly sensitive about it.  That doesnt help anything.  The civil rights leaders of the s for example werent off hiding in safe spaces and fearing words.  They were fighting for their rights in the political and social arena.The fact is the new millennial generation of which I assume you are one based on your tone is the weakest generation weve ever seen because theyve had their hands held from birth.  Theyve been told everyone is a winner everyone is special you deserve safe spaces at all times... well you know what?  When everyone is special nobody is.  Youre not entitled to shut down free exchanges of ideas simply because they conflict with your own.  Do you want to know why someone like Donald Trump who for all intents and purposes is not fit for the Presidency won the election?  Bullshit like this.  Gays are not being hunted down in the streets and killed in civilized society.  Youd like me to believe they are.  Not all police are crooked antiblack abusers of their authority... black lives matter want me to think they are.  The altleft which you seem to align with is causing the advancements in race and gender relations weve made over the last decades to be hidden behind a veil of lies and deceit so they can further their own ends.  People are starting to wake up to this and theyre not thrilled by it.  As soon as you put down the SJW pitchfork and look at the forest instead of the tree in front of you maybe youll see that too.,gamegrumps,daxrwpu,-1,t5_2ulfu

10162293,0,t3_5lifnk,I dont think its an unpopular opinion. It used to be no doubt but a lot of things have changed since the Jon era. Live shows were hardly even a pipe dream when Jon was not so grump. Now not only is it a reality but theyre selling out almost every show. In all honesty I used to favor Jon over Danny but thats only because Ive been a lovely since the beginning. Change was scary but in hindsight Id say bringing in Danny was one of the best decisions they couldve made. Sure if you want to compare their styles of comedy theres an argument there. But if you look at their influence on the shows growth Danny has without a doubt been more significant.,gamegrumps,dbvyal3,18,t5_2ulfu
10162449,0,t3_5lifnk,I think the highs were higher with Jon so to speak but a lot more inconsistent. I think theres like a handful of series and one offs that are unarguably really good and after that it comes very heavily down to preference.He knocked it out of the park a lot but honestly a lot of the time he kind of had a decently similar style to todays Arin that a lot of people complain about say something stupid or absurd and if it doesnt get enough of a laugh just say it again louder. Now that I think about he really did quickly repeat things that he and Arin said a lot.,gamegrumps,dbvyxhs,8,t5_2ulfu

10239486,0,t1_dc4o1rn,Im not critizicing them strictly because of the Jon thing  Im criticizing them because Arins never been shown to have the best way over his words and how he expresses things. This applies to his comments about games this applies to the Jon fiasco and this applies to this latest update video. Dont get me wrong  Arin seems to be a great person as much as I disagree with certain choices regarding Game Grumps the way they interact with the fanbase included... And the mere fact I still watch certain videos and hang around the fanbase as a whole goes to show I want them to improve. Thats why I criticize the way theyre going about things because I think theyre going about it wrong and that they certainly have the potential to do better.I wont comment on what the project Arins got in mind whatever it is will be like  we dont know enough about it to tell right this moment after all. But I do think the update video was very lackluster in that it just failed to address the big issues people would naturally worry about in the first place. The fact of the matter here imo is that Jons departure does leave one with a bad taste in their mouth with how the situation was handled... and while it isnt a reason to criticize them it is a precedent to keep in mind regarding the fanbases future worries. Thats part of what makes the update video lackluster  it just doesnt account for the questions that people would logically have especially given the channels history. If you say This shows not happening well have some new stuff soon! while it doesnt make it right to immediately assume it means everythings fucked it still isnt that much of a leap to imagine people would ask But what about the people who worked on it?.,gamegrumps,dc4pbgm,1,t5_2ulfu

If I want to pump poison in my veins mind your own fucking business. You know why no one dies over the alcohol trade? Because its legal. When you condemn shame and outlaw use of a highly enjoyable and natural phenomenon people are forced to become criminals to feed their needs  the product drops in quality becomes even more dangerous.

We know Egoraptor has long hair a possible blonde streak depending on what season youre cosplaying and multiple chins. We know Jontron has a beard wears a brown hat season depending likes to wear plaid and scream. They have the memorable quotes recognizable appearances and identifiable personalities of personas. Even if someone doesnt have a persona they could still be iconic or recognizable enough to be easily cosplayed.

He took on all the stresses and burdens of being the boss as well as the creative criticisms fans and nonfans have given him over the years and continues to bear it all with humility and a positive spirit.

11380903,0,t1_dflqeqc,No hes right. Look at the native Americans when our ancestors took over the culture in MASS immigration. Saying that a means of movement is not a huge problem when it lowers the concentration of a specific culture is ignorant and honestly as bad as holocaust deniers. Trail of Tears is the perfect example after becoming the dominant invasive culture the invaders used their new power to drive out and smother the now minority native culture. It happened with the Holocaust it happened with the Trail of Tears whos to say that it couldnt happen now? I personally dont think it will or even could but I understand that scared paranoid way of thinking.The only way that mass immigration could overthrow a native culture is if the native culture bends to the invading culture and allows the invading culture to dominate and exterminate the native one. If the native culture held steadfast and didnt allow it to happen eventually the two cultures would blend together in equilibrium.DISCLAIMER I didnt think I needed to clarify since I said this wasnt my personal belief but seeing very aggressive comments makes it seem like a good idea. This is not my personal belief I am simply trying to inform everyone how some antiimmigrant supporters may think and trying to say that some of those people might possibly be not racist but rather against immigration purely due to paranoia of this happening. Again I dont feel this is the right way to think of it but labelling everyone that is against immigration is a little too blanketing and closedminded when simply trying to understand them would make the whole dispute more likely to work out peacefully rather than degrading to violent lashingouts from closedminded arguers. ,gamegrumps,dfm08fs,6,t5_2ulfu

11529394,0,t3_64e1os,See heres the thing.As an entertainer criticism comes as part of the job. A vast amount of criticism is either personal or completely unfounded which isnt remotely fair for Arin in this case. He has every right to be offended when someone personally insults him.The issue is that cutting off comments and criticism as a whole stunts growth. Because even though there are a loud group going after faults with the person instead of something constructive some of us want to tell him our thoughts sincerely.Remember when Dan says people boo because they want you to succeed?Its like that. Id like to get my point across to Arin that the Grubba voice was grating or tell him that I really liked Doodle dudes or that using the same joke throughout months of recording kind of diminishes the comedy of it. But I cant get that point across since all comments are lumped in as a group to be ignored. For a team that wants to let people know how in tune they are with their community that cant be the case if they dont read comments.,gamegrumps,dg2uxd9,2,t5_2ulfu

Instead we operate more as a community of people who happen to have a similar interest. We dont stop anybody from talking about Game Grumps. But actually discussing the show isnt a primary focus of the server. We try to keep most discussions relevant to the channels weve got set up. But we also try not to be too harsh on enforcing anything against offtopic discussions. Its meant to be pretty laid back for the most part. But if you see people spamming often or being super aggressive please feel free to ping Staff Grumps and let us know whats going on. We do have rules against spamming and being generally toxic and that sort of behavior would definitely not be welcome. Keep us posted when you see stuff like that happening. Were a pretty small mod team on purpose it helps us prevent a lot of drama so we cant see everything all the time.I appreciate the feedback though!
