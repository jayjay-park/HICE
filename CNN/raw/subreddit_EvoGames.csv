It too lives in corpses but its hardened body allows it to be eaten along with the corpse in order to set up home in a new body which it will suck dry and turn into a corpse.,EvoGames,cql6t3u,4,t5_37w64

7679437,0,t1_d3d17tv,The front legs of the Orthapug  have hardened and bent becoming useful tusks which the Orthapug use to uproot the Grudan to eat the flower and the roots. Furthermore a genetic defect causes some individuals to have limb abormalities where some of their legs grow from their backs. Although this trait may at first seem useless and cause issues for the individuals their mobility is largely unaffected due to their many other legs and their back growing legs act as a detterent for predators. Therefore over time all the Orthapug population developed hardened and immobile legs on their backs which eventually became more like spines making the Orthapug difficult to eat.Habitat BeachesDiet GrudanPredators Padaslon and Parasmi,EvoGames,d3f3trg,1,t5_37w64
