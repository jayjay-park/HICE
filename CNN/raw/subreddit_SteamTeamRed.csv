1304447,0,t1_cigb83s,Because its more about the gamble than the race. Its really just a race to see how much one team can spend. If we try to fix the race theres more chance of profit. Its not just about being fair to the different teams its also about increasing the odds against Valvethe house and giving the individual more of a chance to win while risking less money. Plus it means you can play the markets because theyll be more predictable. Although Valve handily went and fucked that up thanks to the rule change. Which they only did because they realised how much more money they could make if we compete against one another.,SteamTeamRed,cigd7um,1,t5_328x4

1320569,0,t3_297bpm,Well In order for pink to win first for a day pink will need to step up its game and grab first with an overwhelming lead at the beginning of a new day and then assist red in maintaining nd. Problem is I think that many people have defected to our team and it is making the early lead for pink harder. I am sure some pinks have defected to red as well.And if everybody thinks about it. Joining nd place team will probably have a higher chance of winning a game as there are less people to go up against so the odds are better. ,SteamTeamRed,cii6j0v,4,t5_328x4

1333715,0,t3_29b4cu,Well we can say that at least red team was true... and I dont even think of that bullshit that was going on after Valve changed the rules in fact I would be willing to bet that random intervention of that guy on chan was just a stupid excuse to start this secret pact everyone against the red team... Well played everyone I wont support this its clear that all turned against us for no legitimate reason just to weaken us...,SteamTeamRed,cijnqo8,1,t5_328x4
