374930,0,t3_1ya8re,I always liked how this song is loaded with meaning and metaphors. The line that is repeated at the end its all nice on ice alright always makes me think back on the song as a whole. Its saying that there is some sort of temporary safety for a little while there would be no drowning upside down and dying a horrible death. Now whether he means it to be a metaphor for something that lets you avoid struggle or if literally the ice is slang for crystal meth I just cant tell. Although a lot of the song seems kind of delusional. Either way I kind of always had an unsettling feeling with this song. Maybe its just the waiting for the drums to kick in kind of like the ice breaking the illusion shattering.,ModestMouse,cfjmkih,1,t5_2rj5f

The environment really leaks into the music and Ive always found his guitar effects to be pretty icy. Particularly the reverb that washes over a lot of that compilation Broke is the perfect example. And his soft voice feels cold as well. However his distortion and screaming that dances like a drunken Cowboy Dan all over Lonesome Crowded West is red hot just like Northwestern summers. Ive lived in Montana all of my life and I think that is a heavy indicator of why MM are my favorite band. The music is in the air up here especially in the hip town Im in.

Hes the core of MM so with another songwriter introduced he could run the risk of not sounding quite like the same band. Not sure what to expect of the Krist Novoselic collaboration. Johnny Marr was a neat experiment and they should be glad it worked as well as it did. I agree that some spaces had to be made for Johnnys sound to come through which isnt ideal. Hopefully Krist just gels right into the mix in place of Eric Judy who I had expected to be irreplaceable and have since been proven wrong by the incredible continuity of STO as a singular piece and a part of the MM soundscape.

You keep saying that its just your personal opinion that using profanity indicates that something lacks class however that isnt an opinion thats a testable hypothesis.  I know its a testable hypothesis because a world in which class requires abstaining from profanity would be different from a world in which having class does not require abstaining from profanity.    Logically your argument looks like things with classthings that make use of profanity.     For proof of the general concept of classy profanity Id replace the words with their definitions and see if theyre compatible or logically inconsistentHe has an impressive stylishness in appearance and behavior even when he acts irreverent and uses obscene language.    Is it possible to imagine a person who is impressively stylish and yet irreverent? Yes. Does it violate some kind of logical axiom? No.     Okay so we have verified the general concept I suspected that class does not prohibit profanity by definition but it could be that in the real world things with class are never profane because of some other more complex relationship. To test whether that might be true I need to think of something that already exists that disproves my hypothesis that things cant have class AND profanity so is there anywhere those two things almost always exist together? Since Im watching a lot of House of Cards lately Im thinking politics.    For proof that there are classy profane thingspeople Id use an example like the President of the United States many of which have been very profane but are still full of class nobility grace and respectability even. Can I think of real world examples to confirm my hypothesis that the world is the way I think it is? Yes.     Okay then Its probably true that classyusing profanity is an incorrect hypothesis.    tldr Its a fact not an opinion whether or not something could possibly have class and use profanity and rationalism can show us that there are things and people that have class and still use profanity.,ModestMouse,cpyytri,2,t5_2rj5f

9027604,0,t3_53wvnz,Ive always seen this song as meeting God during a particularly deranged drug trip most likely a meth binge with the Ice being slang for crystal meth. I also love the perverted image of Jesus walking on water while simultaneously drowning in styrofoam boots. Probably the most unique thing about the song is the drums suddenly coming in for the second half. Its not too different than some of their other stuff but it really strikes you the first time you hear it and on subsequent listens you get more out of it.But that is one of the best things about Modest Mouse you will constantly keep hearing songs that surprise you both instrumentally and lyricallyemotionally as you explore their discography including unreleased stuff. They are really diverse for an indie rock band. Also the vocals may seem weird to you because their vocalist Isaac Brock has a lisp that really shows when he talks and kind of makes his vocals unique and sometimes hard to understand. Anywho MM is a band worth exploring for their musical diversity and lyrics. Have fun,ModestMouse,d7wz5ft,4,t5_2rj5f

9847443,0,t3_5gch8u,Since I believe Jeremiah wrote those lyrics and not Isaac I tend not to think of it as an extension of the indian giver type idea that Isaac used in Bukowski.My interpretation is a little different. In comparing God to an Indian hes saying that God represents something like the Indians coexisting with the natural world pure and unmarred by modern trappings or corruption. Then humans come pollute everything kill each other enslave other beings to our will horses. The get on your horse and ride feels like a kind of resignation like yeah humans pollute everything and twist it to our whims acknowledging that is not going to stop any of us from continuing to conduct our lives in a selfish way. Things will always be like this guess all we can do is continue on the best we can.Thats just my feeling on it though of course the fun thing about lyrics is that they dont necessarily have one strict meaning.,ModestMouse,dar57qq,30,t5_2rj5f

Said he was standing outside the recording studio in Chicago  smoking a cigarette and he went across the street to a park where some dudes were just standing around. He greeted them with a hey hows it going or something similar and out of nowhere one of them said fuck you cowboy and clocked him breaking his jaw. The rest of them kinda jumped him but he said the only punch that landed was the initial blow that broke his jaw and the rest of the flailing arms were just missing him or not really connecting. ,ModestMouse,de6py8t,1,t5_2rj5f
