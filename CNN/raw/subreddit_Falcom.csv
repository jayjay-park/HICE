They are their own trilogy of games. I believe the correct order isProphecyTearsSongWhen they were brought over here Bamco did a crap job on translated and changed the battle gameplay as well as got the numbering for the games wrong. Still regardless of all of that people have regarded them as equally fun and in some cases better than the Trails series. So I would say go for it and give them a shot!,Falcom,cuea8kt,2,t5_32vt5

6527971,0,t1_czu89m4,Falcom has a history of doing prestory sort of things for their series but Ys is mostly the target to it. So it was kind of a surprise to get one for a Kiseki story.This was selected for use in Translation Tuesday simply because its a good idea of what Estelle and Joshua are doing postSC and introduces Toval who is an important character in Cold Steel and Cold Steel II.,Falcom,czujlol,2,t5_32vt5

Ive done him on Hard though that video had a bit of RNG involved but now Ive an idea how to beat him on Hard without RNG.Weissmann even on easy is impossible as he will use Dimensional Exile which will vanish you regardless of status or and type of shield up and land a game over.Angel Weissman is probably impossible on everything that is not Easy if not also impossible on Easy because he has a confuse craft forgot the name which cannot be blocked by Earth Guard or even Grail Locket hell keep cycling this craft before it wears off you will never get a turn yourself and you die.,Falcom,d0lacy2,1,t5_32vt5

7047027,0,t3_4c2x0s,I doubt what you say is possible without modifying the binary. And modifying the binary is a bit more involved than most common mods Ive seen for these games where they change or replace the data archives instead.I do know that dual audio in battle is fully supported by the games. That is you can place a Japanese voice archive and English voice archive both in the install folder and itll allow you to change battle voice language ingame In my own doing this in the past I had to modify the archive since the JP versions differ they contain the sound effect SE and voice T files in one archive while the Steam version expects SE and T in separate archives...The obvious easy file replacements include replacing the plain .ogg BGM files with properly looping audio of any kind as you know this is used with converted BGM from the Evo games for that patch.Anything else hasnt been commonly done but Im sure there are other possibilities and peoplell discover theminvent them in time.,Falcom,d1f4zox,2,t5_32vt5

7126318,0,t1_d1nw849,I had the same problem. The solution I recommend is to install the game in a different path i.e. C to avoid Windows permission problems.Notice how other games avoid dealing with Windows permissions by having a config and save files in the Document folders.Another solution is to try to manually edit the config file for the game inside the root.The game has some interesting options that are not accessible by the config program like aliasing and shadows options.

8756079,0,t1_d704smn,gtFalcom doesnt risk anything at all in localization work. Everything is on the publishers shoulder. However theyre looking for reputation of the game over financial burden.I was arguing the point about reputability in my original post. Back when Ken Barry talked about Kickstarter their wasnt many highprofile crowdfunding successes and there were many failures. I feel like that has changed in the years since. Thats why I mentioned DOS and Pillars they show that wellregarded games can be and have been made from crowdfunding. I personally would like to hear another statement from XSeed about this.gtNot quite sure how XSEED can negotiate with Joyoland specifically.I mean in the general sense that if Joyolands AO port is unsalvageable XSeed can finance their own port as an alternative.gtThis is not a financial burden on Falcoms site but that XSEED needs to show them that theyre willing to take on the risk. Falcom has reacted poorly to companies mishandling their property before.I feel like crowdfunding does not compromise any of this. XSeed or the donors will take on the risk not Falcom regardless of how the funds for localization is raised. Crowdfunding also will not change how XSeed actually handles the games script and code.gtKickstarter isnt as popular in Japan as it is here and Japanese companies putting a ton of stock into international sales is not the norm there.I understand that. It just seems like crowdfunding has been routinely dismissed with a wave of the hand when it comes to ZeroAos localization mostly due to an XSeed statement from years ago. With crowdfunding having seen high profile successes in cRPG and VN circles I want to know if XSeeds stance has changed.,Falcom,d7062c9,1,t5_32vt5

8907723,0,t1_d7ihnbc,Theyre deconstructed pretty much right after the prologue. I really didnt think any of the characters in CS came off as any more tropeish than they did in Sky. Ultimately Sky just takes its character tropes from the early s where you can find quite a few more quirky energetic female leads and their broody male love interests and Cold Steels cast has more modern tropes. ,Falcom,d7ikurv,5,t5_32vt5
8912127,0,t3_51l33r,Having just finished marathoning CSII I figured you might be interesting in the perspective of someone whos only able to play the English games. While I probably enjoyed the game more then you its definitely one of the best Ive played all year I do have to agree that CS so far doesnt match up to Sky obviously nocomment on Crossbell.The biggest issue for me was how sidelined much of Class VII felt in CSII. Outside of their bonding events most of them fade into the background and its just not really possible to get the same mileage out of the structure of the bonding events as you can get out of say Chapter  of SC. I actually like Class VII quite a bit but there just isnt any of the truly memorable character moments like the end of Chapter  of SC in CS. The narrative also felt rather inconclusive with all the matches with the villains ending in someone else coming to assist the party and VitaHexen Clan never really getting fully explained. There was also the aforementioned sorta repetitive structure which while honestly totally a thing in Sky too Gospel Experiments I think Sky managed to weave character development and worldbuilding into these episodic arcs more deftly. That said I think the pieces are set up really well for CSIII. Lots of the cast have some pretty interesting ways they could develop going into CSIII Rean and Jusis especially and I loved the direction the political side of the plot went into with the endgame twists. I also just really love the Trails setting so everything they dangle about the lore of the games is great to me. I also agree that the villains were really well done the intermission was some fantastic character development done fast. Anyway those are my thoughts I hope one day I get to play the much hyped Crossbell arc in English.also yeah the weird final final dungeon is some garbage pacing i still actually havent finished it,Falcom,d7j3vl0,3,t5_32vt5
8912555,0,t1_d7j5dft,Ah great I only got them once I patched my game to V.. Thankfully or unfortunately I wasnt done with the dungeon so I got a few to just speedrun the whole thing. They each come equipped with an item that gives them  DEX and  critical rate along with their personal stats and quartz and Master Quartz so enjoy! Oh yes the sepith thing is just another change that irks me but to be honest its the least of my grievances with the two games. I still cant believe anyone couldve thought that a floor dungeon was a good idea gtgt,Falcom,d7j5q6e,1,t5_32vt5

9041150,0,t3_53xjeb,I doubt Calvard plays much of a role in the next game. I think Rean will be the main character but i think he and Lloyd will probably join forces at some point. Class VII will get back together they have to. I think Osborne is obviously going to be the main baddie. Crossbell is now a part of Erebonia just as every other citytown so no doubt some of the game will take place there.,Falcom,d7yloqd,1,t5_32vt5

9078775,0,t1_d834906,Yeah Mobius. I admit I didnt give it a second look in the first game either but a friend told me about its level  ability and that made me put it on a support character to get exp for it early on in CS. Its pretty damn useful if youve got a lot of good endgame food.,Falcom,d834dqq,1,t5_32vt5
9110854,0,t1_d867aq6,Sorry for the delay! I never did end up going into it.Bigtime CS Ending Spoilers and NG Events Theres a comment on the side at one point that Osborne has been acting to try and limit the Gralsritter activity in Erebonia but we know thats not doing too well since we have at least two Dominion in Erebonia. I also suspect that Eins there as well. Three Dominion together is a big deal. As a result I also think that this means well definitely see a play of Ein vs Osborne in terms of manipulation trying to play chess with each other in a sense. However I think the church can get the upper hand because Erebonia in a general sense is a very pious nation and even if he is the chancellor it might not do in his favor to openly play against the Septian Church. So hell be forced to be completely in the shadows for what he does in retaliation whereas the church can probably be a little more open. Especially now that Osbornes taken the research of the Phantom Blaze plan from the Ouroboros. I almost think that Osborne may be a preferable enemy to the Gralsritter than the Ouroboros. If the Ourobros has to act openly then we may have other political shenanigans going down. The end result is the way either of these two organizations act is going to determine the actions of the Septian Church but while theyve been forced to keep Gralsritter activity under the radar they may have a little more freedom to act this time around.,Falcom,d86z6v0,1,t5_32vt5

9252435,0,t1_d8olbgu,Huh well at the very least Im happy to see Rean using a gun. Ive never seen this before thanks! If this means that Crow has the katana C would make so much more sense! It would also make some sense if their back stories were switched as well but thats more just me being hopefulMaybe that Alisa was the combined AlisaAngelica and all the engineering stuff went to George or maybe George is actually the original Rean! Wouldnt that be funny? I would totally play George no Kiseki! This is mostly a joke but stillEdit Alisa actually looks like her combat style may have become Jusis as well. I think they did a lot of splitting character designs to make Class VII an entire class instead of like a club but it really harmed the amount of character development and plot relevance each one of them had in the end.Oh also it is always possible that there are far older concepts for the story than these since theyve probably been planning to do an Erebonia game since when they made the Liberl or at least Crossbell games and then these would be relatively late designs since they got far enough along as to have D models made.,Falcom,d8ota0w,1,t5_32vt5
