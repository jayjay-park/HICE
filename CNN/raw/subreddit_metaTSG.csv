9433149,0,t1_d9b819q,Mattenne mentioned most things but I think special mention should be made of the state of Morrowind in TSG since it differs a bit from the popular interpretation of evidence we get in the games.The Red Year happened and devastated Vvardenfell. The Scathing Bay exists. Most of the stillstanding structures on the island are Daedric ruins save for Nordic fishing communities that still operate in the Sheogorad region and scattered pockets of Dunmer resettlement.Mainland Morrowind was not hit nearly as hard. It was ecologically shaken up and a lot of environmental effects occured but there were no widescale calamities like we saw on Vvardenfell. Instead the lions share of the partial collapse of the Dunmer nation can be attributed to losses sustained by the Great Houses from the Red Year and the Argonian Invasion. Two centuries years after the start of the Diaspora those who remain in Morrowind have reclaimed a good amount of their way of life.Most importantly in my opinion the Silt Striders are not extinct or near extinct but rather the Vvardenfell subspeciesbreed of them were wiped out with the one we see in Solstheim being the only one left.,metaTSG,d9bpti9,2,t5_2uolf
