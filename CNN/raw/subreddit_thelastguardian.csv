8749178,0,t1_d6zap4m,I do hope there is extra stuff to do. Ico had hidden items to find and Shadow had time attack special items to earn and my favorite... places that served no real purpose. Just places you could explore and find that didnt contain a Colossus but still seemed like it had some story behind it even if there was really nothing.,thelastguardian,d6zawf2,3,t5_2slha

9930002,0,t3_5hpaqr,The bleak destroyed empty world was more reminiscent to me of Ico then DS out of its two predecessors TLG was much more like Ico then Shadow of the Colossus. From the architecture commanding an AI companion and the quiet nature of the world it seems like they both take place in the exact same world. Ive only dabbled in DS but if you havent tried Ico I strongly suggest it! Its much closer to the feel of this game.,thelastguardian,db1wkkl,3,t5_2slha

9997055,0,t1_dbaa9bq,Ico amp Shadow of the Colossus are connected. not going to tell you how that would spoil the games for you and fans of the series know that TLG is connected to those but we dont know how yet. Trust me play Ico amp SotC in that order.,thelastguardian,dban84p,2,t5_2slha
10012038,0,t1_dbciil1,I definitely see where you are coming from the button prompts disappeared for me really early in the game I dont think it was patched to my knowledge and I dont remember seeing them all that often when I did it was reminding me of something I may not have used in a while and they stayed on the screen very briefly.I think ultimately if you are looking for flaws in something you will see them many will consider this game far from being a masterpiece perhaps that is the wrong word for it. But for me at least it lived up to and surpassed its hype which is something I never expected and puts it up there with some of the greatest accomplishments in this media. In case you cant tell Im rather taken with it.,thelastguardian,dbcliho,2,t5_2slha
10013475,0,t3_5j25e8,Well obviously Ico and SOTC didnt come out at a time where games had trophies or achievements.  In the original development cycle of Ico no one was suggesting that players should rush frantically through the game in  hours.  SOTC did have the time trials built into it at the time but again people had the option of avoiding them which they still do as long as they are content with not having the platinum.  Bluepoint Games did the remaster of the games and its unclear how much say Ueda or Team Ico had in creating the trophies of the HD collection.For what its worth Ico is one of my favorite games of all time and I would love to have the platinum for it but Ive pretty much given up on that.  The hour speed run makes you angry at the game and the character of Yorda and in general its going to mean a lot of wasted hours trying to force yourself to play sections over and over again.  Obviously there were speed runs done by fans before the HD versions but to force such a tightly timed speed run goes against the experience of the game.  Id rather keep loving the game than have the platinum.The Last Guardian seems to have a less frustrating speed run trophy.  I wish it wasnt there but Ill probably try to do it at some point just because I want to play and replay this game several times anyway.  The barrel trophies dont bother me because at least you dont need to acquire them all in the same playthrough.  If Im playing through multiple times Im probably going to find mostall of them and I can use a guide at some point if I need to.,thelastguardian,dbcs94x,3,t5_2slha

10087815,0,t3_5k97v8,Not as far as I know. NTSCPAL video differences havent been an issue in ages regional gameplay differences for example Shadow of the Colossus PS releases had different physics and other small differences are these days minor to none and at most the european release only has the UK translation. Still a large amount of euro releases default to US english or give an option between the largest EU languages often allowing to pick between US and UK.No differences AFAIK except maybe some logocopyright name differences.,thelastguardian,dbmgk5g,2,t5_2slha

10173068,0,t3_5ljz1u,Id agree with other people that the species is called a Trico because of the labelling during the loading screen    In Japanese the boy says this  and it is spelled like this in their media. These are Katana characters only used to pronounce foreign words its a phonetic spelling and and has only one pronunciation  Toriko       to   ri   ko        Its officially  Trico because the loading screens on the japanese version of the game also have the drawings with english writing. They wanted it to sound foreign. Toriko is the closest pronunciation to Trico a japanese person can say because they dont use tr in their language and cant say it.   For example a playstation is pronounced like  Puresuteshon or something like that because they cant say or pl or st its a common thing just happens with a lot of products names            tldr Its a trico japanese people say toriko when they are trying to say trico     edit ...Im not suggesting the language in the game is japanese just the voice actors they speak a fictional language in the game,thelastguardian,dbx691b,8,t5_2slha
10192369,0,t3_5lwspz,Its not Oueezee as this is just part of their dialect and it it is used all the way through the dialogue sequences.The nearest I got is that it is said in the final scene and it would make sense that its said after the boy is rolled over and people can see his face and recognize him.  At this time two different voices both say something akin to Ithico.  But its not distinct.,thelastguardian,dbzd0sd,6,t5_2slha

10259120,0,t3_5mwbp9,There are similar hanging cages in Ico under the main bridge but they are much more shallow in design. It appears in both games they are only used as jumping platforms but why some are broken I can only surmise that another Trico has been this way in the past and perhaps grabbed onto one which broke under its weight ?,thelastguardian,dc6xekd,3,t5_2slha
10298518,0,t3_5ncpdb,Im going through my second playthrough trying to take good care of Trico. He has been much more responsive this time around.Trico leans his head down to get petted something he never did in my first playthrough follows me more closely and takes many jumps on his own. If I get picked up by a soldier Trico quickly comes to save me. He responds quicker and better to my commands makes sure to wait until Ive climbed on before he takes a jump. ,thelastguardian,dcbe5cq,2,t5_2slha
