And going through some process to display and verify a hash seems harder than installing a plugin. Even getting the other person on the phone in the first place seems harder.gt Now if you used a similar format you no longer need the exact bits of the key to compare them just a quick visual check red green light purple grey which can be compared over the phone.You can actually do pretty well just using a dictionary of say  common words as your alphabet. That encodes an almost respectable bit hash in  words which you can probably read aloud a lot faster than you can describe many distinguished colors. Of course you might have to recreate the dictionary for every user language.You can use that sort of thing to seed your key by the way.

Namecoin or something similar. Namecoin names may be FCFS and therefore potentially confusing but DNS names are nearly FCFS and much more corruptible.. Something along the lines of keybase.io ... but that may be too complicated for a lot of people.. A simplified version of what keybase is doing where you build trust in an identity by communicating with the user over a long period of time. But that amounts to aged nicknames so maybe it doesnt really count as an alternative.. The existing PGP web of trust and probably PGP keys themselves.

The only downside I can see to CryptSync would be that it keeps two folders synced rather than acting on one which is great for certain scenarios but bad for my case in particular. I need to encryptstore documents many GB in size and CryptSync would effectively double the amount of disk space needed. But I will save the link for future reference as I can definitely see myself using it for other purposes in the future.Update Actually reading through it seems that CryptSync has some major security flaws that can spring up when filename encryption is enabled. This isnt essential for me but I thought Id let you know just in case you had that option enabled as it may lead to serious problems. Seems to be safe for encrypting files themselves since GPG and zip encryption are used but the author implemented filename encryption himself and seems to have messed it up fairly badly!,crypto,cohqzy3,1,t5_2qq4h

You should declare dependencies if using a Unixlike operating system with a package management tool and look into the documentation for the other ones e.g. Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X and iOS.I am not sure that initialization vectors must be cryptographically random given that it depends on your mode of operation Perhaps somebody else should be able to help you there.Anyway be very careful when handling cryptography in development. Making secure code is very hard cryptography is extremely hard and hence developing secure cryptographic code is one of the hardest pieces of software you may have to look into.

It cant be calculated by others knowing only the public keys it cant be forged either and nobody else can create a public key from it which they are capable of deriving the correct private key for. This allows people to confirm that the derived signing keypair indeed is derived from your main keypair as EC multiply with the main public key and the HMAC value gives the signing public key. And because the signature is valid they know it is yours. Overall the solution seems reasonable but Im skeptical about this exact claim depending on the details.  This is one level of abstraction deeper than Im used to so bear with me.A message is signed and can be verified under some derived public key DPKPKHMACmessage.  However this is one equation and two unknowns PK is unknown since the original author is hidden and HMACmessage is also not published. A malicious entity with their own public key say MPK and claim the HMAC was DPKMPK where the inversion is done in the EC group.  Of course the bogus HMAC doesnt come from anything but nobody can actually verify that since HMACs are computed in secret.If you also required that the derived secret signing key is used to sign say your main public key then that I think avoids this issue and you dont even need to publish the HMAC but then Im worried about signing things you derived from things itself...

Sadly it never really took off.I remember that he was not allowed to export either the program or the source code but he got around it by printing the source code as books and then exporting the books which were then read with OCR and then compiled into programs locally. Books were covered by freedom of speech. Books could be freely exported.gtYou dont have to distrust the government to want to use cryptography. Your business can be wiretapped by business rivals organized crime or foreign governments.gtThe government has a track record that does not inspire confidence that they will never abuse our civil liberties.

How can you agree that this is a good thing?Thats not how it works. You dont get charged with contempt of court without ever seeing a courtroom. Theres an opportunity for one side to demand documents and demonstrate why they believe those documents exist and are accessible to the person who is being ordered to produce them. Then the other side gets an opportunity to convince the judge that the requested documents dont actually exist or arent accessible to that person. The analog world equivalent for your hypothetical would be someone sending a letter making references to documents that dont exist and the courts using that letter to hold some in contempt until they produce the documents referenced in the letter. The person charged with contempt could theoretically be held in contempt forever because they cant produce documents that dont exist. As far as I know that scenario has never happened but its just as plausible as your hypothetical. There have been several cases setting precedent on the subject of courts demanding people turn over evidence from encrypted drives. In all of them the courts have had considerable evidence that the person held in contempt had access to the files in question but was refusing to comply with the order. I dont think anyone in any of the precedent setting cases has even tried a defense that they didnt have the keys theyve just tried to argue on fifth amendment grounds that they didnt have to turn over the documents which has never been the view of the court. Certainly it hasnt been the case where police throw a suspect in jail forever without ever seeing a courtroom. ,crypto,d3ct6px,4,t5_2qq4h

If you want privacy use encryption.The most common encryption is certificate based public keys. Data encrypted with a given public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. That public key is unique and has a unique fingerprint that you can easily view. Anyone attempting to substitute a different public key will give themselves away.A rogue CA might issue certificates to the wrong people but there are five reasons why its not a bigger concern the certificate would be signed by a different root you can detect if someones inserted a different public key lawful intercept procedures do not allow leaving clues that would let the target realize he being secretly intercepted any CA that issues fake certificates is punished by being ended a digital death penalty.Anyone who uses a root certificate to issue fakes will have that certificate banned real quick. The authority has to be trusted that it will not issue fake certificates. roots that fuck up get revoked  if youre a trusted root and you issue fake root certificates you get revoked China had their root revoked  Dell fucked up with their CA and so theyre revoked Certstar issued a certificates without due dilligence which is why there is no longer a CertStar And if Kazakhstan ever issues fake certificates their certificate will be globally revokedI agree that its a poor system that relies on vigilante retribution  ending a company with a global ban  for authentication.And while few people check the public keys  people do check them. That stops all passive listeners I.e. bulk government surveillance. It also stops me from viewing what people on my WiFi do as everything today uses HTTPs I know Ive WireSharked stray iPhones.It also means that it prevents active intercepts where the attacker cannot let the subject know hes being surveiled. That rules out bulk collection but not targeted encryption.For that you would have to get a validly signed certificate which no CA would do for risk of being put out of business use a selfsigned certificate which gives a warning place a fake root into my computer breaking into my house logging into the computer as an administrator and leaving a certificate that has telltale signs that its there use Sslstrip which gives itself away and there is active technical mitigation to preventI seem to have wandered a bit.

Not necessary Im sure but Ive been fiddling around with TOR since middle school so I have no qualms using it since I know Ive already been on whatever enhanced Surveillance lists that gets you on for quite a while. Also when I started getting ISP letters for torrenting I got a bit more serious with opsec got a torrent proxy and started using TOR to surf thepiratebay. Since then no letters so why mess with success? Sometimes just for looking things up that I dont want to be seen by any agencies like drug stuff or info on hacking tools all just intellectual curiosity calling myself a script kiddie would be being generous just feeling the freedom of not being watched once in a while is like taking my shoes off if that makes any sense. I realize theyre redundant in theory but Ive also heard that there are a number of TOR nodes that are run as honey pots. Im sure youd need more than one of the nodes to be corrupt to compromise your ID but I figure better safe than sorry. Redundancy is usually a good thing. When you say my browser is more likely to be attacked what exactly do you mean? I think thats why I like to use both because if my IP somehow did leak through the TOR exit node itd just be a VPN IP.

If you dont like it get off.And to help ensure that people cannot be prosecuted for hacking into someones computer we have TOR. This way the hacker can operate anonymously without fear of government retribution. There should be no government on the internet whatsoever.gt how do you envision a relatively safe world especially as systems become more digitally interconnected and technology becomes more accessible and versatile than ever?We are now starting to drift away from the purpose of the original comment period. Were now talking about digital attacks online.If were going to talk about digital attacks online we can do that. And I would like to engage in that spirited discussion. But as long as we can first all agree that no person will ever be required to turn over their password no person will ever be required to decrypt anything no person will ever be required to disclose their conversationsThe governments concern was with criminals being able to communicate privately without lawful government interception capabilities. Criminals should be able to communicate online without government interceptionSo before we talk about hacking online were all agreed nobody can ever be compelled to turn over a password nobody can ever be compelled to decrypt documents nobody can ever be compelled to unlock their phone no Corporation can ever be compelled to turn over my information without my express permission any information a quart demands cannot be used against anyone in any wayThose are the right things. And Im going to drag governments kicking and screaming into doing the right thing.You may disagree with me. You may disagree with my reaction at a company being hacked  ransom being set and no one should do anything about it. You very well may disagree with me. But Im right. And Im going to do what I can to drag the world kicking and screaming into doing the right thing. Ive written cryptographic software. I release it into the public domain. Because everyone should be using encryption all the time for everything. Government should have no ability to find anyone or monitor anyone on the internet.Now back to the separate discussion of hacking online. And I know the tired refraingt  what if a hacker hacks into your computer and posts all your personal information online?gt  what if a hacker gets into your bank account and steals all your money?gt  what if a hacker hacks into a CANDU nuclear plant and causes a melt down?The answers are going to all revolve around well the guy was using TOR so youre never going to find him.  the bank does the same thing if they were robbed at gunpoint they have insurance in case someone robs the bank someone hacked into my computer? Damn I knew I shouldnt have run that programgt Bonus people are trying to hack into my computer right now. My event log shows endless failed password attempts. If I dont like it I should not be on the internet.  someone caused a meltdown from their living room in Idaho? What is a nuclear reactor doing on the internet. I just said if I dont want my computer hacked into I should take it off internet. If you dont want a nuclear reactor hacked into dont have it on the internet.I know these are things that PublicSafety.ca doesnt want to hear  they are so antithetical to where they come from.

Its at least better than CC where youre extremely likely to shoot yourself in the foot and have a buffer overflow type exploit. That leaves maybe Rust as one of the few secure languages for crypto.Then again being able to scrub keys from memory is kindof an academic theory only advantage not really a practical one.

Generate P while testing P is coprime with e.    Generate phin.So phin is never directly tested for coprimeness with e because if you failed coprime test with e at this point you would need to regenerate both P and Q.  On the other hand testing P and Q while generating avoids having to do needless and costly prime testing since you can test that isnt a coprime before you test if P or Q is a prime.So you are correct it seems that e is properly tested though I dont understand why the assertion that e must be odd.   Other implementations of RSA will test if e is a divisor of candidate   if e is prime this method works.,crypto,dfsv6fp,1,t5_2qq4h
