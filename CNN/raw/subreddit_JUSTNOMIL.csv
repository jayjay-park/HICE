Convinced hubs that he had to get me yellow lilies that they were my favorite. I actually hate them she convinced him to surprise me with a trip to a restaurant that turns out to be her favorite. Who happened to be there? MIL with FIL and SIL all together. Who did we sit with? I was seething. After we left he asked why I was upset we had to have a talk about how I had to spend my mothers day pandering to his mom and her wants not mine. He realized after how it had played out.

This I have no problem with as hes also a really nice guy. I do however get callstexts from his mom frequently. She normally calls to discuss my boyfriend and what were going to do about him. She always wants me to sneakily go about and try to manipulate him to do things that she wants him to do. I dont fall for it. After the second month of dating I realized that shes just over emotional and manipulative. Heres the kicker Im only . Like I JUST turned  this past month yet she treats me like Im . She hints about us getting married been dating a year and a half and how she wants babies from me. My boyfriend is  and a college graduate so in her mind its time for that next step.

3961491,0,t1_cr7sz0w,See this is what Im really wondering. More of an Im the elder grandmother I come first. Shes always done this usually Im at the table trying to dish up and she just shoves her plate in front of me and tells me what to put on it. Then shell start telling me what to put on FILs plate. Luckily my husband is usually right next to me so hell help manage her while I continue what Im doing. Shes also started correcting my kids more and its not for stuff that has to be corrected. For example last night my  year old who just learned the word no and hasnt figured out what it means yet was saying no over and over. Now this kid will say no to do you want a cookie? Then get mad if you accept no as his answer. Anyway hes in his high chair happy as a clam saying no while eating. She gets after him and tells him you do NOT tell mommy no. It is NOT NICE. Or likes to tell me when I should have given a swat then in the same breath tell me that I should just let the kids do whatever they want as long as theyre not hurting someone. OH and heres one I still havent gotten over. When my now  year old had his nd birthday party he didnt want to hand paint. Not a big deal. I was ok with it he doesnt like to get messy and the birthday place has PLENTY to do he doesnt have to paint. But it was about  minutes past his normal naptime and he was a bit fussy about it. Not a tantrum not a scene but just a bit whiny and crawled in my lap. She got into his face and yelled HEY! My mother was right behind me and if she hadnt been there I may have made a scene. She got between us and told her that she didnt appreciate her grandson being yelled at during his birthday party. I pulled my son away and took him for a diaper change because I was so pissed I knew Id have a scene if I opened my mouth. Shes one of those old school church ladies. The ones who like to sit in the front pew and be Godly but talk shit about everyone. The shit she says about how my brother and sister inlaws parent their kids... I dont tell her anything I dont want everyone else to know. ,JUSTNOMIL,cr7udg1,18,t5_377ps
3971105,0,t3_35a06q,Ugh I hate babysitting drama from my future MIL! She always goes on and on about how shed like to babysit and how shes available all the time...except Monday through friday...and any time before  pm and no time after  because thats her bedtime. So yeah just Saturdays and Sundays from  hour an hour that we are always already home at and we dont go out that late we like an elderly couple already eating dinner at  and watching early movies to save . I also dont trust that woman with a child more than I trust sticking my head in the running blade of a lawn mower. Shes currently raising two of her grandchildren from her other son and both are totally screwed up but in far different ways so ive seen how horrible she is with children.

3972749,0,t1_cr8y1n5,Sadly Id say yes.  My second is due in July and I have a feeling I may have less patience but I try to make as much light of her antics as possible.  My husband gets annoyed for me and having the backup is definitely helpful.  My main thing for not blowing up is picturing my sisters face when she is around my MIL.  She gives me the wideeyed Are you freaking kidding me? look whenever my MIL does what she does.

3984460,0,t1_crag2wz,Youre right.. these are all some major issues. Its hard to bring things up to him because religion.. he feels like hes doing me a solid and his parents feel the same. I was raised Catholic and they think thats why I want nothing to do with it and feel like if only I could see how truly great god really is.. then I would understand and come to the bright side.. for a lack of better words. Its ridiculous and annoying. my hubs and i really do great in all other areas and weve come to a compromise on religion. Ill respect his ... but... he has to respect my views too in the sense that he doesnt go crazy with it. God stays at church on sundays.. thats it. He doesnt belong at our kitchen table etc.. And I agree... things with strings!! Which I hate.. supposedly because they are Christian.. things dont come with strings. I was born.. just not yesterday. My husband on the other hand may have been. Supposedly the kids dont see it or notice it.. they used to and it was painfully obvious. She was given an ultimatum. She said its not fair to her that she has to love those other kids and its not fair to her grandson. I lost it. Told her to basically fake it till she makes it or Im done trying for her. What kind of person does that to children. Added bonus.. her precious grandson wanted nothing to do with her and would lash out when she treated him like he was better than the rest. Once she showed equality.. he started acting human again and enjoying her company. Funny how that works... How would he lash out you may wonder? Hitting her throwing glass.. yes glass.. he loves to throw her collection of wine glasses saying mean things telling her hes happy shes gone hopes she never comes back that he doesnt like her... making her cry.. mean kid stuff. When we woudl skype.. he wouldnt sit and talk to her.. just go scream in a corner or throw things.. which isnt acceptable in my house but was okay in hers.. in fact time for timeout? how about grandma reads you a story while youre in timeout. yep. sounds like a punishment. SHE DRIVES MY SIDEWAYS. Its not just my MIL but my FIL too... unfortunately.. they both ride the crazy train. Equally victim to the god complex and seriously have a glow around them with how much faith they have and spit on everyone. My husband refound his faith last November and we almost split because of it but we were able to work through it. His solutionhis familys solution Just believe in god and everything in life will be perfect and amazing. pft. i hate them sometimes. ,JUSTNOMIL,cragpjv,7,t5_377ps

3998854,0,t1_cr7eabv,My GOD! Youve basically just described my mother! Although my mother actually does love the babies and tries to be helpful sometimes....but its the times when I sayoh poor baby N is really sick with a terrible flu. or I cant talk mum Im really sicktiredbusy etc. and her response is oh I was SOOOOOO sick last week I mean you couldnt be any sicker than I was I was almost going to go to the hospital but I couldnt walk to the car so I stayed home alone with no one to look after me I even though about calling an ambulance. Or you think youre tired? Im way more exhausted than youve ever been in your entire life you dont know what tired is I was a single mother remember?   I didnt have your father helping me I had to do it ALL by myself...you have your husbands help every day! never mind that I basically was raised by my dadgrandparents!.   And after this oneup conversation with me she goes on to post on Facebook oh my poor granddaughter is very sick or my daughter is just exhausted and has the flu she really should take some time for herself being a working mommy can be very exhausting I wish I lived closer so I could help out by talking the kids for a weekend!. really? What the hell? You just minutes ago on the phone told me to suck it up it could be worse I could be a single mom like she was! I do think she genuinely does love her grandchildren and me but shes such a narcissistic weirdo that she doesnt know how not to be jealous or feel empathy and the need to oneup every negative thing that happens because she thinks itll get her some extra sympathy...I held off telling her about my MS diagnosis for six months because I knew the moment I told her shed tell everyone in our extended family and want loads of sympathy because her poor sick daughter had been diagnosed with a terrible  disease...she failed to tell them that Im fine and am in remission.  ,JUSTNOMIL,crc3njp,3,t5_377ps

They do not like to be left alone all day so if you have a dogsphynx or  sphynx you will probably be ok. Nani greets us like a dog would. If you have a breeder in your area see if they will allow your son to come by and meet the cats. Some cats have more wrinkles than others but most are pretty comparable to Nani and Pippin wrinkle wise unless you are looking for a show catbreeding cat. If you are looking into getting more than one look into a retired breeding cat. A reputable breeder will only have  litters before retiring a queen.

Next ... would your husband be on board with postponing Christmas until he comes back from this second business trip? Because that really sounds like the best thing to do for both his mental AND physical health. If so my advice would be to simply call his mother back and tell her something like Mr. McGee and I have talked. Because he has such a short gap between trips and this one has been so stressful he has to work so much while he is home and then will be gone for another  weeks so soon we have agreed that we are going to rearrange the calendar. Christmas for us will be happening on date. I know that the rest of the world is celebrating it in another week and a half but we wont be. Wed love to have you come out in month for our very own special Christmas. This December however is not going to work for us. Of course you have his best interests at heart and I know you want him to be able to function at the top of his game. Thanks for understanding!I would NOT mention the dog to him. There is no point. Nothing he can do about it. Yes its sad. I have had pets my whole life and I remember almost every detail of the last day of each of their lives. Its traumatic. But he is in a different country. And then when he comes home he will have other stresses pulling on him. And then he leaves the country again. He needs to focus on himself right now. Somewhere in the recesses of his mind he is aware that the dog is  years old and he must know that dogs dont typically live even that long.

They got him a washboard a jug a set of spoons and a triangle.  You have GOT to be kidding me. Its the year of Star Wars apparently so that was their singleminded focus this year.

DH and I are trying to raise our kids without rigid gender norms so opted to keep it when we found out I was having a boy. Literally the only bedding I could find with any purple that went with the wall color was a Monsters Inc. set.  Every gender neutral set was jungle themed and the rest of the boy sets were like sports and just didnt work.    I donated most of the toys we got way too many young baby toys and he wasnt all that into crinkly blankets and rattles and used the quilt for playing on the floor when he was super tiny.  It got a lot of spitup   I couldnt even sell it its not well made.  Its like one piece of monkey print cotton backed with bubble minky.  Theres no piecing just gridlines sewn across and bits of embroidery floss sewn on throughout.  The edges arent bound properly.  Its offensive to my sewing skills!

Their main goal is to protect children. So if there is an inkling of evidence that someone harmed a child they call the finding true.  However in the court of law the burden of truth is on the accuser.  The whole mess still really bothers me. I feel like the person never got properly punished.

6365815,0,t1_czcgsss,Yes!  Im not surprised at all  we all spend a lot of time going I should have  but it can get very hard to shake off for something like this.  I do hope you both find help.  I wanted to link to something  Ive been trying and trying to find it  I cant even remember if it was a webcomic or just a writeup!  that I once read.  Im going to try and recreate it!  Basically it was describing how when someone is ill or injured physically or mentally i.e. going through a family crisis just like yours they can be very hesitant to ask for help.  So you picture this person who needs help but has a sphere around them keeping them focused inward on the problem perhaps not asking out of pride or fear of rejection or perhaps just not thinking of asking for help.  And it can easily drain them because theyll try and cope with things alone when what they really need is to let others help them shoulder that burden for awhile.  Meanwhile the people who love that person and who are outside that sphere can sometimes sense that sphere and they do their best to help as much as they can.  But meanwhile each of those own people fails to notice that theyre inside a larger sphere  the sphere of people who are caring for someone who suddenly requires more of your mental or physical or spiritual energy.  And because you love that person in the middle you willingly give without ever stopping to take time to refresh or refill  until one day you realize you are empty and your ability to help that person is severely affected or even zeroed out.  Im intimately familiar with this process when it comes to the elderly  Ive had lots of experience watching family members care for their failing loved ones without taking any time for themselves because it feels selfish.  But eventually they burn out and even then they feel selfish for not being able to keep up a task so demanding that even people who go into that field only work set hours and get paid a lot because its a very hard job!! I think its vitally important that anyone supporting a family member remember themselves as well for both their sakes  and thus I think you need to remember to take care of you while youre taking care of him.

6498625,0,t3_44mdwj,Ask what you can do to help and listen to her answer. If she tells you not do something dont do it. Dont criticize parenting or their choices. She is trying to do what she thinks is right for her children and learning as she goes. Just like you did. Make sure to include her in conversations with your son. There may be things that you disagree with and you may need to vent we all do. But vent to someone that will not break your confidence like your husband and only that trusted person. Do not EVER talk badly to multiple people behind her back. It will get back to her. Remember your DIL is your sons first family and first responsibility do not make him choose between his wife and you. Do not drop by unexpectedly. Always make a plan first. DO respect your sons relationship with your DIL. DO remember that she is a person that really has your sons best interest at heart. Do remember that you both love your son and by being respectful of DIL and their relationship his life will be so much easier. DO keep lines of communication open. I am sure there are a lot more but I wish this is what Irritating Iris did for me.  ,JUSTNOMIL,czri8ur,3,t5_377ps

6507833,0,t1_czs72gv,You can tell the nurses specifically to not let M in the room and that she is not to be in his HIPA disclosure. If she already is then have her removed. Medical staff are not allowed to disclose or even discuss his condition without your say so. You can do this at any time. I would recommend you call the hospital sometime this week and have her removed. Call again the next day and confirm that she was removed from his HIPA disclosure. Hospital staff do not screw around with HIPA violations.Then when it comes up explainThat she cannot have any information about your sons medical condition unless it comes from you. You can explain to her that due to her behaviour and attitude last time there was a medical emergency you are very uncomfortable with her being involved in your sons care. You are his mother and must always be involved with your sons treatment and all decisions must come from you or his father. Last time she took control away from you and then made snide remarks afterwards. You are his mother and you and his father are the only people medical staff should be looking to for decisions.Note if she tries to throw her medical knowledge in your face or brings it up in any way respond with this. Yes as a medical professional you are more aware of the process and medical issues than I am. However you are also aware that my sons parents are to be kept informed of all decisions at all times and are to be consulted before any actions are to be taken. You know better than to have been giving orders to medical staff with out consulting me. I love you and a respect you a great deal so I was even more hurt by your behavior and actions and I will never let it happen again.  You welcome her input but she has to make recommendations to you then you will consult with medical staff before you make any decisions in the future.If you do this it will let her know that you have put down firm boundarys she can not cross with out legal repercussions. It lets her know she screwed up and needs to make it up to you not the other way around.Honestly she really should have known better than to do what she did.

6839201,0,t1_d0qt8s0,gt if I asked my MIL to make sure her son was okay because I was worried about him and they lived in the same house only to find out thats considered creepy...?so i had a longdistance boyfriend once and we texted or emailed or spoke on the phone or some combination thereof every single day. well one day he didnt respond. i figured he was busy with something and didnt think anything else of it. the next day still no answer. i got a little concerned but kept waiting. the rd day without a response i started to freak out because it was seriously unlike him. i contacted a mutual friend to see if he knew anything no answer from him either. fourth day still nothing from the boyfriend and im majorly panicking imagining that he got in a terrible accident and is on life support in the hospital or something. so i did the only other thing i could think of  i called his mom. she didnt answer either so i left her a voicemail that i hadnt heard from him in  days and i was seriously worried and if he was okay to please have him call me. day  he finally calls so i assume his mom got my voicemail and was like CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND DICKHEAD. she didnt need to say anything back to me personally and i can understand if she was freaked out that i had her number since she didnt personally give it to me. but all i really wanted was to hear from him. if he wasnt okay i would hope shed have called me back to tell me so but since he was fine had picked up a new job without telling me and claimed he didnt have  seconds at a stop light to answer my texts this fight actually led to our breakup i really didnt need or want to hear back from her i wanted to hear from him. so if i was worried about my boyfriend the logical thing to me would be to call my boyfriend first and only call his mom if i cant reach him.,JUSTNOMIL,d0rizbo,1,t5_377ps

Mostly because shell probably meddle or whine and I just dont care to hear it. I doubt her knowing would cause any real drama though. I am absolutely not willing to sweep it all under the rug but I am willing to completely ignore that she even exists. As far as I can tell Goldilocks does not see it fit for her to apologize she believes shes the one owed some bullshit apology. I may have to make that call but part of me feels like thats showing my hand a little. I wonder if keeping the bnb a secret might just take away a substantial amount of control from Pharisee?

6986111,0,t1_d187hs9,Well perhaps. Ill argue in this case there is a lot of backstory that renders it rude on his behalf. Though I was generally raised never to pointblank ask anyone what they paid for a housecar or who they voted for maybe my mum was strict in that sense.Specifically the part in previous posts where they pretended to want to help out and even offered a large chunk of money back at Christmas but then refused to send it and wanted us to beg for it. Which we refused to do we hadnt even asked for help to begin with just gave them a generally headsup that we were probably going to be moving in the next year...and so we went and bought a house without any of their money. So...theres that. Also back at Christmas when we were first discussing homes we were looking at Mr. Freeze looked at our states median home price online which of course includes mobile homes and whatnot and does not factor regional differences in at all and started ranting that we shouldnt spend a penny over the laughably low median price in our state. And he refused to give a reason. Note that their house is way over what that dollar amount would buy. He just didnt want us to have anything too nice and their offer to help with money was originally a plot to make sure they could control what we chose to buy. Once we made it clear that we appreciated their gift but would ultimately make our own decision on what house we were buying they started holding the imaginary check hostage at which point we said to ourselves F it we dont need their money anyway and went ahead and bought a house without their monetary assistance. So...I guess there is more nuance than perhaps presented in this update. Though I still teach my kids not to ask people what they paid for things. I tell them its OK to volunteer that information but that its not OK to ask. Though Im a lot stricter about the voting question than the money question with my kids.,JUSTNOMIL,d187sh2,2,t5_377ps

I would have pried him from her if I wasnt afraid of hurting him he was a month premature so i just flipped out and demanded ahe hand him over. She didnt. she and her husband told me if I didnt leave without my son they were going to call the police. I was fuming. I was fighting demanding they give me my baby and pointing out how I never wanted to be separated from him again Id just been in the hospital for complications rated to the pregnancy and deliver for a week. They fucking called the cops and said I was trying to take the  baby for a walk in the woods it was night and there were several inches of snow on the ground. Why the FUCK would i want to bring him into the cold?! So the cops brought me to the hospital and I was diagnosed with PPD because no one would fucking listen to me. That family told everyone I was crazy and kept my baby from me for two more weeks despite the doctor saying that was unacceptable and the baby needed his mother. My first son. A month premature. And so much time Ill never get back. That was a year ago though. Im still livid. ,JUSTNOMIL,d1afp1p,184,t5_377ps
7007230,0,t3_4bmsmi,This would actually probably be a great post to repost to rHarryPotter  they love discussions about the particulars of characters etc and this would likely be a novel take on her.I feel like Mrs. Weasley wouldnt necessarily be a MIL from hell or anything but would likely be very annoying in a Ma its ok I got this. sort of way.  A worrier for sure but not necessarily in a malicious or usually harmful way.  A lot of what she does makes sense within context of the world they are living in and the situations they are in.   I think these are honestly probably the only really unforgivable ones on the list.  I cant really think of a good reason why she would destroy their work outside of fear that they will be ostracizedfail in the wizarding world going off the beaten trail that way. While it isnt a shining moment for her I can see why it happened  since he was  basically the Weasley family had kinda claimed him as a son since he had no good family to speak of at that point.  If I thought someone was twotimingscrewing over one of my kids Id be pretty pissed too. I feel like context is important with this one.  We dont know what Sirius was doing when Harry wasnt around  considering how antsy and rash Sirius was in general I can see Mrs. Weasley and possibly others not trusting his judgement especially when he had only recently gotten out of Azkaban and was just generally ragey etc.  His parents put Sirius as his guardian but that was before everything went straight to shit and even so I suspect they would not be angry that someone was trying to look out for his best interests if it was felt that Sirius couldnt do it entirely on his own.  Though personally I dont feel EITHER of them should of been making the choice  Sirius was too rash and Mrs. Weasley worries after the kids too much.  Dumbledore Lupin etc would be a better person to decide. Ron was just generally insecure I feel.  He was insecure as Harrys friend inferiority complex due to Harrys fame. felt like he couldnt be awesome in comparison to the dude that defeated Voldie and on top of that the family is just generally not well off especially for a generally pure blooded family  and I can see a kid internalizing a lot of that considering how classist the wizarding world is.  One of his brothers reacted to the same context regarding their status I mean by becoming an overachiever others by striking off on the unbeaten trail etc  Ron just took it to mean he was worthless rather then the other way around.  Mrs. Weasley may of contributed to this accidently somehow maybe voicing a wish for a girl prior to Ginnys birth?  Cant remember if she ever mentions it in the books but I suspect the idea that she doesnt love him because he isnt a girl is moreso just misdirected feelings considered she proves time and again she fusses over him just as much as all the other kids. Considering how snotty Fleur was up until that point I can see. Mrs. W getting the view that Fleur would be the type to up and leave under such a horrible situation.  I also wonder if it isnt insecurity on her part too  Fleur could quite obviously have literally anyone she wanted.  Considering how low on the totem pole of the wizarding world they arewere and Fleurs general demeanor up until that point she may of gotten the impression Fleur was there for only x y and z reason  and when those reasons went away assumed shed go away too to get what she deserves and hurt Bill in the process.  I was honestly surprised when Fleur said fuck that Im staying  in a good way mind but it being even mildly surprising should probably speak volumes. It likely isnt a matter of having a say.  By that point emotionally they might as well of been her children too  she loved cared and worried over them just like her bio kids.  While it smacks of having wildly wrong priorities their safety over the wellbeing of literally every person within the UK I dont see it being an issue of them going against protocol ergo its bad  I saw it was her being worried due to them going  out into a situation that they were more likely then not going to die from what could be seen.  Overprotective to the max for sure but its not hard to see why she felt the way she did. This seems to just be a wizarding world thing in general  muggle things  bad and unlike Arthurs obsession with batteries this was his actual health being messed with.  Not a good thing to get nutty about but makes perfect shitty sense for a witch that was raised in that mindset. This Ill give you  shes incredibly pouty and unreasonable about this point and its incredibly eye roll worthy.While she does have a lot of difficulty in separating her feelings from what she needs to actually do I dont think shes entirely as manipulative tantrummy  etc traitwise as implied  one thing to note is that the books are written from Harrys standpoint so everything is in context of how he feels about it.  So OF COURSE when he wants in the meeting Sirius says yes and Mrs. W says no itll be painted as her being insufferable etc.Now the one character I think WOULD actually be a MIL from hell  Narcissa.  Good great gods I would feel terrible for her DIL!,JUSTNOMIL,d1am508,30,t5_377ps

I am going to delete this but I needed to talk about it.Oh Koukla you are so right.  Its just... I STUPIDLY expected some sense of decorum from my small circle in the wake of the death of a child I deeply loved.  Instead I was treated much like roadkill  passedby and detachedly disdainfully pancaked beneath the wheels of those familiar to me left yet to be picked apart by carrion those I was nominally aware of before the crushing blow who normally keep their distance.  In they swooped to glean from my exposed bones every last salacious morsel of my familys unbearable ordeal.My husbands boss questioned his need for bereavement leave stating Its just durbees nephew right?  He probably doesnt count.  MIL had much the same response.  I feel irrationally angry about this incident.The whole situation played out rather publicly thanks to social media and that had people who barely acknowledged my existence up until that moment crawling out from under their rocks to offer condolences and dig for dirt.  They took to FB and became grief thieves posting the Isnt this just tragic?!? Im so upset for the durbees maiden name family.  Please pray.  They PMd me texted asking the most insensitive questions known to man.  When I declined to answer their inquiries I was told I was being selfish.

7117897,0,t3_4d0ajk,let FB go. What will calling her out on her FB shares accomplish? Not a thing. But when she brings up comparisons between herself and your mom you can say Yes my mom visits us often. That puts the ball in her court if she wants to see your daughter more often she will visit. It also shuts down argument because youre agreeing with her. If it really matters to you when people gush to you about how often your MIL sees your DD you can say something like What do you mean? or Thats odd she doesnt come often and leave it at that. But again that wont accomplish much in terms of controlling your MILs behavior. If she complains that you stay with your mom when you visit well theres nothing unreasonable about that. Its your mom. You get to stay with her. You get to stay wherever you are most comfortable. WHen you go to visit your home town I think its a good idea to have an itinerary and stick with it.

Fortunately the grandparents have a huge burden of proof and have an extremely difficult time winning these cases. Unfortunately you cant stop someone from suing you over ridiculous matters.

Now hes blond and if hes anything like husband and I were hell be brunet again by the time hes in kindergarten.

7273743,0,t1_d24txey,From what I understand about baby friendly hospitals they dont forbid formula feeding they just dont offer free samples and outside of true medical emergencies formula has to be provided by the parents. The reason is that in many hospitals it reached a point where breast feeding was considered fairly abnormal that nurses would help by giving the baby a bottle if they were in the nursery rather than bringing them to their mom to nurse. The baby friendly guidelines arent about preventing people from formula feeding its to prevent the people working at the hospital from undermining breastfeeding new mothers. ,JUSTNOMIL,d24z57y,3,t5_377ps

She is also very judgmental and jealous of other peoples maladies. One of her friends was recently diagnosed with Parkinsons and before I went NC she would send me texts complaining that her friends condition wasnt really that bad and she was milking it. She also once told me I didnt really have cancer when I was  Yeah they cut my left lung out for shits and giggles and believes that ADHA is just the result of bad parenting.

Theres the obvious impacts for people who feel like they have no other choice. But even for people who truly enjoy stripping they often have trouble starting over in a new career have to deal with harassment. Use of drugs is very common among porn stars and strippers particularly as a coping mechanism.  Obviously its not the same for everyone and Im not saying all sex workers are depressed under duress and their lives are ruined. But I cant deny after doing a lot of research into the topic that its a difficult position to be in. Theres no easy solution but I personally think not financially supporting strip clubs is a good idea. Obviously not everyone will agree and thats okay. On the topic of the MIL...The idea of not letting your husband touch you for a frigging year is crazy. Shes not supposed to decide your boundaries for you. Even with my boundary against strip clubs theres no way Id ever be that vindictive. ,JUSTNOMIL,d2kv5hj,1,t5_377ps

7442172,0,t3_4h1qgf, FMIL wanted my social security number and DOB to help sign me up for insurance.  Immediately bought onesies stating Life is better at Grandmas Thank GOD for my grandma Who needs Santa when you have Grandma? They went on and on...and went straight into the trash.  Got in my face about FH and I wanting to know the gender before birth. Early called me a party pooper. You know them ultrasounds is wrong all the time. They aint never right.  Bought boy oriented everything.  Built their own nursery without asking. Yeah hope they like supervised visits cause thats a bold move.  Refuse to acknowledge that Im having a girl. Ive had two ultrasounds. It was crushing to Deliverance. Early made jokes that we didnt try hard enough. Gotta work harder for a boy you supposed to look in a mirror when you on top! hip thrusting motion. Ughhhhh...  Ordered me to buy Dreft. I cant tell you how many times she told me I needed to wash all the clothes in Dreft before arrival of LO. I hated the smell and bought Mrs. Meyers baby detergent. Smells divine. Deliverance scowled at me Is it even for babiiiieess?  Cue emotional incest and Deliverance starts informing me her baaaaby never spent a night away from her until he was . Firstly not true. Second then why does she think Im going to send my infant for overnight visits? Why build a nursery? It makes me so paranoid. Also she went into a tutorial on how to scratch his back properly. He was super skeeved out when I told him.  Spent five minutes explaining that FH played with himself as a toddler before I blurted out that Id babysat and that its normal for little boys. It was creepy though the way she just kept describing it. Even Early told her enough.  Early and Deliverance refer to themselves in third person as Pawpaw and Mamaw already. Infantile speech has began. My Baby wont never be out of Pawpaws sight when its here.  Deliverance sat down one day with her nasty bitch stick cigarette and told me DO NOT bend over and or pick up heavy things. My mama did that with me and I had the cord wrapped around my neck. She was trying to kill me and I was just a lil baby. We dont want nothing happenin to our lil critter. Our lil baaaaby. I just looked at her flatly and said yeeeah thats not realistic and I doubt that was your mothers fault. Thats the first time I heard someone refer to my baby as theirs and I havent forgiven it since.  Asked to go to the gyno with me because she had questions for the doctor.  I had a amniotic band scare. Whe she found out she Googled the wrong thing acted like I was clueless as to what was really happening to me. Everything was fine but shes cut off of medical info.  Bought toddler bathtime toys. Bitch you will never strip my child and bathe her. Never.  Would call randomly and ask if I was drinking milk because my teeth will fall out. Im an avid runner and extremely healthy eater. Theyre both inside chain smokers with wicked pharmaceutical habits. Our baby isnt ever staying in that smokey house. I hate having my health habits questioned.  Is always warning me not to run. If its not the critter is gonna fall out its watch out for snakes!  Babysat their nephews frequently and claim to have raised them completely. Which only serves to make me see how much they exaggerate.  Have started questioning how I take care of my dog. They have three dogs on chains and two in the house. NONE get to run ever. I take my dog for runs and care for him completely. Hes a huge dog  lb and now hes been dubbed our big boy by them. And finally....  Deliverance used to dress FH up as a girl when he was around a year old. Take pictures send to family. NOPE. No hell no. Makes me worry shell obsess over our daughter. Hes mortified by it. Our decision is VLC supervised. Even then theyre skating thin ice. He confronted them a few weeks ago and theyve stopped speaking to us unless they need FH to weed eat. I know theyre going to come out of hiding when the LO arrives and Im pepared thanks to advice in this subreddit. I could go on forever but Ill post more later.,JUSTNOMIL,d2o4lqk,6,t5_377ps

7544498,0,t3_4indlx,This is a good updateTo le husbandYou can do this. The father of my oldest two had a really charming reaction to our first unplanned pregnancy. Namely get an abortion or Im gone. I honestly think sometimes people forget that a pregnancy means the creation of a human. They treat it like its a dog coming into the family. Like its not going to turn its big soulful eyes up at you and say Daddy? Were you excited when you found out you were going to have me? like our actions dont become the narrative of our own and others life. But we went on to have an  year marriage  which aint bad by todays standards. He made up for it in part because like you he didnt dig his heels in. Abortion now! lasted a morning. Not weeks. Or months. Remember that dog thing? I think your mom stayed in puppy mode. Not much else seems to account for the fact that shes panicking that someone is taking you away from her! when thats in the manual. If you raise your wee hedgie right someone else gets the fruits of your labour. Children dont stay. Your mother thinks someone is trying to steal her dog. You arent a dog. You were never hers. And her expectations are weird.

Find people sitting in the edges who look like they dont have anyone to talk to and ask them how they are doing. Fetching drinks for older relatives and asking them about their romance and weddings seems to be a great way to chew up a WHOLE lot of time. Ask about how Great Aunt Enid was proposed to and her wedding youve just killed  minutes minimum. And no one can give you a hard time about it because after all youre being polite to the other guests at the wedding.

Every damn day have you not heard anything yet? You should get a lawyer. Ugh. Also she met a woman she knows in our town who was pissed that when her ex husband died she wasnt acknowledged by his family or left anything even though they were divorced for DECADES because they were still always together not in a romantic sense. Just in an always around one another sense. Well Senga was fucking delighted. Basically OMGZ ME TOOOO!!! and proceeded to tell this woman everything about FILs death his sisters how they are using his money lies how they paid for his funeral and will be trying to get it back from his estate lies how they are trying to keep money for their own children lies how his old will from when DH was a kid he is  in a few weeks said she gets  and his kids get the remaining  each and that is what it should have been because she was always there. Nor forgetting her rage at not being included in the portion of his service talking about his family which mentioned his kids grandkids great grandkids sisters neices nephews. How dare they not mention her. Best not to mention the fact she only ever went to him for money or that she is livid she isnt getting it from him anymore. Also bear in mind she gets more in benefits now no longer getting extra from FIL or her own Mum that I do in wages....I work a hour week.... minimum wage .ph. Aaaaand that she doesnt pay rent etc so her only outgoings are utilities and food. She is FULLY expecting her kids who are looking at somewhere in the region of k to give her multiple thousands of pounds EACH so that she is alright. Fuck off Senga.

When he responds with after work I reply with me too. It usually is enough to politely remind him I do actually have a job.

I am a carseat nazi myself and damn proud too because this could be a life or death decision. Not sure what state youre in but many have laws saying to rear face as long as possibleuntil  or . I suggest you show these things to your FH so he can better understand the physics behind all this. A great resource is The Carseat Lady. Google her. She is a wealth of information. Bottom line though is that you shouldnt have to make a case nor argue with your fmil especially. If you want your kid to only wear purple then damn it she better oblige. Your kid your rules. Sorry youre dealing with this. I know from experience how hard this can be. My stupid mil wanted to put used carseats that she got off craigslist and didnt have a clue the history on or if theyd been in an accident etc. i shut that shit down faster than you can slap a bitch.

She got used to a life of excuses and other people pampering her that a week of living on her own makes her feel like a victim of... something or someone. She is . Her head is alright as far as I know. Her physical condition is abysmal. If met octagenarians that were more physically able than her.  She cant walk the dog for more than  minutes. Especially not when its hot outside.  She cant lift shit. A crate of water bottles is too fucking heavy for her. She cant take out the heavy trash cans. Which was the reason we where there by the way. She claimed to be too weak to roll the trash can the  metres from the shed to the street. She has to take a nap on the couch each and every day. She cant stand too long. She cant work.

I hope all is fine now???I will buy the book online asap like when I am done here SO has a minor degree in psychology and I think he kind of made peace with his FIL and sMIL as you wrote. The only thing is that he endures his sMIL her absurde behavior etc. for the sake of his father who is this weak man. And yes he says his father loves his children just isnt great enough to be a good father. He has excuses all over and he doesnt acknowledge having aproblem with his father.But every time he experiences love and consideration from my parents I know he is awkwardly silent afterwards when he thinks of his father.When we first started dating and my parents did something nice or let him know that they thought of him I felt angry that his own father didnt take as much care of him as I was used to my parents because my SO was so loveable and sososo kindhearted. I could not understand the attitude.I stopped making negative remarks about his father and sMIL after initially ranting when they wronged usmehim again because he told me firmly I have no problems with them. I dont hold any grudge. Dont be mad dont let it get at you. Ignore it we only see them once or twice a year. They have no role in our lives.Yet whenever he got a promotion in his job his father always told him Why do you go to college get a job and work you wil never find a job after college with your weid major he seeks evaluation. He calls his father about every raise he got every accomplishment in life. And in return he is ALWAYS disappointed because his father always finds a way to hurt him.SO refuses therapy because he says he doesnt have a problem with his father or sMIL and people who go to therapists are weak and could solve all their problems themselves if they only work on their own reality and lives.He is the most rational man on earth but in this case he is really stubborn and NOT willing to even try therapy.

Sure I could go to my local Sephora and buy everything on their summer musthaves list... but I wont.Half of the stuff that is on the list is stuff I wont use or already have something similar.However I do know people who will leap at the chance to buy these items because omfg its a musthave and therefore they know theyll love everything already or its a kit or a group of minis selling for like . It looks like a good deal but if you arent going to use the item its wasted money. But its on sale and when is another deal like this going to come up so people leap on it and dont realize that deals like that come around all the time.I mean if I found a Tesla car on Craigslist for k Im snapping that shit up.

You could otherwise have very sensitive information just there for the taking if the penalties werent so harsh for people screwing with your mail. Also people just stuffing crap in your mail box gets in the way of the mailperson doing their job. They cant deliver your mail because the box is full of crap but they neither have the time nor the authority to sort through it to figure out whats junk.

Imagine my shock!!!So in your case did she help you paint your nails? Or do your hair in a certain way?

8036542,0,t1_d4jdeqx,Yes and no. Ive set serious boundaries with her family one of which is I do not acknowledge their existence. and so that phone call never happened but I also no longer interfere with my wifes interactions with her family. a sticking point for us early on I would see them try to hurt her and tried to swoop in like a white knight but she is a big girl and can fight her own battles. We were both busy she baking me going through our DVD collection and making it digital so neither of us were really paying attention to the one sided verbal diarrhea of a conversation. I dont think my wife said more than  words other than hmmm is that so? and the ever popular ahh. It was entertaining to listen to but she is the person we have the best relationship with as she is only  crazy vs the  crazy the rest of the family is and only shows her jealousy every now and then. So my wife puts up with the small amount to be shielded from the rest of the family. this one phone call prevented  others that she would get from SIL and the  text messages she would get from MIL. of varying degrees of extreme crazy. ,JUSTNOMIL,d4jds4d,2,t5_377ps

8107391,0,t3_4q76ax,Can you talk him into therapy? I have some issues in my life with my dad and I started therapy  months ago. I found a psychologist who does CBT and I cant even tell you how much hes helped me.I dont quite know how to explain it but he asks me questions that often lead me to some big realizations about my life and my family. He doesnt tell me these things but he has helped me come to these conclusions on my own.Hes also taught me how to step back from the situation with my family and notice all the patterns we all fall into the roles we all fill. Im the oldest and I was made to be the responsible one and so now as an adult I struggle with still feeling responsible for everyone and everything. Just being able to look at a situation and see so clearly that Im falling back into that pattern has been so helpful in stopping. I no longer take all the responsibility for shit and I now have the tools to point it out to my parents too. It would be healthy for your DH to see someone and work all this out on his own. If you try to force NC for him it wont go well for anyone in this situation. You can only decide for yourself and your kid what level of contact you want but your DH has to work it out for himself. utheepilepticferret is right about remaining neutral. Dont let anyone make you the bad guy. Support your DH and tell him that hes not wrong and has nothing to apologize for with his mother.

8194954,0,t3_4rhpx9,I have a friend who has a relative whose teenage son died.  It was very tragic and heartbreaking for everyone involved.  Even so his mom is a bit of a narcissist.  Its all about her and things have to be done her way.  After he died his mom started a blog about dealing with his loss.  His family are very devout very conservative Christians who belong to a somewhat fundamentalist church.On her blog she actually made a post about how she was happy that her son had died a virgin.  He had a long term girlfriend but evidently they never went all the way or at least as far as she knows they never did.  On this post she was talking about how glad he had saved himself for marriage.After I finished reading and gagging I thought that poor kid is looking down from heaven and is embarrassed that his mom is discussing his sex life or lack thereof on the internet.  My next thought was that I hoped the poor kid did get some before he died.,JUSTNOMIL,d51x6cd,8,t5_377ps

8260104,0,t1_d59v6u8,Basically one night camping with DHs entire family some of SILs friends and DH and my friends we were playing never have I ever with shots. So everybody has  shots in front of them and I had  gone and DH looks at me and says Im sorry babe I gotta. Never have I ever had to boil water to take a bath. I took my last shot with pride and then EVERYONE wanted the details.I told them my mom and dad struggled to make ends meet. My dad had been married once and the last time his ex fucked him was in court AYYY! jk. but seriously. He worked two jobs and child support took most of his money since he had  kids. There were times when I wouldnt see my dad for days because he was either sleeping or working. My mom worked too and her paycheck contributed to most of the bills. One month they were late on their gas payment and the gas and electric got shut off. No more hot water for us. But dad made the best of it he could hed boil water for us to take baths. I remember him being so defeated and upset because he was trying to provide for his family and his psycho ex wife was taking all his money.Later that night she needed to go pee. The place we were camping had bathrooms that were super infested with spiders and she is terrified of spiders. Her husband wouldnt escort her up so she was going to dig a hole behind their camper. I told her Id take her up grabbed a flashlight and started walking with her. I told her how Im afraid of spiders but Im really really terrified of being in the dark. She asked why I came and I said Cause you needed someone to? To kill the spiders? I dunno just to help. Thats what family does.She started crying and saying how she was so wrong about me she thought that because Id never grown up in a trailer and my parents were going to drop  on our venue of choice Id had this nice cushy life and Id never understand her or her brother or what they went through living in poverty. They did struggle but they always had money for bills partially because GMIL Mils mom had always been able to help out and give them money.She apologized for making a false judgement on me I just shrugged it off because I was drunk and didnt care. I told her we were family and she could tell me anything and I hoped I could do the same. She confided in me that she hated getting married so young straight outta high school and having kids so young. She loves her husband but if she could go back and put it on hold she would because there was so much she wanted to do that she couldnt do because of her kids.She begged me not to tell him and I havent which to this day still surprises her that I havent told.After that we became really close.TLDR SIL thought I lived a cushy life because Id never lived in a trailer.

They can hang out on the porch to talk or yall can drop him off over there when he wants to visit her for a few hours. You can go very low contact. You might have to see her because of FIL living there but you dont have to interact with her. Only give bare minimum answers to questions and remember No is a complete sentence. If she asks why then the response is Because I said no and dont elaborate. If she really wants a new car that bad tell her to buy one. If she cant afford it then tell her to get a bus pass and learn the bus schedule. I hope she likes walking to the bus stop. Yall are not responsible to her.

That was just stress from work related crap shitty back stabbing managers and other work drama so yes. I fully believe stress can cause complications. If youre stressed and your blood pressure is constantly shooting up that cant be good for the baby. When Im stressed on a normal non pregnant day I get major digestive problemssorry tmi but diarrhea and stuff. If food is going through me and Im not absorbing nutrients and Im majorly dehydrated I cant imagine that being good for an incredibly intense thing like growing a baby if I were pregnant. Im sure many women can chime in and say they did so and so and their babies were just fine! Well good for them. But Maybe Im weaker than them and cant handle the stress of abuse and growing a healthy baby at the same time.  Also I remember reading some articles where they said stress during pregnancy is correlated with the baby being more prone to depression and other mental illnesses later in life something about cortisol in the blood stream and affecting the development of the fetus or something. Which of course made me even more stressed out because God damn it I feel horribly guilty about that now. But either way my blood is boiling over this story!,JUSTNOMIL,d5oazab,64,t5_377ps

She even now will say stuff like I warned you! when she even thinks theres an issue. The expensive tastes is from FIL who is willing to pay a little more for better quality stuff. The other two? He was molested as a kid and told her. She slapped him. He definitely did lie after that because as an eight year old he was like welp whats the point of being honest?. The hypochondriac thing is coming more into light because shed rarely bring him to a doctor outside of checkups. Our youngest just developed conjunctivitis. We took him to the pediatricans urgent care clinic. On the way to get his eyedrops I mentioned how I didnt think Id ever had conjunctivitis and wondered if he did. He did his mom just let it pass. This is a theme with her. I had to tell her years ago that abuse victims sometimes do seek out validation from medical professionals. Hes been diagnosed with a few illnesses since then and she hasnt questioned it but will try and suggest he do things like eat gluten free or cut out caffeine. Monster liked to tease that I never cooked. That I didnt know how. That I lacked basic skills to feed myself and that my nowhusband had to take care of me.My husband enjoys cooking. Maybe not NOW as much because we have little kids who expect short order cooks no but it was stress relief for him.I worked full time moved to a new job and worked  hour weeks. His hours varied but he bounced through jobs fast. Basically he was home he cooked.Monster is...not a good cook. When we lived with her during the remodel we joked that she had a rotating menu of five things. Pasta tuna casserole roast and mashed potatoes from a frozen kit grilled chicken and baked potatoes my favorite and pork chops.One time she invited BIL over and we all sat down to enjoy the grilled chicken. Only she fucked up and burnt it. Badly. No amount of sauce helped. FIL poked a little fun and she got full on cat butt face. She made a joke about it a few weeks later haha. She couldnt even get store bought marinated chicken right so silly! Ha!Six months later she was criticising my uncle in laws cooking. This is FILs sweet little brother. I made some joke about well at least he didnt make your grilled chicken and she went OFF on me. Voice escalated into a scream in about ten seconds telling me how I can just shut up because I dont cook.Biiiiiiiiiitch.My eyebrows nearly left the gravitational pull of the Earth they shot up so high. This was prior to marriage prior to motherhood and prior to me finding my backbone. I apologized for offending her.I do a good amount of the cooking now since Im home during the week.

My room at my parents is painted the same but is now my moms craft room... so instead my parents refinished the entire basement for when me and children visit... which when we found out about we both thought was strange and were a little freaked out about. I mean they spent thousands of dollars for a space for us for when we visit. Its been  years now and both my husband and I are glad that space is there. It is very helpful when we visit to have our own space so the babies dont wake up everyone. Also we might be using it short term when we move... never thought Id move back in with my parents. So not quite the same... but at first it was strange now we are really grateful.

I hardly believe they think he choked me so hard I actually went unconscious once.

Thing is you have to use consequences you can enforce and which will have an actual impact on the control shes after. The consequence whatever it might be has to cut one of her puppet strings. Thats punishment! And she doesnt get to reattach it so you win.  Your DW will make errors in supporting the consequences that you both agree upon this could take years so be patient and dont expect to fix things just once. You came into this marriage knowing what you had to work with and this is the work. For now youre going to have to work to become the authority your wife turns to. That leave amp cleave stuff is hard when youve learned to protect yourself by playing dead.  Until she changes the way she reacts to her mother you have to make your voice the one she has to listen to. Its going to unbalance the relationship which is bad for everyone. Counseling will help you both go at it in such a way that gives your DW has agency and room to make mistakes and grow into a functioning adult and partner. Right now she has no agency  she just follows orders. So work on getting her to trust you enough to follow yours while she finds better tools to protect herself with in counseling.

I have tried to guide him as best as I can I have read some great advice on this sub but of course I can only do so much.

8896662,0,t1_d7h4m77,So freshman year in college I lived in a room with my roommate G and through a jackandJill bathroom lived A and L. L is the crazy one. L got jealous that A G and I were going to an exercise class together once a week she was invited but declined. L started trying to out me from our friend group by spreading lies. This was fine as they were into frat parties and I was more into... Not getting sloppy drunk. I had made other friends. But I still wanted civility with my roommates. When L saw that I wasnt shattered by being outed from the popular group she amped up her tactics. Shed be in our room alone watching tv when I returned from class to study. When I started locking her out shed pound on the door screaming. She wrote obscenities on our door and window in toothpaste ?. She complained to the RA that Id locked her out to which the RA said tough shit bc she had heard L screaming at me. This is when L went to the dean. Dean told me I should let L in my room. Why?I asked the dean to move her or me and he declined saying that there were no open spots in the freshman dorms and I couldnt be allowed to room with an upperclassman. After that she sent the letter to the dean. I mean the hold she had on people was insane. She would create these elaborate lies about me and other people and no matter how ridiculous they were everyone believed her. I mean this was Trump level lying. Finally another administrator got involved and somewhat saw through her BS. He told us that we were to have no contact with each other beyond what was necessary and that L was permanently banned from my room. L was pissed. I ended up driving  hours home most weekends to get away from her. Im still pissed about it and its been  years. ,JUSTNOMIL,d7h92f8,1,t5_377ps

When I first started researching this stuff it was interesting to discover that its not usually the physically violent abusers you know the ones with the reputation who kill their spouses or children... It is the more sophisticated emotionalcovert abusers who murder. Usually they just snap and everyone who knows them is stunned. That person was so family oriented never raised a hand a pillar of the community blah blah blah... something must have happened that caused them to snap...  Reality is often that someone threatened to expose the real person or leave and destroy their illusions...

9039623,0,t3_542mtx,Im just gonna throw in my two cents. Yes she is YOUR daughter but you proposed to Shelby I assume and that means you want to share you life with her  which means making all decisions together and that doesnt mean she replaces Ashle as mom but Shelby will be continuing to help raise your daughter. So I think she is allowed an opinion about your daughter and then you work together to compromise to make the final decision.Im not going to give an opinion as far as what to do but it doesnt sound like Ashley is so invested in raising your daughter since she tends to dump her off on your mom on her days so its even more important that you and Shelby coparent including order to make sure your daughter has as stable of an upbringing as possible.Sorry this is so rambly but thats just my thoughts on the matter.

So  heres what you do.  You either tell her to shut he utter fuck up as its your wedding and youre damn well not going to be insulted by her on your wedding day. You can have FH do it or you can instruct your photographer to do it. Or you could do what my daughter did to her MIL. DDs MIL wanted a huge family photo of everyone from their side of the family including Son in law stood next to her in her cream dress.  Yes thats right. Cream dress. Light cream.  So light it was white. Didnt want a scene so we took son in law aside and hinted at what he should do if he wasnt happy. It was such a shame  you know  but damn dont you just know it that every photo his MIL wanted unfortunately had him and the members of his family who thought MIL was being a bitch all of them were pulling faces. Subtle ones. It looked like a family photo on . So many stoned faces. Poor MIL didnt get her photo   so sad. Every photo that MIL wanted of her stood between DD and SonIL my daughter maneuvered in front of MIL just at the last second. Happily all of the photos of them together as a couple and all of us as a family worked out juuuuust fine. Terrible luck old chap  maybe she can try and ruin her other childrens wedding but she wasnt ruining my daughters. When DDs MIL decided it was time for her unplanned mother son dance our eldest took the hit and accidentally spilt a glass of coke all over her.

9099039,0,t1_d7tfxbs,Sorry for the belated response.I am not sure exactly because Evileena likes to make plans in her head and not tell anybody about them usually involving money.  The best we can figure after we sold the apartment building and were prepared to pay Evileena back the money she loaned us she probably wanted us to keep it in our account so she wouldnt have to pay income taxes on it.  We think that she wanted us to buy the house for her using the mixed money in the account now remember she told us she didnt want that money so technically it became ours when it went into the account so this is mostly just a delusion of it still being her money on her part and then she thought we would all work on the house together.  At the end we would sell the house and she would expect some of the profit.  But she wasnt clear at all on how much she kept saying It isnt about the money! if anything she would want to take at the end.  Again we just have to speculate but we figure she was just going to wait until an emergency and then use guilt to try to cash in lastminute.  This way she would get to keep using her money to do whatever she wanted  basically buy houses and fix them how SHE wants them to be fixed while using us as cheap labor  while forcing us to pay income taxes on it.There have been some recent developments regarding that money so it seems its time for another post today.,JUSTNOMIL,d85k2x4,2,t5_377ps

9153763,0,t1_d8c6wtv,I think the only thing you can really do at this point is not give her the attention. All those threats shes making about taking you to court the tantrums or getting caught lurking outside your house and going through your mail etc. Its about getting attention from you. She sounds like a very lonely woman but she also sounds like a typical narc with an entitlement complex and doesnt like to be told no. I mean if you dont do what she wants its like youre an actual person right? gasp s She cant be having that.So she needs to know that youre not going to give her what she wants. Thats not just access to your daughter but your time energy and attention. And make sure that her avenues to you like FH friends etc cut her off too. Same goes for her little flying monkeys  dont feed them it only gives her the attention shes looking for even if shes getting it vicariously. If she sends you things document them and just ignore her. If she contacts you dont reply just document them. Keep blocking her fake profiles after documenting it all. If she turns up on your doorstep dont answer just call the police. Dont even talk to her through the door. Setting up a security system of some kind means you can get the evidence you need without having to go out there and take the pics yourself if she does turn up which is a plus. And thats not just so she cant yell at you and try to provoke a reaction getting you out of the house even if you dont speak to her is still some kind of reaction its also so you can protect yourself and your family in case she does escalate to more than loud tantrums outside your house while you wait for the cops to turn up. She probably will up the ante but thats what the police are for. Aside from calling them the only thing you can do is to deny her what she wants interaction with you. And if she just wont quit then you may have to consider moving house so she just wont be able to find you... Some people here have had to do that and while Im sure its not the easiest or cheapest option its ultimately the one that will give you some peace and peace of mind.Oh and if you ever get something in the post from a lawyer who claims to be acting on her behalf make sure theyre legit. Not just that theres a law office by that name but that the specific lawyer actually has been instructed to act on her behalf etc. Some MILsMothers on here have faked lawyers letters like that to try and get their own way. Edit It might also be worth deactivating your FB account and set up a new one start over under a new name and friend only people you trust. If she cant find you on FB then she cant harass you there either. ,JUSTNOMIL,d8cb0es,3,t5_377ps

My neighbor eventually told my husband after the fence between our properties blew down that he only called the police because my mother threatened him my husband works for the Dept. of Corrections but my mother made it sound to this guy like he was an official police officer who could cause serious trouble for neighbor if he didnt do what she wanted ie give up the arrow that almost hit him so he called the police for protection. He was actually not a bad guy. But that isnt necessarily enough even if I could get him to testify on my behalf.

Poor DIL was so humiliated and promising to have a talk with her.Would have loved to have been a fly on the wall during DILs conversation.  If you cant go to the meeting yourself is it vital that a proxy attends or can you skip it obviously if youre just being lazy thats different to having a conflicting appointment or schedule or child sick amp get cliff notes emailed?

9223108,0,t1_d8l236x,Thanks for this! I try really hard to support him at every turn. A few years ago we went full throttle to help his mom. We helped her make a budget she is on welfare I took her shopping weekly and also made her meals so that she could live off something other then frozen hungry man. At the time my husband didnt drive so I also chauffeured her to Doctors appointments. We got her into a program that would get her out of the house a few times a weeklater found out she never went and made up elaborate storied about her day that had never happened. We made a big push to try and change her life. Well one day she called when she wasnt supposed to as per our rules no calls at night I asked her why she called and refused to put husband on the phone. She called me a bitch and husband heard. Well...that was the beginning of the end that led to no contact. Sometimes he knows its okay to hang up the phone but his whole life he has been told that he has to take care of these woman so it is hard for him.

9284323,0,t3_57jikc,No advice but wanted to let you know youre not the only one. We found out I was pregnant at  weeks took a picture of the positive test and my bf texted it to her. I think a day later the picture was on FB with the caption Im gonna be a grandmaaaa or whatever. We have mutual friends so everyone knew it was me. Definitely not ready to announce at the time. I told my bf he does not have a FB and let him know I was upset he told her off. Im not sure if she took it down. I told her a few months ago that I will not be putting up pictures of the baby on FB because I feel a little weird about it and that I would like it if she didnt put any up either. I told her shes welcome to take pictures and text them to her friends or show them to people but I dont want them online. I hope she hasnt forgotten but Ill remind her in a couple of weeks Im due .Two weeks ago I had a baby shower and my sister took pictures to send out with thank you cards. For some reason I thought that giving people hard photographs instead of passing around digital ones would make it harder for them to show up online but nope. She took pictures of the pictures and put them up. I had unfollowed her after she put up a random post Did I mention Im going to be a grandmother in November?!  but a couple of people let me know she had posted the pictures and again I was pissed. Bf is no help. We were going to move in with MIL and family once our lease is up but um nope not anymore. She has no boundaries. Anyway one thing you said stood out to me  shes an oversharer too. She likes to brag show off be the center of attention and its so annoying. ,JUSTNOMIL,d8sustv,3,t5_377ps

They feel like they own you and your child because it has some of their DNA so they want to see them all the time want to parent them want to do whatever you tell them not do with your child. Plus the entitlement of Im their grandparent so IM ALLOWED to do this.Interestingly and slightly depressingly in  of domestic abuse cases in the UK abuse begins or escalates when their partner gets pregnant.

9373485,0,t1_d93ss97, Grits are similar in texture to Cream of Wheat CoW but grits are more useful than CoW CoW you would eat like oatmeal for breakfast. You can do that with grits adding butter and honey to them but Ive never seen anyone do it. Usually grits are a side dish at breakfast you have eggs bacon and grits for instance but they can also be used as part of a bigger dish like shrimp and grits apparently super tasty but I hate shrimp. CoW is just a hot breakfast cereal grits is a pantry staple in the south. Also dont feel weird there are parts of the US where grits arent a thing and people wont know what youre talking about.   I always assumed scones were scones? Its like a biscuit meets a muffin biscuit as in the American biscuit not a cookie. Biscuits and gravy is another Southern US dish. DO NOT Order that outside of the South its very hit and miss made that mistake in New Mexico once..bleck. I dont know what British gravy is the gravy on biscuits amp gravy is sausage gravy and its pretty different from regular gravy here. Regular gravy you take meat drippings and broth and thicken it with flour or cornstarch theres a bit more to it than that but thats the gist and its put over meat amp potatoes. They had gravy like this in Norway. Sausage gravy is made differently...you cook up ground sausage then take it out of the pan but leave all the drippings then you keep the heat on stir in butter til melted whisk in flour thicken things up but whisk constantly so it stays smooth you let that brown up a bit then turn down the heat some whisk in milk slowly and let that thicken up then stir the sausage back in and let it simmer a bit more you want that stuff thick but not too thick.  Most likely youd get half amp half is that single cream? UNLESS you go to the Original Pancake House its a chain its amazing they serve their amazing coffee with heavy cream Double cream?. Many places also have flavored creamer which dont contain any dairy at all and you can always ask for milk if you want it. But cream is half and half more often than not. ,JUSTNOMIL,d945m6h,2,t5_377ps

You actually have the best piece of equipment which is the siphongravel cleaner thing! That makes your life easier. Heres what you do. You hook that bad boy up and you vacuum the bottom of the tank. Its kind of like doing your carpets. Your job is just to get all the fish mess out of there.If youve got sand on the bottom dont disturb it. Youre just kind of waving the siphon around down there and sucking up whats on top of the sand.If youve got gravel on the bottom you can shove the siphon thingy into it a little to get whats caught in the gravel. Fish mess will have settled in between the rocks so you want to get at it but you dont need to disturb it too badly the first go.Now when you do this dont suck more than say a third to half of the water out of the tank the first time. I know that seems like a lot but itll be okay. Once youve got that much out put in enough water conditioner to treat the whole tank. So if its a  gallon tank put in enough for  gallons even if you sucked out  gallons.As you do this try not to let the water coming in stir up any of the rest of the muck in the bottom of the tank. If it happens no big deal but if you can avoid it groovy.Congratulations! You have cleaned a fish tank! With a super messy tank its going to be a few weeks before you get it entirely to rights. And given the current state of the tank if the fish die you did everything you could. It should be okay though.If you end up taking care of this thing long term Ill be glad to help you get an easier setup going. It doesnt sound like they have a filter or pretty much anything.

Im a trained photo editer by trade  I even have Expert Certification in Photoshop  edits should be subtle and what people do to wedding photos is a crime. Or those obnxious baby bump and engagement photos  and dont get me started on fashion photography and glamour photography. Fix red eye but dont start moving body parts around and creating that horrific airbrushed look. If youre doing art thats one thing  but wedding photos should just document toe occasion and be edited for color contrast and subtle lighting changes. I would bet the photographer is not going to be pleased especially if theres a watermark in the photos and now their mark will be associated with crappy editing.PS  if anyone wants to learn Photoshop I HIGHLY recommend Lynda.com.

Hey I have a list of shit youve done but I dont want to talk about each and every little thing on the list and just have you argue about how I am wrong about them. And then lay out exactly what you want from him. Just lay it out there. Tell him that youre scared that he will resent you because his mother is ill and might die. Tell him that you want to be his priority  and that doesnt mean he ditches his sick mother but that he understands that your relationship comes first and that his mother cant treat you like something she scraped off the bottom of her shoe. If you guys are going to be a unit he has to make decisions that take you into account and maybe make those decisions WITH you. He seems to think that he gets to operate as an individual while being in a serious relationship. And that shit just doesnt work.And I will say this figure out what you need from this guy and settle for nothing less. And life is short so him getting his shit together is not something that can take months or years and if he says wait until meanie mama drops dead run for the hills  mean people live longer than you think. And when you figure out what you need DO NOT SETTLE FOR ANYTHING LESS. Seriously a LOT of misery could be avoided if women and some men would look at the way their intended treats them BEFORE they get married and make decisions based on the reality before them instead of the fantasy they have in their heads. ,JUSTNOMIL,d9eva9t,4,t5_377ps

Im pretty sure GG looked at me as her future gestational vessel for her grand babies with the way she spoke!

The entire process takes a lot of time and even if the buyers were paying in cash or rather cause I dont think they can actually PAY in cash without a bank loan it would still be several weeks if not a month my parents settled early it still took .   months before the lawyers signed the paperwork.  A quick google says that the norm is    days for a settlement period.Not to mention that if this all happened and Im not saying it didnt Im just confused because it seems so weird??? surely the police would be after the MIL for fraud  I mean selling somebody elses home is a pretty huge crime.  And it should be fairly easy to prove even with forged signatures one assumes in this case it would require both OP and her partners signatures which does imply either collusion  in which case wow divorce  or double the fraudulent activity and even easier to prove.And on a side note realestate is ridiculous in Australia  even in our country towns houses sell for close if not over a million dollars.

9668572,0,t3_5dgpgm,Unsolicited advise If you have a local Costco then you could get an inexpensive cake from there. You could also call some local restaurants and see if they have a section that they can segregate for a baby shower. We just had one for our coworker during the lunch buffet at El Torito and it worked out beautifully. We had centerpieces and games and all kinds of fun. The staff was more than helpful.  You only need  games to seem full. Standards are Dont say baby or dont cross your legs Word Scramble Gift Bingo Identify the candy that we melted in this diaper Using string or TP how big do you think moms tummy is?As a cute keepsake for her you could print out X cards with a giant letter on them. One for each letter of the alphabet. As people arrive you can ask them to pick a letter and draw or write something related to make a babys first alphabet book. This one is a little more hands on but its a great heartfelt gift. Then you could just slide those cards into a slim photo album and give it to your cousin. ,JUSTNOMIL,da4ur3a,16,t5_377ps

The good news is that its totally reversible especially if you use other spices to season food. My mom had to cut a lot of salt from her diet but her food isnt bland by any chance.

Set up an email address let her know her number is now blocked on his phone and keep it all to email.Then if he cant take looking he doesnt have to. Hell if you feel up to it then if he agrees you deal with any emails. That way you can talk to him about things when he is in the right place to do so.You both have my sympathies when my SOs ex emails I get heart palpitations and throw up.

You are an amazingly strong woman and did everything you could to protect your son and honestly its a true testament to you as a woman and mother that after having such a heinous example of a mother growing up you came out of it a damn fine one.

9739521,0,t1_daden0n,It was quite a terrifying story! The story as I recall it if anyone remembers it plz linkDIL has been married for a while and every time she goes to MILs place she notices that MIL always insists on making up her plate of food or drink. Every time she leaves her MILs place she gets horribly sick Vomiting and the like. She starts to get suspicious so one day she switched her and her husbands plate and glass when MIL wasnt looking hours later DH gets violently ill with the same symptoms. DIL confesses to her husband that she switched the plates and DH gets SUPER pissed and angry at her clearly more upset that he got tainted food than the fact that his mother is clearly trying to poison his wife. DIL takes a sample of the food to the police and I think was starting divorce proceedings at the time of the update. I recall that this was posted on a dear prudie or other advice type post but I cant find the link.I suppose that the thing to remember is that women and even mothers arent any different to anyone else and everyone has the potential to be a horrible piece of work... Just most of us have empathy and recoil in horror at doing the things that these crazy bitches feel are justified to them.,JUSTNOMIL,dadlx91,3,t5_377ps

About   years ago there was a major issue between me and MIL they totally ganged up on me and told hubby a load of bull about how Id behaved and how hurt they were in reality my MIL got the name of my ONE SIBLING wrong repeatedly and casually talked about self harm miscarriage and post natal depression over the dinner table in a restaurant which made me uncomfortable and when Im uncomfortable I struggle with casual converastion. After that I said to DH I wasnt organising anything Id go if we were invited but I wasnt making it happen. That happened once. There was then a huge bust up about a year later and I havent seen or spoken to any of them since apart from FIL who is VLC. I respond if I am contacted directly but that has only happened once in the last  years. I dont feel the need to tell them I no longer want anything to do with them I think it is pretty damn obvious. And honestly they havent asked. I think it is more likely to come up when we start having kids and they arent told.

Its completely understandable and thoroughly to be expected.You just got out of what is quite clearly an abusive and painful relationship and havent had chance to really rebuild yourself before suddenly coming face to face with another relationship that will leave you vulnerable to someone else.For him its not so bad  his reservoir of trust hasnt been drained. But yours is running low and your wary of being trapped again. And so right now your unborn baby is more of a ball and chain than something to be celebrated.You need to voice that to your for want of a better word babydaddy. And you also need to talk to him about the stress you are under from your exinlaws. At the very least he needs to know. Dont prejudge him which I know is hard to do right now but dont let the flavour of the past ruin the meal of tomorrow.Get some wifi cameras and set them up facing your front door and the street outside  theyre relatively cheap on amazon. Set them up or get Mr Babydaddy to set them up.

If they continue or start a fight. End the conversation. You dont have to be aggressive. Just stay calm. This doesnt seem to be a good time to talk.

9901485,0,t3_5h7apd,First off Im so sorry this is happening to you. Its terrible and disgusting. But I might have some insight into this that may help you.My SILs boyfriend is a convicted rapist. The girl he raped was underage. He raped this girl while SIL was pregnant with their baby SIL was  at the time he was almost . The girl he raped wasnt much younger than SIL. DH and I refuse to be around him simply based on the fact that has proven that he is dangerous. This infuriates MIL FIL SIL and basically everyone in the family because theyve somehow managed to blame the rape victim for what he did. Its abhorrent and disgusting. Because I live in a small town and everyone knows everyone Ive been approached by police officers and the man who was in charge of Rapists rehabilitation. Theyve both warned me to stay away from him as they said it wasnt a matter of if it happened again it a matter of when it happened again. He is a danger to women and children. Rapist and SIL will never meet my currently nonexistent children because being a rapist is bad enough and enabling that behavior is just as bad.I know your DH is conflicted about this but you have to protect yourself and your child. MIL will not protect you or your baby. She should not be allowed any access to you because shes proven that she will make an excuse for everything he does. Id be willing to bet that she would not hesitate facilitate an interaction between this man and your child. Please do not allow this to happen.,JUSTNOMIL,day6q12,23,t5_377ps

9905202,0,t3_5h92q4,I think grayrocking is enormously effective if only because it protects you. Its like having a force field around you that muffles noises and bright colors. You absently hmmm people who chat at you and nod absently while going about your business. Unfortunately grayrocking can essentially become enabling. Think of what happened to those husbands weve read about who amiably blunder about immune to and and unaware of what is going on. Their grayrocking has become a lifestyle rather than a behavior to mitigate crazy people when necessary. In addition grayrocking should not have to be your permanent state of being to survive every encounter with a human being. For example I know my MIL becomes a twittery mess when invited to big events a million questions a million suggestions for what to do during the event she will ask where to put garbage before looking for a garbage bin and this has happened when the bin is right next to her so I grayrock her I focus on the other people or what Im doing and really dont pay attention to her except to introduce her to people when necessary. So I think grayrocking is an effective tool but sometimes not the right one depending on the situation. ,JUSTNOMIL,dayo65d,3,t5_377ps

So while everyone else ate steak something my stomach cant deal with and lobster something that kills me my toddler ate cut up meat and my toddler had boob.  I had a pbampJ and ended up sick.Thats pretty much what happened the entire time we were there and we paid her full rent for  and it included food.  So hubo and i started buying our own food and making meals and got her pissed off at us cause hubo was a better cook than she was and although I didnt do the actual cooking helped him out by do this  itll make that taste better.Holy smite... she had at least five separate chopping boards two frying pans  one for vegetarian meals  and more.  She knew about my food allergies and intolerances but only hers and her husbands were important to her.  She tried feeding my toddler eggs before she turned a year old  eggs are bad....

Your SO wants all the advantages of being an adult living in an apartment with a girlfriend but cant cover the responsibilities. And your meddling in the banking stuff likely did set off WWIII.

10068017,0,t3_5jxppi,Hmm OK! Was about to post some frustrating motherfuwch text message interactions but wasnt sure  now it has a place and Ill go post there.  Cool. Seeya in the letters sub! My concern tho is that if people post updates there we will miss them if not subscribed or we subscribe there too and end up with the same volume of traffic as if it was all on JNMIL. If you want to take updates off the main forum   and fair enough but also Im sure we all want to know how shittymilthrowaway is doing?   then why not start a JNMILChat sub so we can drop in and out of there to update people wanting to know how others are doing? I think that would make a much better separation than having members health or other social aspects discussed in the same place as a forum for letters directly to the MILs which doesnt logically mesh for me and means Im more likely to accidentally post in the wrong place never my intention  my own various mod jobs have shown me how tiresome and thankless it can be when it isnt being rewarding! Hope that helps anyway.

Your boyfriend should deal with his sister even when she is texting you. The fact SiL is angry texting you directly smells of a trap.  gtI feel like Im the scapegoat like Im the only terrible person here.This is the fun phase when you are blamed for corrupting her poor sweet innocent boy with your Devil Vagina Magic and your fancy ideas of building a life together. gtMy bf tried to talk to his mom and reason with her and she refused to listen.

10158512,0,t3_5leyb0,BEC works both ways. There is not a scenario in which you can visit correctly. I spent years trying to execute a visit and visit frequency that would make my MIL happy but there was always something wrong. We arrived too late. We arrived at the wrong time of day. We stayed too long rarely we didnt stay long enough. We stayed in a hotel. We stayed with her. We were there too often or not often enough. We waited for her to invite us came exactly when she wanted left exactly when she wanted. Still nothing but CBF the whole time. Then one day in a strange moment she told me I dont really like having people over. I mean I like having seen them but when they show up at my house for some reason I just dont like it. After a while I get over it. And it magically came through to me She wanted to like having us over but she actually didnt. She had an ideal visit in mind but we never lived up to her expectations. Welp thats a problem I cant solve for you lady but I can sure solve it for me! Much easier to accept her complaints about us not visiting than to sit around for days feeling like Im doing absolutely everything wrong. ,JUSTNOMIL,dbvivct,11,t5_377ps

I do know she wont show her ass at the wedding because appearances are everything to her. And heaven forbid her church crew know shes batty. Fun part is she already paid for our wedding for us and I called the photographer to make sure she cant change anything or get her money back and she cant. My father passed away last year and I am NC with my own mother so this was their gift to us.

I said Hey me too! and the nonexistent mystery was solved. Their age gap is scarily identical to our own.Yes she says things like that to the point that Im going bald in my thirties.

Meanwhile my vehicle has the radiator grill literally held together with heavyduty ratchet straps and has a hole in the floorboard that would be really handy to dispose of a baggie of weed through if I ever got pulled over while carrying. But thats fine.She has back problems   True enough except A she blames me for them and B as soon as something starts to help strengthen her back and make the pain go away she drops it like its hot. Also shes refused to even consider the various workfromhome opportunities call centers and the like that Ive tracked down over the years. Shes finishing her book  To me this is the most valid one because as an avid reader I actually believe her book and its outlined sequels has a real chance of going somewhere.

10240330,0,t3_5mkzmo,Your issues sound super similar to mine and DHs. Like you were the side that lives  miles away. So theres that. While my BSIL live right in town with her. I find it hard enough to deal with the woman while shes  states away. I cant imagine being within arms reach. If my BIL doesnt pick up his phone like he didnt on his last anniversaryshe was obviously trying to cock block him she will literally call  times in a row. Then shell leave a message saying if you dont pick up or call back shes coming over in  minutes. You would have thought there was an emergency of some sort but no the woman is just legitimately insane. She had a spare key made when they gave her a key to let their dogs out one weekend they left town. They never wanted her to have one permanently because shell stop by unannounced or go through your things when youre not home.As for your dad maybe he just thinks you should always back up your spouse? I mean thats what most people expect I think. So I wouldnt be too hard on him. Also can you imagine?! He has to actually LIVE with the woman. My FIL was a wonderful man but passed away a few years ago. Even though it was counterproductive and just reinforced the bad behavior he basically gave into every single one of her crazy demands. He would always tell the boys that it was easier to just give her what she wanted than to hear the nagging. As a consequence this woman goes ballistic if anyone dare tells her no. Thats the way she was treated until her boys got married. Luckily they didnt marry spineless jellyfish so we have no problem saying no setting boundaries or standing up to her. My point is maybe your dad treats her with kid gloves because its just easier for him in the end. Edit its worth adding that my awesome SIL sick of all MILs weirdness and constant drop ins literally has taken to leaving adult things out on purpose just to mess with her. We always laugh every time DH and I stay with them because there are so many sexy things in the shower and around the house. ,JUSTNOMIL,dc4srbn,6,t5_377ps

10242089,0,t3_5mmorp,Yes still ongoing continuous work after a NC.  Maybe thats why weaker people would still rather be in contact and take abuse from their abuser.  TV shows and popular culture make it seem like after NC restraining order etc. life is like a yogurt commercial again.Was listening to a psychology podcast earlier.  About how our devices allow more contact and has a detrimental effect on us.  Toxic people will have more ways to get to us.  The positive does not outweigh the negative on this one.  Like the fun sex research you did just before hlsbl was able to get through.Dont get me wrong.  Good for you for using technology to enhance your quality of life.  This phone call happened before the cease and desist order went out.  Maybe to enforce how important a zero tolerance NC is.  hlsbls name on a cheapo landline caller ID was enough to get to DW.  I never liked phones or doorbells.  A way for someone on the outside to disturb your safe indoor space.I will be looking forward to when hlsbl will get her just due.,JUSTNOMIL,dc4zxi3,5,t5_377ps

There is either untreated depression or something else is going on. gtI dont understand why I cant just let it go and be in a casual space with him or am I expecting too much from myself?Because you have gone from a full relationship to casual FwB but with no circuit breaker to move on.

For the life of me I could never understand how calling your spouse or children such vile names or warranting such cruel behavior is ok. None of DHs family is college educated i.e. Psychology or sociology courses this is what raises red flags with me and the fact I wasnt raised by feral animals or even consider counseling.  Im not saying you must be educated to recognize toxic behavior but they consider college or even the mere suggestion of counseling weak. I am a college graduate and also have suggested counseling for his family as a whole to recognize these said behaviors only to be shot down and told that was weak minded.

For your pregnancy keep your schedule to yourself and stress to your FH that any information pertaining to you and your child is under lock and key. Information that your MIL wants needs to be asked from you. Let your doctors nurses and family know what your birth plan is. Make a folderbinder that consists of your birth plan of who is and who isnt allowed into your room. Register as private when you go into labor. Do not let her know of the birthing place youll be at. I ask that you not engage unless you have to. Keep record of all things that happen write every encounter in a book in pen. Document her verbal abuse texts messages.

10321277,0,t1_dcdxv3m,Yeah but thats not what Im talking about.  It seemed that they never bothered to check on their kid or interact with him the entire time he was in the stroller awake and looking around.  If I could have kids Id definitely be a stroller user. I also have a bad back and Ive liked strollers every time Ive babysat.  The whole situation the person described seemed off.  If I were going to an aquarium and my kid was up and awake Id be taking the kid out to go look at stuff and interacting with them.  And Id check that the kids diaper is ok because the kid was awake.   A kid sleeping in the stroller for a long time and then having a leak is a totally different situation.  Also I was talking about the almost year old kid so hopefully there wouldnt be issues from a csection at that point.  I wouldnt blink twice at a little baby in a stroller all day when the parents are going someplace but the story as written seemed like the parents were doing it to avoid the hassle of having a kid.,JUSTNOMIL,dcdz225,7,t5_377ps

I think it all has to do with whether or not folks can have a sexpositive and healthy attitude not age or relative family position. Everybody rocked shared ridiculous stories naughty gifts and too much champagne.  Then the nothing girls and I went clubbing more drinking strippers and finally fries and burgers at  AM. Pretty standard. The weirdest part for me was actually running into my brothers best friend whose sister was a part of the bridal party and the group clubbing and getting him to give up his boxers for my bachelorette scavenger hunt. I dont know I guess I just dont have what it takes to be a cougar because I couldnt think of him as a  year old guy I could only see him as the kid I used to have to open juice boxes for.

10382959,0,t1_dckhihj,If you setting boundaries go in one ear and out the other you arent doing it right. Setting them isnt enough you also have to enforce them. People who push boundaries have gotten practiced at throwing fits and conditioning those around them to go along with it. Thats why you gotta treat them like a toddler. Literally. Explaining in simple terms putting them in time out not being afraid to make a scene extremely important cause they thrive on this and leaving when needed. No one is going to stand up better for you than you and this stuff doesnt get easier or calm down over time. It gets worse. You have to make the effort not worth it for them. Look she has both of those trained. They already know its wrong. Its why they didnt say anything at all at this point with all the creepy stuff she is doing. Another reason youve got to step out of your comfort zone now is so you have the boundaries established and enforced with consequences before baby comes. Shes already pushing the boundaries to condition you. This is a situation where you have to deal with it now or you will have to deal with it later post partum exhausted and in a much more vulnerable state. Trust me on this one. Im speaking from experience. You have every right to be respected. You have every right to your body autonomy. You have every right to enforce your boundaries. And most importantly you have every right to say and enforce the word NO. Only a toxic unhealthy person would be offended or find fault with this.

He even catches himself now most of the time and goes Im being too aggressive Im going to start just listening now. Its been a long journey though. I tried the pretending the emotions werent there for a long time but it didnt really work out very well for me. Ive had more success with what I call the Bene Gesserit method so named because I was inspired by Dune  Ive been able to get really practiced at compartmentalizing my disordered emotions cognitive behavioral therapy helped me a LOT with this. It makes it easier to let myself feel whatever it is and just let it pass rather than fixating and escalating my bad moods. Its not a perfect method but its been the most effective thing Ive tried so far. I hope youre able to find a way that works for you too.

10430662,0,t3_5pctbk,My dad is a fairly normal person with some odd idiosyncrasies!  One of them is his penchant for eating old food and for not paying attention to expiration dates.  When I grab a bowl of cereal at my parents house the first thing I have to do is determine whether there is any decent milk.  They will keep milk weeks past the date and insist its fine.  I just cant with old milk though. Im sure its partly psychological but I cant stand to use it past its date.He will also find weeks old leftovers in the fridge proclaim them to be still good and heat them up for lunch.  Its disgusting.  They have two refrigerators three freezers and cupboards and drawers and a huge pantry all brimming with food.  This is my step dad and evidently he grew up very food deprived when he was small till other family took him in.  I think that caused lifelong issues surrounding food and while I dont at all judge him for that Im wary of what I eat there.Your MIL is clueless about food safety!  Or doesnt care same end result!

10452493,0,t1_dcsv0zi,Good call.She could easily have parasites in her digestive tract some sort of terrible unchecked infection or have cancer throughout her body. Or be Bulimic. Which might explain why no doctor. I was Bulimic for  years in recovery for three and never mentioned the vomiting to a doctor MIL could have an eating disorder of some sort. Ask your DH why she gets a pass for bad behaviour when she wont even see a doctor for her serious chronic illness? She could be breathing all sorts of germs everywhere which may not sicken an adult but a baby with its developing immune system could be a different story. Plus illness is not an excuse for behaving like a shit. It might make you cranky but taking it out on others is shitty behaviour and MIL will pass that on to LO along with her sickness unless prevented. I have chronic pain  hours a day every day. Sometimes its so bad I cant stand it but I remain pleasant and chill with others because my pain is not their fault. Grrr! Seriously MIL needs to see the doctor. Or her doctor should be informed of what is happening. My BFFs mum was generally unwell with some sort of malaise for years. One day she felt some extra stomach pain and went in for an operation to take a look. Doctor opened up her abdomen and then closed her up the poor lady was totally filled with tumours.

10466554,0,t1_dcu1387,Yeah. She used to like me because I think she thought I was a doormat because Im a pretty quietintroverted person but also because I think she likes that Im educated and so by extension she thinks it makes her look good that the son she raised was able to land someone like me I dont think that! But I think she does... and I read that on a wordpress website on narcissistic MILs and emotional incest with their sons and it fit perfectly. She took two days off to prepare for my PhD convocation doing what? Im still not sure and after my defence when DH was telling her about how well my exit seminar went like a presentation you give on your research to a wide audience before going in to the actualexam she asked why didnt you tell me about it?. I said I only wanted DH to come because its a stressful thing but I wanted his support and for him to see how it was and she said well Id have come anyways. So I think at the start she liked me because it was another thing to brag about to her coworkers and friends so she could feel like such a successful mother she even used my education to put down SIL in front of guests and made comments about how I was better than SIL in front of her and other guests but when she realized we were getting married and DH didnt just listen to whatever she said to placate her and after all these fights after the engagement where we didnt give in she hates me now haha The cleavage thing is interesting because I think it was just SIL trying to suck up and tell her how sexy she was in a creepy.

All I did was love their son but was never good enough to do so. Yesterday I was at his parents house visiting for bills my partner still has in his dads name and my car has a bit of an issue at the moment and his dad is a mechanic. She said things to me that actually made me think she understood where Im coming from in terms of how I was brought up and that the family theyre used to having is smothering to me. And that she feels bad when she does things and wants me to actually tell her that i want her there before she will do anything... nek minute comes over without asking  My partner is fine although he does have a few anger issues but never to me always to video games and stuff. He says therapy doesnt work for him as hes been before but only to a couple of sessions. Ive been talking to him about it a fair bit but tbh its like talking to a brick wall. I personally blame the culture difference as theyre African and that theyre used to operating like that and I did move here I guess so Ill just have to learn to deal with it. Will come to a time where Ill just snap. Theres been times where Ive felt so horrifically lonely because my whole life is km away and I just want to go back..... atm my partner is the only one I have really. I have a few friends but theyre relatively new much younger than I am so nothing but go out drinking and smoking... so theres no real interactionconnection there.

10506411,0,t1_dcyku5f,I actually find your response here more disturbing than your post your post reads like someone spiralling out of control and desperately clawing out for help. A episode of extreme panic. What set you off?  What triggered this outburst?And by the way outbursts of desperation followed by periods of calm where you repair the damage  thats also classic PTSD and depression. You need to really discuss this with your therapist. Im not sure how often you are seeing your therapist but you need to be going regularly and often until you can stabilise your emotions. Im glad your husband is trying to help you but your problems can only be fixed from within by you. Odious actions really only tapped in to a lot of unresolved issues and thoughts you have.I have to tell you after I posted last night I went back and read your post history and the one salient detail I take from it is that you havent really addressed your upbringing yet. Being in control  having your voice heard  is supremely important to you but youre not sure how to react when you meet someone who tramples on your sense of self. You work yourself into a pit in some strange attempt to prove that you are a worthwhile and you let Odious get to you because somewhere part of you thinks you are not. It cant continue. You need to address all this with your therapist asap.,JUSTNOMIL,dcz0hct,32,t5_377ps

10540367,0,t1_dd2ro12,Okay.  Then take a step back for a few days.  Just table it tell him that youre tabling it but that you want to revisit it soon.  I agree that divorce is not necessarily the answer especially since youre right in the thick of the storm.  But at some point you are going to have to sit down and talk to him about this for your own peace of mind. Since he is looking for a counselor I suggest going on and looking for one too but one that isnt connected to that pastor who is obviously biased.  You can ask the counselor to meet with you both separately a few times and then you can talk to him or her about all of this and ask that she broach the subject with your husband.  Then it would be coming from a thirdparty whom he feels safe with rather than an anonymous stranger on Reddit.  But in the interim do yourself a huge favor and tell him its not okay for him to talk about your marriage issues with his parents.  He has to support you on this to them.  If they ask he needs to be able to just tell them that its between the two of you.  I still firmly believe you should not accept anything his mother has bought for your baby because it is full of her Grief and will always be.  And I believe she has to at least deal with that before she is part of your babys life.  Give yourself a few more days maybe even the work week and recharge your emotional batteries.  When youre ready maybe go somewhere public like a restaurant and talk about counseling.  The sooner that happens the better. Back to Grief...no matter what else she is your MIL is locked in the sadnessdenial stage of grief. I promise she has not let anyone else grieve with her.  Even in your first post you consistently talked about the loss of her daughter not your DHs sister or FILs daughter.  This has been her Grief since day one.  Your FIL is being passiveaggressive in his actions over this and that signifies he is likely harboring some anger of his own and as his grief has been progressing unchecked I would say hes likely in the anger phase.  You will become his SG if things continue in this way.  Neither of them will move forward from the roles they have assigned themselves and they will both be eaten alive by grief and anger and eventually bitterness.  They are drowning in Grief and they will take your husband with them if he doesnt cut the cord.  It is very hard to do that especially with people you love but you cant drown yourself to keep other people afloat.  He needs to get to shore and get help from people with better resources and let them save his parents.  And he has to do that to protect you and your baby and your future.  ,JUSTNOMIL,dd2v8yj,3,t5_377ps

Things are not as they used to be when I graduated from high school a young person could get a factory job buy a home within five years or so and having both parents working was still optional. That part was just starting to change.  If you went to college it was affordable and a degree all but guaranteed a cushy life.  People got jobs and stayed in the area in which they had been raised and where generations of family continued to live. The world has changed along with the economy and young people have had to adapt.  Many are saddled with enormous student debt and have a difficult time finding a job in their field or any field with the possible exception of the STEM careers including medical that pays enough to support them while paying back their loans.  Yay!!!!!  for your husband for finding this amazing job!  Instead of negating what he tells them his parents should be relieved and also busting their buttons a bit because he is a success story. This is how I feel about Son One who has managed to secure increasingly lucrative and responsible positions in his field.

The only exception is with a court order remanding that person to the care facility due to criminal charges OR a court order declaring the patient incompetent allowing the patients guardians to place them into the facility. The place cant keep you if your behavior is just concerning but I think if they have legit reason to think you are an immediate credible threat to yourself or others they have legal ways to extend the hold.I hate these rules.

10598771,0,t1_dd8uedn,gtI want her to just admit she hurt us as well.Sadly the probability of her admitting fault is likely too small to measure.  That you want this is understandable.  However such an action is opposite from choices shes made again amp again.  The most recent opportunity is the joint session with the counselor.  She had the chance and ignored it.  When individuals get so far into pathology theyre invested the likelihood of change pretty much disappears cause shed have to admit that her behavior over decades is wrong rather than just in this one instance.  You want her to change.  Im suggesting accepting her as who she actually is amp FIL as an enabler.  Never say never miracles happen.  The probability of them living the rest of their days as they are is something in the high  range.  Realistically theyll continue to make the same choices for the rest of their lives.  You amp DH get to decide your level of interaction.  Thats likely to be easier if you accept them as the flawed damaged personalities they really are.  Please concentrate on making your lives what you want them to be.  Thats a big enough challenge without expecting them to come around.  If they do its lagniappe.  ,JUSTNOMIL,dd96k20,3,t5_377ps

Worst fucking backseat driver.I fuckin glanced at my side mirror to check for car coming and over my shoulder  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh... bitch i gotta check to change lanes. Nope. Never again. Did drivers ed much more comfortable with relaxed driving instructor. Eta very first lesson. I wanted to go to a parking lot or.something and practice but no she insists i start on the road oh its nothing you can do it!. Theres this turn where you turn right then literally immediately is the road she wanted on the left so i had to turn there she starts yelling TURN TURN TURN TURN scares the shit out of me i go into the telephone pole. Yup. Awesome. I mean she was more concerned I was okay over the car but my first lesson was an accident cause she couldnt chill thefuck out and let me do it.Eta another not a lesson had my full and had been driving a year  i was at a two way stop and there was nothing coming so i went to go when she starts yelling STOP STOP THERES A CAR STOP!! so i slam on my breaks and look.. to see a car literally just turned out of the Tim Hortons onto the road i had so fucking much time and space to go if I had gone when i went to. I had noticed that car but as it was still in the tims parking lot it wasnt a freakin issue!!  But nope i stopped and waited. Then she harped on and on about how dangerous that was.

10710997,0,t1_ddk7wxf,I have a mini dachshund. lbs of ferociousness or she was when she was younger. Her bark was enough to scare people or get them talking. Its big and deep. On walks I would hear people say I think theres a big dog up ahead. Then as soon as we rounded the corner theyd bust out laughing. However she has had back problems. Many if not most dachshunds end up with them. If you have stairs I would recommend NOT getting a dachshund. A short stint at an apartment with stairs ruined my dogs back.Doberman dogs are intimidating and loud and very goofy and loveable.If you go this route I would highly recommend a certified trainer.

10715579,0,t3_5t9gvy,Okay Im going to go against the grain here and say that absolutely in a bad fitting swim suit my JJs can go their own ways. Theyre bouyant slippery and I prefer swimsuits that dont have necklines that my victorian grandma would be proud of. That said its never in a way thats very attractive and its either in a minor way that I miss the suit slipped down an inch or two you can see more sideboob than planned or its in a big way that I DEFINITELY KNOW ABOUT e.g. the whole damn thing is going south and the lady parts are free wheeling. The first thing to do is to let your husband into this. The reason why you want to loop him in is a this appears to be directed at him or somehow involves him. He needs to know that someone is targeting him in a sexual way. And b two heads are usually better than one and having extra eyes is helpful. Something like Honey I need to speak with you. Last week when we went over to your mom and dads house something really disturbing happened. In the hottub you and FIL were relaxing and had your eyes closed. MIL exposed herself very deliberately didnt cover herself up when I opened my eyes and she was looking directly at you. I put my head in the water and when I came back up she was putting herself away but shed been sat like that for a while. I dont know why but this is not the first time this has happened. examples It made me feel so uncomfortable and weirded out I want to believe this is an accidental thing or that she was confused so can you help me to look out for stuff like this? Being extra observant when it comes to hottubbing or swimmingthat kind of thing? In the future when it happens call it out but in a way thats about how inappropriate it is. Your tone should always be matter of fact and as if shes a toddler who insists on taking her clothes off in public husband should also push this angle as well. Dont pull her aside or let her know discretely say it loud and proud in front of all and sundry  FIL relatives family friends. You cant shame her on a personal level but you and your husband can make other peoples reactions her problem.  Wow MIL pull your dress up! Youre exposing yourself around your son. Mom thats disgusting. I dont want to see your butt. leave room.  MIL youre not wearing underwear and we can see everything. Maybe you should go put some underwear on.  Mom youre showing me everything. The only person I want to see that on is my girlfriend not my mom.  MIL your breasts are on show. I think that your son would rather not look at those.  MIL this is the third time youve managed to expose yourself to me and your son. Is everything okay? Are you feeling alright? Its quite weird to be doing this.  MIL you forgot underwear again today. Are you forgetting things a lot? Maybe you should see your doctor about that  I heard its not a good sign for you to keep forgetting basic things like underwear. ,JUSTNOMIL,ddl8do5,70,t5_377ps

I have definitely had a brother shaving at the sink while I was showering behind the curtain.

His form of dwarfism is very obviously limiting  all bassets are dwarfs but some are more functional than others if you get my drift. Its hard to tell if he has the usual hip and back problems because honestly his ability to move is so hampered. He has fatty cysts everywhere. His wee drags on the ground. He has issues commonly associated with a depressed immune system skin and stomach issues. Me and Polly have had a few words about this she agrees with you that a wellbred dog is far healthier than a mutt on the street. After all Mr Basset was IMPORTED from FRANCE! HE is a retired STUD! His parents and offspring have RIBBONS!Im apparently an idiot because I keep pointing out PUREBRED  WELLBRED and papers and ribbons mean absolute cock. I am honestly a bit horrified that Mr Basset ever reproduced. You could probably kick the next hundred mutts you saw on the street and not find one as unhealthy as Mr Basset. We returned Mr Basset with a few pointed comments and firmed up our spines. But instead of their next Mexico trip Crackers Polly and the Husband decided to buy themselves a brand new Holiday Trailer. For Glamping! This has provided us with a lot of laughs because no matter how glamorous camping is not a  star resort teeming with helpful staff looking to make tip money much to Pollys disappointment. ,JUSTNOMIL,ddspwzw,2,t5_377ps

He used to tell me that she would only be upset in the beginning but that she would love me once we were married and she got to know me. When I first met FMIL I was introduced as a friend and she was polite but somewhat distant because she was having her own pity party about recently being told again by both of her adult children that she could not live with them. The second time I met her was as his girlfriend she was nicer that time but FSIL and FH were present at all times and would have jumped on her if she had been anything but nice. The third meeting is when she came to stay with us for what she had said would be  weeks but turned into  months... thats where the crazy started.

Shes basically the mom of our friends the rest of us are perpetually single so shes incredibly responsible. Hopefully she sees this isnt healthy. I said as much I just dont want her to break up with him and for her to think I somehow planted the seed that ruined their relationship ya know?

10928709,0,t1_de75y5k,I dont see BIL leaving he is GC and he may be fuming more often recently but its not going to be enough to squash his belief of Mother just wants what is best. Not only that but hes a bit annoying because hes socially stunted and unlike SO he isnt attempting to follow his more socially adept workchurch acquaintances because Her Lordliness has him convinced that as a Christian he must not condone worldly behavior or some other shit like that. As for SIL shes one tough cookie and extremely well socialized compared to her brothers but I am definitely worried about her because she is getting to the point where she is growing up learning about the world and SO is the only one in the house who understands that she isnt a baby is too old to be treated like Her Innocence Must Be Protected At All Costs and is in fact already learning things from her many friendssuch as how to circumvent the extremely limited internet access among other things. Ive been thinking about slipping her an old ipod touch in some kind of secret compartment in a gift so that she can still get in touch with us and do her own research... Grandma knows about it because I had to ask her for her phone number in order to get SOs parents to let him come down. Also because I asked last year and they said no and of course I was very upset and told her about it to which she responded Oh wow. How old is he? My parents were like that too. Extremely micromanaging. shakes head. I dont know if her parents were narcs but shes always been very subdued nonconfrontational has ended up stuck in abusive relationships to the point where she gave up on love and marriage etc. I can see how shes been affected and I wonder if confronting those things may help her as well.

10933983,0,t3_5vnrjk,Nuh uh!!! My instinct when nursing a baby is to cradle them and not let go lol even when half asleep. In the early days home with Kiddo I fell asleep after trying to calm a grumpy colicky newborn all night long and he finally took a little nap attached to the boob. Well Hubs got up and heard Kiddo start to fuss so he bent down to pick him up to take him down and make him a bottle of my saved milk and I apparently tightened my cradle grip and kicked him in the face. I woke up to him screaming he had a wheeler wreck as a kid and his two front teeth are fake that I knocked his teeth out and saw blood from his busted lip on the bed and started crying which made Kiddo cry and made me start leaking everywhere! Thankfully his teeth were fine we cleaned up the bloody lip and changed the sheets and my shirt and we all decided to go back to bed. It was traumatizing then but hilarious now!! My MIL actually decided to reach over and massage my boob while I was feeding Kiddo to help get it flowing because hes hungry and youre not doing it right I elbowed her right in her implants.

Set up a string on guardians for your children with a specific note that says due to the abuse your wife suffered under her parents hands they are not to receive guardianship under any circumstances nor are they to have visitation rights of any kind in the event of your passing.

11035139,0,t1_deipwsl,The stated reason that FIL gives for them coming that weekend is that the company that he and DHs uncle runs is folding and FIL is going to have to get a job with another company and is worried about being able to get time off to come and see their son. I can understand that they miss DH and that they want to see him I can even understand that FIL is in a hurry to get down here just in case he does have to get other work but the issue for me is that there are weekends that exist before and after that weekend. FIL has apologised apparently for it being the worst weekend to come see us but the damage has kinda been done and they have decided to do it anyway. I am empathetic to their issues and I want to support them seeing their son but they dont make it easy. EditJust wanted to say that DH usually has a great spine and has put his foot down with them before and in this case. He let his dad know that if they had decided that this was what they wanted to do then he couldnt stop them but that we wouldnt be able to hang out and that he has no intention of showing them around because we have no time to do so. ,JUSTNOMIL,deit3p7,5,t5_377ps

What a horrible disgusting person to hurt you like that. Im sorry. It just really angers me when I know other people have been treated so badly for zero reason. Interestingly my mother is a walking contradiction. She loves to tell everyone about how hateful and abusive he was. All the time. She rants and raves about it to anyone who will listen. But she will not admit that she knew about it. Because of she admits that people will ask her why the fuck did she allow it? But she does love the attention she gets for lamenting about how abusive he was. My mothers history is also the exact same. She fails to remember that she was perfectly happy to have zero interests other than Prada handbags and trips to Italy. She only left when he started on her. And it was severe I know it was she was right to leave. But why couldnt she have protected me? And she caused me to have a nervous breakdown during my first year at uni because of her telling me everything he was doing at the early hours. I had to come home. I was a wreck. And he told her to kick me out. So she did. Just told me perhaps its best if you leave What the fuck. Why do these people even have kids if they dont give a shit?

Even I felt slightly sexually harassed by proxy with the way he was talking about it.Why are you so interested in the sex your kids are having?

Tell her you have to go and hang up. Put her calls on Do Not Disturb or just turn your phones off if youre doing something. She doesnt need to come see you guys regardless of who is seeing who when that find of fairness is a ludicrous demand she doesnt come stay with you and she sure as hell doesnt move in with you because then shell never leave.

11149221,0,t3_5z283s,Firstly Im so sorry this happened to you. Even though you didnt know you were pregnant until you miscarried and didnt necessarily want to be pregnant it must have been awful to go through that. Youll always wonder what if and what would he be like but I do think that was a little cruel of your doctor and maybe a little unprofessional to actually tell you what could have been. Secondly your grandmother ? is a shebeast from hell who deserves nothing but pain. Who the fuck cares if she never had a miscarriage? Like her uterus dictates all the uteruses in the family so obviously because shes never had one no one else could have. Im sorry that she said what she did and wasnt there to support you. It may be two years to late but I want to tell you that there is nothing to blame yourself for and that your allowed to be sad sometimes and to wonder what if. That you went through a serious emotional and Im guessing physical trauma and that you have every right to work through that as you see fit.

Fair has nothing to do with a great deal of what happens in the world and instead of wallowing in it I could use that energy to help fix some of the unfairness out there.I do recognize this is the emotional equivalent of Eat your brussel sprouts there are kids going hungry in Africa.,JUSTNOMIL,dewxbc6,1,t5_377ps

If its far enough away you can get deposits back and just explain to people that due to some family drama youve decided youd be happier eloping.

MIL worked full time while her kids were small. MIL sent her kids away in the summer for months at a time. MIL let her mom take her kids on the weekend when she had time off. MIL paid her mom to watch her kids but then still let her mom do things she was uncomfortable with like hitting them with wooden spoons. I think the only way MIL dealt with it was by saying Oh well! I will just get to do these things with my grandkids so I guess its okay if I let my mom do whatever with my kids!I dont just let her steam roll me to get what she wants.

11213308,0,t1_df2ykbx,I am hoping that so will come with me.  So here is the kicker I was going to tell so I was going to move out last March but right before I was ready to make the move control hog was diagnosed with stage  ovarian cancer.  I couldnt bring myself to make such a significant move when our family and company went to crises mode.  That has made this year even harder.  Control hog was in the hospital for about  straight months.  That time period was the happiest time for me.  It was like a normal family.  Control hog is in remission now.  As she gets stronger her behavior gets worse.  At minimum so will go back and forth. Cancer will eventually come back.  I hate to feel this much hatred and resentment towards anyone but I married my husband not control hog.  I feel like I have to divorce the hog.  So understands and just wants me to be happy and healthy.  I wont come between the little time he has left to be with his mom.  She cant live alone.  She has made it very clear that I am the problem.  To keep the drama to a minimum I will move out and when she dies I will move back in. My biological daughter will move with me. This family is seriously dysfunctional and I have to leave. Soon.  The lights and springs are just the tip of the sword!  I could go on an on about how she sabotaged her own company to make me look like I cant do my job.   I may have to leave the company too if life does not become manageable after moving. Since she is the owner and I am the ops manager she is technically my boss and I will still be under her wickedness.  Time will tell.  But when I move I am giving myself a raise just for putting up with her ass.  I hate to come home when I know she is awake.  I stay confined to a bedroom to avoid her. I make it a point to avoid going into the kitchen or cook because I know she will come tell me how to do it her way.  My kid refuses to do her chores when control hog is around. The hog hovers and nit pics everything and has the ability to make us feel incapable incompetent and inadequate with just a few words.  This is not living. This is surviving.  ,JUSTNOMIL,df30kdd,37,t5_377ps

He would always come home when I called him though which was really neat as he was the first cat I had that would do that. So Im coming home from the  when I see a kid a couple houses down from mine with what appears to be my cat in his hands taking him in his house. I was an inch away from snatching that cat out of his hands but I wasnt  sure so I temepered myself and went home and called for my cat. Within a minute or so my cat came jumping over the fence so I think they just had a very similar cat.

11270205,0,t3_60uur9,The only solution as I can see it is moving out until your husband is transferred. Can you stay with a relative or a friend even if that means traveling some distance? ampnbspFriend you have a DH problem as well as a MIL problem. Yeah you live in her home and some degree of politeness is good but DH refuses to see that politeness only works two ways. gt I have talked to my hubby about this and he says I am being ridiculous and that his mom has to see her grandson.Dont be fucking obtuse DH. This isnt about physically seeing her grandson as much as making demands about her grandson interrupting bath times wanting to know where you and he are at all times wanting to be a part of everything you do etc. Your husband isnt a bad guy Im sure of it. Just one that needs to see the toll this is taking on you. Unfortunately the only triedandtrue method I know to make someone understand this is too much and I cant live like this is leaving. Not leaving the marriage but that house. ampnbspHis transfer is in August. Can you really take another five months in that house OP?

The last few Romagnola bulls we rented were really really tame. Part of that was regular handling but theyre way less jumpy than the beefalo. Well unfair beefalo are more jumpy than your average cow but theyre entertaining! And they have a lot of perks like easier births greater tolerance for a larger range of temperatures willingness to eat scrub brush that regular cattle turn up their noses at... basically better survivalists. The cost is the lessened domestication. The meats healthier though. Bit gamier leaner meat. Nom nom nom.,JUSTNOMIL,dfc4lag,1,t5_377ps

11295939,0,t1_dfcd9so,Thats scary to be expected to be financially irresponsible for the sake of appearances and a community that doesnt uphold their part of the bargain for giving.

11297197,0,t1_dfcdmi2,I dont want to say anything bad because peoples financial issues are their private ones. I was always taught if possible to have savings. Even a little bit. I saved I had a piggybank.SO had no money. Their background wasnt poor but times were difficult and nobody maybe except the mob and shady businessmen had money. So they had no savings. Overall I would say both in our current country and SOs country theres a big emphasis on living rich while actually earning little to really be rich. Eg buy an iPhone although it costs you a month or twos salary. So financial irresponsibility is kind of normal there lots of places where to get money for computers etc. SO has even told me how normal it isused to be that to get money for foodtravelnice stuff people would pawn away their expensive belongings and later go and buy them out with interest. I suspect many people there dont have savings for incomes are really low. So they borrow a lot  from friends from banks from relatives. But people also go under with such stuff and MIL and FIL can barely keep themselves afloat without the loans so with the loans it can be really difficult to live.You say its scary to be expected to be financially irresponsible? Just some time ago a relative asked another relative to take out a loan for almost K dollars. Thats.... like  years worth of said persons salary every month counted in. THATs how relations there can work and many people actually follow these requests. ,JUSTNOMIL,dfciqto,2,t5_377ps

11311656,0,t1_dfdrm2j,I used to get this shit said to me a lot during my life. Now I will admit my mental health issues do cause me to panic and overreact to certain things. However its also important to note that the reason I panic so much and get upset about little things is because I lived with a narc parent and I was blamed for every single little thing that happened. I catastrophise most things because I was terrified as a kid and teenager. No matter what I did it was always youre being dramatic when I wasnt. I dont know half the time what my reaction should be to things. So I tend to go worst case scenario. Pneumonia however is something to flip your shit over. What the fuck. I had a sore throat last week so I havent been to see my nana whos had open heart surgery because I was terrified of giving her something! Why would you think it was a good idea to be sick around a toddler?! Even if it was just a bad cold! You just wouldnt! Then again she wanted to stay she wanted everything to go the way she wanted it so I guess she didnt give a shit. ,JUSTNOMIL,dfe5q1c,5,t5_377ps

The problem with borderline people is that they alternate between treating you like youre amazing and the worst person in the world. You go back hoping for the good aspects of the relationship to become the normal.That doesnt happen.

So basically if someone hasnt been recently vaccinated for something that spreads easily and is dangerous to children they dont get to be in the same building.I cant get the flu shot because I have a bad reaction and get super sick. Like worse than the flu sick. So I just take my chances every year and so far so good. If someone needed me to get the flu shot Id just not go near the baby or parents so they cant carry it. Its not malicious itll make me too sick. So this way everyone is protected. People who refuse to get the vaccines and then go near the baby or parents is putting them very much at risk.Its always ideal to listen to the doctors about which vaccines to get because theyll know whats flaring up and whats dangerous. If doc says MMR get MMR! It does vary by region thoughEdit TLDR children need herd immunity until they can get the vaccines themselves plus some rambling,JUSTNOMIL,dflynet,42,t5_377ps

11384859,0,t3_62gqo0,Fellow queer here. If a partner wants support while coming out of the closet its a good idea to give it since the whole closet experience is so shitty.However group coming out is not usually a great idea. Id say come out to SIL first then brother then parents because having witnesses tends to increase reactive behavior. It might not be bad to have a counselor on hand or a neutral third party to help with any MIL related meltdowns.Also Id have it in a public place like a quiet corner of a restaurant to avoid screaming meltdowns unless shes the sort who does not care about her public image.If you want your SO to come out of the closet and have been pushing for them to do so then its totally fair for you to be there when it happens.Oh and I also support drugging yourself to the gills with Xanax or whatever works for you and having some wine as well and getting an uber home. He can also send a card with a thoughtful message where he comes out and invite them to dinner to talk about it later so he does not have to be face to face with them when they get the news if he expects her to react poorly.,JUSTNOMIL,dfmgdd2,101,t5_377ps

11396261,0,t1_dfnohvc,Dont get me wrong...I love the man to itty bitty sticky pieces...But holy shit. Growing up CC pretty much did everything for him. Now as an adult a lot of that reflects in an inability to make decisions and a tendency to overthink. A trend Ive seen especially with wedding planning is that he never has an opinion until the decision is made. For example with the colors. Wed originally thought wed have our wedding in December but October is the best month here for weather...And its the best month for flowers at our venue they have a garden that blooms in seasonal rotation. So October. I kept the burgundy red changed slightly to marsala later on and simply changed the gold to champagne from our original colors. I let the bridesmaids select the color they wanted to wear and got plum. DF didnt like the red and purple because they look like old people or funeral colors and gold reminded him of Donald Trump. When I asked him what colors hed prefer he couldnt tell me. Later he said he would have picked silver and bright blue.Literally EVERYTHING hes fought me on. Ive asked his opinion and its always as long as we get married Im cool!

11439121,0,t3_63703m,Back in the day when scientists did it better than nature it was widely believed that formula was better than anything a human being could produce for its offspring could ever provide epic eye roll. Formula was a perfect balance of everything a child could ever ask for. I breastfed back in the late s and let my children wean themselves. I got so many comments about how gross it was to let a child breastfeed after the age of one. My mother was embarrassed that I breastfed and gave me a hard time after each child was  months old that they werent weaned or potty trained. She actually spent the first week of two weeks when she came to see DD for the first time trying to get her to take a pacifier. Believe me I tried. I had every iteration of pacifier available but DD who had GE reflux until about  months old and seemed like she threw up almost everything she ate was breastfeeding every hour hour and a half and got as much sucking as a kid could want didnt want any of them. I finally yelled at her to stop. Yeah she always knew better than my hyper researched self.A couple of friends didnt even try to breastfeed because their mothers physician told their mothers when their mother attempted breastfeeding that they were starving their children because they tested the breastmilk a couple of squirts during the first week and it was not formula perfect. Those of you who know the research know this isnt true. The misinformation and prejudice was thick. This is what the MILs of today dealt with as new mothers. If they are the sort of people who do not grow and learn then this is what they still believe and use to justify their poor choices.

Maybe the harshness of those words will open his eyes. I know Im coming down kinda hard on him but i know  what it is to be with someone who hurts you constantly and you stay becasue you love him so much that living without him seems unbearable its Hell.

Three was under  so about what you pay now but you dont come home to a trashed home and the right daycare will make you feel secure leaving your kid there. If your market rent is  or more Im guessing daycare costs are similar. Our market rent for our place is around the same.My MIL watched my kid for free for  months.

At restaurants well usually add like  on top of their tip from us big spender lol if someone is being particularly awful. We joke about it being our donation to the Civilized Diners Charity. Its a grassroots campaign of just us where when we see a waiter or waitress being abused we give them money because we spend  on stupid shit all the time and this is something that might actually brighten someones day a little. Sometimes well quietly mention it to the server like Im so sorry. The funny thing is all of them immediately know exactly what were talking about. If its not a tipping place I just try to be really kind and I think the same thing. Even when theyre being kind of shitty I just assume that some other asshole probably ruined their day. Sometimes theyre just jerks though lol.If Im on my own Im right there being that person lol. And then theres guys like the dude banging his plate with his fork yelling Hey! Hey! You! and all my What the fuck? comes out regardless of where I am. I also take a frankly hateful glee in purposely leaving huge tips on the rare occasions I go out with Hagatha grandma and when she always comments on it I just say They earned every cent. Petty yes but Ill stop when she stops being rude to them.I dont always go for the person who is being an asshole because some of them frankly look like theyre about half a smartass response away from ending up on YouTube screamhurling trays and apple pies on a McDonalds counter. I just try to be as kind as I can in the aftermath. Ugh I still get shivers about the time I had to play nice out at a work party. It was awful. They werent abusive just extremely obnoxious. I think I actually tipped the full amount of my bill which Ive never done before or since. Edit They have to cross over into actual abuse or tantruming before I laugh or say something though.

Even if the guest isnt BEC or boundary stomping the entire time it is a very tiring time where you are adjusting and bonding with your new baby. You should not have to play hostess in addition to new mommy. Plus having another person there will detract from or eliminate the intimacy of the experience.

11578924,0,t3_655bxq,Been married twice. First marriage worst MIL ever. So based on that Heres my unsolicited  cents worth. First of all weddings are overrated. Not worth the ridiculous pricing out there. Makes me sick how much we and my poor parents spent on our weddings. It was fun but the price was stooooopid. Secondly you are marrying him AND his family. I cant blame him for loving his momAnd wanting to please her. Its common. You need to think yourself do I really want to deal with this woman for the rest of my life? Lots of holidays vacations dinners etc. IF you have kids she will be a nightmare believe me! Experience! so you have to ask yourself if you love your fianc enough to realistically deal with his mother for a very long time. If the answer is no you cannot tolerate her it is time to go. It is really not fair to ask someone not to hang with their parents. Even if his parents are jacked up theyre still HIS parents and he sounds like a real mamas boy. So my advice is if you can tolerate her for the foreseeable future just elope the two of you. Take the parents off the table. If you cant tolerate her and your fianc will never learn or leave. WALK. Now. Breaking up is hard to do but I believe there is a song that says all the broken hearts in the world still beat. True. Good luck!,JUSTNOMIL,dg8h76r,2,t5_377ps

11580840,0,t1_dg4f7wg,Accidentally posted before finishing my comment. Im  next month diagnosed at nineteen. My diagnosis didnt change me but it changed how I viewed myself. Id always known something was different about me but could never name it. Getting a diagnosis and putting a name to it made things so much better for me. I could define and work on issues I have and weird things I do. I could start accommodating and advocating for myself such as using isolation headphones when overstimulated and receiving and training a service dog to guide me to an exit when I become overstimulated. But mostly it gave me a sense of identity that I had never had before. For that and the friends Ive made and things Ive learned I am so so grateful. ,JUSTNOMIL,dg8p11p,1,t5_377ps

Ill post a brief story at the bottom that you can read if you want. Killing yourself isnt a solution. There are people out there waiting to love you that need and want a DavidGjam in their life and will treasure you. Them not sharing genetics makes them no less family. They will be family that you choose. Go call a counselor or CPS or the local high school. You will find help and your life will become less dark. It took me a long time to realize that not being able to find Syria on a map did not make me any less worthy as a person. Dont take as long to figure it out as I did. Im not talking out of my ass. My moms home schooling was leaving me alone to do it and screaming at me when I didnt understand something ending in her pushing me out of the house three states away to go to college at  because it made her look like mother of the year to have a child who graduated early. She actually had me cheat on my exit exam so she knew I wasnt ready.

11594880,0,t1_dga9pjk,Yup I tried the high road for a long time but it got me basically nowhere. Ive accepted that their behavior wont change and my only option is to limit contact to what I can tolerate or go NC. Then I figured out the third option which is just to not give too many fucks and almost always take my own car. They bother me less because Im a bitch and I still get to see my few relatives who arent shitbats.Being reasonable is futile with these folks and the only thing they respond to is their own nonsense thrown back at them. I believe this is something that probably being on the spectrum helps me with. I already have different modes of communication and rule sets for how socially close I am to different people. So this is just a mode I use exclusively with my family. And people who abuse customer service employees. Theres a large overlap between the two groups.The more I read JNMIL though the less Im willing to put up with Relentless bullshit. Therapy is helping too. Im predicting this may change soon because I have this feeling my mother is displeased with my growing spine and Ive learned to trust those instincts.

I was actually a professional cleaner at one time so trust its completely unnecessary.I think for her its partly perfectionism like you mention. Our eggs definitely turned out more folk art while all hers needed was the right lighting to be magazine cover ready. Mostly though she just finds it really difficult to let anyone butt into her domain of all things domestic.  For example FFIL loves to smoke and grill meat. Hes really good at it. Yet she will always make another meat. Always. Seriously my first Thanksgiving with them was last year... There were two turkeys for  people plus kid. She cant help herself. For another holiday I dont recall which one. FSIL brought homemade cookies FMIL immediately busted out some packaged cookie dough and made more cookies! And has made cookies for every holiday since. Today she made cookies a cake a pudding and had  flavors of ice cream just to cover all her bases. FSIL and FBIL outsmarted her though and brought a pie. Ha! ,JUSTNOMIL,dgd74w9,36,t5_377ps

They watched it at their dads house....Spotlight once was watching Supernatural at her home when she had invited us over. On her  HDTV was a body cavity open on the screen and she had paused her show. Luckily my girls were in another room away from the TV. So I asked Spotlight if she wanted us to wait for her show to be over. I guess my tone implied judgement so she snapped you cant protect them forever!So I asked her when she was  as my youngest was did she get to see a disemboweled body up close? No? Cuz you mean TV was primitive when you were a child? Oh....I see. She went to CBF and said oh. I guess I can see your point.

Start asking her what shes sick with what day is her doctors appointment what specialists she needs to see etc. Really really sick is not a medical diagnosis. If you come out and tell her or FH that you think shes making it up shell whine and cry about how you are such a bitch not to believe her. Concernbomb her and tell her that youre so sorry shes not up to coming but youll find a way to make her feel included by skyping and sending pictures. Pretend to be really sad that the wedding will happen without her there. Make it clear that the wedding will still happen in as nice terms as possible! FH needs to understand that the wedding is important to you and will not be derailed by anything less than a nuclear holocaust.

I buy them food from my pocket because thats how I was raised. Not religious but I love helping people   Editmy wife also stayed at the shelter when she was homeless at age .

11762284,0,t3_67twb6,Honey what you have is called a boundary stomp on your mother in laws part. This is her exacting her desire onto YOUR wedding.gt  I tried to argue that were all there to celebrate our union and the color of my dress wont make or break the day. This is the correct response. This is not her wedding this is not the society wedding of the century she doesnt need to have it her way. gt  MIL couldnt articulate why its necessary just that it is disrespectful if I dont have one.Its disrespectful because its nontraditional because it reminds her that you have a past that did not include your husband to be because its a point that she thinks her opinion is better than yours. She cant even frigging say why she doesnt want it to happen. gt I cry to my friends and one girlfriend imparts to me some sound advice that Im trying to hold onto. Since the photo session is mainly for the families perhaps I should just get a white dress for that. No. Hell to the fucking no. People might present this as compromise and in a nice reasonable family it probably would be. But this is your mother in law strongarming you into something you dont want. Literally I dont want to wear a white dress is fundamentally incompatible with Ill wear a white dress for some of the time. Your photos are for you to remember the best day of your life  instead of the dress you picked out the one that you love in those pictures youre wearing a white dress. It is LITERALLY a white flag waving that you gave into her demands. It creates hassle it makes you have to run around and do extra changes on your wedding day  something that takes time and actually costs money e.g. the photographer has to wait around longer for you to take  minutes to change etc. gtIm trying to remind myself that in the grand scheme of things we probably have  years to have more disagreements on and perhaps the wedding dress color shouldnt be where I draw the line. But at the same time of all the things I could compromise on I at least thought I could be in control of what I actually wear.Alternatively you could look at it as this is the first of  years of disagreements and this is your first chance for you and your husband to decide that you deserve to be treated with respect are allowed to make your own decisions and create your boundaries that will be the prototype for all future ones. gt To add on husband still thinks color is no big deal but if it is so important to MIL then I should be considerate to his familys values. From his view if we can compromise by having two dresses then Im just choosing to still be pissed and anxious when I dont need to be. Why are you the one being asked to compromise your wedding day to him to keep his mother happy? Why is it her anguish over a white dress is more important than his future wifes happiness on the day you commit to each other for the rest of your lives? Why is it if its such a big deal to her she can have it her way but if its such a big deal to you you get to spend more money and time to buy something you neither wanted nor asked for.Go get some counselling. This is about more than just the wedding dress. If you go through with this that wedding dress will become emblematic of her presence in your marriage. Itll be the bone of contention and every time you look at those photos youll be angry and sad. Shes paying for the wedding so you have to compromise on some things but not on something that personal that important. ,JUSTNOMIL,dgta8vc,64,t5_377ps
