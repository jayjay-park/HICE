Its all about having respectful disagreements not arguments.Also did his post change your views at all?,MurderedByWords,dcx09z5,26,t5_3hx3r
10604031,0,t1_dd6qcd7,Literally everybody in this thread needs to shut the fuck up. If i have to hear another dumb ass say some antimuslim shit then have some self righteous assholes mock him and get all offended... Well i might just do it... I cant fucking take how god damn reactionary everybody is... Hypocritical statement due to me reacting i know but i cant take seeing this exact thing over and over. im sure you all know the definition of insanity. Look on the internet almost anywhere. You will see people saying the same shit you all just said... You want a different result do something different as opposed to A say some stupid shit or B Get mad at some stupid shit... You know i truly believe we need to live in a more accepting society but part of that is accepting that there are dumb ass mofos who will believe some dumb shit and its their right to.. Like try and change it if you want but dont get mad if some dumb ass is still a dumb ass after it all.,MurderedByWords,dd9q42u,1,t5_3hx3r

10822761,0,t3_5tlqsa,I agree with his reasoning completely however I dont see how it could possibly support his conclusion. Hes brilliantly wellspoken which makes his departure from logic all the more disturbing.,MurderedByWords,ddwaip2,1,t5_3hx3r

10962400,0,t1_de9ys30,Now imagine you want your fair share and  other people barge in saying they represent you and that your family doesnt deserve their share and that they should give it to you. Then your father says thats ridiculous so those  people throw a riot.The point Im trying to make here is that BLM is unorganized and because of that they cant keep people who proclaim theyre affiliated with BLM from letting their emotions get the best of them and damaging property or hurting somebody. They have leaders that have denounced some wrongdoings but they dont always denounce wrongful rioting. A LOT of damaged property and people have resulted from BLM protests. This is why people are against Black Lives Matter. A more productive movement would be one that is peaceful a movement that is organized and has specific goals and ways to achieve them and a movement that points out actual cases of racism instead of jumping on the He dindu nuffin bandwagon for anybody dark skinned like they did with Michael Brown and Mario Woods.,MurderedByWords,deap03n,-15,t5_3hx3r

11126880,0,t3_5xkmdv,Im sorry but it looks as if Syminton is the slimy one and Mcarthy is trying to defend his underlings against an unfounded attack. The reference to Donald only draws me more towards thinking that Syminton is the bad guy as he dodges questions and expects special considerations to be met before testifying under oath... crybaby tactics much like our current President espouses.Needs more clarification.,MurderedByWords,det80kq,2,t5_3hx3r

11798073,0,t1_dgxcme9,My point is that  muslims supporting violence to defend islam is fucking laughable its sooooo high.  Thats something like  millions people spread all over the world.  in case youre not convinced this is from the wiki article I linked above Polls taken by Saudi owned Al Arabiya and Gallup suggest moderate support for the September  terrorist attacks within the Islamic world with  of Arabs polled by Al Arabiya saying the  attacks were morally justified  disagreeing and  of those polled being unsure. A  study produced by Gallup found similar results with . of Muslims questioned believing the  attacks were justified. Another poll conducted in  by the Fafo Foundation in the Palestinian Authority found that  of respondents supported the September  attacks.,MurderedByWords,dgxcolz,1,t5_3hx3r
