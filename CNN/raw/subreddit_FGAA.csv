7317219,0,t3_4fljc3,Oh this is HILARIOUS... You know how Angie is always accidentally revealing Erics lies? She did it again. His statement said he and PTF parted wats sic but on good terms? Angie stuck her foot in her mouth yet again and admitted that they dropped him. So much for the claims of discussions and agreements between him and PTF. Sneaking things in is NOT following a dietary plan  one that costs thousands of dollars which you have been given for free. Thats ungrateful and wrong. If you plural werent prepared to abide by the plan you shouldnt have accepted all that free food in the first place there are far more deserving people who would have jumped at the chance you had. Thanks Angie! Keepin it real for all the people who see right through your lies!Image of Angies admission.Yeah I BET he was just sneaking in fruit and milk. Definitely no fast food at all ever. Of course without eating x the daily recommended allowance of sodium maybe EampA have actually added years to their life by being dumped by PTF. But thats only if they can resist gas station taquitos and rippers...,FGAA,d29x2ax,3,t5_3cbz4
7582233,0,t1_d341fze,Someday is a concept he uses to avoid taking any responsibility. Also the somebody else will help with  attitude. Wasnt it funny that both he and Angie threatened the haters are getting so bad Ill have to stop and get a job for a few weeks within the same month of each other? Like thats something that would really disappoint followers because it would slow down this fastpaced entertainment? And yet they never actually do it. Its incredibly sad to watch the same excuses and the same lies over and over. If he was doing this to himself on his own dime I walk away and leave him to it. But hes fleecing so many goodhearted people in the process and sullying an honorable pursuit. ,FGAA,d3429pv,3,t5_3cbz4
7597893,0,t1_d35tyyi,Not a bad theory but I dont think that was an edit  I think he just stopped recording. Mostly because I think hes too lazy to edit and he could have chopped off the whole part of her starting to talk if he was editing any part of it. Eric did claim that he deletes comments when theyre profane so either they dont swear at all ?! Angie uses the word retard an awful lot for someone who thinks cursing is bad or he had already started to end the recording. However I wouldnt be surprised at all if Angie has been banned from speaking and posting it seems that way.She looked so out of it. Im not even snarking I just think its incredibly sad and worrying. They need to stop this farce and go home and get the help they need. If hes using her as a prop to prove that hes still succeeding on the fix my marriage part then hes even more of a lowlife than it usually appears. She needs help. ,FGAA,d35uc0m,1,t5_3cbz4
7969721,0,t3_4nyl5d,Hes so utterly smug I cant even stand it. Why isnt he ashamed of his shitty performance? How can he have the nerve to sit there and make an anniversary video as if its a GOOD thing that hes been draining public goodwill for a solid year is still morbidly obese and is no closer to living a functioning productive life? Hes been doing the same things as he did at home just with more news coverage pity donations and sightseeing in the process. Meanwhile kids are dying of cancer before they get a chance to get their Make a Wish dreams come true. How can he sit there and congratulate himself for siphoning off funds that could have been put to genuinely good use? Its beyond pitiful. Whenever I watch his QampAs the amount of eyerolling and smugness and entitlement is absolutely sickening.,FGAA,d4bveqc,2,t5_3cbz4
