It is best to separate them temporarily until the fight or flight hormones flush out of their system a bit. ,felinebehavior,ctkg1i4,1,t5_2ytzb
11323135,0,t1_dfelsfo,Ive been bite free for over a year now so its possible! And I was already thinking of ways to find her a new place because I felt like I was terrorized. Once I ended up in ER because she bit and scratched my arm so hard and I remembered I didnt have my tetanus shot done. Now I know better than to have whocansingthemostofftune opera with my sister. Kitty doesnt like high pitched voices. In time hell adjust and so will you. As a cat owner I cant lay on bed with my feet over the edge and swirl my toes whenever I want to. Thats just begging for trouble. But the cuddles make up for that. ,felinebehavior,dffgiul,1,t5_2ytzb
