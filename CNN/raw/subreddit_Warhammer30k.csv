7274020,0,t1_d24ydq7,The Red Butchers are rules wise a great unit.  Play smart and stay away from mass S CC and they just absolutely destroy what they touch.  Ive had my butchers in one game take out  thallax an AV bunker  man lascannon squad a  man Tac squad and another  man Tac squad with an attached character.  The Ramapagers are pretty meh rules wise.  Youd think for a whole squad of guys with the butchers nails they would hit harder.  Pair this with a pretty crappy wargear selection and they just dont seem like a good choice.  These dudes are some of the most bloodthirsty and savage legionnaires and they are only WS!  Give these guys WS andor Furious Charge in their rules!  I still run them from time to time because I absolutely love the models and keeping my lists fresh.  I see Rampagers in a pretty similar way that I look at destroyers.  Great models but they are too expensive for what they actually bring.As for our wargear selection.  It is very very lackluster for its points.  There are  ways to fix this.  change the rules for the weapons or  make them cheaper.With the exception of Shabran Darr the character choices are pretty good.  Angron is obviously a god of combat.  Surlak provides a lot of benefits for his unit and can really buff your Tacs and Despoilers.  Kharn has a pretty good warlord trait that helps you go first and has a pretty good statline and wargear.  My biggest complaint is that he is LD and should either be I higher or A higher base.  The LD is a bigger issue than his other stats.  Overall though Kharn is still a solid choice.  You hit the butchers nail with the legion rules.  The WE biggest strength is their rules.  While th ed may be a more shooty edition the assault phase is still very decisive.  Pair this with marines not having ATSKNF and fearlessstubborn being a commodity and you find the assault phase is even more deadly than compared to k.  I dont know of any other legion that buffs their basic legionnaire so much.  I find game after game that my troops are the work horse of my army.  ,Warhammer30k,d250a2n,2,t5_352pm

8467779,0,t1_d5zzvi8,Its a surprisingly fun welledited watch its not as scripted and stagemanaged as youd expect from the GW we know and...know and makes it look like a genuinely good time. They dont edit things out to make turns flow more smoothly so you get a real idea of how the game plays.Another plus btw is that there are no point costs per mission or anything like that. So long as you equip the models in the box with the options listed ie the Sergeants can use special melee weapons and each veteran squad gets a special and a heavy weapon like k Tactical squads not  how veterans work in k but a good base of models to build from nonetheless youre good to go since each mission only specifies the number and type of models you get without micromanaging their equipment for you.In case youre not aware there are some extra missions in White Dwarf issues to expand the game one that adds Daemons into the mix generic use any daemon or hell any model you want one that has rules for combining two sets if you think you might want to try this someday do what I did and look on bitz sites or ebay for a second copy of the boards Id be amazed if you paid more than  and I think a third one?

If you can get enough assault marines to run the Drop Assault RoW you can see some great results because they cant be murdered by the dozens by templates and blast weapons on the turn they deep strike which will really let them do their job turn two. The biggest key to a list like this is your assault marines are expendable thats why youre bringing close to  of them. After turn one literally spread out as far and wide as you can and disordered charge everything that moves.

This is my response to some of the issues people had.I loved that he doesnt care about them and considers them weapons and tools. Tbf why would he think of them any different he doesnt really know them well and manipulates them the same as any other being. Some of those custodians have been with him for like what  years or so probably and they dont know him and he is happy to send them on sucked missions to carry out his will. so why would he care about  genetic constructs he build to command his armies that he doesnt really know I mean he only really had Horus with him for like  years or so probably why he selected him as warmaster as he was the only one he kind of knew and didnt really care as he had more important plans. The whole point the whole point is the survival of humanity and he seems to do whatever is necessary to do that so manipulation lying etc.The big Man is working from an entirely different perspective than anyone on this. The custodians have a bit of the truth because he is sometimes honest with them hes only human he needs to speak to someone or have some companions to be honest with. I dont see why when you are talking about someone who has planned for millennia knows ridiculous amounts of information and has seen and done insane amounts of conflict would place that much importance or any affection in the primaries who even if they are made from his genetic material were still just vat grown uber generals to lead his army of genetically altered super soldiers who were themselves taken as children and stripped of their humanity and chemically and surgically changed into obedient killing machines.On closing the web way I got the impression that once the gate to terra is closed it cant be opened again. To stop the warp flooding in with all the power of the gods behind it meant he had to sever it from the warp. So like permanently sealing it. Thats what I got any way thats why he was on the throne fighting back the warp and why he sent ridiculous amounts of troops into it for  years to back. That would be why they wanted to keep the route to mars open so much I guess. And this would explain why he is so gutted to have closed it as all his plans revolve around terra as the centre of humanities future etc. Otherwise he would have closed it straight off which he didnt. This is probably why he doesnt have any idea what to do once its closed. I like the thought that the reason why he doesnt do much at until Horus shows up to terra is that he is super depressed that his plans have been ruined by a bunch lab experiments.I might just be too cynical but this is grim dark. truly the emperor is a king of men not a nice guy but a warlord with a penchant for genetic experiments I mean look at the thunder warriors,Warhammer30k,dfqrcnz,2,t5_352pm

11656063,0,t3_66bowv,Just talking ruleswise first you cant play the Solar Auxilia flamer team unless you have lasrifles in aswell.Otherwise I dont quite about some minor loadouts if you want you can take special weapons for the grenadiers and in my opinion the Veletaris shouldnt run into the fight but thats more personal. If you mean to give them more personality spending some points on the Force Commander could be nice too.,Warhammer30k,dgh89j1,1,t5_352pm
11658709,0,t3_65zd3z,I think with all the sub legion detachments and such that any legion could have some forces involved in every conflict.  Not the majority but a token force say  pts or so.  A handful of vehicles an HQ and a core of troops basically.  Given the scale of most of the engagements that could easily be lost in the mix.  So really you dont have to go far to justify a small force in nearly any engagement loyalist or traitor.  ,Warhammer30k,dghj2bs,1,t5_352pm
11661332,0,t1_dghr3qd,Its honestly not even that strong for its cost depending on how you equip it.  The turbo laser destructors are really powerful but the other options are much weaker and if you bring  or  lasers you will find its pretty fair as far as LoW goes.  A few knight titans are probably better especially if they have the melee weapons with Str D as they are likely to make it to the warhound and beat it to death rather quickly.  But if you get a lucky death blow roll you may total a knight before it makes it there.Also it cant really hurt air except with the vulcan mega bolter.,Warhammer30k,dghtrxp,2,t5_352pm
