7129781,0,t1_d1fj719,gt I hate to break it to you but maybe some ideas are free a dime a dozen. But ideas that have been fleshed out into designs with months and months of research and prototyping ... either they arent called ideas any more and ideas can stay free OR ideas are not free.I vote for the latter. The difference between a professional and an amateur is that the professional can more often than not weed out the bad ideas faster than the amateur albeit with false positives.Fair enough. I can agree with that.gt Rule of thumb is that a patent is worth roughly Mil.Now I hate to be the one breaking it to you but patents dont have any intrinsic value what so ever. There are s of completely useless patents that no one would pay a dime for.,metaverse,d1okqud,1,t5_2ql88
