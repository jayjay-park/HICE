6684958,0,t3_477gwt,I think the terms eastern and western should be taken with grains of salt. The only reason I say this is because unless were talking about precise plots or coordinates geographical terms can often be very subjective to ones own perceptions or experiences. Having spent my childhood in Southern California and a decade of adulthood in New England I can agree with your ideas of western being open and sprawling while the east is often limited by age.With that EastWest in the U.S. are often divided by the Mississippi River as opposed to proximity to the oceans or infrastructure development. Culture would also distinctly divide the two as would population densities but the middle of the country while often getting shoved into one or the other is very much its own geographical region with its own styles of infrastructure development population densities cultures socioeconomics and in all reality its very far from both coasts. Our country spans a continent. Most people dont think about that.So as to your question of why their monickers seem odd in relation to their geographies its just perception and colloquialisms.

Its got a bad reputation but its actually relatively safe and the areas mentioned below except the Hunts Point area near Hunts Point Market and Fulton Fish Market are very welcoming and worth the trip.The Little Italy in the Bronx is one of the more authentic Little Italies left in NYC. Arthur Avenue is the main thoroughfare with shops cafes restaurants and a public market. The people watching and sensory experience would be rich. The Bronx Zoo and the NY Botanical Gardens are adjacent and worth checking out especially the older Victorian sections of the Bronx Zoo.City Island is another interesting part of NYC also in the Bronx. Its quite a unique part of the city more like a fishing village with architecture and a vibe more closely aligned with small towns in Massachusetts than the Bronx. It has some great seafood restaurants and an interesting boatmakingnautical history as well. Hunts Point Market and New Fulton Fish Market are in the Bronx and are the source for produce and fish for most of NYC. The fish market is the largest in the Western Hemisphere Tokyo has a the largest in the world Fulton Fish Market comes in second. Hunts Point Produce Market is gigantic  acres and open at night and the early morning. You may need to call ahead to find out if they have visitor hours or if you need a special permit to enter. Of course there are other sections of the  boroughs that are unique and interesting. I am currently reading The New York Nobody Knows Walking  Miles in the City by William B. Helmreich.
