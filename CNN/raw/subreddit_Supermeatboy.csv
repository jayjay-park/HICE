58763,0,t1_cekxhhq,I suppose it was simply obvious that iMisty was going to win. Anyway IWBTG crashed if I recall correctly and they did the same thing. I think its because a true RTA doesnt stop the timer no matter what unless run ends or reset.,Supermeatboy,cel4d49,1,t5_2s5t1
59597,0,t1_cekxhhq,gt I figure they werent sure how long the run would take and they only allocated  minutes but come on.Nah they know pretty well how long a run will take and err on the side of caution. Vorpal one of the runners ironically the one who lost the race is the any WR holder with a  run. iMysty has at least a sub  PB havent watched him for a while so I dont know how much it has improved so  minutes was for sure enough. Even with a few crashes.Re the boss fights they werent just trying to show off various stuff like they did on Larry? Not that theres much interesting about Lil Slugger but still. Could also be marathon nerves  there were a lot of people watching the stream.Anyway I think any is a bit sad for a marathon. Doesnt get to show off enough of all the coolness that is Super Meat Boy.If you want a really impressive marathon run go check out Breakdowns AGDQ   run its on YouTube. Its really good and Team Meat joins them on Skype during the run which only makes things even better and a lot more fun.,Supermeatboy,cel7rz1,1,t5_2s5t1
1444045,0,t1_cixa2oa,Dont worry about it. I just thought you might have missed it here on Reddit hence I went to YouTube.Super Meat Boy is an amazing game but when its freaking out like that from running at way more than  FPS its pretty much unplayable and Im pretty sure that some levels like   and  are completely impossible to complete when its running like that.,Supermeatboy,cixackh,1,t5_2s5t1
1476559,0,t3_2b0z48,also check around youtube for speed runs. There are some people who are good and some who are terrible. Even the terrible ones will beable to help you by not doing what they do XD,Supermeatboy,cj1d1ij,1,t5_2s5t1

5320447,0,t1_cvratax,the problem is they offered money for Danny but he refused it and no one besides him and team meat know why he stopped working with them,Supermeatboy,cvrqziw,5,t5_2s5t1
