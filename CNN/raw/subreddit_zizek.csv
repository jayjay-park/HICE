107623,0,t3_1vah5o,This is a perfect example of Zizeks ideology in action. As one individual uzizeksucks comment is spam. With one more person behind him he has credibility and even may actually draw common users of rzizek to his side in a living embodiment of self mockery I havent searched their post histories. Who knows? Maybe they are. ,zizek,ceqonl6,10,t5_2s3h6
149212,0,t1_cev8i8n,Oh I understand now. Thats a good point though it continues to frustrate me that theres a lack of a true encounter with Deleuze. ,zizek,cevfcgw,1,t5_2s3h6
1092576,0,t1_chsh5ne,I dont like that sort of unprovable slightly ridiculous boastful claim actually. Its alright when its like instant coffee or something and they have a slightly suspect survey saying Most popular brand but how can anyone quantify the most discussed philosopher in the world?,zizek,chsh9zi,3,t5_2s3h6
2009838,0,t3_2hrmrf,My only problem with it is that it isnt sufficiently radical enough. They agree with Zizek that nature does not exist but they still talk like humans exist. Destroy the human subject as well. The ratio of human cells to cells of other creatures in the human body is  Are we truly human anyway? Were we ever human?,zizek,ckvdse0,-5,t5_2s3h6

2390108,0,t1_cm73var,Thanks. Its a great text but I see Zizek was mostly in a Nietzschean mood qualifying all sorts of things as Nietzschean but not much discussion of Nietzsche himself.,zizek,cm74hp4,1,t5_2s3h6
2619074,0,t3_2pvv9z,Can anyone date this video? Z seems younger here.,zizek,cn0g8s9,1,t5_2s3h6
3110206,0,t1_cok8tgv,Its not that long and you should know by now that Zizek can be very animated when he speaks I believe I already outlined his position quite thoroughly. at least within the context of the point Im hoping to make.,zizek,cokddse,-1,t5_2s3h6

3938381,0,t1_cqw66en,as an aside Im aghast the oriental is a term people feel ok using. Im not calling you out just is it fairly accepted as far as you know? ,zizek,cr57k2t,1,t5_2s3h6
4175621,0,t1_crw37ho,He said in a talk once when i find it ill link it that it was clear that for isolated cases the market was clearly a very efficient solution that could be used. Specifically he gives the example of cell phones and their explosion.,zizek,crw86k6,0,t5_2s3h6
4771495,0,t1_ctvze0j,Maybe hes not but he didnt defend his positions at all here. It was written so horribly and onesided that it wasnt allowed.  but I decide that to challenge him would waste our time.Thats also where I quit reading. This wasnt an accidental bias. This guy had an agenda and was trying to be offensive and unfair. When that occurs it is only a waste of time to read because either you already agree with it and shout hurray or you disagree and shout bah humbug. Nothing is gained.,zizek,ctvzn1u,2,t5_2s3h6

6891867,0,t1_d0xfwak,I like his response too but I feel it may be mixing up drive with jouissance. Z does present a distinction of sorts between the two although as you can see I have trouble delineating it clearly myself. ,zizek,d0xien7,1,t5_2s3h6

7723673,0,t1_d3k3oyj,There are compelling arguments to be made that the contemporary social justice movement is regressive rather than progressive. It is a fossilised liberal ideology incorporating to be sure version of what used to be radical theory but quite thoroughly tamed by capital and cornered into symbolic cultural issues. Its theoretical weakness not to mention its antiintellectualist tendencies undermines any associated leftist position leaves practically every flank open and alienates practically every potential ally. Its just bad in theory and ineffective as politics.,zizek,d3k4mu5,3,t5_2s3h6

9149417,0,t3_55h4qb,His criticism of Brexit to my understanding is not so much on the basis of the EU being a desirable institution to be bound to in the long run but more significantly Brexit as an ideological event by investing belief into the narrative that reclamation of national sovereignty is authentically resistant to globalism a rightwing equivalent of the lefts concepts of global capitalism and corporate globalization we feed into the emergent ideological dichotomy of the st century that of globalism as embodied by the technocratic elites of Brussels and nationalism embodied best in those behind Brexit. These false opposites puts capitalism as both poles eliminating the visibility of capitalist and communist struggle the struggle of privatizers and rent capitalists vs. the commons and the marginalized who have suffered as a result of global capitalisms privatization and fragmentation of the commons and reducing visible societal antagonism to two variations of the same system capitalism of a nationalistic flavor and capitalism of a multinationalistic flavor both of which are mutuallyreinforcive ideologies which in the end feed into global capitalism. The Left irregardless of the outcome or ultimate result of Brexit should in the broader scheme of things concern itself with finding a way to articulate the discontent of global capitalism which leads to the generation of nationalist sentiment of the first place wrestling the language of internationalism from financial technocracies and wrestling the language of opposition to global corporate power from nationalist democracies.In regards to democracy his point is that democracy is something of an empty signifier it is everything and nothing. Jameson made a good point about the political vocabulary of democracy in An American Utopia essentially that the language of democracy is an abused and debased one which is utterly meaningless  representative of the whole existing political spectrum and thus the statusquo meaning the left must acquire a new vocabulary to articulate the left program. Beyond the ambiguity and uselessness of the vocabulary of democracy iek has three prominent critiques of democracy which Im going to simplify here for the sake of not getting bogged in verbiage  democracy should not function as an end in itself it is an ambiguous concept which other ideas or ends should hold precedence over  the general will should be violated if the general will is abusive and  democracy is more often than not a veneer which obscures economic and political operations within it. To clarify democracy is not bad but it is not a holy endsandmeans to be fetishized.,zizek,d8br6uf,2,t5_2s3h6

9394435,0,t1_d962csx,Reality in itself in its stupid facticity is never intolerable it is language its symbolization which makes it such. There is a lot more to be learnt from attaching yourself directly to philosophers no matter how intense and working your way through that attachment understanding it than having the Master discourse of a university mediate it for you. You will only be exposed to and distracted by the fears and desires of other people. There is good reason why ZIzek cites G.K. Chesterton so much and why Badiou writes about St. Paul,zizek,d96t76c,1,t5_2s3h6

9521400,0,t1_d9kmq6r,I would also add that he believes Clinton is a basic example of greenwashing e.g. Apple sides with gays and doesnt answer for Foxconn Hillary is first woman feminist president so she cannot be a mass murderer etc.I think Zizek believes multiculturalism is the new consumerism and anticlass that the progressive stack is code for racial sectarianism that mirrors white supremacists. I dont really know how relevant that line of thinking is since the left has always failed to critique Democrat presidents.I can never forget as Obama was elected everyone so sentimental and optimistic Naomi Klein asking but isnt it a bit odd that Moveon.org was so instrumental in Obamas election yet Moveon.org is a pacifist organization and Obama is fine with more war?I have no faith in the left anymore whatsoever personally. I think everyone secretly just wants to be rich and there is no other human contribution to anything. Trump would not be enough because Trump wouldnt even be enough of a disaster. The world needs a much bigger disaster to change directions and even then direction change would be utterly dire.People make such a ridiculous todo about Trump proving that people want to send a message to the elites in Washington. I cant respect Americans who have no clue how much poorer the rest of the world is than they are and are willing to attack the system purely on the basis of any wage stagnation whatsoever.At this point I have no faith in anything except the human race PERHAPS someday declaring a humans suffrage under renewable resources and universal basic income. If climate change migration disasters happen first I think border closing will be considered AOK by everybody and the left will have to surrender to that in order to even be relevant.I think Zizek is just teasing us to see if anyone can keep up and the answer is no people cant.,zizek,d9mpqjq,1,t5_2s3h6
9522126,0,t1_d9knibw,True Zizek seems to know little about the history of Buddhist thought.  He knows nothing about Nagarjuna or Vasubandhu or Dogen or a host of others.  But he doesnt claim to be talking about thathis criticism is only of the kind of Buddhism he sees commonly being practiced the most visible and widespread practices. The kind you see on the bookstore shelves for instance or read about in the lifestyles section of the newspaper. Surely that is itself just an absurd caricature right?  ,zizek,d9msydc,2,t5_2s3h6
9536911,0,t1_d9olvlv,If I leave aside the issues of Trumps value and whether or not a progressive revolution can happen postClintonelection Id like to draw your attention to the fact that a Clinton vote is a tacit endorsement of corruption.It would be one thing if you were voting for a candidate whose policies some of which you disagreed with. Or something you would be willing to live with to do better than the alternative.But in this instance a vote for Clinton is a vote for one of the most corrupt least ethical leaders in US history. She lies cheats steals peddles influence shes careless avoids responsibility for her actions has little if any integrity and is fundamentally an opportunist. Her main goal is power and wealth and she will do or say anything to get it.If you can swallow that pill and live with endorsing someone of that low base value then Im not sure it even matters whether Trump or Clinton is a better choice. Because in the old endsmeans debate the cost of that choice is so high that the victory is entirely Pyrrhicyou will have accepted someone so bad to prevent someone worse that ethics and values in America entirely lose their meaning.I could never live with myself if I made that choice. I would not vote for Trump because I have confidence in him or because I believe in his message. I would vote for him if I could because I simply couldnt stomach Clinton.,zizek,d9omfy5,1,t5_2s3h6

9795233,0,t1_dakf0il,Unfortunately its not about the message but the medium. Reading texts is just frustrating for me regardless of subject. Trust me when I say Ive tried everything when it comes to reading aids. Dyslexia in general isnt a question of not being able to understand the message but having a hard time in... receiving the message itself? I dont really know how to communicate the difference hope you get the rough idea. For example Ive had to proofread this message through four times to catch all the mistakes I made even in writing this tiny ass whinge.Texttospeech programs that Ive tested anyhow curiously enough produce same kinds of problems for me as reading itself but natural speech does not.Ah well perhaps Verso thinks that blind people couldnt possibly perceive the objet petit a.,zizek,dakh2zm,2,t5_2s3h6

11323150,0,t3_61llp5,Class definitely has gotten shafted in favor of gender race et al. But Im not sure if just straight up saying class is more important is effective communication. When people are shot dead in the street for being trans or black it is cold to say what about class though? We have to emphasize the importance of intersectionality while continuously calling out corporate intersectionality for failing to be what it says it is. Its not intersectional if it ignores class.  ,zizek,dffgl1v,20,t5_2s3h6
