When I am little I genuinely feel sexually ignorant and I enjoy asking silly questions like whats this? and pointing to different body partsobjects around me.  To little me body parts such as the nose and objects such as a book are on the same level as the penis.  I have no interest in sexual contact and it actually makes me uncomfortable including a kiss on the lips.

2468144,0,t1_cmgr8n2,Oh honey I understand. For awhile I was secretly wishing and trying to make deals that might bring my mom back. It sucks to have to be Big and remember that wont happen.But you are soooo lucky. You loved someone who loved you back. Im sure your Daddy took amazing care of you and taught you things other people couldnt. So many people dont ever get a chance like that and while its unfair that a little girl like you had to say goodbye before her time think how gifted you were to have known him!And another thing. A Daddy who deserved your love must have been a really really good Daddy. And all good Daddies want their little girls to be happy and to feel safe what would Daddy have done for you if you had lost someone else important? Would he have brought you a cuppie or your snack put you in your PJs tucked you in? Made sure you had your best stuffed animal? Poured you a bath? Remember how he comforted you and makes sure your are doing those things for yourself... Theyll be the most comforting and you will know you are going on like he would have wanted you to.,littlespace,cmgrgat,1,t5_2voav

If you find yourself being too crass or rude or anything towards her the best thing is to just be aware and talk and apologize to her about it. No one should need to censor themselves around loved ones. So my advice is just be thoughtful considerate and communicative and dont worry so much about being just right. Also us as littles should understand that we are not Always in that mindset so we dont expect you to be. ,littlespace,cmjpdsl,1,t5_2voav

2585968,0,t3_2pf7tq,Anything you can get or make for him thats either unique or special.For example say your papa loves whiskey...you could get him a nice bottle of whiskey asking people who know whiskey to offer really good suggestions or a nice set of whiskey glasses.  You could draw something for him or color a very nice picture and put it in a frame for him.If theres anything thats either unique or super special for you two that would be nice too.  For example I met my little at Hershey Park and that place will forever be linked to her.  I cant think of Hershey Park without thinking of her so were she to get me a picture of us at Hershey as an example in a Hershey frame I would cherish it forever and ever and ever and ever and at LEAST one more day past that.  The key is it needs to be something thats you two.  If Id gone to Hershey park with lots of girls and just happened to have met my ex little there too...there wouldnt be anything super special about it in my opinion.,littlespace,cmw4gvk,2,t5_2voav

Its one thing if he does it once or he might think of other girls once or twice but if its a constant thing? I think thats really just so wrong...you should be more than enough for him. If youre not already enough in his mind then whose to say that he wont have sex with another girl? Thats just how I feel about it though.. I could never be with anyone who looked at porn while theyre with me. How would he feel if you were looking at pictures of naked guys?

My daddy works long hours as a chef and gets home really late around  and if were lucky I have our toddler asleep already so thats usually when we spend time together. He asks about my day and we sit together on the couch. Sometimes Ill brush his hair or paint his toe nails. Sometimes hell hang out with me while I color or well watch Pixie Hallow fairy movies togetherwhich I know he likes too  Before work we always do some activity with our toddler and he plays with us. While hes at work he sends me sweet texts and reminds me to drink my water since I have a hard time with that.

4724200,0,t3_3fk3ev,I slip in and out of little space mainly because its a general part of who I am. Whether Daddy is around or not doesnt really matter because Ill still act little if I feel like it. Im not even a little little per say  Im a middle. Pacifiers bottles and sippy cups are too babyy for me as are diapers and general AB stuff... perhaps even stuffies are.Im very attached to certain activities not objects. I have three staple stuffies that stay in my bed at all times but I dont cuddle them often. Im little on the streets by holding one of Daddys fingers instead of his hand and it only happens when it strikes my fancy to do it like so not all the time. If Daddy and I are going through a rough patch we talk about it and fix it. I dont believe in just sitting there and letting bad thoughts and feelings fester so I never have to hold back or get distant from him or the little stuff hes given me. Regardless of how little I may feel at times Daddy always encourages me to use my words and express whats on my mind thus we can almost always avoid any issues.Acting little comes naturally for me and I think my people persona is so much different Im quiet when Im around strangers that nobody could guess I go home to throw kicky tantrums about Daddy not wanting to play the same game with me for the thousandth time.,littlespace,ctq0x1b,1,t5_2voav

4985855,0,t3_3j3bxd,I hate it when they dont understand. Youre getting used to a new environment missing things you liked missing your relationships and then you lose your favourite bow? Maybe you could handle that on a good day but youre already needing comfort. You wont die but your emotions might feel like they are and you reach out to the one person you think could understand what youre going through and they laugh at you.Sometimes my boyfriend will do something that I think is absolutely heartless and inconsiderate but come to find out he doesnt always understand what Im thinking why something small became something big. I forget were two separate people and I have to tell him why what happened affected me so hard and hes often surprised because he had no idea. I have no idea what your relationship is like but baby girl has to tell him exactly whats going on Ive been in multiple ldrs none with a daddy since I havent had one yet but the pain does go away. Youll get into a comfortable routine figure out new ways to spend time together and be happy. He can still be your big and you his little.Together via phoneskype you can...

4998616,0,t3_3jbks5,I previously worked dog daycare and I couldnt stand them I ended up leaving them both pretty quickly cuz I didnt survive. I worked at one of the biggest dog daycare chains in the country and all my higher ups and coworkers were mean to me.. Everyone was extremely stressed and grumpy even the clients were mean. There were always too many dogs and not enough people to watch them or control them. Dogs were allowed in that were not good candidates for being at dog daycare but the bosses didnt care about that because the more dogs they allow in the more money they get. The employees including myself were young and not getting paid anything basically so things were often messy or done wrong. Getting dogs inout of the room was a nightmare that often resulted in dog fights or dogs squeezing their way out of the rooms.We also had coworkers speak negatively about animals or clients  and unfortunately the dog doesnt get kicked out of daycare like they should be if theyre constantly fighting they just get put in a solitary room all day and the client doesnt know or they get told oh your dog isnt that bad just a few problems but in reality BIG PROBLEM. We had a dog come in everyday that bit. And not just nipping I mean full on defensive growling biting hair standing up on his neck. He was either terrified or just an aggressive dog. He bit me once and I couldnt get him where he needed to be for the night.. I cried from how stressful it was and had to ask somebody to help me.I was also expected  like you  to be able to do everything around the place including interacting with clients and we didnt get our  minute breaks like we were supposed to. Clients would get upset at me for putting their harnesses on wrong when I have another  dogs to bring out to other clients theyd make me stand there like an idiot and do it over again.. ugh.And this wasnt just one dog daycare place it was the same but worse at a different place I worked at. One of my managers was subtley mean to me everyday. She condescended me and nitpicked me and whenever I would clock out usually way after I was scheduled to be off she would complain to us about how much their was to do and how we werent doing things right. It was just a really hostile negative atmosphere and I felt bad for the dogs because they didnt get much space they have to be around other animals that they dont get along with and they tire out very fast. It can be stressful for them too.Anyway I just wanted to say I can relate at how hard it is working in retail places with animals. People think its just hanging out with puppies and stuff but the animals can be difficult to work with and when your coworkers or boss is making you rush and stressing you out that affects your ability to do things right and ensure the animals happiness and safety. I didnt like working in environments like that. ,littlespace,cuoiqiy,1,t5_2voav

5798336,0,t3_3ujlfa,a few things about this that need to be addressed. first of all it feels like he may have some selfesteem issues that he needs to resolve. he fears that hes pushing you too far and blames himself. what you two need to do is come to an agreement in no uncertain terms that as soon as you start to feel nervous doing something that you both agree to stop and thats that. no harm no fowl in either direction. slowly you will build upon this but its at YOUR speed. and im pretty certain that he wont have a problem with this. next you need to both agree that you will discuss your feelings openly but without blaming each other or yourselves for how the other person feels. believe it or not sometimes daddy needs someone to care for him. you need to show him how to be strong that he may be strong for you.as far as your specific instance you wrote about when you get to the point where you dont want to go any further just say im not comfortable with that yet. and make sure he understands its not his fault at all. sure he was asking for a bit more but you have the right to say no and neither of you are to blame. its all about the mutual respect for each other that builds trust and furthers the relationship this rule is in general not just limited to LDRs let him know hey not this time but maybe next time and reassure him that he is not to blame for anything.and i say this with the most sincerity you both need to address this immediately and resolve it or this will turn toxic. i would know ive unfortunately been in this exact type of situation. i had low selfesteem and it rubbed off on her. eventually we unintentionally began to use that as a tool to kinda get our way. it was miserable and i ended up resenting her for it.i wish you the best of luck sweetie. and if either of you need to talk im available. i would be more than happy to explain all of this to him as well,littlespace,cxfu7ca,1,t5_2voav

Once you get the motion right you could mimic it with your tongue.Im not sure Im on board with all the tell her to stop masturbating completely suggestions. If she never gets to cum unless you make her cum and currently you cant make her cum that just sounds like a whole lot of sexual frustration and added pressure on both of you to get there.

6830094,0,t1_d0qh9i6,Yeah we are out there but we are a  rare bunch I personally even prefer the non sexual aspects of the dynamic. Not that I hate sex i love it but I feel its something that should be reserved for when a little has been very good or just outright asks for it or hints at it if she is shy.So yes not every cgl relationship is focused on bdsm. ,littlespace,d0qhpf8,2,t5_2voav

6845451,0,t3_49dxdo,Why are you a little or Daddy? Im a switch! Im little because well Im  and lbs. Im not saying this is requiredI know that plenty of littles struggle with not being small and I wish that werent the case. Mentally I can be pretty immature when alone with my boyfriend and luckily he can be big and reassuring and just put me in my place. Im a Mommy Domme because idk after being together almost a year my boyfriend started to let down a ton of guards and he realized he liked being little too. I looove to be big for him. ltWhat is most rewarding about being littleDaddy? Best thing about being little is everything! How could you not love it? You get to be completely smothered in love stuffed animals video games onesies. Personally not all that into coloring but you dont need to be into anything in particular really. Just drown yourself in the things that make you feel simple and happy. Best thing about being a Care Giver CG is the overwhelming love you feel when you hold your little in your arms. It feels fantastic to have all that trust put into you. When Im the CG all I want is to make his life simple and lay out his clothes and call him my angel and make sure he has no doubts that he is so so loved.How did you get involved in the lifestyle? Once we were having sex and he told me to call him Daddy and things started to snowball from there. I found reddit!Did it feel awkward at first? Does this pass how did you deal with it? Oh man yeah. It was a little awkward in my head because he DID kind of spring it on me..he knew already that I liked to do as Im told and he was just seized in the moment. It was the first time being kinky for both of us. Also my father had very very very recently passed away so after that night with my boyfriend I sat in my bed panicking to myself about the implications of the word Daddy. Honestly I just stuffed down those worries. My boyfriend DOES protect me and keep me safe and happy. He IS the strongest and most reassuring male figure in my life. Theres nothing weird about this ultimately and I had to accept that. Im very ok with it now.What are the benefits to being involved in ddlg? Well..if you like being little then you get to be little without being judged. You get to be little with a big CG thats enthusiastic about your little side and likes taking care of you.Is your Daddy your boyfriend? If so or if not could you elaborate on the advantagesdisadvantages? Yes he is! I honestly cant think of any disadvantages. Maybe its kinda tough if we both feel little at the same time who gets to be spoiled today? or both feel dominant at the same time no YOU stay in the chokehold. Seriously though it has only made our love for each other double and triple over the time weve been together. Things that might sound unreasonable to a vanilla guy sound like little things to my Daddy. He has more patience because of the dynamic.How do you get into little space? Usually it just hits me but he can make it happen by being bossy leaving out the word please putting that steel in his voice which makes me know I cant disobey. Not that I would ever want to. I love to do what he says so if he tells me to do things sexual or not honestly I was writing this whole sentence thinking of nonsexual acts then I get a little subby.Does your ddlg relationship involve anything sexual? Why or why not? What if anything has this made complicated in your relationship? See aboveyes quite sexual but also kinda . I dont mean were doing DDlg stuff  but rather he has the option of putting me in little space whenever he wants to. He can be little whenever he wants too. Advantages I think I covered..and like I said I cant think of any disadvantages. This dynamic forces LOTS AND LOTS of communication and cuddling two things that I believe make any relationship much stronger.Does anyone other than you two know youre little? Uh some of my close friends I guess. Actually yeah most of my friends. He and I are very open about what we do sexually and theyre all used to it by now. Also maybe my older brother knows. Not sure. I dont think he WANTS to know.Does being little complicate your big girl life? In what way and how do you deal with it? No sometimes it helps me deal with my big girl life. I just get burnt out. I feel like my brain starts shortcircuiting and when that happens I just want to put on my tigerstriped onesie surround myself with blankets and stuffed animals and my love and put on Netflix. Sometimes my big girl college life allows for this to happen sometimes I have to wait several hours. I can handle myself and be grown up while I wait but once he and I are free to seize the night thats what he calls it Ill be stuck in either little space or CG space depending on who needs the structure more. The structure I mean of being told what to do where to go sit down now go turn on the TV go make the bed so we can sit etc. Its nice not to think.What advice or guidance would you give someone new to the lifestyle? Some bullet points Do your research! Spend hours on reddit or whatever resource you need in order to learn! Learn learn learn. Learn about you what makes you happiest about being little? Surround yourself with it. Learn how to communicate those things that make you happy. Communicate with whatever SO comes along be clear about what you want because if you arent clear youll just regret it down the line. Find someone you love and give them all your love if they deserve it. When youre upset squeezehug something soft. Ageplay is not weird. No sexual desires are all that weird. Be open communicate discuss talk speak share. Communicate. Youll get sick of hearing that word..but it doesnt matter because COMMUNICATE!Hope this helps!Edit clarification,littlespace,d0s8l2l,1,t5_2voav

Dont let this change who you are.Try to focus on you he cant tell you what you are supposed to do he is not your daddy anymore is he? so he can shove it! its easy enough to be little on your own and I bet you could find someone super fast if you wanted to.

I also love soft snuggly things like stuffed animals. I dont like clutter though so I mostly stick to blankets. Oh yea and Disney and other cartoons are like one of my favorite things ever. You could also try eating little foods and snacks like Dinosaur nuggets or macncheese.. or you could do fruit and stuff if you want a healthier option. Its more fun if you have a cute plate and utensils. I got   plates from Target that I really like. Anyway hopefully at least one of those things sounds fun to you!,littlespace,d16ibj5,1,t5_2voav

My type basically does well on a vegan diet so I follow that. My type produces less stomach acid so I learned that I dont digest meat well other than turkey and fish occasionally. Dairy just gives me sinus headaches eczema...basically inflammation. As for how to get more protein? Well youd be surprised how many non animal products are high in protein. You could do beans nuts seeds oatmeal spirulina etc. Just gotta find recipes to your liking that incorporate those ingredients or do some experimenting of your own.

When you sub you often focus so much on what your sir needs that you dont have your needs fulfilled. You have to know what you want out of any kind of relationship. Do not be afraid and do not give up. Do something that makes you feel happy. Find someone who you can just TALK to first. YOU ARE NOT UNLOVABLE!!!! Love you first. Once you love yourself you will begin to believe in yourself. Once you believe in yourself you will understand yourself. Then its easy peezy japaneezy after that.

9126969,0,t3_559ulv,I dont live with my Daddy and we arent in an LDR we live ish minutes apart but I totally understand having the cravings to be little while not having a CG present or at times that I just cant indulge. I think a lot of littles unless they are with their MommyDaddy  have these moments. Personally if I frequently have periods where Im craving little time in situations where its not appropriate Ill try and make a point to set aside time where I can relax and be little in a safe private space. Thats when Ill color watch a good show have a snack do some crafts and just little out. And then Im with my Daddy  nights a week so Im little around him a bunch!Its definitely frustrating when I feel myself slipping into it accidentally though. My friends all know I like cute things and I get pretty goofy a lot of the time anyway so if Im not required to be responsible its not that big of a deal haha. Also Ill plan some things like wearing a ribbon in my hair packing a cute snack or decoratingputting stickers on things for like subtle doses of littleness throughout the day.

9153611,0,t1_d8c82zv,For a few months now in multiple states there have been reports of jackasses in scary clown suitsmakeupmasks lurking in wooded areas and along the sides of roads. It began with the clowns merely being there looking menacing but has been escalating to some attempting to lure children over to them and last week was a police report of some now chasing children and adults with swords. I have read one article where a policeman was patrolling an area known to have a clown and spotted him crouched in a roadside ditch. The clown was arrested and found to be a  year old man. Im uncertain if hes been questioned about motives or if this is some kind of Internet forum for the lulz thing or just loads of copycats.Of course with Halloween coming up in North America Im quite concerned for peoples safety. Local officers are asking people not to dress up as clowns while naturally costume shops are going lol we have clown suits be just like them on Halloween!

I always had pink everything pink room blankets Barbies Barbie movies and games and I had to do ballet. Somehow this carried on for a long time I would play with sand and pretend I am cooking even when I was past . I like to roll around and play fight and play girly online games dressup makeover etc even though my personality and how I dress is more tomboy. I like cartoons anime kawaii things including animals and stuffies. I act like a kitten my friend calls me kitty and it is not necessarily BDSM. I am just naturally like a kitten.

I got a bunch of white mugs and we decorated them with colored sharpies. Decorate your own cupcake is always super fun too. We also did paper cut outs of mustaches crowns glasses and lips and had a little photo shoot. A cool thing I would do if I wasnt afraid of balloons popping is getting black balloons and filling them with treats. Little candies stickers dollar store jewelry and paper confetti and have fun popping them and making a big mess! Best part. I always find that food is the most expensive thing to do when hosting so make as much stuff as you can from scratch or do something simple like sandwiches. Using cookie cutters to make them into cute shapes goes a long way. And dont be afraid to ask for help! People usually love to contribute by bringing their favorite snack or drink.
