Turn them on! And dont ever be afraid to ask for help when you need it.Harrys situation may have been fighting for life or death but its ok even luckier that you will be fighting for a GOOD life. This is my favorite quote  It is our choices Harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities. I think you will have a great life ahead of you! And allowing these stories to stay with you... even to have the power to make you into a better  stronger  happier person through your choices... is the best way to honor them.

48177,0,t3_1un9d0,I think James Potter would have been easier on Snape if the latter had been sorted into Gryffindor theres a definite sense of sticking together and protecting your own in the Hogwarts houses.It would have been harder for Snape to become tempted by the Dark Arts and he and Lily probably would have remained good friends. James and Snape might even have become friends particularly in view of Snape and Lilys friendship or at least rubbed along comfortably together.None of this would prevent Voldemort rising to power of course and if James and Lily still got together lets assume Snape being in Gryffindor doesnt change this fact and had Harry the Prophecy would still hold true as it did in the real story. The only difference would be that Snape would not be a Death Eater would not have known Voldemorts plans would not have reported them to Dumbledore  James and Lily would never have had a chance to protect themselves with the Fidelius Charm on Dumbledores suggestion. The events then would remain the same Voldemort would have killed James and Lily attempt to kill Harry have the curse rebound upon him. Harry survives. The story progresses in the way we are all familiar with only now Snape cant act as a double agent for the Order because he was never a Death Eater to begin with. Would we have won the war without him?This is really interesting to think about! For me it just goes to show how rich the story is written  that in changing one part we have to unpick and unravel huge parts of the fabric of the reality JK wove throughout each book.,harrypotter,cejwyea,8,t5_2qiqi

98452,0,t3_1v7pt2,Didnt she get the potter name from a cemetery or a gravestone or something. Anyways i imagine like most other authors names come from a mix of places. Family friends acquaintances. Personally when im trying to come up with names for different things i like to use cool names ive heard of and ones i want to name kids or animals one day. Also if in general you are looking for names name generators are great.Also something that is seen a lot in Harry Potter is people whos names mean something to do with them i.e. Remus Lupin remus was one of the founder of rome said to have been raised by a wolf mother and lupin basically means something related to a wolf. I.E. hes a wolf people. All the blacks names come from stars Andromeda Sirius Regulus. I.E. a lot of stuff you can name based on stuff you know i.e. lore from around the world and where it fits into your story line names that are linked together like star names in a family tree. Historical people that mean something or who might have been famous for something and naming a character after them or naming a character a latin...or something like that that reflects their character in some way...depending on what you are going for with the character. Looking at the character you get some names that reflect who they are...i.E. Sprout and others.,harrypotter,cepn00z,1,t5_2qiqi

266492,0,t1_cf8cppl,probably.  remember Riddles diary.  It almost managed to become completely corporeal just because Ginny became a bit too attached to it for her own good.  a piece of Voldemorts soul nearly got a body by draining her life away.Now imagine the same situation with Harry as the host.  The horcrux doesnt even have to become corporeal its already inside essentially a living vessel which wont be fighting back for control.  not to mention that everybody who loved and cared for Harry would obviously be grieving for his death which would give him plenty of sources to feed itself and grow in power.but i dont think this would make him into a second version of Voldemort.  I think that he would essentially be stagnant and not grow or develop in any way.  he would always be the Voldemort that attacked Harry that one night when Harry was a baby.  he couldnt develop as a human with experiences and such.  essentially he would be like a snapshot of Voldemort somewhat similar to how Rowling describes the living portraits.  however this is a Voldemort at the height of his power so he would still be formidable.,harrypotter,cf8dr4h,6,t5_2qiqi

The Death Eaters might not have hesitated to kill the Dursleys or any other Muggle that left the premises.This is also why Vernon and his family were escorted out hours beforehand by Kingsley himself  it was the safest way to get them out of there.Seven Potters ensured that at least those seven members of the team would be safe from being instantly killed by a DE.

501313,0,t3_1zu79j,Yes. For the most part. Your patronus is a representation of your core identity and your identity is shaped by your culture. While your patronus wouldnt be limited to animals that live where you live you are more familiar with such animals so it would be easier to identify with them. To an American something like a wolf or a deer or a raccoon would be more familiar so it would feel more comfortable but to an Australian Koalas Kangaroos and dingoes and the like are more familiar. And if either country were to look at animals that arent from where they live theyd see them as more exotic and would likely only have them as a protronus if they themselves identified in some way as exotic. ,harrypotter,cfx944q,3,t5_2qiqi

957259,0,t1_chd0947,cutting out arianas story made sense i suppose since they basically cut out the life and lies of albus dumbledore and how harry and hermione dealt with the deep cut of reading that chapter. that was a real bottoming out for harry losing ron and learning what dumbledore had been left him with almost nothing. for him to find the truth behind it from both dumbledore brothers was a great nod to just how much he learned. not only him not fixing his wand but snapping the elder wand and throwing it over a cliff makes me angry. why end the movie on a cliff outside the school? was gambon busy that day that they couldnt halfass a painting in the dumbledores office set? if the movie canon holds harry has the allegiance of the most powerful wand ever made and no wand of his own. should make a great auror. another thing that bothered me about that movie was him running into ron and hermione on his way to the forest. were led to believe by these screenwriting people that hermione and ron are harrys two best friends. he tells them that hes going to sacrifice himself to voldemort. hermione cries and half says that shell go with him. ron says nothing. they let him fucking leave! there is no way in the world that should have happened. theyd been with him through everything. ron would have already pulled the cloak from harrys hands and started swinging it over them all. ,harrypotter,chd3kmt,1,t5_2qiqi

The wand never belonged to Voldemort so it didnt preform as well as it could.

1184191,0,t1_ci2tr5m,Easily enough Harry Potter is such a deep universe and long story that people cant help but explore it In the same way that we all do when we think what if? except they write it. Some of it is reasonably well written and works quite well. As people have literally grown up with and in these books they literally adore everything about them and want to read more to quench their thirst. This combined with the three year summer between GoF and OotP where people were almost craving HP meant there is a lot of fanfiction out there. The redeemable quality is how well written some of it is. Of course you have your standard awfully written FF where Dumbledore is a controlling megalomaniacal despot Harry and Ginny create some sort of mystical soul bond and Harrys magical core is so large it engulfs the known universe and he can defeat Voldemort by lifting his pinky finger half and inch. But if you sift through that there are some truly spectacularly written balanced clever fics that are truly fantastic. If we read canon looking for stories you will immediately find great story opportunities which if explored correctly can be as good as canon.

From the point Harry disarmed Draco Harry was the master of the elder wand despite never coming into contact with it. The elder wand was being used against its master and did no true damage to Harry. Thats why the Crucio curse did not harm Harry after he came back into his body. Im of the opinion Harry wasnt truly killed but simply in Limbo due to the trauma of having the fragment of Voldemorts soul removed. As an aside you should read the books. The movies omitted a large portion of the discussion regarding wandlore. ,harrypotter,ci338q8,9,t5_2qiqi

Richard Harris is not playing the book version of Albus Dumbledore in the movies. He is playing Ben Kenobi in a giant fake beard with less charisma. Thats not who Dumbledore is.The Dumbledore I know the Dumbledore I met when I first read Sorcerers Stone before the movies came out is the Dumbledore who could lead the Hogwarts anthem with everyone singing in different tunes and still weep at the beauty of everyone singing at once even in absolute discordant chaos. The Dumbledore I met in the books is the one who could say I want to say a few words nitwit blubber oddment tweak. Thank you and sit down as if hed said something very important. The Dumbledore I met in the books is the one who could find Harry looking at the Mirror of Erised look into the mirror himself stay perfectly stoic and then tell Harry the baldfaced and obvious lie I see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks. Harry stared. One can never have enough socks said Dumbledore. Another Christmas has come and gone and I didnt get a pair. People will insist on giving me books.Richard Harris was not the Dumbledore I met in the books. He could never have been the Dumbledore I met in the books. He was too devoted to being Ben Kenobi.In Prisoner of Azkaban Gambon showed me exactly the Dumbledore I knew from the books impish devious manipulative and eccentric to an unclear degree possibly as a cover for the rest of his behavior. Goblet of Fire saw Gambon horribly misdirected which is why we got HARRY DIDJEW PUTCHER NAYMIN TH GOBLADAFAR which everyone and their grandmas dog cites as their reason for hating Gambledore. Order of the Phoenix had some good Dumbledore bits like the failed arrest but also fell prey to bad direction in other parts. In HalfBlood Prince at long last David Yates learned what Alfonso Cuaron already knew in Prisoner of Azkaban if you just relax and let Gambon be Gambon he will be the perfect Dumbledore.

1458231,0,t3_2aus2q,I and I would assume many others since it wasnt that far fetched was sure that RAB was Sirius brother from the moment I came accross the letters in the book.There were a bunch of other tinfoil ones I had as well like Harry x Hermione or Snape actually fighting Harry in book .Also I always thought the series would end with Harrys death and the final scene would be Ron x Hermione remembering their childhood friend. To this day I think the series would have been better with a bittersweet ending. The reason I was convinced of this was because imo it fit with the series. Harry could never catch a break every time something good happened to him it was followed by either tragedy or hardship. It would fit the idea that even though he was the boy who lived he lived a life with overwhelming sadness and a terrible burden that he never chose to bear and small bursts of happiness and so his last action duel Voldemort to the death would be so that those he loved and changed his life forever could live on free of the shadow of Voldemort.,harrypotter,ciz2bzp,33,t5_2qiqi

1467430,0,t1_cizmied,I agree with you! I started replying to another comment but felt it was more appropriate here. I think the point of that is that Voldemort values his own life more than others. If he chose people who deaths would have been significant I think that would have meant to him at least that their deaths were more significant than his act of killing them and storing his soul in his artifact of choice. A part from early in the series that speaks strongly to me about this point is when Voldemort so easily kills and drinks the blood of a unicorn. Hagrid is appalled disgusted mortified that someone would do that and says that whoever would willingly stoop so low can never turn back from that choice. This was in book   the deaths of these people arent any more than a means to an end for Voldemort. I think the people who are significant are special in their own right and not because Voldemort found them to be so. You dont own or have claim to an artifact like the ring the diadem etc without earning it somehow  just like in the real world somebody who owns an original Da Vinci or Picasso isnt going to be somebody normal. I think thats why his victims in this case range from someone like Hepzibah to a random muggle who happened to be in his way at the wrong time and place. Theyre all meaningless to him as far as their lives are concerned. ,harrypotter,cj07uj8,3,t5_2qiqi

He kept it with him at all times in hope of catching his chance at the most absolute perfect time. This led to his utter failure when the encounter with James happened. Snape let his anger come out on Lily and called her a mudblood which fucked any chance he ever had with her. Snape knew that he could use it to restore his friendship with Lily and maybe even ask her out but he knew that it wasnt the right thing to do so he kept the tiny potion bottle inside a small container which sat on his mantle in his home well after he died.

1574539,0,t3_2catkd,I went through film school and worked on several short projects and the directors wanted to add every little character and subplot they could and it would stop the film dead in its tracks.People especially on this subreddit dont seem to understand quite how vital pacing is to a film and complain about every little change from the books saying oh a five minute scene where they saiddidshowed this thing wouldnt make too much difference except it would.Sometimes that shot the director spent hours setting up just doesnt fit. Sometimes the well written dialogue serves no purpose to the main story. Sometimes the beautiful set dressing is not important enough to halt the story. Every frame makes a huge difference.The Weasley family are generally not crucial to the story. Molly was a strong mother figure and had a strong impact on Harry but ultimately wasnt nearly as important as Ron or Hermione. Ginny was always a sidekick at best. Percy was featured so sporadically in the books after he left Hogwarts that it was barely worth bringing in his whole subplot to the last film and Bill and Charlie were for the most part just menitoned in passing with only a few scenes not enough to warrant writing the full characters into the film.We get a clear idea of the Weasley family in the films and it does not need to be done through more screen time. Small things like the clock in Chamber of Secrets are really powerful establishing moments. Charlie telling Hagrid that it is indeed a pretty big dragon is forgettable. As the film is about Harry telling the stories of people who never really do anything with Harry is pretty pointless and more of the lesser Weasleys would have been tedious and the films flow would be interrupted.,harrypotter,cjdn64s,20,t5_2qiqi

1598616,0,t3_2cizur,Hell no.He was definitely very brave that cannot be denied.  And he was great at his job as a double agent.  And he undoubtedly saved many many lives.  And he was instrumental in ending Voldemort and ending the war.But why did he do those things?He hung out with Death Eaters while still in school.  He loved the darkness craved power... and he was willing to kill.  We have no idea if he killed with his own hand or not... but he teamed up with Voldemort took the Dark Mark... he certainly had a depraved indifference to the value of human life.He heard a prophecy that threatened his master and he told it to him.  Voldemort would undoubtedly go and try to kill whoever the prophecy was about.Snape was fine with this.Until it so happened that the ONE person in the world he actually gave a shit about was threatened.  That didnt make him decide mudbloods were just as valuable as purebloods that didnt make him decide Voldemort was evil and torture and murder were bad things.He just didnt want Lily hurt.So he asked Voldemort to spare her.  And if James and Harry had died and Lily had lived hed have been fine with that.  He hated James so he would have been glad for his death and Harry simply meant nothing to him.  He might have felt bad that Lily was sad about Harrys death but he himself wouldnt care for Harrys own sake.  Harry was just James baby so who cares about him?But he didnt trust his master so he goes crying to Dumbledore... and admits that he doesnt care about James or Harry earning Dumbledores disgust.He finally agrees to turn on Voldy enter Dumbledores service and protect Harry as the price for Dumbledores help to try and save Lily.This fails and while he still doesnt give a shit about Harry he decides to make it his mission to protect him for Lily not because its right or anything.  And he decides to take down Voldy because Voldy killed Lily not because he realized Voldy was evil and he didnt want to be evil anymore.Because Snape was just fine with being evil.  He bullied children and terrified them.  Nevilles greatest fear was Snape not the witch that tortured his parents into insanity.  What a douche!And near the end of his life Dumbledore asks if Snape has come to care for Harry and the answer is a resounding NO.  He still doesnt give a flying shit about Harry.  Just Lily.  If new evidence showed up that Harry wasnt actually Lilys son that he got switched in the aftermath of Voldys demise with some other baby Snape would abandon Harry Im sure because he never once cared.  Its only Lily he cares about.Hero a man of distinguished courage or ability admired for his brave deeds and noble qualities.Snape has courage and ability and has done many brave deeds.  But if that were enough to call someone a hero then Bellatrix would be a hero too wouldnt she?  She was certainly quite brave.  So was Barty Crouch Jr.Why arent they heroes?Because of the and noble qualities part of the definition of hero.Noble of an exalted moral or mental character or excellenceWell Snape fails that in spades.  Hes an asshole hes selfish and his selfless acts are motivated by a deeper selfishness at his core.Consider he is saving Harry for Lily but would Lily thank him for the way he bullies Harry?  Hell no.  So he sure isnt doing everything he does for Lily in reality.  Hes doing what he does for Lily in a way that makes HIM feel better.

1686539,0,t3_2donm9,Ive been of the opinion that Fawkes gave the feathers at the same time  not sure if he was in Dumbledores possession or not but thats beside the point.Ollivander in the story states what he calls the  supreme cores unicorn hair dragon heartstring and phoenix feathers. He alludes that other cores are used like kelpie but they are substandard.JK said this of Phoenix feather coresThis is the rarest core type. Phoenix feathers are capable of the greatest range of magic though they may take longer than either unicorn or dragon cores to reveal this. They show the most initiative sometimes acting of their own accord a quality that many witches and wizards dislike.Phoenix feather wands are always the pickiest when it comes to potential owners for the creature from which they are taken is one of the most independent and detached in the world. These wands are the hardest to tame and to personalize and their allegiance is usually hard won.So I think that no matter when the wands were made the first one chose Voldemort because he had the potential to be an exceptional wizard that fit the personality of the wand and his innate abilities. The second wand chose Harry because it sensed the same attributes within Harry  but is it due to Harry himself or because the wand sensed the part of Voldemort in Harry?,harrypotter,cjrr3sv,19,t5_2qiqi

1694353,0,t1_cjsam9j,I dont know how the two different groups of magic would interact but Gandalf has plenty of defensive spells that given the relative power of the two combatants I would bet could take the killing curse. Also LoTR has mind altering spells. The enchantments on the rings are the best known example but all of the Nazgl have a kind of aura that causes terror and eventual death. The elves also possess a few manners of bewitchment if memory serves. Gandalf is no doubt knowledgable about most of these. If we start bringing allies into this too by the end of the Return of the King Gandalf has the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor at his back in addition to any remaining elven forces. If that isnt enough Gandalf is pretty tight with the eagles who rescue him from Orthanc and help engage the last  Nazgl at the Battle of the Morannon. Gandalf is also no fool. While he would feel terrible condemning any prisoners of Voldemort to death he would also realize that if Voldemort can kill thousands of hobbits at will he would likely kill thousands more. Gandalf would just fuck up Voldemort. Keep in mind that Gandalf lead thousands of men to their deaths in a war against Sauron that didnt have a great chance of succeeding knowing that it would be worse to leave Sauron with any power.,harrypotter,cjsqjgs,1,t5_2qiqi

1697781,0,t1_cjlu7s2,Acer Lamnia The Sharpening CharmThe Sharpening Charm is a relatively simple household charm taught in Fourth Year Charms. It is one of the Charms covered in the Household Charms sections of a Charms OWL. The purpose of the charm is to reapply an edge to any sort of bladed implement be it potions knife or wood axe. The reason the simple and lowpowered charm is not taught until fourth year is that the second stage of casting the spell requires the caster to hold the charm for as long as it takes to apply the charm to the blade to be sharpened. By fourth year students have had enough practice holding charms for extended periods of time that there is minimal risk of a student dropping the charm early and scoring the tip of their wand with a blade.The casting of the charm is done in two parts. The first movement is two downward diagonal flicks of the wand while speaking the incantation Acer Lamnia. This should if the charm had been performed correctly create a dim blue light at the tip of the casters wand. Once the caster has produced the light the tip of the wand is to be run over the edge of the blade to be sharpened once on each side of the blade. This will not cut into the casters wand as long as the light remains lit. Concentration must be maintained to maintain the light. The charm may be cast nonverbally if the caster has sufficient control and concentration.Of note for the Sharpening Charm is that with enough practice as caster can gain more control over the specific bevel of the edge left by the charm. If the caster is sharpening for example a potions knife and requires a remarkably sharp edge they must hold in their mind an image of the desired edge particularly the angle of its bevel the entire time that they are running the charm over the blade. The process is identical for producing a blunter more robust edge. Casters still learning the charm should keep in mind that if they are manually determining the degree of edge applied by the charm it is possible to ruin a blade by losing concentration part way through application or otherwise changing the image in ones mind during casting.Students are reminded that Goblinforged blades do not require sharpening and in fact many bear enchantments that would interpret the Sharpening Charm as an attempt to tamper with the integrity of the blade thus causing often violent reactions.,harrypotter,cjt62vn,5,t5_2qiqi

1700402,0,t3_2dtms3,According to Pottermore and the wiki there are eleven schools of magic total in the world. We see the three largest in Europe Hogwarts which covers Great Britain probably Wales Durmstrang Germany and that part of the world and Beauxbatons students from Portugal Spain France Romania etc. go there  so its pretty large. According to Pottermore there is a Russian school of magic called Koldovstorits. Pottermore under the wand woods section under the wood cherry a Japanese wizarding school called Mahoutokoro   which means the place of magic  I dont know Japanese but I know Chinese and the kanji is the same... is named. It is said apparently that students there prize cherry wood wands more and if you had one you were elevated to some level of prestige. So they still use wands. I doubt theyd use technology like phones as often...just because wands are arguably according to Ollivander the best way to channel magic. I mean it is possible but I doubt it.An African school is named too namely Weikedu School of Magic and we read of Bills pen pal who goes to a school in Brazil.The Salem Witchs Institute is mentioned  although neither does Pottermore nor the wiki confirms it as one of the eleven schools...it might not even be a school at all just because it has the word Institute doesnt mean its a school Im guessing. Id say there are large cultural differences with how each culture deals with magic. We know of flying carpets and how Arab wizards favor them over brooms. We also can assume that there is a difference in verbal magic among the different cultures.,harrypotter,cjthy5p,2,t5_2qiqi

1737806,0,t3_2e7bqv,JK Rowling addressed this on her old websitegtWhat exactly happened when Voldemort used the Avada Kedavra curse on Harry in the forest?gtAgain Voldemort violated deep laws of magic he did not understand but there is more to it than that.gtHaving taken Harrys blood into himself Voldemort is keeping alive Lilys protective power over Harry. So Voldemort himself acts almost like a Horcrux for Harry  except that the power of Lilys sacrifice is a positive force that not only continues to tether Harry to life but gives Voldemort himself one last chance Dumbledore refers to this last hope in chapter . Voldemort has unwittingly put a few drops of goodness back inside himself if he had repented he could have been healed more deeply than anyone would have supposed. But of course he refused to feel remorse.gtVoldemort is also using the Elder Wand  the wand that is really Harrys. It does not work properly against its true owner no curse Voldemort casts on Harry functions properly neither the Cruciatus curse nor the Killing Curse. The Avada Kedavra curse however is so powerful that it does hurt Harry and also succeeds in killing the part of him that is not truly him in other words the fragment of Voldemorts own soul still clinging to his. The curse also disables Harry severely enough that he could have succumbed to death if he had chosen that path again Dumbledore says he has a choice whether or not to wake up. But Harry does decide to struggle back to consciousness capitalises on Lilys escape route and pulls himself back to the realm of the living.gtIt is important to state that I always saw these kinds of magic the very deepest life and death issues as essentially unscientific in other words there is no Elder Wand  Lilys Blood  Assured Survival formula. What count ultimately are Harry and Voldemorts own choices. They have each been given certain weapons and safeguards but the power of these objects and past happenings lie in how they are understood and how they are used or enacted upon. Harry has a deeper and truer understanding of the meaning of the objects and past events but his greatest powers those that save him are free will courage and moral certainty.,harrypotter,cjy7qdy,6,t5_2qiqi

1762924,0,t1_ck14r4c,Thanks for explaining. I agree that Ron isnt a perfect character by any means but I think in a lot of ways hes the most realistic. Hes overshadowed by a ton of successful siblings and hes overlooked a lot at home. He gets to school and his best friends are the smartest person in the whole school and the most famous person in the whole school. Of course he eventually gets tired of it  I understand his frustration at Harry in book . I agree hes not nice to Luna but I think thats about the reaction that most people would have to her. Its unkind and unfortunate but its no different from the norm. Doesnt make it better at all but Ron is kind of the average guy in a lot of ways which actually makes him more relatable too.  And in the th book lets be honest its very reasonable that Ron bailed  they had no plan no supplies and the Horcrux affected Ron really badly. He also had very low selfesteem  about his relationship with Hermione because remember hes surrounded by people he thinks are way better than him. That scene where the Horcrux taunts Ron is an incredible characterization of Ron and we really get to see exactly what hes been struggling with. I know none of this excuses his behavior  he bailed on his friends although he came back and he was kind of nasty to some of the others. But this at least in my opinion makes him more interesting of a character. ,harrypotter,ck1dfzs,2,t5_2qiqi

There is also the brief scene in which Harry sees her coming and hides and she is looking at tarot cards in a presumably halfdrunk state she does love her cooking sherry as she walks down a hall.  She reads aloud that the card she has drawn suggests the presence of if I remember right a darkhaired man that does not favor the practitioner meaning her.  She stops dead and says Well that cant be right!  So it seems that she has latent talent but either tries too hard and winds up botching it much to her dismay she comes from a line of Seers and longs to be listed among them or she does see and doesnt believe what she sees and dismisses the truth andor her Seer powers are strongest during a Seer trance.  To most she is a fraud yes.  But thats because most people dont know the truth about her prophecy.,harrypotter,ck26k49,1,t5_2qiqi

While I like to be more humble than to say that Im the superior of my company I certainly find myself unusual and perhaps I have the potential for greatness but dont feel the need to flaunt my abilities.As for the dragon core I think the ability to learn quickly is true to me and while they can be easily change allegiance if they are won they always bond with their current owner which is also similar to myself because I can adapt to changing circumstances and always connect deeply with the people that I decide to trust.The length is probably mostly due to my height  because I dont have a particularly large personality but who knows.This wand paired with my sorting into Slytherin had my worried at first but once I got past my preconceived notions about the house and the wand I was happy.

But why is it so unreasonable to also assume that some prophecies could be unfulfilled due to various circumstances?Seeing is not a perfect art because humans are unpredictable  you can See something that might happen but theres no guarantee that it will happen  people die people change their minds people change.Between the prophecy being made and it coming to pass the person could have changed entirely and neither the Seer nor the prophecy record would know any different.In the short term this is unlikely but in the long term this is perfectly possible. So using my example what if Harry becomes a vegetarian between the time that the prophecy regarding his chicken dinner is made and the time when he should eat his chicken dinner?

2050655,0,t3_2i9yrg,I love the Harry Potter series as much as the next person however speculation about a character that doesnt even exist losing out because Harry was given the position.  I dont see the point worrying about this.  We are not talking about a real injustice here.  I mean JKR didnt even write that someone was miffed about losing out.  Even then its a fictional character.  I think honestly if there were tryouts yes Harry should never have gotten the shot as a first year.  But lets assume his nd year he tries out.  Hes going to get the Seeker position.  Now this new Seeker got one year and lost it to the new kid.  Okay he got his shot however he has to live with being defeated by the new kid.Please understand I know what you mean about losing out on something when you never get a chance.  That does stink and is unfortunate that it happens.  However we are talking about a fantasy world.  Dont let the real world taint how you view the magical one.  It takes away from the story and can ruin things.  I mean if we want to delve into hurt feelings how about Stan Shunpikes parents when they find out he was killed?  Or the nameless people that died at Voldemorts hands.  The list goes on and on of wrongs never brought to justice.Thankfully its just fantasy and those people dont actually exist.  TLDR  Its all make believe and feelings dont exist in a fantasy world.  No sense worrying about it.,harrypotter,cl0hf5i,4,t5_2qiqi

2352862,0,t1_cm2in56,yes thats what originally happened.  Rowling stated as much as far as the Malfoys are concerned at least.  their wealth DID come from muggle exploitation.  but thats in the past now ever since the international statute of wizarding secrecy made it so that wizardkind cant interfere in the muggle world.  their power now is entirely attributed to the fact that theyve created a system in which they consistently remain on top thanks to all those illgotten funds they earned back before the statute was set in place.  how theyre managing to sustain this manner of wealth I have no idea.  when it comes to the Malfoys at least we know that they deal in the wizarding black market.  but I doubt this applies to all of the rich families of the wizarding world.  some are just riding on the coattails of their predecessors without actively screwing up anyone directly.  at the very least I doubt the Potters did much exploitation.,harrypotter,cm2iwit,1,t5_2qiqi

Many wizards will spend time in the muggle world because there isnt that much to do in their own world. With the exception of Hogsmeade most wizarding settlements are intertwined with muggle ones so if you wanted to go down to the pub youd either have to go by floo powder off to an approved wizarding bar or just pop down the street to the muggle one. Some wizards are muggle born so they would have friends and family in the muggle world and they may want to live a largely muggle life. While some wizards are very cut off from the muggle world there are still plenty with very close ties.,harrypotter,cmctz8i,2,t5_2qiqi

So it would not be odd for a few of them to start attending a boarding school in Scotland as everyone starts attending another school at that age. I recall that Harry and Dudley were going to attend two different secondary schools anyway if Harry hadnt gone to Hogwarts and I think some muggleborn Justin FinchFletchley? mentions in book two which secondary school he would have gone to if not to Hogwarts.,harrypotter,cmfpsjh,13,t5_2qiqi

JKR is quite explicit about the contrast between Snape and Voldemort the latter can not love and is pure evil but Snape can love and is shielded from becoming purely evil. I do agree about his relationship to James I agree that he envied James but I would word it differently he wanted to be LIKE JP but not be JP himself.

2759380,0,t3_2rn5it,The math in Harry Potter drives me nuts.. The house points at the end of the year seem really small especially the way that points get thrown around every year. In book  Gryffindor wins with  points. If you consider that people get around  points for doing something good during the year and that each house has about  students  boy and  girls per grade. If at least one student is getting  points per class for their house for each grade and there are maybe  classes a day. Each grade is getting  points a day or  points a day for their house. Assuming people get into trouble during the day I dont think it is unreasonable for the average per day to be  points per day. Considering an average school year of  days that at least amounts to    points. Thats without stuff like points for winning for Quidditch and any other big points people get throughout the year. Does that seem more reasonable?. Maybe its just my perception but there seem to be way more students in the movies than should actually be at the school. This may be an error on my part but if I recall correctly there is only one dorm for each year per gender. Harry lives in only has around  other guys in his year. That means there are  per year per house  guys  girls making only  per year for a total of  years being  students. That means every class should only have  students which seems reasonable since usually a class is two houses combined. This also means that  students make up the house tables whereas it seems like a lot more in the movie. Is it just my perception or is it off? I need to go rewatch the movies.. My biggest pet peeve is the scoring for Quidditch.  points for the Snitch is crazy. I have had this complaint before and someone mentioned that in ancient times brooms were a lot slower and it was not uncommon for matches to last weeks so this point system is not unreasonable. However with modern broomsticks the scoring is way off. Cricket had a similar issue with people getting bored with the test matches so they introduced T cricket to change the dynamics and make games go much faster. I understand the need to stand true to tradition but many of the modern sports we have today evolved into what they are they werent just static unchangeable things. I know soccer has been struggling to stay modern with many wanting to keep it the same and others wanting to make it more exciting by increasing the goal size to increase the amount of scoring and this kind of a change is more on that level but the way Quidditch currently stands the majority of the game is time wasting until the Seeker catches the Snitch which is sad since Quidditch is an interesting and inventive sports idea.. While Im on the topic of math I am sure this has been mentioned before but dont the students need to learn some of that. I understand the need to learn magic and the complete lack of knowledge that wizards have for anything muggle especially electricity and clothes but isnt a school supposed to help prepare students for the future one that is more and more likely to have them interacting with muggle regularly. What about muggleborns that go back to live and work and study in the muggle world what do they do? Study muggle classes on the side?,harrypotter,cnhqbia,66,t5_2qiqi

The director must work with the script. Columbus is the most limited of those cited when it comes to directionhe is far too literal. I didnt care for the direction in general across the board but the screenwriting was the main issue. The root issue of that is the forhire screenwriting and direction choices made by the exec producers.I have no issue with screenwriters making a film that stands on its own via making ideal changes in order stay true to the soul of the work while translating to a different medium for another fantasy example the LOTR adaptations. In fact this is how adaptation should be approached.Another issue is that WB and AOLTW always saw the series as delightful but childish despite GOF already being out so they didnt have a vision for the on screen continuity that would become popular at that time starting with another of their properties which internally was less emphasized at the time before its release  LOTR.,harrypotter,cni4iw6,1,t5_2qiqi

2765119,0,t3_2rllq7,Ever since reading that Lavender Brown went to the Yule Ball with Seamus Finnigan I was never able to shake the fact that Seamus probably had an ongoing crush on Lavender.  I realize there is absolutely no proof within the book to substantiate my claim other than this one date but I built this entire back story in my mind while reading the books  Seamus asked Lavender to the ball and then Harry asked Lavender if she would go with Ron.  Lavender goes pink and giggles because she actually finds Ron somewhat cute although she certainly wont admit it until two years from that date.  However Seamus who is actually trying to impress and curry favor with Lavender is failing and he notices that she looks at Ron a little too often and laughs at his admittedly funny comments a little too loudly.  Seamus is jealous of Ron from this point onward.  Something Im sure would have thrown Ron for a loop as he would never think anyone would ever be jealous of him.  Dean who had always found Parvati attractive as he voiced in the th year claiming that Parvati and Padma were the best looking in their year would be a perfect double date candidate.  Seamus and Lavender Dean and Parvati.  But of course this is all fantasy in Seamus Finnigans mind because Lavender will always view him as immature silly and hot tempered. And that is my own personal philosophy of GOFs back story.  It goes on but Id rather not bore everyone to tears.,harrypotter,cnidt2c,3,t5_2qiqi

2826021,0,t1_cnpa4oh,In OoTP he doesnt really play the biggest part he steps in as necessary but for the most part hes a background character and chooses to be as such in order to distance himself from Harry and hence distance Harry from Ministry criticism. In HBP he takes a much more active role directly instructing Harry on Voldemort commanding Snape to teach him Legillimency to keep his dreams and thoughts safe from Voldemort teaching Harry about Horcruxes and finally taking him to retrieve a Horcrux grooming him for the next year of hunting Horcruxes and his final battle against Voldemort. He also commands Snape to kill him and sees Draco Malfoys attempts at evil and makes no attempt to stop him. Dumbledore makes many of the decisions that influence the plot the most. Voldemort commands Draco and his Death Eaters towards the battle at the end and has a lot of influence on things going on in the background attachks on both Muggles and Wizards and slowly taking over the Ministry. However his actions are arguably not as influential on the plot of HBP alone as Dumbledores. An antagonist is not always the bad guy but simply the person whose force drives the protagonist towards specific actions. An example would be Disneys Frozen wherein Elsa is the major antagonist but Hans is the villain admittedly not the best example but easy to understand. ,harrypotter,cnpbaog,5,t5_2qiqi

Problem was I understood they died but not fully comprehending they were gone for ever I suppose.Its hard to explain probably because I never have lost anyone close to me to death.It also didnt help I have raced through the books at every read and not haved to wait for every release because they were almost all out by the time I started let alone got to the last one.I also have no older siblings so back then I knew nothing at all really about life as a teenager so all the hormone induced stuff was never fully understood by me. Reading them again now I understand certain actions more and etc. The shellshock for Harry in OotP wasnt noticed by me either back then because I was oblivious to it mostly.The main reason I regret this is because now that I know all the results I cant go and read the series again without having all the knowledge in the back of my mind.,harrypotter,co05zjs,1,t5_2qiqi

Unless he got a unicorn farm  he needs to buy it from someone else. And pretty sure theres no legal way of getting dragon heartstring in UK so probably he got it from eg Romania?  Phoenix are incredibly rare.So we knew  of them is from Dumbledores and probably he has to hunt in places where phoenix are known to be appeared at.Electricity  None  of course.Staff costs   I guess its a family business but still including Ollivander it might be    persons into it.My guess is the Ollivanders get a pretty good portion from the Ministryand try to be very cost conscious No fancy things inside other than wands.And presumably they invests the money they accumulated over the years into something else.,harrypotter,co7pvls,1,t5_2qiqi

3031042,0,t3_2uvqwx,Alexandra Quick might be of interest to you. There are also some particularly interesting head canons if you search the subreddit for past posts on this.Some people have pointed out that theres no evidence that Salem Witchs Institute is even a school it could simply be an organization of some kind. Which is very much in keeping with historical New England.My head canon is that theres a school in the SouthSouthwest area a school in California and a school in New England. There are various magical communities with roots in nonEuropean magical cultures some of them very insular and others more mainstream. But the new England school is considered the best and kind of the standard. As someone who has been to Salem I love the idea of the wizarding community still being headquartered in Salem because Salem has basically built their brand on the Salem witch trials. There are haunted houses witches on the police cars and the local high school is called Witchcraft Heights. Halloween is huge there and they get tons of tourists. If you want to find magicrelated kitsch or even newage occultwicca stuff Salem is where its at. So it would be hilarious and very fitting if there was a real magical community mixed in with all of the tourists and local college students that work at the witch museum. My head canon is that the school is located elsewhere in New England but that Salem is to the American wizards what London is to British wizards. A prominent member of the fledging American wizarding community establishes a school in a rural area thats relatively close to Canada drawing heavily from the British model just as muggles did.  The school eventually becomes the feeder school for the American wizarding community and SalemBoston area becomes the headquarters for commerce and government.However the experience of the Salem witch trials leads the Americans to be much more cautious and the American wizarding institutions are not as integrated into muggle cities as they are in the UK. They have experimented a lot more with magically enlarging spaces. Because of the size of the US and the bicoastal population theyve will have done more experimenting with transportation as well.,harrypotter,coc5yq7,10,t5_2qiqi

However he chose Harry thus making him the other half of the prophecy. Once his decision was made that was the end all be all. If he had managed to kill Harry then and there he would have won and the rest of the prophecy would become null and void. Neville does not simply become become the chosen one. Harry remains the chosen one because Voldemort chose him.,harrypotter,cocctof,3,t5_2qiqi

3043737,0,t1_codgtdd,Yes I like this. They could rewrite the law so that underage wizards can practice magic if theyre being supervised by a wizard who is of age. In the case of muggle borns home for the summer thered have to be an agreement in writing to keep their child from performing magic in front of other muggles. In all cases thered have to be info about what to do in case of spells gone wrong or emergencies and a section about fines for rules being broken which become more costly the more work the ministry has to do with memory modifications or cleanup etc. The magic used currently to enforce the law should stay put so that spells can be monitored.

There are quite a few HP fans who try to excuse Jamess rampant bullying and spoiled bratty behavior by saying well he eventually stopped doing it and joined the Order to fight Voldemort. Yet that doesnt excuse the mental and emotional scars left by his bullying on Snape and other Hogwarts students who ended up becoming Jamess victims. Especially since studies have shown that the invisible scars of such bullying can last a lifetime among other mental and emotional problems well into adulthood in bullying victims.Well eventually Snape joined the Order and Dumbledores side as well.

3049855,0,t1_coe34wd,Ive just been to your office Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight so I took a gobletful along.This is what Severus says. Why would he say something like that if it is not true? I cant think of a reason why that would be. He has you know pockets and such in his robes where he can store things. It is also not clear if Severus only went to Remuss office to bring him the potion in the first place or because he had already left a full goblet in the Great Hall or the staff room. It doesnt really matter though because Severus would in any case have brought Remus the potion in time had he stayed in his office and thus fulfilled his duties.There is no plausible way he could have known in Remuss office who else was in the shack as the map does not show the shack and he never says that capturing Sirius is the reason he came there in the first place  on the contrary his wording implies that this was pure luck. The only plausible explanation I can think of why Severus followed Remus into the shack is because he cared for Remuss welfare.Why he waits so long to reveal himself I do not know. It is possible that he knows approximately when the moon will rise. But listening to Remuss story meant that he found out about the animagus transformation Sirius is capable of. It gave him a better idea of the situation. In addition there are two wizards there that he considers dangerous plus three that he believes to be confounded so its natural to hesitate in ones estimation of the danger of the situation. And yes there is evidence to support that. When Harry wakes up in the hospital wing Severus says Black had bewitched them I saw it immediately. A Confundus Charm to judge by their behavior.Yes he is clearly in panic and cannot think very clearly. Would you not be when you are in the company of a werewolf in a full moon night and a person you believe to be a mass murderer? In an emergency situation like that it is more important to protect oneself and the students than to listen to an explanation. It requires immediate action of some kind.A few months before that scene Severus had caught Harry with an enchanted parchment that insulted Severus in the names of Moony Wormtail Padfoot and Prongs and Remus claimed that this was probably a product of a joke shop. Severus obviously knows whose nickname Padfoot is and he knows that Remus knows  please tell me how he could not have come to the conclusion that Remus was working with Sirius that year?It is indeed not directly backed by canon that the Dementors Kiss is the punishment for escaping from Azkaban but given that Barty Crouch Jr indeed received it and Sirius Black was stated to be sentenced to it according to Remus in chapter  not Severus it is very likely.,harrypotter,coe46jt,3,t5_2qiqi

YouKnowWho probably stems from the fact that in the beginning little to no one probably knew who was actually in charge of the Death Eaters. In Dumbledores own words Tom Riddle was unrecognizable from the student he had once been or the shop boy he had once worked as. So everyone probably just started referring to the leader as YouKnowWho. Later on the nickname would gain recognition and fear with the onset of the First Wizarding War as the Death Eaters started to become a larger and more terrifying threat.,harrypotter,cofdg8o,-2,t5_2qiqi

And then I realized that I was ignoring a lot of the other shitty behavior from the other characters Harry included and then I realized that this was likely quite intentional.But yeah complex characters like Snape are really enjoyable to read and I am glad for that fact.EDIT And Im kind of happy that Harry was not a girl who looked like his mum because that would have been creepy as hell.,harrypotter,coffqoq,3,t5_2qiqi

I think that the Elders wand loyalty made it so that Voldemorts spell could not work on Harry backfiring into Voldemort and destroying the last remnant of his soul. And I dont think that it was meant to be that Harry could not die while Voldemort lived or vice versa. I think Harry could not die a natural death as long as he remained a Horcux. Or at least the vessel that contained the Horcrux could not die wed have to first establish what constitutes a soul in the HP world and what happens when the body diesthe soul dies. ,harrypotter,cogm4ts,3,t5_2qiqi

3175981,0,t1_cor0gez,I have a problem with this theory because unlike the locket and other horcruxes there wasnt another soul acting as a buffer.  It makes sense as to why Harry is such a bitch sometimes but I dont think that prolonged exposure would have the same effect in his case as it would the locket  especially because contact with him was fairly limited.  The locket was stored in the Black house for ages and apparently never turned Sirius into a raging dickhole so that logic doesnt really follow for me.I think its possession that causes it.  The Dursleys never really claimed Harry as their family or their property or anything like that  they were very distant and handsoff with him and actively rejected him on a number of occasions.  Sirius didnt consider the Black house at all his just where he happened to live  so the locket didnt affect him.  Meanwhile the trio was actively taking responsibility for the locket during the time they wore it and only the wearer  or owner  was affected by it not the others who were in extremely close proximity.This would coincidentally explain why the Weasleys suffered more and more with each passing year as they grew closer to Harry and adopted him into the family.  ,harrypotter,cor6tv3,20,t5_2qiqi

He should be the only Death Eater who could enter it but not reveal its location to anyone else until Hermione dies.

3208485,0,t1_co7s3xw, What is the name of your proposed profession?Magical Musicologist and Audiological Specialist or MMA Specialist        Give a description of the profession.First explored by Alamarcus Morgan a subpar healer training at St. Mungos a MMA Specialist will use the creation and execution of music to assist in the magical and spiritual healing of afflicted patients.  While MMA Therapy has little effect on those at the mercy of malicious potions and hexes that affect individual body parts it has shown success in initiating healing of mind sicknesses particularly charms and spells that block misdirect or befuddle thoughts.  MMA Specialists will be called in after initial healing visits for patients that fit the above criteria and show suboptimal improvement after standard treatment.  After a consultation with the patient and the attending healer the Specialist will need to determine which auditory stimulus will target the area of the brain that is magically affected and will structure a composition  that incorporates those tones and harmonies that will weaken the magic.  While the Wizard Morgan started by composing healing music on the lute modern day MMA Specialists will be versed in at least two dozen instruments.   Bells are especially beneficial against cases of befuddlement and blocked memories while wind chimes and enchanted breezes are more successful for misdirected or clouded thoughts.  Other entrylevel instruments include spellbound pianos harps guitars and harmonicas singing toads lutes as well as enchanted waterscapse amp sandscapes.  Specialization in voice as well as the use of Mimicking  Jungle Snipes to have the voice of loved ones ever present in the room of the patient requires additional certifications. List the O.W.LsN.E.W.Ts you will need to achieve and the required grades to move forward in this career.    OWL RequirementsCharms Outstanding    Potions Outstanding    Defense Against the Dark Arts Exceeds Expectations    Herbology Exceeds Expectations    Arithmancy Exceeds Expectations    Care of Magical Creatures Exceeds Expectations    Transfiguration Acceptable    Astronomy Ancient Runes History of Magic Divination and Muggle Studies No RequirementNEWT RequirementsCharms Outstanding    Potions Outstanding    Arithmancy Exceeds Expectations    Herbology Acceptable    Care of Magical Creatures Acceptable    Defense Against the Dark Arts Acceptable    Astronomy Ancient Runes History of Magic Divination Transfiguration and Muggle Studies No Requirement Explain how this profession will benefit the Wizarding population.Musicology and Auditory Studies is a rapidly growing field worthy of a codified position and official apprenticeship program as a subdivision of healers.  Since MMA Specialists would not administer any potions or direct charms and spells to the patient beyond basic healing proved through success OWLS this provides a healing role for witches and wizards who have the passion for healing but struggle with the mastery of potions andor Dark Arts required to succeed in traditional healing roles.  It also has promise to assist in the healing of mind sicknesses of its various forms which the healing profession struggles to consistently improve.  This is also allows for a branch of muggle outreach and philanthropy in healing since MMA is not detectable as magic as long as magical instruments are not in view.   Assisting muggles with extreme psychiatric disorders fits into the current growing campaign to anonymously assist muggles in a hope to improve relationships and perception of the muggle community.   List any restrictions or guidelines that you believe should be made by the ministry to those wishing to practice this profession.The Ministry already has strict guidelines in place for healers which should still be used with the exception of potions which will rarely be used by MMA Specialists.  Arithmancy is the one area that is more important for MMA Specialists to understand over the traditional healing roles since the numerical importance can guide compositions.  Once tones and harmonies are established to soften the hold of the jinx curse or other magical impairment Arithmancy is used to determine how long each therapy session will be the structure of the composition and how many instruments should be used for maximum effect.Tell me about a wizard who tried and failed in the field.Alamarcus Morgan attempted to instruct his first pupil Witch Callista Peakes in the ways of magical composition in mood altering as a platform for malady correction.  However Callista lacked the patience and selfcontrol to master the skill and created a composition that involved tuning forks an enchanted waterscape and brass hand bells with unicorn hair detailing.   Unfortunately in an attempt to resolve a fight involving herself and her husband of  years Ms. Peakes created a melody that pacified both her her husband and neighbors on each side of their home to a suggestible state.  Each affected witch and wizard seemed to follow the first suggestion they encountered after the music began.   Mr. Jonathan Peakes was found listening intently to his wife who in turn was staring at him.  Thier neighbors the Blishwicks were each engaged in various household chores.  The children were perpetually making their beds while the parents had continually made dinner for the family.  They were discovered two days later by Alamarcus Morgan who sought her out when Ms. Peakes did not come to work.  Once the bells had been silenced all parties began to regain their autonomy which resulted in Callista losing her apprenticeship as well as further distressing her marriage.   The Blishwicks had made more than  pies of various compositions six soups three forms of pork seven salads  pounds of cooked riceand chicken tacos by the time the music stopped.  Most of their meals were donated to St. Mungos Hospital in thanks for ending their culinary compulsion.,harrypotter,couk440,1,t5_2qiqi

3300950,0,t1_cp4c8dy,I think Snape couldnt see that they were drifting  he only wanted to be Lilys friend and I dont think he had much experience of other real friendships so he probably didnt see when Lily started to extricate herself.  And I think she had started to extricate herself.  I think she would always have a soft spot for the boy who introduced her to magic but I think he was a challenging friend  certainly socially and thats played out because none of her other friends understand why she bothers with him.  In fairness to Snape he actually takes Lilys rejection on the chin.  I think he was devastated but he doesnt appear to have continually pestered her.  I guess we wont ever know but you feel that if there had been more scenes with him being rejected by Lily they mightve made it into the pensieve seeing as she was his motivation.If hed been a stronger person or someone with more of a support network I think he wouldve walked away from the Death Eaters and chosen Lily...but he didnt have anyone else.  His family if they were still around wouldve been no help and he seemed unpopular with the rest of his year group.  So I think Lilys rejection of him inadvertently propelled him deeper into the Death Eater mantra.  Now he had no reason not to get in deep and he probably thought he didnt have any other avenues open to him  and the Death Eaters who might have had reservations about his friendship with the mudblood wouldve been satisfied that their friendship had ended.,harrypotter,cp4j9a9,4,t5_2qiqi

3315232,0,t3_2y2y1n,I have a few Remus Lupin is an exceptionally calm werewolf with high control of his tendencies and this is not at all the norm. Most werewolves become feral beasts all the time like Fenrir Greyback and the laws against them make perfect sense to protect the population. Lupin is just the one unfortunate victim who didnt deserve this crap. Tom Riddle does not care at all about pureblood supremacy. He just hijacked that movement for his own selfish purposes. This is why he has no problems associating with Werewolves and halfbloods and is just as likely to kill off pureblood families as muggles. He just played the part to get their support and their money but doesnt give a shit about their blood status nor does he show any respect for their ancestry. Percy Weasley was a sleeper agent for Dumbledore inside the ministry and used his influence inside the department to save the lives of thousands of muggleborn wherever he could. Think Schindlers list However they decided that Fred George Ron and Ginny were either too young or too immature to keep this a secret so they were kept in the dark. Arthur still visited him every day at work however. Draco Malfoy once had a few older siblings that mysteriously disappeared when it turns out they were squibs. Thats why Lucius is so pissed at Arthur showing off seven children with magical potential hes just jealous. Likewise Nevilles uncle did not accidentally drop him from a high window he deliberately forced Neville to either unlock his magic or he got rid of the squib if he didnt.

3350525,0,t3_2yjvrf,gt I wondered if a student who is sorted at the age of eleven could change enough that he might want to be in another house?Perhaps but the fact of the matter is that students cannot get reSorted. Each student is only Sorted once. It doesnt matter if they change their minds afterwards they have to make the best out of the House and group of students they were Sorted into. I think some HP fans also tend to underestimate the Hats ability to see where a person truly belongs and I disagree that the Hat can be outwitted. Unless a student is trained in Occlumency highly unlikely then the Hat would be able to tell exactly what personality traits and qualities that student had and where the student might fit best at Hogwarts. Or what House might be best to develop the childs character best according to their desires and values.Take for example Tom Marvolo Riddle and Neville Longbottom. When we see Tom Riddle in the orphanage he wants to be special and he hates the thought of being ordinary or just like everyone else. He also seeks power over others wanting to be infamous by acting in the shadows and manipulating people to obey him. Thats quintessentially Slytherin and thus the Hat put Riddle in that House according to Riddles traits goals and desires. Neville Longbottom on the other hand didnt think he was good enough for Gryffindor so he asked to be Sorted into Hufflepuff. While Hufflepuff would have been a good choice for Neville he also wouldnt have had as much opportunity to develop his character Hufflepuffs are already stereotyped as good at Herbology and loyal and just. The Hat also saw Nevilles bravery even if he didnt see it himself and his potential to grow beyond stereotypes in Gryffindor so the Hat placed him in the latter House.gt IIRC the sorting hat belonged to Godric Gryffindor do you think that the other founders were sceptical at first?No. At the time of the Hats creation Gryffindor and Slytherin were still good friends before their ultimate fallout. If all four Founders had not been pleased with the Hats purpose it would not have been used to Sort students.gt Lets say someones parents move to the UK and the student had to change schools if that is possibleIf someone is born outside the UK they would be unknown to Hogwarts and thus not receive hisher letter. A magical child must be born in the UK in order for hisher birth to be recorded by Hogwartss system and later receive hisher letter of acceptance.There is also no evidence in the books to suggest that Hogwarts accepts new students past age  transfer students or anything other than the system already shown to be in place. While it is possible that Hogwarts may have accepted student refugees from mainland Europe and Durmstrang due to Grindelwalds reign of terror during WWII and some fans speculate that Antonin Dolohov may have been one I think that would have ended with Grindelwalds defeat.gt Does that student have to attend the sorting ceremony with the younger students at the start of a new semester? Or do you think that they can put on the hat in Dumbledores office maybe during the holidays?This is mostly open to interpretation but my guess would be that all students regardless of age would all be Sorted at the startofterm feast.,harrypotter,cpa6nui,11,t5_2qiqi

As for the time frame it took Harry the better part of a year to destroy the horcruxes plenty of time for Voldy to find the wand. In fact the only hoop he had to jump through was figuring out who the thief in Gregorovitchs memories was and considering that is about as much information as Harry had about the cup only Voldy was only looking for one object not four of them.

3443962,0,t1_cpks4fy,Have a quick crashcourse in the world of Harry Potter ShippingThe first thing that you need to know is that relationships between characters are often referred to as ships.  The act of advocating for or writing fanfiction henceforth fic based on a particular ship is known as shipping. A person can have many ships canon those which happen in the source material and noncanon Actually there are gradations between that HarryGinny is canon or a ship which sailed HarryHermione is not canon and a ship which was sunk by JKR she later recovered it though in a recent and infamous interview RemusSirius is not canon but a strong case can be made that it is implicit in canon.... Ships can be serious or crack.  A crack ship or crack pairing is one in which the pairing is in some way absurd unlikely or even disturbing famous examples are HagridDobby and Hogwarts CastleGiant Squid.A persons preferred ship for a particular character can be known as their OTP One true pairing.  The later coinage OT one true threesome means exactly the same just for a menage a trois rather than a couple.The other thing that you need to know about shipping is that there are two ways of referring to a particular ship.  The standardised method is mostly in use in this thread which is the characters names involved separated by a  sign.  Thus DracoHarry is a relationship between Draco and Harry while SiriusRemus is a relationship between Sirius and Remus.  Easy isnt it?  Slightly complicating the things is the fact that most characters have fairly standardised abreviations so those relationships would in fact usually be written as DH and SBRL respectively.  In general the major characters of Harrys generation are usually referred to by a single initial Hermione is Hr to avoid confusion with Harry and other major characters are referred to by first and last initial.  Minor characters are sometimes refered to just by first or sometimes last if unambiguous name.  Rare characters are referred to by full name thus LeanneKatie for Leanne Katie Bells friend from HBP and Katie Bell.Conventionally in some fandoms though not noticeably in the HP one in mm ships the first name denotes the top.  Thus DH would be Draco fucking Harry but HD would be Harry fucking Draco. Likewise it would be conventional in Ds relationships for the Dom to be named first and capitalised and the sub to be second uncapitalised thus Dh.The thankfully rarer method of refererring to ships might be thought of as the customary rather than systematic naming.  In this method some ships have accepted names in the fandom which are often prefixed with SS for slash ship and HMS for het ship though Im not sure exactly what the abbreviation is held to stand for punning on the other meaning of the word ship.  These come from many sources portmenteaus Drarry and Snarry are DracoHarry and SnapeHarry respectively Harmony is HarryHermione which is a slightly less direct portmenteau references to well known fics with these ships Guns and Handcuffs is a now outdated term for DH based on a fic which IIRC was based around auror!Harry or punny allusions to character names Dogstar for SiriusRemus for instance.  You dont really need to know many of these in todays HP fandom.Oh one last thing slash refers to mm ships. het to mf its short for heterosexual and femmeslash or sometimes delightfully saffic a pun on sapphic to ff ships.  Characters canon sexualities are routinely ignored in the case of e.g. Dumbledore who is occassionally shipped with McGonagall or broadened no one really believes that JKR intended to write Harry as bi but theres enough evidence to suggest that she did write him as bi intentionally or not! in pursuit of favoured ships.,harrypotter,cpku59c,6,t5_2qiqi

Snape was a special case. Sirius and James hated Snape so much that Remus thought it could ruin their friendship if he took Snapes side over theirs. Not that it makes it ok but if they had done that to anyone else I really think Remus would have stood up to them.Also im pretty sure that they chose prefects by selecting a boy and girl from each house in each year from fifth onward.So unless there was another boy in their year we didnt know about Remus is the best option out of all of them.James and Sirius were obviously out for being trouble makers and Peter was too much of a follower.,harrypotter,cpl89q1,2,t5_2qiqi

3491657,0,t3_3089vm,Ive written about this before and my opinion has been changing. Was her response a little snarky? Maybe. Without fans you fail dont forget but none of us can really understand where she is coming from.  She created this character from scratch.  Dumbledore is a part of her regardless of our opinions on his sexuality.  So naturally she would take it personally when people question her choice to make him one thing or another and shes done it often enough that shes becoming impatient with the potential ignorance from her fans.  I do understand the confusion some readers have because it may have been unexpected but tweeting an author in judgement of her favorite character is no way to handle that confusion.  Did his sexuality need to be included in the series?  I say yes and in more than subtle references!  I think the stories would have been a huge force for change if it was revealed a little clearer early on.  Also we have to recognize that she had publishers who may have played a part in toning down his sexuality in earlier drafts because it wasnt approved by a youth panel or some nonsense.  To those who are stronger on their stance against this remember that gay people are still very marginalized and so are those who support them. I say we let it rest already.,harrypotter,cpq9va9,9,t5_2qiqi

Hence them not being a big deal.gtAt least it was to me when I read it.Nah it didnt cause he wasnt revealed as gay when you read it.gtGay kids need role models and heroes they can identify with. Okay. Well if that was her intention she should have made him gay in the books. If a black man and a women are apparently being used to overthrow something without hiding it then why not a gay man? Why didnt she state it in the books? Its not like Kingsly wasnt outright black in the books and only revealed after.gtSo to reject it because its not part of your headcanon comes off as sounding a bit selfish. I dont really care. I could say to everyone who dislikes Ron that its selfish not to because hes ginger and ginger people need to know they can grow up and get the girl in the end. Its not selfish to dislike an aspect of a story just because some people see meaning in it. In fact id say its selfish to goaround telling people they cant dislike not deny like you claim I did an aspect of a story because some kid somewhere needs a rolemodel. gtThat doesnt give you the right to deny that facet of the story.Wasnt in the story though.gtJK Rowling who is obviously the author of the series and the only person in a position to make such a claimI follow the Death of the Author mindset so I dont think her interviews are relevant to the story.gtThe story wouldnt have unfolded the way it did if Dumbledore was not in love with GrindelwaldLike I said I see no reason that has to be sexual love and not brotherly love the way I had seen it for  years prior to her claiming that.

3532058,0,t1_cpuf47z,No actually uciocinanci is correct  the whole entire series relies heavily on the fact that Voldemort gave her the option to live.Theres a subtly here I think you are missing. If Voldemort came into my home with the idea of killing my son and killed me as I shielded my son from the spell no magical protection would be formed. Just as the German woman was not able to protect her children when Voldemort came looking for Gregorovitch. Yes these two woman tried to protect their children in the same way. They both had the choice to stand in front of their children or to run away and protect themselves.The difference is that Voldemort had gone in with the specific idea in his head to not kill Lily. He didnt much care to keep her alive but why not one of his most faithful servants had asked to spare her life. He told her to move aside but Lily refused and because she was becoming annoying and meddlesome he broke his weak promise to Snape and killed her.The difference is not that Lily chose to stand in front of her child but that she chose to stand in front of her child while the murderer asked her to move aside. And above that that he initially meant to spare her life but her actions changed his mind.gt Whats unbelievable is that supposedly nobody has ever sacrificed themselves for a loved one before Lily Potter.Well I dont think it is the first time this has happened. We cant forget that Dumbledore not only recognized the signs immediately but added to Lilys protection so that Harry was safe while living with Petunia. But why would he tell the Ministry or The Prophet? It was to his and Harrys advantage that the reason Harry survived is not wellknown.You could also say Why is Dumbledore the only one who recognized whatd happened?. Here is where I think fault is more appropriately placed rather than Lily being the first or only person to die for a loved one. But to me it seems plausible enough to suppose Dumbledore the cleverest wizard of his time and no one else simply had read or studied or experimented as much as he had. Perhaps other clever witches and wizards were not near Britain and did not have enough of a personal stake in the matter to spare as much thought as Dumbledore did.,harrypotter,cpuvn9p,1,t5_2qiqi

3738587,0,t3_337v3k,I dont think even Voldemort understood the mechanics of horcruxes. He seemed personally affronted that he had been ripped from his body by the rebounding curse. But when I think about it I cant imagine how else they would work.You have your main soul fragment that part that lives in your body and is your main consciousness and that is anchored to the mortal plain by the horcrux which seems to become more remote from you the further away it is and the longer you are parted from it. Voldemort regularly inhabited Nagini but didnt even feel it when the ring was destroyed. When your body dies either naturally or unnaturally your main soul fragment should cross over to the other side but it does not. Then you need to arrange for a new host body which Voldemort eventually did. He was obviously not expecting to need this for some time. If it were me I would have had the required ingredients all ready to go.Honestly I dont know why he didnt have them collected after he came back too just in case. Maybe he did but the whittling down of his horcruxes to  meant that his main soul fragment had no anchor and he never got to cast the horrible graveyard spell again.,harrypotter,cqif8io,2,t5_2qiqi

3767935,0,t3_33jfoq,Hmm who havent people said...I see someone commented about Luna surrounded by her mom and friends and not as an outcast...But I dont necessarily thinks she minds being an outcast. I think maybe she sees herself with her mother and father together and with all of the weird made up things she believes in surrounding on her. Proof in the huge amount of faith she and her dad have.I think Dobby pretty much got what he would see himself as a free elf wearing cool clothes and surrounded by people he loves. Being able to help and protect the people he loves. Which although his story line was sad at least he got that.I read a post about Colin Creevy earlier and he is on my mind. I think he would see himself as friends with Harry and the gang. He would be popular well liked but most importantly respected. He would see himself as somehow showing the brave and noble qualities that defined Gryffindor and to which he was always trying to live up.Draco Malfoy probably sees himself as more talented more intelligent and more respected by his peers but most importantly respected and admired by his father. He definitely was craving some of his fathers affection in the earlier books although I suppose he may have become a little disillusioned with him as some time went on.If Petunia were to look in the mirror she would see herself surrounded by her parents and as a witch who is better than her sister. Her parents would think she was smarter funnier and more talented than her sister and would have more respect for her.Dolores Umbridge ugh would see herself surrounded by cats in charge at the ministry and with a devoted and loyal following who valued order and structure and control as much as she did. If she wasnt the minister herself she might see herself as completely and totally trusted and replied upon by him.Professor Trelawney would see herself as respected by the other professors in the castle in fact she would see herself as revered as a step above the others. Her predictions would be accurate and people would value her input highly. Her class would be required although people would acknowledge that Divination was mostly a gift instead of a skill.I cant really think of the others right now but it was cool to reflect on how Harrys experience with the mirror may have changed as he aged. In the beginning he saw his family whom he has never known. Probably up until the end of the third book when he meets Sirius. Now he sees Sirius in the mirror and the way his life could have been if he lived with him instead of the Dursleys  a place to go home to during every school break in the summer clothes that really fit real food to eat no hatred or abuse. After Sirius dies he feels that cold hard rage toward Voldemort and his followers and his deepest desire is to see him and his followers eliminated or in prison. After he kills Voldemort at the end of the last book he sees himself making a new family with Ginny and surrounded by his loyal friends who fought the whole battle with him.,harrypotter,cqlrth6,5,t5_2qiqi

3832218,0,t1_cqsya72,gt Um but I think that lets not expel this kid who might have to live with his rich spoiled friends parents who will spoil him equally oh the horrors is a particularly terrible argumentIm not sure what you mean by spoiling him equally since its made pretty clear that Siriuss parents werent his biggest fans. From the way Sirius talks about them from the way Kreacher talks about MasterMistresss feelings on Sirius the brief encounters with Mrs. Black and the way Harry makes an explicit comparison between  for Sirius and  for Harry I think its pretty safe to say that Sirius didnt have an easy time.I always thought it was accepted that he had been verbally and perhaps physically abused not to mention how hard they tried to brainwash him but others might disagree.Not to mention that many of those in the death eater crowd are people who he was once socially connected to. They all know who he is and they hate him for being such a terrible pureblood and thumbing his nose at their beliefs. And I think it would be incredibly hard for him to see his baby brother associating with the future death eater crowd and he would probably be a little bit clumsy in his attempts to persuade him to change course.Given what we know of Siriuss character I would be extremely surprised if he avoided getting into any fights during that time period. And I wouldnt blame him to be honest.And I do think that would have an impact.So I do think you could make the argument that Sirius was going through a difficult time.Sirius said he ran away when he was about  according to OP though he later says that he was about Harrys age when he last saw Bellatrix Harry has just turned . Snape also says he proved he was capable of murder at the age of  and theres a separate reference to this event taking place during their fifth year. It never says he ran away during the summer it could easily have been christmas. Im sure Sirius would have preferred to spend christmas elsewhere but his parents dont strike me as the type to give him a choice. So the events happened around the same time though which happened first is sort of hazy. I honestly think its quite logical to say that they might have been more lenient with Sirius because of his problems at home. Dumbledore and McGonagall would have been inclined to be sympathetic.It never says he ran away during the summer it could easily have been christmas. Im sure Sirius would have preferred to spend christmas elsewhere but his parents dont strike me as the type to give him a choice. ,harrypotter,cqt3tfi,2,t5_2qiqi
3838404,0,t1_cqtqwbl,He wasnt incapable of independent thought but thats how Sirius saw him and I dont think he asserted his independence much. We know that he did change his mind after he finished school but Sirius didnt.I also dont think that Reguluss treatment of Kreacher was that much of a departure. Kreacher seemed to adore Siriuss parents and he hated Sirius for disappointing them. Sirius was horrible to Kreacher but imagine how Harry would feel if he was stuck back in Privet Drive and someone kept muttering about how he was a goodfornothing freak with worthless parents who deserved to be locked in his cupboard and moaning about what the Dursleys would say if they could see all of the freaks in their home. He was a bit nicer and a bit softer toward him but I dont get the impression that being nicer to Kreacher was an act of open rebellion. And I do think that Sirius made an effort to changesave Regulus.For one thing he does wholeheartedly believe that hes right and the rest of the family is wrong and from the way the relationship between Sirius and his parentsmother was characterized it seems like Sirius wasnt exactly quiet about his feelings. I think he made his political views very clear to Regulus.Hes also a teenage kid with a temper. I dont think he would be able to let it go. I can  picture him entering a confrontation where its him vs  future death eaters because hes so pissed at Regulus for choosing to hang out with  future death eaters. I have a younger sister to whom Im very close. I would throw myself in front of a train for her. But I cant force her to agree with me on everything. There are so many things I wish I could make her understand. Obviously Im talking more things like ask that guy out and youre beautiful just the way you are not dont join the death eaters rather than muggleborns arent scum. But either way I cant make her do anything or make her change her mind. All I can do is give her my advice and hope she finds her way.And at the end of the day you cant save someone who doesnt want to be saved. Sirius might want to kidnap his brother from their parents house throw a bag over his head and lock him in the Potters attic until  but he cant. And remember that Regulus did change course. Despite being surrounded by death eaters and pureblood supremacists who thought Voldemort was going to be the best thing ever he stopped and said theres something wrong here. ,harrypotter,cqtt7s9,1,t5_2qiqi

3891817,0,t1_cqyrbdw,I feel like there must have been more to the tapestry to me it makes sense that by burning someone off you were doing something official. Especially since Sirius notes that Tonks doesnt appear and Kreacher doesnt obey her because Andromeda was burned off.On the other hand Ive always seen being disowned as being more subjective rather than being made of hardandfast rules like you will be disowned if youre sorted into Ravenclaw. Its more at the discretion of the older members of the family or whoever happens to be in possession of Grimmauld Place at the time. After all Alphard was blasted off the tree postmortem for something fairly minor. I think that was more because Walburga Black was angry than because there was some real justification. Obviously something like marrying a muggle is pretty untenable to the Blacks world view but supporting muggle rights doesnt automatically get you blasted off the tree. Its more about how much you irritate your parents while supporting muggle rights.gt I think it is passed on to Sirius because of the oldmagic that specifically said that they have to be maintained by a Black.Thats plausible. Dumbledore was kind of ambigious when he spoke to Harry but it kind of seems to work.gt But first of all I must tell you that Siriuss will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned.gt You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at gringotts and you inherit all of Siriuss personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the legacy  gt Yes said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in the Dursleys. Our problem he continued to Harry as if there had been no interruption is that Sirius also left you number twelve Grimmauld Place.gt Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line to the next male with the name of Black. Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother Regulus predeceased him and both were childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood.gt I bet there has Harry said.gt Quite said Dumbledore. And if such an enchantment exists then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Siriuss living relatives which would mean his cousin Bellatrix Lestrange.gt You see Dumbledore said turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered if you have indeed inherited the house you have also inherited gt Well that simplifies matters said Dumbledore cheerfully. It means that Sirius knew what he was doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.,harrypotter,cqzwgak,1,t5_2qiqi

We cant know for sure so that isnt a good argument for his character.gti think he understood that implicit in protecting harry was destroying voldemort because thats who harry needs protecting from. So if even by your admission his motivation was to protect Harry how was he to see a plan which includes killing Harry in order to save Harry from Voldemort? I wouldnt use the word necessity but stupidity to describe that plan if my motivation was to protect a person.If you think his highest motivation was to stop Voldemort not protect Harry thats a whole new matter.

And also Flitwick for indirectly calling another student a baboon brandishing a stick. They may very well have both thought that ribbing him would provoke him to do better especially as there was nothing wrong with Nevilles intellectual ability. He wasnt stupid just permanently scared out of his wits and yes people do use provocation to get people like that to snap out of it. As I mentioned its telling that Snape actually deducts only . points from him over the course of the books and that was for fighting in the corridor.

You and Harry seem stuck in the mindset that it ought to have been something along what came before but this spell was marked as different.

They find out that she modified their memories and sent them to Australia which is no mean feat in and of itself. The fact that their yearold daughter would be capable of something like that is kind of mindblowing. One thing is that Hermione would still be grievingrecovering and Im not sure her parents would be able to help her. Hermione has gotten used to relying on RonHarrythe Weasleys for emotional support and I think that would be a hard habit to break. Hermione is reuniting with her parents but shes not staying in the muggle world.  So she goes back to England with them and spends a few weeks max and then she goes back to her real life in the wizarding world. Which is rough.

Might be they thought that Snape was deceiving Lily all along and tried to get her to the dark side.

4369700,0,t1_crrrd4f,Muggles and wizards have always been close to each other and so were their tales. My greatgrandmother was an old and wise witch from Siebenbrgen a place that is better known as Transylvania. She and the mugglekids from a small village grew up with the tale Die Knigtochter in der Flammenburg engl. The kings daugther in the castle of flames My grandmother loved the tale but when she told it to her grandfather he laughed. Muggles hear this tale and dont believe in it because they know nothing about magic. Of course it is true but the muggleversion is just an adaption of the original tale. The original tale has to remain a secret but if you promise not to tell it to a muggle I will iniate you into a story about love faith and fate.Once upon a time there was a very poor wizard in Transylvania. He had so many children that every neighbor was already the godfather of one of his sons and daughters. One day his wife gave birth to another son and the wizard was desperate. He walked up to the road that lead into the village and decided to ask the next passerby to be his sons godfather. An old and rickety man come along and the wizard was almost too hestitant to ask him for help. The old man was glad to help as he had no family and lived isolated in a remote montain shelter. He was so happy that he gave his new godson a Hypogriff that was born on the same day as his godson and had a little star on his beak. He was also able to talk to the little boy.The boy was very afraid of the Hypogriff at first but he learned how to train him and both became close friends. As his youngest boy grew up the poor man noticed that he started to develop magical traits. Once again he was desperate because he knew that hew could never afford to buy him a wand. The Hypogriff listened to the fathers grief and decided to help. When the boy became old enough the Hypogriff placed him on his back and took him to the king of Transylvania. The kings only daughter was taken away by a dragon that kept her in castle of flames behind a rough sea and a  insurmountable overburden. Many young man tried to rescue the daugther because the king promised that she would wed the one that would succeed.The Hypogriff told his friend to ask the king for a wand. Of course the king had a magician at his court. A lot of young men had already tried to defeat the dragon and asked for sowrds or a boat but none dared to ask for  a wand. The magician was willing to help the young boy and gave him the wand he asked for. The Hypogriff placed the boy on his back and the flew over the overburden. Then the Hypogriff drank all water from the sea and used it to extinguish the flames around the castle. He was too exhausted to help after that and so the brvae boy took his wand and defeated the dragon all on his own. The king kept his promise and the boy wed the princess and became the new king of Transylvania. His father was very proud but hide away from his son after he returned. The boy walked to his fathers house and asked him why he wouldnt want to come to his wedding. Im so ashamed. He said.  I gave over poverty to you and couldnt afford a wand for you. All you have was given to you by others. The son smiled and hugged his father  It matters not what someone is born but what they grow to be.The tale of the poor young boy that managed to become the new king was very popular throughout the ages and reminded young wizards wand witches that its okay to ask for help to care for all creatures that surround you and to trust in others advice. As the boy said himself the circumstances you are born into dont necessarily define all of your further life you can always try to make the best out of it. The tale was counteracting the dark arts because its intention was to motivate people to help each other along and not to subjugate others. Its popularty rose when Grindelwald became a vivid horror in the south of Europe and a lot of wizards and wicthes had to leave Transylvania. Some wizards also believe that the three tasks overbruden sea and wall of flames were an inspiration for the three tasks in the triwizardcup. As its said in the tale the boy became the new king and here he have an old portraiture of his canting arms You can see his Hypogriff and the wand the magician gave him. For those that are interested in wands its core is a hair from the Hypogriffs tail and the wood is from the most common romanian tree the copper beech.,harrypotter,csi77q6,2,t5_2qiqi

4481443,0,t1_csvgnqs,I get that the Fidelous is pretty ironclad but I still think there were some holes and an obvious lack of motive. Not that I think its a plothole because I think everyone got a bit caught up and lost perspective. But I dont think it was an objectively openandshut case. If anyone had bothered to investigate they would start realizing that Sirius didnt have any ongoing ties to the Death EatersVoldemort had a history of being openly against Voldemort and that he would throw himself under the Hogwarts Express for LilyJamesHarry. I think Siriuss testimony sounded really implausible circa  because everyone is so used to him being a scary murderer and now he looks the part. But if he had been able to explain Pettigrews involvement and show memories I think he could have built a pretty strong defense. But it was a crazy time and people rushed to judgement. I can see proVoldemort people who didnt know Sirius well being like oh he finally came around. But I think the more you had been exposed to Siriuss antiVoldemort attitude the less sense it would make.Its possible Siriuss mother went to her grave thinking Sirius had been proVoldemort but that doesnt really tally with what Kreacher says and how the portrait acts. Kreacher doesnt make it sound as though Walburga had a chance of heart about Sirius from . Its one thing for her to still hate him for embarrassing the family while simultaneously being satisfied that Sirius did come around eventually. But Kreacher seems to make it clear that Siriuss mother thought he was a blood traitor.As far as what Sirius told the Death Eaters he might not have told them anything. He hadnt seen Bellatrix since she was brought into the prison and he says the same thing about Crouch. So as horrible and inhumane as it sounds I dont think theres much socializing at Azkaban.,harrypotter,csvjwru,1,t5_2qiqi

4527660,0,t3_3d2v93,Youve pointed out some valid things and raised some good questions. There really arent great answers to them. The Goblet scenario is a bit flawed in these respects. Questions about breaking the contract aside I think that it would have been possible for Harry to just walk up at each task and forfeit or something like that. However I think what makes the most sense for why Dumbledore didnt instruct Harry to do that is that he knew that whoever put Harrys name in the cup definitely didnt have any good intentions for Harry. By playing along with the system they could attempt to amp up the security already in place and be on the lookout whereas if they hadnt let Harry compete then the person who put his name in would then resort to less open methods for hurting Harry which would be more difficult to guard against. It doesnt fully answer the contract question but I think its an important factor. ,harrypotter,ct1cke3,8,t5_2qiqi

MUST show a preference towards Slytherins while actually preferring to do that naturally and b. MUST detest the Gryffindors while again that is his natural inclination anyway. For a man of Snapes character and with the mindset I envision him working under it would actually be much easier for him to act as he does because it is the closest thing to his actual personality that he can still honestly refer to as an act.,harrypotter,ct1gel5,2,t5_2qiqi

4612975,0,t3_3e6srq,If youre there for an entire day I would say you could probably do both parks since it doesnt take that long to get between the two. Depending on what you pick or if you do both here are some tips for both parksHogsmeade Definitely definitely go on the ride in Hogwarts Castle. Its incredible. Heres the trick the line to get in that takes you through all of Hogwarts can get pretty long so I suggest getting to the park as early as you can and heading straight there. The rest of Hogsmeade will still be there. That way the wait should be an hour or less and you get to stroll through Hogwarts which is really entertaining. If you get there and the line is super long do the single riders line. Its like a  min wait so you can experience the ride then come back and do it again properly when the lines cut down. Lunch at the Three Broomsticks was really good when I was there so I would recommend going there as well as Honeydukes. Basically just take a tour of the stores. Ollivanders has a line but if its not too long its fun to see kids get wands because its a little show. Youll also notice Butterbeer carts where you can get liquid or frozen like a slushie butterbeer. Personally I prefer the liquid kind and I got a souvenir cup that I still use so Id say it was worth it. Diagon AlleyDefinitely super fun. Same single rider trick applies to Gringotts and I absolutely recommend this ride. Diagon Alley has more stuff to look at in my opinion because the shop fronts are so detailed so Id spend some time here walking around. Also I cant even explain how good the butterbeer ice cream is in Fortescues parlor so do yourself a favor and get some of that. If you go to Diagon Alley from the Hogwarts Express its worth it to leave that section of the park through the brick wall and see the London street outside because thats where the Knight Bus is! Lastly if you can help it try not to bring a backpack or even a large purse since you have to put those in lockers to go on the rides and its a madhouse. Usually you cant even bring bags at all so either leave them with someone or keep your wallet and phone in an interior pocket somewhere. ,harrypotter,ctc1oal,7,t5_2qiqi

4631579,0,t1_ctebkvr,Wizards were driven into hiding and there really arent that many of them. Sports is a strange thing to bring up especially when there are really only  or  sports played by most muggles. Clearly wizards still possess those admirable traits imagination curiosity and science. In science I urge you to look at Xenophelius Snape the various Wizards Lockhart stole from Ollivander The Department of Mysteries and the whole of Hogwarts. Education research and learning are all very real things. Curiosity is also evident in a great number of characters. The whole of the series focuses on Harry and Company putting his nose into other peoples business foiling plots that he shouldnt even know about. The Dark Lord experiments with magic the likes of which the world had never conceived of. Dumbledore explores myth and legend. The Hogwarts library is always bustling with students. Imagination? Who needs imagination when theres so many fantastical things to experience yourself. Thats not to say that there havent been a number of imaginative wizards again see Xeno or Luna. Muggles visited the moon but wizard astronomy was leaps and bounds ahead thousands of years earlier. Theres no improving on perfection. If a wizard wanted to visit the moon they could use a bubble head charm and apparate. Im sorry that wizards dont have enough disadvantages to overcome so you can pat them on the back but to imply they are in anyway inferior to muggles is ludicrous. They are capable of everything muggles are and a great deal more. ,harrypotter,ctedpjy,4,t5_2qiqi

4646517,0,t3_3em3ne,Ive asked myself this exact question many times. The prevailing wisdom uttered by JK in an interview and therefore apparently The word of God is that Pettigrew was present in the Potter house and took it following Voldemorts downfall.Except that makes no fucking sense. Pettigrew thought Voldy was dead so WHY would he take it? What was to be gained? Plus he knew he would be blamed by the powerful Death Eaters that remained which is why he faked his death and framed Sirius taking the wand would only give credence to the idea that he betrayed Voldemort either having taken it as a trophy or in an attempt to usurp power. And if he did take it what did he do with it while he was a rat for  years? Nope. Doesnt make a lick of sense.So whats the other option? Voldemorts body was broken dying he tries to escape and hides the wand somewhere before his body finally gives out? Well that would certainly explain his bodys absence but if that were the case surely he would have tried to kill Harry weak or not he knows he wont die completely it seems odd he wouldnt have tried to murder Harry but we can be reasonably sure he didnt  because if he had laid hands on Harry then he wouldnt have been surprised by the inability to touch Harry in PS.Snape? Nope  why would he? Even if he HAD taken it it would most likely have gone to Dumbledore if Snape had kept it as a trophy unlikely but possible then how would it have gotten back to Voldemorts hands in time for his reconstitution at Little Hangleton? Snape did not arrive until much much later after Potters return to Hogwarts. Had Snape made efforts to return it earlier than it is unlikely that Voldy would have been so convinced he was a traitor when he takes stock of the Death Eaters at the cemetery. So Snape cant be the wands trustee either.That leaves  more possibilitiesHagrid makes the observation that he retrieved Harry from the house just before the muggle authorities started swarming around it is therefore possible that the wand was amongst effects considered of evidentiary value and held in an evidence locker somewhere and eventually retrieved by Pettigrew on Voldemorts behalf.The final and to my mind most intriguing option is that prior to Sirius and Hagrid and Snape if you include the films within canon arriving and theres a question  why was Hagrid even there? Was he Just in the neighbourhood? someone else arrived on the scene and took the wand for reasons unknown and saw to its return to The Dark Lord prior to his resurrection.,harrypotter,ctg9a5l,2,t5_2qiqi

4654199,0,t3_3eokdd,Voldemort ordered Snape to pick up the DADA position and go to Hogwarts to presumably spy on Dumbledore and convert the students to the cause. Snape kept applying for the position as a record of loyalty. When Voldemort returns Snape could point to his actions and say he continued to be loyal even when Voldemort was MIA. I think that after a while Snape hoped he would get the position just so the curse would kick him out of Hogwarts and he wouldnt have to teach children anymore. Dumbledore continued to refuse his application because he didnt want anything to happen to Snapeit was important that Snape stayed at Hogwarts. His refusal could be spun by Snape whichever way he needed depending on the situation. It could prove his abilities as a spyDumbledore trusts him enough to keep him safe even at the expense of his students education. It could also go the other wayDumbledore doesnt trust him to even take up the DADA position so Snape certainly cant do any missions or Muggle torture for Voldemort without Dumbledore questioning his loyalty. That could get him off Death Eater duties.,harrypotter,cth7z8s,3,t5_2qiqi

Its a single bank run by a race of aggressive and highly intelligent magical beings with a really nasty grudge on the wizarding population for likening them to animals. And they dont have competition or regulations meaning the actual worth of the Galleon could be literally anything they want it to be that day.Remember wizarding England is relatively stupid and very very corrupt. Just having the right breeding and money in the bank could get you into all sorts of places. Lucius Malfoy was essentially running the entire Ministry of Magic from the comfort of his bank account. They left soulsucking nonliving monsters to guard a prison where they threw literally everybody for even the tiniest crimes.So yes illegal acts fall through the cracks all the time.

4752602,0,t3_2w7c0l,The Death Eaters.  I often wondered why real pure bloods like the Lestranges Blacks Malfoys etc would want to have anything to do with Voldemort once they discovered his real heritage. I mean there is no evidence that any of them ever knew about his background before the graveyard scene in Foblet of Fire. It is very plausible that he lied to them about it but why couldnt they have looked into his family tree? Or their own for that matter since practically all pure bloods are related. I find it hard to believe that if they really knew about his heritage they would not have stood by him and instead would have treated him like garbage just like he did to others and formed their own supreme league. I get that the large amount of the stories center around hypocrisy but still. On the other hand all of them or most chose to stay with him after the graveyard scene where his heritage was made official. Why not just call him out then? Maybe I am reading too much into it but it never made sense to me. I know that there had been rumors in Hitlets time that he was part Jewish and people obviously still supported him so I suppose JKR was going for a similar thing but knowing what we know about the pure bloods in the story it still irks me. Furthermore there is no evidence that the later generation of Death Eaters Bellatrix Rodolphus Rabastan Snape Crabbe and Goyles dads Lucius ever even knew his real name prior to the graveyard scene. Why would they not ask or at least try to find out something about his past? Even when Lucius slips Ginny the diary all that is indicated is that he knows the diary came from Voldemort not that he knows Voldemorts heritage.   The only person before the graveyard scene who seems to know anything about Voldemort is Pettigrew as he is present in the Riddle House. And what about Snapes heritage as well? None of the Death Eaters appear to know about his heritage either? Were these things deliberately overlooked by the Death Eaters? Did they just never come mind? Or were they so enthralled with Voldemorts beliefs that they just assumed he was pure?,harrypotter,cttlzry,1,t5_2qiqi

4850821,0,t3_3hbhjn,gtwas there a special connection between Harry and Fawkes because he had her feather in his wand?  gtis there something about Fawkes which creates particularly powerful wands with her feathers?gtHes had her at least since Voldemort was .Fawkes is male according to HP Wikia  Also its possible Fawkes donated feathers to Ollivander before Dumbledore owned him.gtfudge basically impeded the course of justice here didnt he?  Pretty much yes.  However its pretty unclear to what extent there is separation of powers or checks and balances in Wizarding government since Fudge seems to be both Executive and Legislative branches and he even presides over Harrys trial judiciary.  Further it seems wizards dont have the basic rights that democratic government ensures since Barty Crouch Snr was able to chuck Sirius into Azkaban without a trial.  I think Fudge as minister is pretty much an autocrat who has very few limitations on the amount of power given to him.gtdo you think fudge really believed in his heart of hearts that Voldemort hadnt returned?  I dont think he would have let himself believe Voldemort was back.  When I recently reread GoF I tried to come up with an analogy to the position Fudge must have been in and this was the best I could think up Imagine youre the German Chancellor in the early s.  Its been over a decade since the terrible years of war and society has lived that time in relative peace and calm.  All of a sudden a potential rival politician comes to you and tells you that Hitler is still alive that he never killed himself in his bunker and that he has been living in a secluded forest in Albania for the last ten years.  But now hes returned to Germany with the help of a loyal SS officer who everyone thought had died.  However the only evidence for this is the word of a fourteen year old boy who just this morning was accused in the newspapers of being a delusional showoff suffering acute mental distress.If you were the German Chancellor in this scenario wouldnt you probably assume that this whole thing was a ridiculous farfetched story invented by your political rival in order to destabilize your government and get himself in power?  Maybe there would be a small part somewhere deep in the back of your mind that considered the possibility that since Hitlers body was never recovered he could be alive but theres no way you would let yourself give it any serious consideration.,harrypotter,cu5zczi,4,t5_2qiqi

4858984,0,t1_cu6sw6p,Sorta  I more intended to provide specific examples of how the movies dont always match the characterizations given in the books.  Id certainly agree that the movies they rely on the books as a foundation if only because thats their source material.I completely agree about how the changes in characterization stick out like a sore thumb.  Much more than added or omitted scenes or characters or spells or whatever else its the characterization changes that prevent me from enjoying the movies  because despite it all being fantasy I know these characters so when they dont act like themselves it ruins the suspension of disbelief.  Magic sure! is part of watching a fantasy movie but she wouldnt say that! or how did Harry read Rons mind? or why is he acting like that? pulls me right out of the moment.Its also much easier for me to understand e.g. scene changes or added dialogue as necessary parts of the shift in medium than it is to follow wild differences in the portrayal of characters.  Skipping the World Cup?  Its a shame but I understand  they have to cut something and its pretty much though not entirely selfcontained.  Even cutting out Charlie as I discussed here is something I can understand.  Or Harry using a spell here despite how it flies in the face of the logic of the created universe.  It is an action movie about magic and they wanted something flashy.  I dont agree with the choice but I get it.But theres simply no moviemaking reason for Dumbledore to assault Harry over him name being in the Goblet.  It would have made an equally good scene to have Dumbledore as he did act calmly and rationally  showing his trust in Harry and humility even admitting that he may have made a mistake  and leaving it to another character to point out that theres no way that happened  while the other characters provide the color.Im looking forward to Fantastic Beasts specifically because that sort of thing wont be an issue  so Im hoping I can enjoy it for what it is rather than being constantly jostled out of the moment.,harrypotter,cu70ezb,2,t5_2qiqi

To me the issue wouldnt be Azkaban isnt enough punishment for Voldemort it would be Can Azkaban even hold Voldemort. Even if you dont think Azkaban is severe enough for Voldemort surely it would be preferable to have him secured there than on the lose where he can maim and murder.As far as Im concerned though literally no one not even Voldemort deserves the dementors.

4984795,0,t1_cumakky,Exactly. Harry went through more traumatizing stuff in such a compressed time more than any other character and still was self sacrificing. The way he turned out was a miracle tbh. It annoys me when people harp on and on about Harrys angst but if I was Harrys age I would do what a teenager would do which is basically just not get out of bed for a year whine endlessly and be jealous of everyone elses life or use my fame to make myself feel better D I cheered in OoTP because we were seeing some characterization instead of Harry being the narrator that reacts to things. He had to angst otherwise hed be unrealistic. Hes still a little unrealistic when all is said and done so brave so caring so incredibly goddamn resilient.,harrypotter,cumuou4,3,t5_2qiqi

I mean she definitely loves Harry and even if you couldnt tell throughout the series its painfully obvious she does in deathly hallows her scream when she thought that harry was dead while Bellatrix laughed at her.I can see her knowing his family intimately. And Harry having grown up around strong women Hermione Molly Ginny McGonagall would definitely want these women in his kids life to influence them they way they did him. Especially as role models for Lily.  Also Harry places the utmost value in family. Not the Dursleys. His wizarding family which includes not only the Weasleys and Hermione through marriage but his adopted family which includes Hagrid Neville Lily and several others. I daresay McGonagall is included amongst them. I can just imagine McGonagall sitting down with Harry and complaining about James and his penchant for rulebreaking being far worse than Harrys ever was he is after all in some way connected to James Sirius and the Weasley twins  of Hogwarts most infamous rulebreakers. Except this time Harry offers McGonagall biscuits to calm her down while he smiles admiring the irony. ,harrypotter,cup45ro,10,t5_2qiqi

5056734,0,t3_3k66ij,I think part of it has to do with the fact that the wizarding community is so small relative to muggle populations. Its size makes it easier to terrorize and control and means that there are a lack of random good andor powerful people willing to chip in who arent already in the thick of it. Also with regards to the battle of Hogwarts...havent read DH in a while but were the dark wizards in the thousands? My impression was more like that they had maybe  people not including nonhumans. I suppose if there were a ton of imperiused people maybe that inflated there numbers a bit. But as far as Im remembering the Death Eaters themselves only numbered  or so. Not hugely important but if in all of Britain the total amount of witcheswizards only number a couple thousand it makes it easier to understand how there werent ever random outsiders coming in to help.,harrypotter,cuvizxr,1,t5_2qiqi

If we ignore JKRs outofuniverse statements in interviews and whatever she says about Quirrell on Pottermore I cant find exactly what that is atm... then it seems that Quirrell has been teaching DADA for at least one year prior to Harrys arrival.  Hagrid says of him at the beginning of PSSSgt He was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience.. They say he met vampires in the Black Forest and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same since. Scared of the students scared of his own subjectWhich seems to suggest that he has been teaching Defence for at least one year  the year it took for Hagrid to assess that he is now scared of his own subject.  Unless he was teaching muggle studies and became scared of that during his year abroad.  We know that he is apparently scared of defence though...Like so many things this seems to be an earlybook inconsistency before JKR had decided that the defence position was cursed which was retconned in her postDH interview...,harrypotter,cuvkbk6,3,t5_2qiqi

There are plenty of people who were abused or neglected as children who dont struggle to form friendships or relationships etc.  Plus Harry did have a healthy bond with his parents before their deaths so its not like he never experienced any sort of lovephysical contact in other words this is not a Romanian Orphanage type situation.  We also dont know for sure that the Dursleys started out being awful to him.  They may have made initial attempts to form a relationship after all Petunia at least has some feelings for Harry or at least a desire to honor her sisters wishes as evidenced by her preventing Vernon from kicking Harry out of the house in OotP...  if she straight up didnt care Dumbledores howler wouldnt phase her shed be like So what if my blood is the only thing giving him protection from Voldemort?  Get him out of my house. then given up when they found they couldnt bring themselves to care for him or when he started showing signs of magical ability.

5075027,0,t3_3kf2xr,I think for the same reasons that humans cannot truly love or cry on command neither can a phoenix. Most likely the magic of the tears is only if the phoenix is feeling a particular emotion which is whatever Fawkes feels in response to Harrys loyalty to Dumbledore. As for bottling I see this being impossible for the same reason that Lilys love protected Harry and Harrys actions protected Hogwarts at the end. We are given more insight at the end actually had Harry been told what was happening then there would have been no magical protection for the others. Instead because he went to Voldemort intending to sacrifice himself to save others the others were protected by the same type of magical protection that Lily gave him. Getting back round to the main point given that emotional intent is required I dont think its a simple matter of bottling just any phoenix tears and distributing them ,harrypotter,cuxqdlb,1,t5_2qiqi

And Hufflepuff will help you stay on the straight and narrow theres no doubt about that. No?Peter Please please. Anything but Hufflepuff anything but Hufflepuff.Sorting Hat Well if youre sure. Too dull for Ravenclaw and not ambitious enough for Slytherin... better be... GRYFFINDOR! As for your other points He was far too deep in at that point. It was either lose his hand or potentially lose his life. Not that it doesnt take some balls to chop your own hand off but I wouldnt consider it bravery when your hand is forced. Selling out your friends at the height of the war doesnt take courage either considering none of his friends were even aware of his actions. Plenty of other Aurors and OotP members were captured and interrogated by Voldy and as far as we know they all chose to die or end up like Nevilles parents. Pettigrew took the easy way out and gave up what he knew willingly. And he did this at the height of Voldemorts power where it was clear up until that point that Voldemorts was the winning side. There really isnt anything brave about this. It takes will to live as an animagus for all those years for sure but is it bravery or courage? I dont think so. Its still living a cowards existence too weak to accept who he really was and what he did. Bravery would be admitting what he had done after the fall of Voldemort allowing his friend Sirius to go free and accepting punishment for his part. A life sentence in Azkaban to be sure but it would have potentially avoided him the dementors kiss and possibly the fate he ultimately ended up with.,harrypotter,cuyvnw6,7,t5_2qiqi

5103780,0,t3_3kwto5,gt  How conflicted do you think he was about killing Dumbledore? Do you think he was considering abolishing all of his earlier arrangements and wouldnt bring himself to do it? Thus sacrificing himself because of the unbreakable vowDumbledores injury definitely had an impact here.  We know that Snape doesnt make the vow until hes sworn to murder Dumbledore.  So all the vow does is ensure that Snape doesnt have cold feet when the moment comes.  If Dumbledore was healthy and wouldve lived for another  years I doubt Snape wouldve put himself in a him or me situation with the vow...and I strongly doubt that he couldve cast the curse leaving the Order without a leader.  Furthermore without Dumbledores injury it becomes less important to throw Snape deep undercover.  On a personal level for Snape I imagine he knew he was between a rock and a hard place  Dumbledore wasnt going to live anyway and it was paramount for Dumbledores plan that Snape was highly regarded by Voldemort.  He had to murder Dumbledore  but in doing so he was destroying all of his links with the Order and he was murdering the only person who could vouch for him.Murdering Dumbledore was Snape signing his own death warrant.  He became the spy who couldnt come in from the cold and if the Order won he was likely to be murdered either in battle as a traitor or imprisoned for his role.  In one way I think he was lucky hed made the vow because Im not certain he couldve brought himself to go through with it otherwise.  One of the other Death Eaters wouldve certainly finished the job and its possible that Snape wouldve either lost standing with Voldemort or been killed as a traitor.  gt  Is the Halfblood prince subplot related to the main plot in anyway? It feels like its completely disconnected from the main story and is only important if you wish to know who edited the potions book.Primarily the book serves as an introduction to Severus as opposed to Snape the evil teacher.  We get a glimpse of what he was like as a student and we see how Harry responds favourably to him when hes unaware of his identity.  ,harrypotter,cv171ze,4,t5_2qiqi

More evidence to say he did. We know he wrote on the board rarely if ever used textbooks.

However simple mistakes would ruin the entire potion. Yet Harry likes Slughorn or he at leasts pretends to to get on his good side and using the recipes from Snapes book allow him to pass.

For instance oppugno is a real Latin word meaning to attack or assault derived from ob towards and pugno to fight from whence English words such as pugnacious.  Repugnant is derived via French from the Latin re and pugno lit. fight against but forming the noun repugno meaning disgust or revulsion.There are nonLatin derived magical terms Avada Kedavra for instance is derived from abracadabra Alohamora is IIRC from Hawaiian and so on... but I think the majority are from romance languages and ultimately Latin  which is unsurprising as the languages that JKR knows are afaik all romance languages...,harrypotter,cva5ptk,2,t5_2qiqi
5180136,0,t3_3lsu6z,Heres few Ive been considering Book   Hermione is younger than Harry and actually figured out much about the magical world well before she would have been approached. Shes been itching to use her wand but some rules cant be bent she wont get it for a month into the school year.  For the rest of the novels shes trying to catch up on the visceral attunement to magic despite knowing more than anyone else about it. Common action casts spell something odd happens she says Its not supposed to do that. Then one of the others will get it right. She finally gets it right the first time when petrifying Nev.  Book   Neville is added as a permanent member of Harrys circle the twins as loyal allies for saving Ginny  Book   Hermione has signed up for all electives its possible but unwise. When the Dementors are assigned adding pressure to the school life Minerva takes Hermione aside and tells her to drop a few of the electives. Hermione insists that shes prepared to handle the workload.   Shes ready because shes discovered a wondrous device that lets her relive a few hours taking a different path than previous even while retaining memory of the first path. She found the device before leaving the previous year as she felt shed lost too much progress while petrified. The teachers dont know and the schedule allows her to take all classes if she doesnt have study periods.  Speaking of periods... her erratic behavior worries her friends and the werewolf Defence teacher misleading the reader as to who is a beast within the walls. The Grim? The Wolf? The raging student?Ginny proves helpful in trailing after the mystery. Harry thought she was pining for her hero but she actually was worried for Hermiones sake.  In the end secrets are revealed and history catches up with everyone including Hermione who will now almost qualify as a th year. Also the Turner breaks due to Hermiones attempt to change events in one timeline rather than choose another.  Ginny added to the circle Sirius and Remus added as allies.  Book   There is only one cup. It is the Goblet of Fire and it has unusual divination properties making it a valuable relic to trade over a competition. Dumbledore needs it to anticipate Riddles means of return and survival but its currently in the hands of Beauxbatons. When Albus asks for a competition Durmstrang is eager to join in for the chance to regain the Goblet. Whether Karkaroff intends to use it as a bribe to save his arse when Voldemort returns or hoping to discern a way out he wants it.  Harry is dragged into the tournament and starts feeling the ominous presence of the Goblet in his nightmares and waking dreams almost like a thing alive...,harrypotter,cvae9va,-1,t5_2qiqi

Her film version does it better for me.What are your thoughts on Sirius?  In the book hes like a whiny teenager which is perfectly fair and to be expected having spent all of his young adulthood in prison but he treats Harry like shit. He doesnt offer as much advice  he always wants to break the rules and when Harry admonishes him  Sirius insults him saying hes less like James than he thought. While in the film hes more of a father. The James comment is transformed to the bittersweet mistake where he thinks hes dueling beside James before he dies and instead of whining the whole damn time he gives Harry that beautiful speech about light and dark that isnt in the book.It could just be that Gary Oldman is a boss yeah but hes part of what makes the movie better than the book for me.That and that blue lens filming ,harrypotter,cvhbb9u,2,t5_2qiqi
5241141,0,t1_cvhqqse,gtExactly. As soon as she considered Snape an enemy she let James torture him.    No she didnt. If you remember any time Snape and James went at it he did so when she wouldnt notice.    Also keep in mind weve been told Snape gave just as good as he got. It wasnt nearly as one sided as you think.    She left Snape because Snape was going down a dark path and she gave him every chance she could. I mean come on! Snape was in league with Death Eaters. The very people that wanted to take over the wizarding world purge muggleborns from the school and probably enslave muggles.    She stood up for him constantly. It was Snapes fault that Lily abandoned him. Yes she abandoned him and good on her for doing so. Snape would not listen Snape would not change. Hell Snape didnt change until Lily died.    But who was there? Who fought against the subjugation of muggleborns? Was willing to risk his life for those he cared about? Who was friends with the likes of Albus Dumbledore Rubeus Hagrid and Minerva McGonagall?    This is so stupid.

5279521,0,t3_3nas00,Yeah there was stuff on pottermore idk if its on the new site yet..Basically patronus forms are theorized by some wizard whos name I cant remember which I take it to mean basically it is true but JKR is trying to be realistic about the unknown parts of magic to represent the secret self which I take to mean like an inner strength or hidden part of yourself which you are possibly unaware of. A wizard or witch whos patronus takes the form of their favorite animal suggests obsession or eccentricity. It suggests they dont feel the need to hide parts of themselves and one should be wary of such people but also have respect. I read this to mean Umbridge is a psycho cat lady some people are just super real and honest. Most witches and wizards have mundane animals as their patronuses like cats dogs and horses. I think this is related to how the patronus charm is cast with a strong happy memory which for some would be related to these animals which may have been pets but that is a little headcanony. Patronuses take forms to animals native to your home animals youre more familiar with. Extinct patronuses can exist but are rare.Size of patronus does not matter. There is a story about a wizard named Illyius who was mocked for having a mouse patronus but it was strong enough to save his whole village from a large swarm of dementors.Im not sure about whether patronus forms are predetermined. I kind of think it somewhat is and somewhat isnt. On one hand I think that the memory you choose helps represent what makes you happy and that leads to what the animal represents like how if your memory was about being with your family and feeling loved perhaps your animal would be representative of being loving or protectiveness or togetherness or something like that.But Im also pretty sure that Harry uses different specific memories to conjure his patronus but it stays the same throughtout the series. For him I kind of think his patronus represents his love for his parents. Yet we also know for some people the patronus does change like instances of true love where it changes to represent the one they love which makes sense since their happy memories would likely shift to b about the one they love.,harrypotter,cvmiq0z,1,t5_2qiqi

He does this on Draco in HBP. No spell is cast only silence and we hear him comment on how Draco has learned occlumency. I imagine for someone that doesnt know occlumency they cannot feel the slight prod and poking of the staring into the eyes aspect.

In addition it is very powerful and requires a huge amount of concentration. Not many people pull out a handgun to kill a mouse either. And you generally dont come across creatures strong enough to require it. You could just put a fine on the usage of the word. People would quickly start to say killing curse and other things instead of AK like they do with Voldemorts name. In the book the snatchers show up as soon as Harry broke the taboo. gtCome out of there with your hands up! came a rasping voice through the darkness. We know youre in there! Youve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we dont care who we curse! That seems pretty fast to me. And even if they dont catch the murderer at least they find the victim right away.

5462155,0,t1_cw9jsjn,Ooh!  I know this one!  Im gonna just copypaste an earlier comment about itI got to discuss this in my genetics class in the context of Huntingtons Disease which occurs because of a homozygous dominant trinucleotide repeat sequence. Everybody has this same trinucleotide repeat to some degree but Huntingtons occurs when that repeat sequence reaches a point where its significantly longer than normal. The severity of the disease corresponds to the length of the repeat sequence so sometimes two perfectly healthy people with slightly longer than average repeat sequences can have offspring who due to a DNA replicationcell division error ends up with an extended repeat sequence that results in their expressing the disease. Magic being tied to a homozygous dominant trinucleotide repeat would explain how two Muggles with absolutely no magical heritage could spontaneously have a magical child since completely random mutation is far too random for that to happen so many times and it also explains the differing strengths of the magical population longer repeat sequence  stronger expression of the magic gene.,harrypotter,cw9ube0,4,t5_2qiqi

5466323,0,t1_cw9qhh2,Id be happy with the script being released but I really hope that down the road wont mean years from now. Tbh I think this is setting up a really unfair situation for fans from different countries who are unable to travel to the UK. Its one thing to adapt existing material as a play but to make that the only medium for fans to see new material basically guarantees that the vast majority wont have access to it for a loooooooong while. A bit of math on this subject  million copies of DH were sold in the first  hrs. Palace Theater capacity  . Even if those were the only fans interested in seeing Cursed Child and of course they arent we know the global fanbase is much much larger than that itll take over  performances. The logistics are staggering even once the play travels. Theyd need multiple casts running in multiple cities throughout the world simultaneously to even remotely approach offering access to all the people whod want to see it. I dont want to be a downer but Im really disappointed that the new material is being presented as a play first. To top off everything else once the run starts itll create a situation where itll be extremely difficult to avoid spoilers without avoiding the internet altogether.

The one alternate universe somebody created where the Hogwarts champion in Triwizard tournament is a Slytherin instead of Cedric and follows a similar story with them getting killed by Voldemort only for several Slytherins to see how evil Voldemort iswant revenge causing many to actively defy their parents and stand with Harry. I love that AU and just wish something like that could have happened. When i first read the books it felt like all Slytherins were prejudice bullies and snobs and that really should not have been the case.,harrypotter,cwhhqu6,16,t5_2qiqi

That in itself isnt a crime. Its the actions of your followers and yourself that have the potential to be evil. When Dumbledore says hed be sorry to believe half of the things he heard about him he probably wasnt referring to mass murder. If Voldemort had already been accused of murder we wouldve heard of it. Remember that after graduating Hogwarts Tom started working at Borgin and Burkes. Many people viewed this as him wasting his incredible talent. It would make sense for the rumor mill to start turning against him after he was employed at such a place. People would start to think of him as a boy with great potential turned into a shady ruffian.

5650000,0,t3_3sg6ak,House elves are paid little attention so I doubt there is enough record of their history at all.something Ive discussed in this subreddit before just food of thought gt Magic in HP universe works in quite subtle and flexible way. You can even jinx something intangible and conceptual like a teaching post and a name. Therefore I expected something like that in the history of the elves. For example they swore a blood oath a super powerful magic like the unbreakable vow to bind them to servitude to wizards which both restricted them and granted them certain unique abilities like being able to hear their masters calling them from far away and even nonmasters like Harry to Dobby. I just hope that it was a voluntary oath not something the wizards forced upon the elves. I prefer to think that the elves were so weak and could not survive in the savage struggle against other magical beings like goblins centaurs etc. and chose to serve wizards top of the food chain to avoid being wiped out and guaranteed accommodation and relativelywellbeing life. It may have been random cases of some elves making unbreakable vow or similar vow to certain wizards out of their own choices their children and grandchildren inheriting and succeeding the vow and in the end only those elves who chose to become house elves survive until modern day.

5660711,0,t3_3sl0ra,This is a really difficult question since there are already spells that take care of virtually all the needs of a human being. I mean consider that they have tents that are as large as a small apartment inside. There are at least two ways to conjure permanent water. You cant conjure food but you can turn a little bit of food into more food and presumably you can transfigure it into any other form of food.Consider the struggle of living. Even in the most developed places in the world everyone still struggles to find a job and work at least half of their waking hours in order to have a place to live and food to eat. Its all solved with a few spells. Even most modern necessities can be taken care of. Cleaning the home and hygiene can be taken care of magically.Theres no reason half of the magical world didnt just drop a tent in the middle of the Amazon and live there or something.Then theres all these healing spells human transfiguration whatever. Health issues and body image taken care of.So I dont really know. Once you take away these stresses I dont think I would have any need for further convenience. Life wouldnt be hard anymore all the spells already exist to take care of everything I would ever consider a major inconvenience.

5662762,0,t3_3so0hb,This may sound dumb but I enjoyed the house elf parts of the series a lot. We get to see the story mostly through Dobby and Kreacher and find out that house elves actually have really sad lives. Kreacher is the grumpy old slave resigned to his fate that a lot of house elves inevitably become while Dobby is rescued from that fate.But even though we get to see over and over that Dobby has so much potential he still ends up working in a kitchen along with dozens of other house elves. There are just no real opportunities for his kind. And in the end he dies a hero but he was only one house elf. The rest are still enslaved. I know its a dark part of the series to focus on but the casual way in which most of the wizarding world dismisses the plight of the house elves was really significant to me because its so relatable to many very real situations of slavery and racism. People who are otherwise not malevolent the Weasleys for example just have no reason to question the way things are done because its always been that way. Its not hard to draw a connection between purebloods discriminating against mudbloods and wizards discriminating against house elvs and Hermione realizes this but only because she comes from the muggle world and grew up learning about slavery and racism in the British Empires past.We also get thrown other little tidbits of information throughout the series such as how goblins arent allowed to have wands and how centaur live on reservations and how Hagrid experienced discrimination for being halfgiant.I dont know why this part of the series is so important to me but it makes me think about how entirely different our modern western perspective on civil rights is compared to the past and the wizarding society gives us a glimpse at that past. Its not that there is a long history of freeing the oppressed you have at the same time slavery and discrimination against entire groups of beings like mudbloods house elves goblins centaurs giants with no former progress to use as a basis. And that reminds me that in our own nottoodistant past racial discrimination was acceptable women didnt have their freedoms homosexuals were hidden in the shadows xenophobia was rampant and caused countless wars and all of that was happening AT THE SAME TIME.There were probably countless Hermiones in our past who could look at all these things and conclude that the world is really fucked up but they felt powerless to change things.Our own world took a really sharp turn in the direction of equality for everyone but it didnt have to. Harry Potter shows us the s in a parallel world where discrimination is still enshrined in law and supported by almost everyone.,harrypotter,cwz0r57,5,t5_2qiqi

Plus he knew that Regulus was super intoloyal to Voldemort and was never dissuaded of that so of course he would jump to help him. And hes been alone in the house for a long time. I also imagine that Sirius was always a dick to Kreacher even when he was younger so theres a lot of built up resentment. There was enough toxicity without the locket to ensure that he would have betrayed Sirius.I dont know if the locket affected him at all though. Or that poison he drank in the cave?

Im sort of tired of this kind of stuff but its good discussion. Whoever wrote this probably didnt read the book and only saw the films...maybe. This person is just latching onto this ONE flaw and going nuts with it. Trying to get attention or something given the political stuff. Can we all remember that all the characters in these books are flawed no one is perfect. Its realistic and we can learn from that. So onto Ron....Ron was a kid he grew up and learned and now hes better. You probably had prejudices as a kid. Everyone does. Id say hes more prejudice than anything. Racism is not the right term. In the books he has some worse flaws than prejudice that most teens have mainly jealousy and being a jerk at times. He also told Lupin not to touch him half because of the werewolf thing AND half because it seemed Lupin had BETRAYED them to mass murder Sirius Black who is after Harry Potter. He is prejudice because he picked it up from people around him the community or because he heard scary stories and assumed Werewolf BAD!. This could be anything. Like assuming muggles are all stupid. Some people hate dogs because the only one they knew was scary and mean....until they meet more dogs that arent jumping and biting and loud. Its similar here. Lupin puts a person to a werewolf and Rons view is changed. He becomes a better person. He could have reacted worse to it but he didnt. Hagrid was unsurprisingly half giant. Ron cared about him and visited him even when he did questionable things. Ron is very loyal. Even after finding out about his giant gene or whatever he didnt abandon him. Prejudice is one flaw in Rons character that he was able to change. Draco was able to change in the end. What we should take from this is that people CAN change for the better. ,harrypotter,cx6fmnp,1,t5_2qiqi
5723806,0,t3_3tiepk,idk i think you are romanticizing him just a bit. If Lucius did not lose favor with Voldemort do you honestly believe Draco would have changed? It was only when he and his family were threaten that sparked a change that maybe being a Death Eaters is lifestyle not worth living. Even though he didnt out Harry in the manor you just cant forget that he tried to interfere with the trio when they looked for the Diadem. In a sense i think Dudley ended up being the better redemption story and its because he had a choice. Dudley didnt have to change because his family wasnt in any danger and he wasnt in any danger. Him being nice or him being an asshole would change nothing but he choose try to become a better person without any outside other than the fact he got to see himself for what he was. ,harrypotter,cx6lf0h,4,t5_2qiqi

5730347,0,t1_cx75qr5,gt gt And if the Elder Wand was capable of killing its master why did it rebound onto Voldemort at the end?This question I think is less paramount to the story and as such has a correspondingly less significant answer edit compared to the other question you asked that is. However it is still rather important and I do think there IS an answer I just think that answer varies depending on the whim of the reader and there isnt necessarily one correct away of looking at it.My own interpretation is tied to wandlore and the idea that wands have a sort of sentient ability to make choices.gt You talk about wands like theyve got feelings said Harry like they canthink for themselves.gt The wand chooses the wizard said Ollivander. That much has alwaysbeen clear to those of us who have studied wandlore. DH ch. The Wandmakerand a few paragraphs later Ollivander expands on that...gt Subtle laws govern wand ownership but the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master.I agree with you that a wands are generally loyal to their masters and I think in an ordinary situation an ordinary duel a wand will not kill its master for that reason.But... what if the will of the master was to die? And what if the wand was not sentimental but switched its allegiance often and based on rather arbitrary instances of power? It has a strange idea of loyalty.I do get the feeling that people think the wand is undefeatable. But its history of moving from person to person shows that this wand is literally the most defeatable wand ever. Its reputation is hardly accurate. Ive always wondered where people get the idea that its undefeatable when its right there in the book that its definitely not.So anyway we have Harry and Voldemort facing each other in the forest  a duel so to speak but Harry is not even attempting to fight. Obviously the Elder Wand is attracted to strength and power. So then we have to figure out  will the wand switch allegiance in this exchange? In this particular duel who does it consider more powerful the one willing to kill or the one willing to die?I personally think it considers Harry more powerful because it doesnt switch allegiance and because I believe it considers itself fulfilling the wishes of its master. It is not sentimental it does not care about Harry or Voldemort on a deep level it just decides that in this moment Harry is more powerful and does what he wants it to do.Anyway those are just my thoughts. I actually have a few different ideas on this and it changes slightly every once in a while but this is pretty must the gist of it.,harrypotter,cx7eltz,1,t5_2qiqi
5730751,0,t1_cx7fdl0,The killing curse never actually hit Harry it hit the horcrux.  A wand wont harm its master and the elder wand by that point was Harrys wand and remained so because he volunteered to sacrifice himself.  He meant for voldemort to hit him with the curse in order for the horcrux to be destroyed.  A wand will change allegiance if its owner is overpowered or otherwise loses control of the wand as was the case when Draco disarmed Dumbledore which was not part of the plan and when Harry disarmed Draco afterward which is how he came to be the elder wands true master.,harrypotter,cx7gexz,2,t5_2qiqi

5735868,0,t3_3tntoy,I think that part of the reason why I grapple so much with the idea of Slytherin not being the catchall asshole house is that nearly every person that has ever bullied me in the HP fandom and I mean actual bullying not wellintentioned back and forth has been a Slytherin. For some reason the houses values have been conflated to be nasty and mean instead of self effacing. To be honest Narcissa Malfoy is in my mind the perfect Slytherin. Ambitious cunning wily and absolutely without question willing to do whatever she has to to keep her best interests Dracos safety sound.I dont know when people started using the Slytherin banner as an excuse to be an unbearable jackass but its what a lot of the younger fans think it stands for now and that drives me nuts.

5886883,0,t1_cxr9xv4,Its a bit more complicated than this but see it as the catastrophic event that made him reevaluate himself and his loyalties. Lily was dead and he was partially responsible for it. He could not save her but protecting her son was the next best thing. He does so grudgingly he doesnt care about her son at all until Dumbledore shames him into it but he protects him. Its his path to redemption a way to atone himself and to protect the last remnant of Lily. It is never about Harry.As for his loyalty to Voldemort it died pretty much when he killed Lily even though Snape had asked him not to. I dont think he was ever all that keen on the pureblood business anyway. He was fascinated by the dark arts but it was more like somewhere to belong to the right crowd to help him be powerful a sentiment not uncommon in neglected children. It doesnt excuse him but it makes it easier to understand how he can change sides and fight against his former ideals. If you want to be cynical about it it certainly didnt hurt that changing sides spared him from a oneway trip to Azkaban. And Voldemort was gone anyway.

6007764,0,t1_cy710a1,EDITTrying to put this entirely to bed Ravenclawstyle here  Can you help?  I need fluent ideally native speakers of languages other than English!EDIT Follow up! languages came in all with translations of the passage as indicating emotional state rather than skin tone.  I think this data indicates that those who would consider translations as canon must conclude that this passage is not evidence regarding Hermiones race.I hold that my initial interpretation was reasonable given the information I had at the time but with this added data I now agree with the interpretation and conclusion that Hermiones race is not indicated by this passage.  I am not aware of any other passage which permits a reading that explicitly indicates Hermiones race and I therefore conclude  to the extent of my knowledge now  that anyrace Hermione is consistent with canon.Original comment follows to maintain the record.gt What her actual skin colour or ethnicity is is completely irrelevant as she is a fictional character and cannot be seen by anyone for what she really is other then her creator herself.Thats ridiculous.  If canon explicitly makes a statement the author doesnt get to come back and say uh...I was lying.  Go with this.  The followup points you made are what matter not what JKR says after the fact.Harry Potter is male.  Ron and Ginny Weasley are siblings.  Dumbledores full name is Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.  Hermiones name is pronounced Hermyohnee GoF US p..Maybe the book is wrong!  Maybe Harrys actually female but was given testosterone injections in his sleep!  Maybe Ginny is adopted!  Maybe the man everyone thinks is Dumbledore is really Fred Cunningham with an assumed identity!  Maybe Hermione was just screwing with Krum and Krum was right the first time with Hermyown.Maybe despite that the text says Hermiones white face was sticking out from behind a tree PoA US p. her face isnt actually white?  Ridiculous.  Whats the point of reading and engaging with a story if youre just going to throw it out the window?That doesnt mean you cant cast a black actress to play the part.  It doesnt mean you cant like the idea of her having been black.  But the character in the books wasnt.  There are plenty of other demographic considerations among other things! that arent in canon which are implied and consistent without jumping through insane conspiracytheory hoops e.g. Dumbledore being gay or Anthony Goldstein being Jewish.  But when the text explicitly gives information about a character its true except in cases of the technique of an unreliable narrator...and I think we can agree that Harry is reliable about colors.Kingsley Shacklebolt Lee Jordan Angelina Johnson Dean Thomas and Blaise Zabini are black.  Plenty of other students skin colors arent mentioned or pictured in canon illustrations.  Wikipedia says that  of the UK are black.  Those five therefore allow for a population of  physicallydescribed characters before the books dont match let alone reasonably represent British demographics.The book says Hermiones face is white among other passages which also imply light skin.  Shes white.  I dont understand the problem.,harrypotter,cy75dkt,78,t5_2qiqi

What the author sees in her mind while writing is not necessarily the end all be all.

Look at roles where actors canonically change like James Bond or Doctor Who.If the actor is just good people think of them as terrible because theyre being compared with greatness.The greater the change the harsher that effect.Kenneth Branagh gets away with his racebending characters like Heimdall in Thor a Norse God played by Idris Elba because he chooses people that are fucking amazing.

6096408,0,t1_cyie7go, What is the name of the fourth hallow? What magical properties does it possess?The Ring of Affinity. Its a ring that when worn will make anyone who you touch instantly like you. Like you as in enemies stop being hostile strangers are more friendly towards you abd people tend to agree with what you say so sort of a weaker version of a love potion but with unlimited uses.  What is the story of how the sister found Death? How does her encounter with Death and her hallow affect her life?The younger sister was very friendly and didnt want a way to hide from others or a way to look at the dead and especially didnt want a powerful weapon. She merely wanted to live a happy peaceful life and figured that this ring would be incredibly useful to her. She found death when she heard about her brother being a powerful wizard who beat everyone in battle. Upset she sought him out to try to convince him to be less violent and more careful. Sadly she was too late he had already been murdered in his sleep and his wand stolen. However she arrived just in time to find Death claiming her brother. She begged Death to give her the ring so that she could prevent further deaths. Death felt sorry for her as she had just lost a brother and so took a ring from her and bestowed magical properties on it.  What is the legend of the hallow? What is its history? Is there a rumor about its existence? Does it have a long and bloody history?I sort of went over some of the back story in the previous question but Ill expand on it some more. The sister after receiving the ring went on to become a powerful noble using the ring to gain power in the hopes of insuring peace at least in her country. However the ring slowly made her even more powerhungry over time as she could easily use it to make anyone do anything she wanted anything at all. Eventually she became a queen and wanted to expand her kingdom. But as time grew on people began to suspect that there were properties about her ring that she never was seen without. One night the Queen was killed in her sleep and her ring stolen. The assassin almost instantly took control of the kingdom as the ring helped him along. The ring quickly became known as a good luck charm that gave the wearer great power few people who hadnt worn the ring suspected its actual power. Many people wanted power of the kingdom but they all realized that the ring was the ultimate symbol of power so they all fought for it. Many assassinations later many successful and many more unsuccessful the ring was lost from history. It couldve been lost during a revolt or taken by someone who refused to use it to gain power or it could have simply been misplaced. But it slowly faded away from history over the centuries. Bonus Draw an image of the four hallows together.Image here I wanted a design that was very similar to the preexisting Deathly Hallows symbol so I just added a gem to the Resurrection Stone to symbolize the Ring. ,harrypotter,cyilkpa,2,t5_2qiqi

6187465,0,t1_cysvutn,I second this. The footprints of both persons look close to each other. Men usually stand with their feet apart whereas women almost always stand with their two heels very close to each other. We can assume that the pair of footprints that are a bit apart belongs to the guy and the other pair of footprints the girls. We can also infer that the guy has his back against the wall.Sorry for the following somewhat NSFW comment I have seen some porn videos and for a couple to be doing the deed while standing up the guys legs would have to be spread farther apart than the pair of footprints on the Marauders Map. Besides physics would require the female to be leaning on to something for support as the thrusting action would cause her to topple over. If the pair of lovebirds were indeed having sex both would fall onto the floor because the girl has no means of counterbalance like a table or wall.,harrypotter,cysy7gl,3,t5_2qiqi

I dont have anything to argue here just going to go more into it.gt Perhaps he had other back up plans as well but they just werent needed because hed already given Harry the information.This would make sense to me if he did. His will was so prepared at least I believe considering he did not know he was going to die that night and it would make sense then that he would do everything sort of stepbystep. As in every day prepared that this could be his last.gt I will always say someone else could have because I dont believe in propheciesI believe this too. Ive come to decide after thinking a lot about it that prophecies are more of a hindrance and far from anything that could ever help someone. It just seems to me at least in the Harry Potter series that they are useless. They either dont come true at all so whats the point? they only come true because someone makes them come true or they only come true because that was genuinely something that was going to happen anyway no matter if there was a prophecy or not. But for entertainment purposes I love books that have prophecies its just an irrational thing of mine. And I know its so overdone and cliche in literature but I dont know I just still sort of like the idea of a Chosen One and reading about the burden and journey that comes from being that person. Just a silly thing of mine DAbsolutely nothing more to say about your last paragraph and thisgt was fully prepared to assume Harry would be like any other kid only to find that not to be the caseexcept for the fact that its just unfortunate it had to be a seventeenyearold boy. And you said this but I agree too that this is something Dumbledore struggled with. I agree that Dumbledore would not have included Harry if hed had it any other way. I believe Harry would have turned seventeen graduated Hogwarts and then joined the Order and do whatever was needed there. Whether or not Dumbledore would have even included him at all in the Horcrux hunt if hed lived is something I really dont know. But what the hell was Dumbledore supposed to do when hes going to die and the next best person to do this is a teenager? Id even argue that Harry was better to do the job than Dumbledore as I sort of touched on in my post but thats a whole other debate. I said this in my post but really age does not and cannot matter here when theres too much at stake and the next best person to do the job is a teenager.,harrypotter,czcnshb,2,t5_2qiqi

SourceNot to mention the additional fact that Sirius James and Peter were not putting anyone in harms way by being illegal animagi except themselves technically They were not an additional threat if anything they helped contain Remus and thus lowered the threat level. Plus it was against school rules to leave your common room after dark and the doors were locked as shown in HBP when Harry takes the Felix Felicis and finds the front door conveniently unlocked.gtattempting to unleash a Werewolf on another studentThey werent unleashing Remus on Snape Sirius had conveniently disclosed the information on how to follow Remus and Madam Pomfrey.Your point about FBaWtFt is spoton and I forgot thats an actual textbook they use.  But I still dont think Sirius quite considered the consequence of Snape actually getting as far as the Shrieking Shack. Considering the fact that theres a teacher with Remus you would think she would be there to prevent someone from stumbling in dont you?gtthe worst case scenario of death as Myrtle proved the first time the Basilisk was used or best case scenario of reversible petrification.This is just generally incorrect information and kinda irrelevent  the stare of a Basilisk kills... except in the Hogwarts case in  where every single victim out of a grand total of  met the Basilisks eyes through another object. Completely coincidental. Source  PottermoreBook Sourcegt To say Sirius goal wasnt to kill Snape implies that he didnt know that Werewolves are dark creatures which is obviously not trueI explained my reasoning. It doesnt imply anything because I believe I was straightforward in my opinion which is in my comment you replied to. He was a kid  or  years old knowing Remus was escorted by a teacher knowing Remus was loud thats why it was called the Shrieking Shack knowing the school was patrolled etc. I dont think he really considered that Snape could actually die or that Snape would honestly get that far. Snape wasnt stupid he was a social outcast.gtKeeping the prank a secret from James until the last minute shows Sirius intended to let Snape die because it served him right.Again the served him right was spoken after maybe  years of Azkaban which was  years of the Wizarding World and all the news that came with it  he was almost definitely speaking on hindsight. At the time yes Sirius also believed it would have served him right for being a prying twat but I still dont think Sirius considered just how much danger he was putting Snape in.It might be because Im still exposed to kids that age and because I can still remember being in middle school but Im standing by what Ive stated. Kids dont think through much of their actions Sirius used his good looks and tomfoolery to make people like him and I just dont think he was ever a killer. He didnt even kill that night he was murdered  he disarmed Lucius and then pushed him away. I think he was being a cocky POS with an enemy in middle school and a chance to finally see said enemy suffer in some way or another. ,harrypotter,czfluac,1,t5_2qiqi

6474196,0,t3_44au9a,To me Harry is just an average wizard overall but is above average in DADA and Quidditch. The only reason he even beat Voldemort was pure luck. Due to Dumbledores planning a plan Harry was completely ignorant of until Snape gave him the memories not long before Draco ended up with the Elder Wand and thus Harry got the Elder Wand. So in other words Voldemort lost because he tried using the Elder Wand against its master. That is literally the reason he survived the Avada Kedavra in the forest. Without having mastery of the Elder Wand Harry would have died and Voldemort would have unknowingly destroyed one of his own Horcruxes.That is confirmed when McGonagall Kingsley and Slughorn dueled Voldemort and I should emphasize that the former three are all far far stronger and more skilled than Harry already as Snape proved at the end of HBP yet Voldemort defeated all at once even when he wasnt the actual master of the Elder Wand and with Harrys protections shielding everyone. That basically confirms in canon that Harry is objectively an average wizard overall. Harry couldnt even beat McGonagall Kingsley or Slughorn in a duel by Deathly Hallows let alone beat twothree of them at once. The fact that Bellatrix duels Hermione Luna and Ginny all at once only rubs it in further since Hermione is already more skilled overall than Harry at magic yet Bellatrix was handling not only her but both Luna and Ginny too and those two arent slouches either. Harry couldnt beat Hermione Luna and Ginny in a v duel nor would be stalemate them hed just get wrecked.People cite Harrys Patronus as being an example of being powerful yet the Patronus doesnt require particular magic strength or intelligence to use. It just requires strong happy emotions or memories. With the one exception of the timeturner event Harrys Patronus is onpar with the rest of the Patronuses used by those his age.Objectively speaking Harrys feats pale in comparison to the previous generations as well as some of his own generation Dumbledore did things with a wand that Id never seen before according to his N.E.W.T examiner and published academic work in The Practical Potioneer and Challenges in Charming in addition to being the winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional SpellCasting the British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot and the Gold MedalWinner for GroundBreaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference in Cairo. That was all while he he was a student. Voldemort was considered the most brilliant student that Hogwarts ever had. Even if Dumbledore was modest that still puts Voldemort as the nd most brilliant student ever. He made a Horcrux at the age of  and went onto make multiple Horcruxes transcending the boundaries of magic. And thats just the stuff we know he did in his student years. James Sirius and Peter all became Animagi at the age of  and THAT far outclasses anything Harry ever did by himself without luck. Becoming an animagus is an academic acheivement and one where very few people have even attempted to become an animagus. On top of that James and Sirius were considered to be great students academically. Those three in addition to Lupin created the Marauders Map a device which hasnt been replicated by any other means. Snape created various spells when he was a Hogwarts student such as Sectumsempra Levicorpus Libracorpus Muffllio Langlock the ToenailGrowing Hex and of course Vulnera Sanentur. He was also smarter than those who wrote the books as he made annotations for the Draught of Living Death Poison Antidote and Elixir to Induce Euphoria to make them better. Hermione got all Outstandings in every subject except Defence Against the Dark Arts where she got Exceeds Expectations. Either way she undeniably outclasses Harry in every field which isnt DADA or Quidditch and is more skilled. The fact that she is a muggleborn only makes this even more impressive. Fred and George set up their own business and became one of the most popular in all of Diagon Alley. Additionally they invented most of the stuff if not everything they sell in their store.,harrypotter,czoz7qp,7,t5_2qiqi

Although ron saw ambitious things in the mirror of erised he would never climb over others to get it. Thats not the mark of a slytherin. Hermione has ravenclaw traits such as her book smarts but on several occasions she proves to be closedminded. Such as hating devination although its a real thing. She also is uncomfortable around luna even though luna knows answers that hermione could never give him. Such as to the location of the diadem the insight on voldemort etc. hermione is genius but not very open minded or philosophical as most ravenclaws. But harry is definitely through and through griffindor. So is neville. Hufflepuffs are unafraid of toil. Bravery is defined as being terrified but standing up and doing it anyway.

From what I know this is kinda one of the big Marauders Era fanfics. Either way it was pretty damn good. Jily iirc and Wolfstar.      Casting Moonshadows  Moonsign  This is a long one but I loved it so so much... it took a darker route than many other fics but Moonsign made it work and Im into it. Its about their time at Hogwarts basically with some really interesting elements thrown in and I would  recommend it. Jily Wolfstar.      Harry Potter and the Marauders of the Mind  Moonsign    Also by Moonsign not a sequel but makes subtle references to CM so if you read that before this youll catch little adorable things that might otherwise have been missed. This is postDH preEpilogue Harry gets into some stuff with LilyJamesRemusSirius its amazing I cant reveal more. Romione Jily Wolfstar.       The Life and Times  Jewels   This is a well known fanfiction and for a good reason too. It even has its own fandom. I havent finished reading it yet but its awesome so far.

6652035,0,t3_46r2bc,At the very least I think some of them can dress like muggles even those from pureblood families. Barty Crouch Sr passed as a muggle when Harry saw him and Harry even thought that Vernon wouldnt recognise him as a wizard describing Crouch Sr in a suit as looking like a banker. Maybe he might not know stuff about the muggle world we take for granted e.g. transport electricity etc but hed at least TRY to fit in unlike the more ignorant wizards who wore stuff like a poncho and a sombero and whatever other silly things they wore in GoF. Then again maybe Crouch Sr knows more about muggles than the vast majority of nonmuggleborn wizards and maybe even some of those too due to being a very highranking person in the ministry who would have to deal with all sorts of people.Fudge similarly could probably pass as a muggle albeit not as good as Crouch Sr. Maybe hed wear a suit and tie but it would look so unfashionable or out of place e.g. his green bowler hat maybe hed wear it with a purple suit and whatever else would be out of place for muggles. Though considering he was Minister for Magic I think he would be able to pass as a formallydressed muggle which is enough since hed be dealing with the prime minister rather than say muggles like Hermiones parents or just the average muggles.Even Voldemort of all people yes he grew up in the muggle world but its Voldemort... dressed up in a suit when he went to meet Hepzibah Smith. Considering Voldemorts hate for muggles I think whatever knowledge he has of them would be coated with extreme bias. He would probably have known of the more notable muggle events WW specifically the Blitz and dropping of the Atomic Bomb of his time but would have forgotten them by the time of the First Wizarding War.Maybe Voldemort has some basic understanding of stuff like the Atom Bomb e.g. muggle blast used to kill loads of other muggles or the Blitz e.g. planes fly over Britain and but thinks that mere muggle advancements in his mind couldnt possibly matter to him or his conquest. In my headcanon Voldemort definitely would NOT know about later muggle advancements from  since he would be too distant from the muggle world by then whereas anything that was  or sooner might still be a possibility.,harrypotter,d07dm7j,8,t5_2qiqi

So chances are theyd be mostly unknowns. Lily will need to be an absolute stunner as will Sirius. Gary Oldman for all his considerable talent was nowhere near handsome or slick and charismatic enough to adequately portray Sirius Black.

6676104,0,t3_4725gn,Unfortunately a lot of these spells arent fully explained in the books or on Pottermore. We have to sort of make assumptions and educated guesses for a lot of these.. I would imagine Reducto would have really messy consequences if you used it on a human. I read a fanfiction once where Harry got hit with it and it broke a bunch of ribs and left a giant bruise that took weeks to heal. Its not canon but that sounds about right to me. . Like with most spells the effectiveness is dependent on your intent. So for Sectumsempra if youre just waving your wand willy nilly hoping to cause whatever pain you can looking at you Harry then multiple slashes will appear. If you intend to just cut open their cheek for example then you could make it do that. You can make your target as small or as large as your skill will allow.. As someone else mentioned Expelliarmus is just for disarming someone. It might knock them over but it wont stun them like Stupefy would. Stupefy will actually knock someone unconscious. . I think Confringo would create a bigger explosion than Expulso. Expulso creates an explosion that can throw people into walls but Confringo which is what Pettigrew used to kill all those muggles is deadly and produces a lot of damage around the explosion.. You can use Diffindo on humans and like Sectumsempra you can change it slightly depending on intent. ,harrypotter,d09v87e,1,t5_2qiqi

I feel it was a mistake on JKRs part to not utilize the Battle of Hogwarts when it came to the Slytherins  while it was illustrated time and again that any house could churn out good and bad wizards though some were more or less likely Slytherin seriously never really was given that chance besides having Snape and Slughorn being convenient members of it  and even then it seemed in spite of their house not because of or totally irrelevant of.

6853553,0,t3_49n0i6,I think for  amp  youre judging her based on concerns that dont seem to be present in the wizarding world. Its more violent there probably because common injuries can be fixed quickly. They play a game where hard balls are spelled to hit them. The librarian caused books to repeatedly smack Harry and Ginny over the head in OoTP. Fake!Moody bounced a student and all McGonagall did was let him know they dont transfigure before letting him drag away the student he just assaulted. Their idea of friendly competition is to put students internationally into a tournament where people have died. Ron throws a knife at his brother and gets nothing but a fivesecond scolding. This is the culture Ginny grew up in. It doesnt play by the same rules. I love Fleur but she showed herself to be selfinvolved and condescending in GOF. Ginny even complains that Fleur talks to her like shes . When we first see her in HBP shes breezing past Mrs. Weasleys wishes in her own house smacks her in the face with her hair and then makes what sounds like a disparaging comment about there being only cooking and chickens at the Burrow. I doubt she is a joy to live with. Its not gentlemenlike to ignore a ladies own wishes and it certainly sounded like it was something Ginny pointed out before. She even irritably says that he always does it. Theres nothing wrong with either of them in that situation especially since it was invisible Harry that did it. However if Dean wants to help a girl through portrait holes he needs someone else. And if Ginny wants someone to leave her to help herself she also needs someone else.

Anyway JKs stayed clear of religious references like saying Jesus only had healing abilities because hes a regular ordinary Harry Potter wizard while vaguely mentioning every religion has a pupil at Hogwarts. I can kindve see how Native American culture would be tied to religion and to say this only happened to this spiritual character is because theyre wizards might be seen as similar to making Jesus a wizard.

Hes not the most avant garde person in the universe.However we all know that Voldemort has a connection with wizards and beings in Eastern Europe in particular he sends envoys to the giants and Karkaroff has an affinity for him. I could see him going for a nice steaming bowl of kasha with a pat of butter. Its hearty and keeps him going for his day of murdering.What we need to consider here is his sense of smell.

7051571,0,t1_d1fijfw,I disagree with literally every single one of your points except the Buckbeak one.Harry. Calling him insufferable is being impossibly unfair to him. Hes a teenager who is thrust into a central role in a war. Yeah it stresses him out. But hes forced to mature much faster than a teenager normally would so theres gonna be some turbulence. I think hes an incredibly wellwritten character.Hermione. She is just destroyed in the movies. By removing all of her flaws they took out everything that made her human. She becomes this bastion of perfection that cant do anything wrong. Shes a freaking Mary Sue. And furthermore as a result of her becoming freaking perfect Rons character is completely annihilated.Voldemort. Hes decent in the movies but he is amazing in the books. He seems like this perfect villain whos got everything figured out this time. Hes cold calculating completely ruthless and he doesnt awkwardly hug teenagers. Then we start to see his facade crack slowly at first before crumbling completely in the climax of Deathly Hallows where we see him fully for the coward that he is.Hogwarts. The movies definitely did Hogwarts very well. But to say that Rowling didnt in the books is absurd. She is an excellent descriptor.Hagrid. Theres nothing wrong with his accent some people have strong accents. And they didnt make him more humorous in the movies they made him downright dimwitted.Ginny. The rest of this stuff could be chalked up to opinion but saying that Ginny in the movies was better than Ginny in the books is simply objectively incorrect. To call movie Ginny a pale imitation of book Ginny would be overly generous.Buckbeak flight. I have no idea what youre talking about with this one so maybe.Quidditch. It was immensely entertaining in the books. There are major problems with quidditch itself as a sport but Rowling still managed to make them exciting because we could hear Lee Jordan and knew what was going on. In the movies wed get one or two shots of the  exciting players doing something and then just watch Harry fly around. Dont get me wrong I like quidditch in the movies very much. But I want to watch the whole game not just the seeker. Further far and away the most exciting quidditch matches in the books are the GryffindorRavenclaw and GryffindorSlytherin matches in PoA which got taken out of the movies entirely. The whole House Quidditch Cup subplot got removed which is a major shame.,harrypotter,d1fnjxr,58,t5_2qiqi

7189519,0,t1_d1vafjk,You dont need to be a mass murdering dark wizard to use that curse though. The death eaters werent in the habit of giving people outs. Voldemort wasnt in the habit of giving people a chance to survive. He only gave Lily one because Snape requested it. So it is very understandable no other occurrences of this happened during the wizarding war.Throughout history it may have happened before but on such a smaller scale that it wouldnt have been properly recorded. Maybe something like a parent angry that his daughter wants to marry a muggle tells her to step aside to kill the muggle but oh no she jumps in to save him. Such a situation couldve activated that same curse but wouldnt necessarily be recorded in history. If there was just a muggle eyewitness after all he might not be able to tell wizards. Or more likely people are so convinced that the curse cannot be deflected that they just assume there must have been an error in the casting rather than actual shielding or that the muggle didnt know which spell was being used. ,harrypotter,d1vdy5z,3,t5_2qiqi

The great medieval wandmaker Geraint Ollivander wrote that he was always honoured to match a cypress wand for he knew he was meeting a witch or wizard who would die a heroic death. Fortunately in these less bloodthirsty times the possessors of cypress wands are rarely called upon to lay down their lives though doubtless many of them would do so if required. Wands of cypress find their soul mates among the brave the bold and the selfsacrificing those who are unafraid to confront the shadows in their own and others natures.

Theyre ok but I find it very hard to relate to them so were a little bit distanced emotionally..  years strong were equally snarky with each other and affectionate..

I try to attain perfection in anything I attempt and I get discouraged easily if I think I suck at all.. I would say the arts since Im very musical and Ive studied design.. I let people do what they want to do and be who they want to be..

Also an acceptance of each others awkwardness if any at times. That being said I can be friends with anyone that Ive had enough time to get to know but that sort of thing happens with time and cant be forced.. Its hard to say because I dont know whether or not I would have considered my magical knowledge suffice. It could easily have gone either way. If I didnt know what the challenges were I might have but knowing how physical they were I dont think I would have felt adequate.. Hufflepuffs are awesome and I admire them because I think they tend to be selfless hospitable and hardworking. Gryffindors are inspiring because they take risks and follow their heart with what they feel is right. Slytherins are important coz they getshitdone and efficiently.

7336614,0,t3_4ftmy5,Christian pastor here dont all freak out at once. This kind of stuff makes my blood boil. Particularly because there are two mainstream fantasy series Chronicles of Narnia and LotR who implement similar tropes and storylines some even more extreme than HP yet get a free pass because they were authored by very outright Christian men. First off J.K. Rowling herself has expressed that she too believes in God and Christ and incorporated her beliefs into her writing. Just because it is not something she is the most outspoken about doesnt mean a thing. Her heart is in it and it shows. I am personally a huge fan and upon reading them found the second half of my previous statement her faith expressed in her writing to be very blatantly obvious. Theres a ton of Christian symbolism lions vs serpents the Resurrection the power of love conquering all to name a few in those stories. I will love reading these books to my kids some day and even having a chance to show them the parallels. The fact that this is still apparently an issue of this caliber makes me shake my head at the level of ignorance among the religious community and its a shining example of precisely why there are so many problems with it.Edit I also used the series as an example in one of my sermons once.

7338063,0,t1_d2bughg, Honestly I dont think its too far off base to think that maybe when Voldemort used the room to hide the diadem that it wasnt the Room of Requirement as others in need found it. Think about it  for Fred and George its a small broom closet to hide in. For Dumbledore its an obscure bathroom at  a.m. For Harry and the D.A. its a nearly impenetrable room full of all they need to practice Defense. For Neville and the resistance its a truly safe place away from Snape and the Carrows. I dont think its impossible to think that when Voldemort used it it was just a small empty room perhaps with a pedestal in the center just for the diadem. The room forms itself based completely on the users needs. Voldemort wouldnt have been thinking I need a place to hide this. and leave it at that. He would be very specific and bring it all back to himself. More  I need somewhere safe protected special and secret to place MY treasure.     I dont even think it would have entered his mind to put it somewhere common or already used so the room presented itself as a private secret place. But from then on anyone else who used it specifically to hide something wouldnt have been making such clear demands and distinctions and since the room itself just sees the diadem as something hidden it would be grouped in with all the other stuff should anyone but Voldemort come calling.  Hes so wrapped up in himself and his needs that he never would have allowed the room to become common when he called for it. Therefore it would be perfectly acceptable for him to think he was the one and only person to find the room. Up until the last moment he stills thinks the diadem is safe still deluded into thinking that hes the special one the only person to know all of Hogwarts secrets and to have used them to his and his alone advantage.    I really hope that makes sense. Its a strange thing to work out.  ,harrypotter,d2cacw7,105,t5_2qiqi

7360705,0,t3_4g3tz2,I think many variables come in to play when it comes to wand allegiance.  The stakes of the battle certainly come in to play but if I am not mistaken the makeup of each wand is a key factor in the changing of allegiance.  For instance dragon heartstrings though generally wellbonded to its owner may be persuaded to change allegiance more easily than a Phoenix feather wand.Theoretically the alignment of the winner may play a significant role in the allegiance of a wand.  For instance a unicorn hair wand won from an Order member by a death eater may not change allegiance as unicorn hair is along with being the most loyal of known wand cores is the most stubborn in regards to turning to the dark arts.Remember if were going by Ollivanders wand lore theories which are likely correct each wand is essentially sentient and while most behaviors may be anticipated each wand is unique and may not necessarily conform to expectations.,harrypotter,d2ev140,2,t5_2qiqi

7486349,0,t1_d2stmfw,I gather that my opinion is wrong from the downvotes but I thought that he provided a reasonable explanation for why Dumbledore would have created a horcrux. And nobody knows how a horcrux is made other than vaguely that it is very bad. My problem with the theory because I dont personally believe it either is that it has to be murder and I dont think the Dumbledore murdered Ariana even if he was the one who fired the curse to kill her. But you could certainly argue that it would have been depending on how you interpret murder. And then distraught and still with the Hallows on his mind I dont think theres anything that proves he wouldnt have especially when we dont even know how to make a horcrux. Of course its a stretch its a fan theory. But its wellsupported so all the negativity is absurd. I would like to read the Hallows not horcruxes part of seventh book again that might actually be a piece of evidence to the contrary now that I think of it.If you want to rip a theory rip the Dumbledore is a timetraveling Ron theory imo.TLDR why do people hate this theory so much? You can disagree but it is supported by evidence from the books which leave things to the imagination. So I dont see why everyone thinks its such a sin to even think of it.

Now whether trying to transfigure someone into a pig is considered an attack is debatable. Ill say that I am pretty sure Hagrid knew that Dudley wasnt really going to turn into a pig because by his own admission hed never been good at magic. As to whether that makes it better probably not.I think just in the world of HP in general people tend to get a lot of passes for some of their behavior as observers we can judge but it may be just a reflection of the morals of the universe. In a world where magic can do great and terrible things maybe a lot of humanwizard behavior that isnt seen as super good or super evil holds lesser value? prejudice blatant bribery verbalpsychological abuse manipulation etc.Anyway if people can love and defend characters like Malfoy and Snape I feel okay with liking Hagrid. ,harrypotter,d3dlwd5,5,t5_2qiqi

It was a little petty of him but I am sure he was not completely serious. And probbaly he had taken almost as a personal insult that Rowling did not bother to go to accept the award or send anyone to do so like she did care about award and she probably does not. And people who did vote for Rowling apparently were not the normal Hugo voters apparently but Harry Potter fans that had not red the other nominees and registered to vote just so Harry Potter would win fans vote not some jury and anyone can vote if you register I believe I am not entirely sure if that is true but I think it was and if it is you can see that would be a little annoying.,harrypotter,d3key98,2,t5_2qiqi

Nevertheless I feel that its unfair for people to be already judging the actress Noma solely based on the color of her skin as well as for decisions that are completely out of Nomas control. Noma didnt cast herself after all. Rowling said on Twitter that Noma was the best actress for the role and she was cast based on her talent. Noma has also spoken out on Twitter recently saying how much playing the role of Hermione means to her.Yet some people are outright dismissing her as Hermione because Noma has dark skin without even seeing Noma perform in the role to begin with. Theyre not even giving her a chance even though Noma is not only an actress who has won awards for her other roles but one who puts  into every role she takes on. She even managed to take on and play a role she was completely unfamiliar with only days before a showing putting an astounding amount of work and heart into it and subsequently wowed audiences in the process.I really wish that people would have a little more faith in both Rowling in Noma when it comes to such an important casting. ,harrypotter,d3xaegk,23,t5_2qiqi

7867147,0,t1_d400aby,Please note that I am not invested in Hermione being white Im happy with the casting. But in addition to Hermione being described as turning pink she is also is seen her white face peeking through the trees which although it describes her emotional state black people are not usually described as white when scared or upset. Gaunt perhaps or drawn or pale or drained or a lot of other words could have been used that are more racially neutral.Also she is specifically described as having tanned over summer vacation having gotten a lot darker. As a general rule black people dont tan in a noticeable way and people with darker skin tones dont usually have a big deal made about having gotten some sun because theyre already darker.So while I dont think Hermione needs to be white I think Rowling subconsciously put things in the book that tip the scale towards interpreting Hermione as white or at the very least not black.I personally always imagined her a s Mediterranean Greek Italian or Turkish perhaps with lots of curly hair and olive skin that tans significantly in the summer. ,harrypotter,d40c943,5,t5_2qiqi

I would hypothesize that this is because changing your own memory would also cause you to form a memory of you making the changes which would partially negate the changes being made. Hence Slughorn had a correct version of the memory and the one he initially gave to Albus.Now if Albus were to modify Harrys memory it would probably be indistinguishable from a true memory or close enough as to make no difference.,harrypotter,d40nx11,2,t5_2qiqi

First of all Dumbles is a very powerful wizard and Fudge is a very stubborn unbelieving person so even if the memory was shown to Fudge Fudge would claim Dumbledore somehow magically forged the memory somehow. We can definitely see how memories can be changed and manipulated because Slughorn did that with the horcrux memory though he did a poor job with it. I also strongly doubt that Fudge would be willing to go up to the Pensieve to view the memory because of how stubborn he was being and Dumbledore insisted earlier for no one to question Harry about what happened in the graveyard so I strongly doubt that Dumbledore would insist on having him take out his memory as it would just be a reminder of what happened and Harry needed rest.,harrypotter,d41hv1x,1,t5_2qiqi

Whatever Mrs. Figg said to the contrary it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like the eerie way they moved hovering inches over the ground or the rotting smell of them or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air  A dumpy wizard with a large black mustache in the second row leaned close to his neighbor a frizzyhaired witch and whispered something in her ear. She smirked and nodded.gtBig and wearing cloaks repeated Madam Bones coolly while Fudge snorted derisively. I see. Anything else?gtYes said Mrs. Figg. I felt them. Everything went cold and this was a very warm summers night mark you. And I felt  as though all happiness had gone from the world  and I remembered  dreadful things. gtHer voice shook and died.gtMadam Bones eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it.gtWhat did the dementors do? she asked and Harry felt a rush of hope.gtThey went for the boys said Mrs. Figg her voice stronger and more confident now the pink flush ebbing away from her face. One of them had fallen. The other was backing away trying to repel the dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and produced silver vapor. On the third attempt he produced a Patronus which charged down the first dementor and then with his encouragement chased away the second from his cousin. And that  that was what happened Mrs. Figg finished somewhat lamely.gtMadam Bones looked down at Mrs. Figg in silence Fudge was not looking at her at all but fidgeting with his papers. Finally he raised his eyes and said rather aggressively Thats what you saw is it?gtThat was what happened Mrs. Figg repeated.Mrs. Figg is not convincing when describing Dementors and also says this is what happened instead of this is what I saw because she would lie then and would be implicated in lie.You might not have caught those things while reading the book but its still there. And Rowling has just confirmed it although in my opinion shes pretty clear about what happened and theres no need in that just like in case of Hagrids wand remains being in his umbrella which is implied by Ollivander in Philosopher Stone but not said outright.,harrypotter,d43lsuy,5,t5_2qiqi

This particular instance wasnt quite as egregious as some of the others since I love the sentiment behind Hermiones words but it feels incomplete. As others have mentioned Ron would have at least offered to go with him as well with the more likely scenario being that both Ron and Hermione would have attempted to stop Harry from going. I love the films and can easily recognize them as separate entities from the novels but I really wish Kloves hadnt constantly treated Ron so unfairly all due to his love for an alternate pairing which is laughable for a professional screenwriter. Rupert Grint deserved to be able to portray the rich character Ron is in the books since his performance was consistently excellent. ,harrypotter,d45kt8r,3,t5_2qiqi

He probably imagined being his righthand man or something and instead he was just treated as a random lackey incapable of following orders and perhaps more of a complication than an asset. Thats not a good place to be for someone with Lucius ego. By the time the Battle of Hogwarts happened hed been imprisoned in Azkaban and then forced into hiding once he was broken out. His son was forced into the Death Eater thing and failed miserably in the tasks he was given by Voldy. And his wife obviously had lost loyalty to Voldemort since she betrayed him in the forest for the sake of her son. I imagine he was rather relieved when Voldemort was gone and all three of them got away okay from the situation.spoilerMaybe he wanted the time turner to avoid Draco marrying Astoria. Or maybe to use it for his business ventures since he seemed to be collecting random dark trinkets. Or goodness knows maybe  years from now when we get the th canon Harry Potter story well find out that Lucius fell in love with a woman from Mars and they were broken apart by interdimensional Nazis  so he wanted the time turner in order to save his undying love for the Martian chick and avoid his marriage to NarcissaspoilerIm sure JKR will invent some excuse or another if asked in interviews.

8177502,0,t3_4rbe9j,gt But then if he was only marginally better Grindlewald ought to have been able to win since he also had an unbeatable wand right?The Elder Wand provides extrapowerful magic but does not render the bearer unbeatable. Grindelwald was a bit less talented than Dumbledore so we must either surmise that either Dumbledore was sufficiently more talented as to close the gap between them or other circumstances evened the odds.My personal opinion is that Grindelwald was probably only an even match for Dumbledore with the Elder Wand which is why it didnt guarantee his victory.gt Then I started thinking... What if the elder wand was never truly loyal to Grindlewald? Remember the manner in which he took the wand for himself? He stole it. He didnt win the wand he merely took it while it was left unguarded. Holding the wand isnt enough using it isnt enough. It was kind of similar to how Voldemort got hold of it.Grindelwald stole the wand but he also stunned Gregorovitch on the way out the window. Which leads us to...gt  So... What if Dumbledore heard the rumour about Gillerts wand and decided to investigate? He tracked down gregoravich and discovered the truth. He theories that the wands allegiance can still be swayed if gregoravich is defeated. Perhaps Dumbledore walked into that battle pretty certain that he was the master of the elder wand even though Grindlewald weilded it.Thoughts?I think this falls apart because the chain of ownership wouldnt be consistent with what is present in the series. Dumbledore would not have won the Elder Wand by defeating Grindelwald and it would not have been his to pass on to anybody.Under this particular theory youd need Dumbledore to go blitz Gregorovitch to have the Wands allegiance. He was already wary of his own thirst for power at the time so I dont think hed have taken it in this way.,harrypotter,d4zqk6f,3,t5_2qiqi

There is no obligation to take up the place however a family might not want their child to attend Hogwarts.We also know that most countries dont have their own magic school therefore more young witches and wizards are homeschooled than attend actual schools of magic. I assume that if you did not want to be educated as a wizard your parents could simply help you learn to control your random outbursts and youd be free to pursue any Muggle career of your choice. As far as whether qualifications would transfer... I have no idea. To the best of my recollection we dont even know whether there is any postgraduate education beyond Hogwarts.

Although he was very interested in the subject I look at it as he was so focused on the subject because that is one of the main skills sets for being an Auror.. Harry was an advocate for Snapes portrait to be hung in the Headmasters office. It was my understanding that Prof. Mcgonagall was the one who ordered it placed there as she was the Headmistress at the time. someone correct me on this if I am incorrect please. When Harry disarmed Draco and took his wand at that point the Elder Wands allegiance shifted to Harry regardless of the fact that Draco never took possession of the Elder Wand or if he even knew of its existence to begin with the wand knew. This due to the fact that the Elder Wand was loyal to Draco since he was the one to disarm Prof. Dumbledore. This of course was all part of Dumbledores plan.. In short yes there were  Horcruxes Harry being the eighth and unintentional Horcrux creaded.. That was the piece of Voldemorts soul that was attached to Harry while Harry was a Horcrux.Hope these answers help.

Rowlingquite rightly expressed her feeling about her pairing Ron and Hermione. She herself stated that a character of Ron is fun to write but not so much to date. Further more she said even though she dated Rons she eventually found her Harry. But nowin the plot its implied Hermione is female Snape simply because she isnt with Ron and he is all meek because he isnt with Hermione.

Reading your script has left me feeling like Im actually in some sort of alternate reality where this so called th book has been allowed to happen. It is not worth the paper its printed on and the FACT that you have made me feel that about a Harry Potter book is unforgivable. You obviously have no regard for canon so how DARE you write an official part of the series? I will not be putting this script among my Hp collection instead its going on my bonfire.

8466175,0,t1_d5zpzoa,Yeah I totally agree  it wouldve been okay to leave it ambiguous at the end but shoving in the Rosespoiler thing felt super contrived and honestly the only reason I could come up with for why theyd include that is to show that Scorpius is suddenly coolspoiler. Kind of a lame reason imo. If they did really want to set up a ScorpiusRose pairing then why not have her with them throughout the story so we actually get to know her as a D character? Shes barely in the play at all and all we know about her is that shes good at everything and kind of judgmental.

8474939,0,t1_d60w7c9,Ahh right! Hmmm... I dont think his soul was split into half every time he made a Horcrux... that would mean that some Horcruxes had significantly more soul in them than others and should have impacted him more when destroyed. The destruction of the diary in Book  would have cost him half his soul as its presumably the first Horcrux he made. I dont think he would have been able to rise again so strong in GoF after that big a loss.I definitely prefer the  per Horcrux thing... though actually it probably isnt proportioned the way I laid it out in my earlier comment. My theory is that Voldemort had full control over how much soul he put into each Horcrux and had calculated that the optimum amount was  based on what he said to Slughorn about  being the strongest magical number. Thus he probably put  of his soul into each of the  Horcruxes and retained  within himself and then when he accidentally made Harry a Horcrux the  that was still in him split in half leaving him with just  of a soul within himself  not enough for him to continue to exist physically.

8509935,0,t1_d658mcm,Still you dont have enough time to flesh out nuanced details of a Harry Potteresque plot in a play. However I would argue that if we read the Wicked script as a standalone most wouldnt find it as intriguing as the musical. Furthermore performance is the meat and potatoes of any stage show while the script is just the recipe. We cannot cast judgement on this story as we have not seen the way it was intended to be seen as a play. We havent tasted the final dish. We have only peeked at the recipe and imagined how it would taste.Also explain your reasoning behind the failed plot. I found it wonderfully paced and thoughtout. It examines the fatherson relationship and does so purposefully. Contrasting Harry and his son with Malfoy and Scorpius and others. Its a story for the reader who has grown up. The reader who is now a father. It struck a chord within me and therefore I found it immensely relatable. ,harrypotter,d65apzp,4,t5_2qiqi

8511992,0,t1_d65jbip,Thats quite a good point actually. Responsible adults could be trusted to take it responsibly but I still believe there is more risk involved for something like love potion. I see the banning of love potion as prevention of rape rather than punishing after it takes place. I know that sexual assault isnt exclusively caused by love potion so it might help make a decision on this by seeing some figures on how many issues of sexual assault are caused by love potion to help justify the regulations. Something else to note an outofdate potion could also be used to increase the strength or multiple doses so that would have to be taken into account as well. ,harrypotter,d65k1d0,3,t5_2qiqi

8521565,0,t3_4wcwtu,I have to start out with my Slytherin RantI have often thought that the Sorting Hat via Rowling put too much emphasis on Slytherins being cunninggtOr perhaps in Slytherin Youll make your real friends These cunning folks use any means To achieve their ends.gt And powerhungry SlytherinLoved those of great ambition.To me these seem like the way the Sorting Hat pitches the houses to not sound bigoted against muggleborns. As we eventually learn the Founders chose their students off of what they wanted in a student.Gryffindor specifically wanted brave students. To be sorted into Gryffindor you need to be brave.Ravenclaw specifically wanted intelligent students. To be sorted into Ravenclaw you need to be intelligent.Slytherin wanted students with cunning and ambition yes but those two traits also fall under Intelligence and Bravery respectively.  You need to be intelligent to have cunning you need to be BraveBold to have ambition. which actually is how I explain his friendship with Gryffindor and Ravenclaw they value similar traitsBut the Hat glosses over what Slytherin really valued. Blood Purity. To be sorted into Slytherin you should need to be pureblood because thats what Salazar Slytherin most cared about and the Hat should know that. Indeed eventually the Hat acknowledges that Slytherin had very specific ideas about what kind of students should be admittedgt Said Slytherin Well teach just those whose ancestrys purest.and my emphasisgt For instance Slytherin Took only pureblood wizards Of great cunning just like him.Hufflepuff specifically says that she will teach anyone. I know its a joke that everybody else can hang out in Hufflepuff but its true. She is the only Founder that gave everyone equal chance at developing their magical skill. In a way Hufflepuff is the best pedagogue of the four.Im surprised more muggleborns arent sorted into Hufflepuff they are probably terrified of this new world theyve been thrown into so they probably arent feeling exceptionally brave at the time of their sorting the great majority will have zero magical experience so to the Hat they may not demonstrate what a wizard would think of as intelligence and they certainly arent purebloods.To actually answer your question HermioneI get why Hermoine is in Gryffindor for plot reasons but to me she seems like a cardcarrying naturalborn Ravenclaw especially at the time of her sorting. She finds out she can perform magic and the First Thing she does is start reading anything she can get her hands on. To her this new world is just another topic of study. I also personally have a pettheory that she dives headlong into it as a coping mechanism she is so terrified of this huge change and sudden realization that she instinctively approaches it in the way that makes her feel most safe reading about it. Thats where all of her courage comes from her intelligence. If she knows about it shes less afraid of it. Even the social bravery of comfortable introducing herself to strangers on the train is an extension of her intelligence giving her courage. I dont have the book handy so I cant confirm it with a quote but IIRC we are introduced to her by two functions  she is helping another student attain information the whereabouts of his pet and  imparting information that she has onto other studentsBoth of these are things that she does to give herself confidence and validity because if she can know something more than a pureblood first year then she truly must deserve this world after all.All her bravery she learns from Harry and Ron and as a function of being a Gryffindor but Hermione is a quick learner.,harrypotter,d66r951,2,t5_2qiqi

8529791,0,t3_4wkc1k,Everything about this script has been picked apart ovee the last week so I wont discuss anything specific here but frankly nothing in CC actually breaks canon. There are lots of moments some people think are out of character but that others think are understandable given the amount of time passed. There are lots of moments that seem out of place and need some mental gymnastics to make fit in a logical way but that is not breaking canon thats just kind of poor storytelling which a lot of people think is at least partially die to format. At most there are parts that contradict what JK Rowling has stated in interviews which honestly isnt canon to me. Maybe you have a different opinion but until an author has published something theres nothing solid about it. The thing is canons a tricky beast because you can retcon anything with enough effort. If Hermiones dad shows up and hes a wizard and no explination is given thats breaking canon. If Hermiones dad shows up and hes actually a squib that was left to live as a muggle thats canon. Dumb but canon. TlDr Nothing in CC actually breaks canon.,harrypotter,d67sd8v,2,t5_2qiqi

Maybe most Christians of any all other denominations dont care whether people have toes. But a whooping  of Catholic Christians have some very strong feelings about it. Would that not be something that would be nice to detect statistically?You could offer as an option as many other denominations of a religion as you want for example add an option for Evangelicals etc and also add available subcategories for other religions too theres no reason why the Sunni case shouldnt be so if the author thinks there is something interesting there to detect.I hope that makes sense.,harrypotter,d6nhvzs,0,t5_2qiqi

8761138,0,t1_d70skim,Snape didnt go with the Order to the Ministry as he had to maintain his cover as a deep cover spyThat is true! Only the ootp he alerted went. My mistake! But still snape alerted them and he probably told them to get to the ministry. The Order also didnt know of the prophecy specifically I believeMaybe not the prophecy but they did know that theres a weapon remember when Sirius told Harry voldemort wants something he can only get by stealth..   Why would Sirius say this to Harry if the other order members did not know. The order had to have known of something in the department of mysteries voldemort wantedand it was only Snape and Dumbledore who had knowledge of Harrys nightmaresWhen Harry had the nightmare about the snake attacking many order members especially the ones who came to Harrys aid when he was at the ministry fighting and escaping deatheaters knew about it and were discussing it at the saint mongos hospital.So I think the ootp members who came to Harrys aid at the end way too late had a very shrewd idea of what was going on. Besides they are members of an anti voldemort movement theyd follow through to ensure harrys protection. So I dont think that Snape wouldve taken long to gather the ootp. So thats why Im confused because the ootp arrived way later especially considering that Harry and co. went by thestrals and ootp by apparating. If they didnt see Harry and co. yet they couldve kept a lookout just in case and send a few others to look for them in the department of mysteries. ,harrypotter,d70sxcl,8,t5_2qiqi
8762002,0,t3_503gkf,I agree with you. Personally I cant simply like or dislike Snape because hes such a complex character.I guess my biggest problem with him is that all he did he did only because of his love for Lily. Ok hear me out.Lily was in the Order and fought against Voldemort and his crew. She literally died defying Voldemort. Just by her being a member of the Order you can tell that she goes against what Voldy amp Crew stand up for. It wouldve been nice if Snape had realized and emulated Lilys values because of his love for her. It wouldve been nice if he turned his back on the Death Eaters not just because they killed the love of his life but also because they push for the things that Lily had fought against.I dont know. Maybe its because of the way I interpreted things but I never saw him totally rejecting Death Eater philosophy. It really wouldve been nice if his love for Lily was able to turn him away from all that. Instead it only went as far as him agreeing to be a spy for Dumbledore. Im not saying that this wasnt brave or worthwhile because it definitely was. It just wouldve been better if he did a complete . But maybe he did. Who knows. My interpretation could also be wrong.,harrypotter,d70wtno,2,t5_2qiqi

8802890,0,t1_d75yedo,gt This is also the reason why Harry is struggling as a parent. This is very true. Its strange how people expect Harry to be a perfect parent when the only positive parental figures in his life were Molly Arthur Hagrid Lupin and McGonagall. All his other parental figures the Dursleys Dumbledore and Sirius were either abusive purposefully keeping important things from him or were too reckless to be a responsible guardian. Cursed Child hammers home how much Harrys parenting skills have been impacted by Dumbledore and the Dursleys. Because he had no positive parental figures in his childhood he struggles raising Albus a child so similar to himself so like Dumbledore he decides to distance himself so to avoid getting hurt. Albus at first resents his father for this then comes to realise that its not his dads fault and theyre all victims of the past. People get too hung up on the time travel to realise its role thematically in the story to show that the past affects who we are as people in the present and future and that our personality and actions is sometimes not us as people but the result of the situations that led us to where we are now our pasts shape and define us as people and you cant change that. As we see with Ron and Hermione changing their past led them to unhappy lives showing that sometimes good things come from a specific set of circumstances and should be left to unfold not interfered with. Likewise Albus thinks changing just part of his Dads past will fix his dad in the present but comes to learn that his Dad is who he is because of things that happened long before Cedrics death things that Albus couldnt change showing that people cant be changed overnight and that their problems cant be traced back to one specific event.With Delphi we see that shes trapped because of the past. She spends the entire play trying to change her past to fix her problems. Harry then tells her she has to learn to deal with it subtly telling her that the past is set but she can learn from it to change her future.  Its a theme that would probably come across clearer in an actual novel than a script but I love what Rowling was trying to do with it. ,harrypotter,d75zkkm,1,t5_2qiqi

8895109,0,t1_d7h0sq2,I agree. I only gave the Dursleys the benefit of the doubt plus I really cant imagine that they can be as horrible to toddler Harry as they were to  year old Harry.My guess is that when Harry asked about his parents they lied and immediately dismissed the subject. Regarding their treatment of him they probably werent as cruel or abusive when Harry was younger but they ignored him a lot and clearly showed that they favored Dudley far more than Harry. They probably only took notice of Harry during meals or when he needed things for school etc. Relatively important stuff like that.This makes me really wonder why Harry wasnt all fucked up when he grew up. I mean the Dursleys must have had an effect on him. If the only adults he interacted with were the Dursleys and occasionally Aunt Marge and Mrs. Figg where did Harry find role models? How did he not end up like Dudley? Did he have teachers in Muggle school who knew how he was treated at home and made it a point to take extra care of him? Did Harry in turn emulate said teachers? Its not impossible since its implied that Harry and Dudley went to the same school. Im not sure how schools in the UK work but its possible theyre in the same class and that the teachers knew how terrible the Dursleys are from parentteacher meetings and other events like that. Well it can be explained away if you believe in nature instead of nurture Harrys parents were kind people and must have left their kindness in Harry.,harrypotter,d7h2crf,6,t5_2qiqi

9011361,0,t3_53kpmc,I am not sure that they ever did. While Godricks Sword had magical properties it never had magical powers. We dont know what the source are of the cup or of the locket. Just that they were owned by the founders of Hogwarts. So really unless they were also Goblin made they could not have. The cup and the locket were probably just prized family heirlooms. On par with the silver goblets that Kreacher stole from Serius Black to keep them from falling into the wrong hands. Fancy items owned by Witches and Wizards do not necessarily have to have magical capabilities.    That said if I had to pick. For me the locket would allow someone that could not speak parseltongue to understand when it was being spoken. Or at least understand it on a basic level. I dont think it would have given true parseltongue speaking capabilities but that would have been pretty rad.    When it comes to Helgas cup if it had any properties I bet it would be something along the lines of enhancing the flavor of whatever drink was poured into it. That sounds like a Huffelpuff thing to me. ,harrypotter,d7v0wy3,1,t5_2qiqi

Theres no altenate timelines or any of that rubbish. Further Time Turners do not move you forwards in time after a certain interval. It is a one way trip.

The fifth question is toughest to pass there are five different questions and each answer only turns up once or twice in the answers. If you wait too long i.e. not answering three questions you have to start again at question . However after question  it gets easier again as there are less questions and you can get a given patronus through multiple questions.In other words the questions that you get already determine to a great extent what your eventual result will be.

I think with his fathers help he could have a company up and running without too much effort to him. He took his spoils and broke them putting them in the spare bedroom which becomes Harrys. I think after he grows up he is less spoiled valuing his friends and his health physical activity. Especially when he learns some of what Harry did after he left the house.

Somehow that ended up in the wrong part of my reply.  I looked for the quote but couldnt find it.gtHarry and Ron notice repeatedly that shes taking more than one class at once and the fact that she just brushes them off without an explanation contributed to their anger to her.I still think the meta explanation works here.  If Harry and Ron had confronted her earlier then that would have fouled up Rowlings need to keep Lupins disease a secret.gtthe fact that she does so and the way that she does so negatively impacts her friendshipsIm not so sure about Harry.  Throughout the series he demonstrates an exceptional capacity for forgiving Ron his petty jealousies and securities coming out at the most inappropriate times.  If Harry can forgive Ron for choosing better food and beds over destroying a magical megalomaniac than I think he could forgive Hermione for keeping her Time Turner secret or for owning a cat that wants to eat rats.From The Patronus of PoAgtCant you give her a break? Harry asked Ron quietly.gtNo said Ron flatly. If she just acted like she was sorry  but shell never admit shes wrong Hermione...Youre probably right about Ron as he is not a forgiving person.gtI also think that if Harry or Ron at this point had been given something as important as a Time Turner they would have told the other twoThis is an interesting point that I hadnt considered.  I tend to view Ron as Harrys window into the magical world.  Ron foreshadows Quidditch Harrys Invisibility Cloak and a hundred other minute details of Rowlings worldbuilding.  That doesnt leave many opportunities for him to have any secrets.  There isnt really a point to having him keep a bit of knowledge back for himself.  The only thing I can think of is the conversation in PoA about Squibs where Ron confesses that it would be a bit embarrassing to have one in the family.  Thats probably easily explainable by the fact that Rowling didnt think of Squibs until then though.,harrypotter,d8c7nia,2,t5_2qiqi

9154069,0,t3_55nfd8,Diana Whynne Jones. She is a contemporary British fantasy writer and all her stories appear to be in the same universe but dont really overlap and when they do its very slight nods. She deals with magic in a sort of alternate universe but not like super high fantasy like LOTR or something of that nature. Her novels are magical easy reads suitable for most audiences with relatable characters.Id start with a shorter novel of hers first and then if enjoyed she has some nice thick books to delve into.

So when they stop being antagonistic and instead become happy and together you lost most of that.yeah i considered that. but it also comes from the fact that Harry naturally has quite an explosive personality which he completely lost in this fic tbh and Draco is selfish and very competitive. i think that maybe even if they had no reason anymore to lash out at each other for shits and giggles theyd still retain those fundamental traits and it would impact the way they interact with each other. in this fic the writer really tamed both of them.and besides the Hat implied that some of Harrys worse qualities such as the desire to prove himself and thirst for glory would really come out if he were sorted to Slytherin. i havent really seen this road explored in this fic or maybe i stopped reading too early?. to sum up Harry turned out a bit underdeveloped imo.gtI guess the question then becomes do you want to continue to focus on the romance or just have a happy couple as their usual notsoexciting dynamic while the story focuses on other stuff.youre completely right here im guilty of this. however i think that in a good fic all plots should be interesting and captivating including the romance. whats the point of making them a couple if youre not going to explore their dynamic?,harrypotter,d8dbrg4,2,t5_2qiqi

The greatest challenge however is the vanishment of a kitten which Hermione Granger managed to do by midyear.Minerva McGonagall stated in May of  that Vanished objects go into nonbeing which is to say everything.Harry made an iguana go away and it was actually far beyond what others his age could normally do.

Besides a werewolf hes an accomplished wizard able to take care of himself as we saw. Theres another reason I think he appointed him Snape.

9185708,0,t3_564d9x,One of my favourite moments in the books is the battle of hogwarts. We get Harrys account on the battle but sadly he spends most of the time looking for the horcrux and we lose most of it. Sometime I would like to have at least a narration in what was happening on the rest of the castle. Or how the forces moved and where. Its a major moment we know beside the named characters at least other  died on the hogwarts side those are bodies retrieved maybe many more just where lost in the fire eaten by acromantulas or transfigured we dont have even a rough account on how many on the deatheater side. My favourite part is Not the battle itself but the moments before. During the preparations of the battle decisions are taken that likely decided the first half of the battle.For example to make all younglings abandon the castle. On one hand its a good choice. As there would be people more worried on defending them than battling. It also encourages students with at least some fighting capabilities to abandon the fight for example students in fifth and sixth years. all of slytherin left some ravenclaw stayed hufflepuff some more and then gryffindors didnt want to leave Also  is it possible to evacuate the whole castle in so short time? Also what happened to the small children that wanted to stay in the castle as their bigger brothers and sisters where fighting? I like the idea of many students taking shelter in the dungeons in the slytherin common room to be precise. Where some of them would stand guard unable to know what exactly is happening outside. Also in the crucial point of battle when centaurs and house elves join the battle Slughorn reinforcement charge is one of my favourite moments. Its highly unlikely that no slytherin students also came back to fight. Just that harry didnt see them. given that hes an unreliable narratorDo you have some extra theories or contents on the battle?,harrypotter,d8gct6m,5,t5_2qiqi
9187304,0,t3_5657v8,gtJo would later say that the elder wand has a Thestral hair for a core. I wonder why no one else seems to use Thestral hair.  Not everyone can see thestrals so itd be kind of hard to gather a hair from one if you cant see it.  Also theres the whole thing about thestrals being considered unlucky.  If Ollivander or some other wandmaker tried to sell someone a wand with a thestralhair core I think most wizards or their parents would be quite apprehensive about buying one.gtwhat did Luna tell her father about Hermione? Xeno calls Hermione limited narrow and close minded. Do you think Hermione is limited narrow or close minded? Im more inclined to call her a skeptic.  In the eyes of conspiracy theorists being a skeptic is the same thing as being closeminded and narrow.  This is how they justify believing in the crazy things they do by convincing themselves that anyone who refutes them is just being stubborn or closeminded.gtdo you think Xeno was more rational before his wife died? Was his wife zanier than he was?I have a headcannon about this that I think really fleshes out Xenos character. When Luna was a little girl her mother use to tell her fantastical stories  like that Nargles live in mistletoe or that whenever a person seems confused or dazed its because a wrackspurt floated into their head. Ever since Lunas mother died a griefstricken Xeno has been playing up these fantastical stories as a way of helping his daughter cope with the loss of her mother and to help preserve his wifes memory.,harrypotter,d8gk3bg,5,t5_2qiqi

9270298,0,t1_d8qv1px,Sorry to be super pedantic but you got the timing on Lord of the Rings wrong. Going by the book chronology which the movies admittedly dont always follow the main quest with the four hobbits going from Hobbiton to Mount Doom takes six months with the Battle of Helms Deep at the end of the second movie and the battle of the Morannon at the end of the third movie only being  weeks apart. It takes them seven months to get back then Frodo leaves for the Grey Havens about   years later. Also Bilbos birthday party canonically takes place  years before Frodo leaves the Shire though the movie heavily implies that it only takes a few weeks. Of course since your point was that the very long movies took a very short amount of inuniverse time shortening it from  years to mostly  months only makes your point stronger.

When we arrived I ran straight for hogsmeade we went to the one in Hollywood so unfortunately no Hogwarts express ride for me   and once I got into hogsmeade my brain wanted to explode. I literally could not process that everything I had ever fantasized and dreamed about was right here before my eyes. The first thing I did was get butterbeer and then while I was waiting in line at ollivanders for the wand choosing I felt really really sick. I guess a combination of the heat and dairy Im lactose intolerant and over excitement didnt do me any favors. A wee bit later I ended up getting sick all over myself in one if the shops and felt so so so so bad. I apologized to the staff over and over again but they assured me that it happens all the time and its nothing to be embarrassed about need to apologize for. After we cleaned up my boyfriend went to exchange our day tickets for season passes so I could have a redo and hopefully I wont overexert myself next time.Even though I got sick all over myself I still had an absolutely magical time and the staff there was so nice and added to the magic of the park.

We know at that point he had made three more Horcruxes from the objects he took from Smith and the Diadem.While in his spirit form he had Quirrel drink unicorn blood which would have cursed him and he used an elixir with Naginis venom as well which could contribute further to the snake like appearance.TLDR bad guys does bad things and looks bad,harrypotter,d98vbm1,4,t5_2qiqi

What if any life event lead to the boggart taking this form?I know that when I was young I had a series of nightmares where the moon was a prominent feature.

Trump is many things but he is certainly more populist than any politician Ive ever known he has never ignored the small folks.

Im wondering whether young Dumbledore will turn out to be the Pretty Boy taken in by someone darker more charismatic more worldly. In the books it struck me that Dumbledore was seduced by Grindelwalds ideas more than anything else. I can see Dumbledores later tendencies towards manipulation and control being born out of that relationship or at least cemented by it.

9689377,0,t1_da7erz2,Yeah it could fit with Slytherin.  As the element of earth is associated with prosperity wealth strength and death...all things I would associate with Slytherin too but there are definitely Gryffindor traits in there. I suppose thats why theres no direct correlation. It would appear that she mixed elements of the Hogwarts houses in order to make the Ilvermorny ones. Also there tends to be overlap between Gryffindor and Slytherin traits in the books anyway. Dumbledore said Harry had traits that Slytherin liked to see in his students. Dumbledore also implies that Snapes fierce loyalty to Lily and bravery for spying on Voldemort suggest he might have belonged in Gryffindor. Its hard to say without knowing more about Wampus. Also I would wager all the Hogwarts founders were adventurous and traveled the world in order to learn more about magic. Newt is in Hufflepuff yet travels and deals with Beasts which could be seen as brave and adventurous. None of it is really an exact science. ,harrypotter,da7f5va,1,t5_2qiqi

9711828,0,t1_daa4gtm,gt He didnt have that much screen time in Order of the PhoenixUnsurprisingly the books go into a lot more depth. If you recall in the OotP film Dumbledore talks to Harry about the prophecy saying that either Harry or Voldemort has to kill the other. Its a very short scene but its there.In the books Dumbledore doesnt just tell Harry what the prophecy means he tells Harry why he didnt tell him as soon as Harry entered the wizarding world didnt want to burden a child with such horrible information and eventually that he began to love Harry so that even when it was obvious Harry could handle the information even at a young age Dumbledore still chose not to tell him because he foolishly thought he could protect Harry from the implications of the prophecy. Basically he became the overprotective parents who coddles his kid instead of preparing him for the real world. Dumbledore acknowledges this mistake and apologizes to Harry.Without going into detail Grindelwald is important to the story because it shows us how Dumbledore handles personal and emotional problems  i.e. horribly. So when Dumbledore begins to care about Harry a boy whose death he will probably have to plan that falls pretty nicely into the personal and emotional problems box and he unsurisingly doesnt handle it well.So all that was cut from the film.,harrypotter,daa6xbh,6,t5_2qiqi

9713853,0,t3_5e20aa,Terrible adaptation of the book. Mind you my copy is a bit adulterated. Written in a ton by the last owner a Mr. Harry Potter.The book is a bit short at about  pages so a  hour film adaptation surprised me. Thats roughly  minutes per page of content. Even so they managed to miss so much from the book and added in many things not in the book. Sure much of the book is just an index of beasts and while not exhaustive one would assume that an adaptation of this book would show all of them. Of the  beasts in the book only  of them show up in the film. Obviously working with some these creatures would be far too dangerous to do for a film yet they had some things that were just as dangerous such as a Thunderbird and a Nundu and that Obscurus thing. That Obscurus thing seemed very similar to a Lethifold honestly but whatever. Thankfully they did not have any Quintapeds or Acromantulas as those are far too dangerous to work with but the point remains that they had dangerous beasts in the film and neglected to showcase of the safer varieties of beast like Flobberworms or Kneazles..

9736315,0,t1_dad7eac,Ive thought a lot about this since it seems to be something that shouldve been mentioned previously. I dont think Grindelwald was a seer because as weve seen from the other prophecies they are usually in verse form and not something the seer remembers after they come out of their trance. So I think GrindelGraves used his position at MACUSA to find out about the mysterious incidents around the city and put two and two together. The fact that he didnt foresee that Credence was the Obscurial points to the fact that he isnt a seer. He only mentions that the child is no older than . This is something thats just general knowledge about Obscurials because as Newt says theres never been one that lived past the age of . So I think that he was just using his knowledge to impress Credence who would have no way of knowing or challenging his assertions.spoiler,harrypotter,dad7ouz,6,t5_2qiqi

Before Harrys fifth year he really only supported death eaters by taking their gold. As for the Barty Crouch Jr thing I dont think he was trying to silence the man but rather brought the dementor with him as selfpreservation. That is essentially Fudges motto. He appealed to the rich and influential people of the wizarding world to keep his money and title. His reluctance to accept Voldemorts return wasnt born of a plan to divide society but rather an aversion to change. Especially since this change would affect the peace hes worked for ten plus years to build. He wasnt a deliberately evil person just a selfcentered corrupt politician.,harrypotter,dajizbc,2,t5_2qiqi

Then you had the Dementors who sided with him because he could offer them a full feast instead of the MoM who could only give them a snack. The Giants were apt to join voldy because he could offer them refuge rather than them having to run away from the wizarding community in fear that they would be hunted to extinction. ,harrypotter,db510y8,2,t5_2qiqi

10028559,0,t3_5j6yn6,God dangit. Im sorry but I wish she would stop revealing things. Just let the series be canon or write more books. I hate the culture of whatever an author says is true. If she approached it in a way where she herself was guessing and creating fan theories that would be cool. But I dont like that shes adding more afterthefact as truth. I believe authors should and do know as much as their readers.edit  Im going to get downvoted but I dont really care because I would rather have a discussion about this. I think its really upsetting that something thats so important to me can be changed and altered and put more in a box with a simple tweet. Its so much more fun to not know to analyze to comb through a book and look for evidence to support your theory. Speculating and building your own world and opinions and theories is half the fun of reading about a new world like Rowlings. Like the quote in the tweet she responded to what an awesome quote to find! It could inspire a whole paper! I would much rather try to prove either or neither or both by rereading and putting together an analytical case. But instead she takes away a readers freedom to do so by explicitly stating Yes he is a Seer. It takes away the thrill of a new idea.Whenever she announces something new theres just this deflating feeling of Oh okay. Nevermind then.  NOT KNOWING IS MORE FUN. How fun was it to speculate about everything when OOTP came out? And then how fun was it to find out if you were right after a new book was published? Imagine if you had just found out about horcruxes via a tweet? I would much rather hear all of this extra amazing stuff of hers in a new book than via Twitter or Pottermore.I dont like that an author has more authority over the texts than her readers I know author is in the word authority but after authorization I think the author has the same text to go on as us just a slight advantage when analyzing and predicting.Even if you dont agree with me I hope you can see my side of it. I dont cling to the idea of canon just because its traditional or antiquated. It really spoils something I feel dearly about. Im a young English teacher. I hate to see my students lose motivation to explore a text because an author has already explained it or answered the question. end rant,harrypotter,dbeqz0h,17,t5_2qiqi

Grindy wants wizards to come out of hiding and rule over muggles but as far as I know hes not a pureblood supremacist.

Not book smart like Hermione but cunning. He can figure people out and their intentions pretty quick. Look how fast he read Malfoy. Sometimes hes wrong but usually he is right. His nighttime wandering a werent so much about courage or bravery but hubris. Snape was kind of right about Harry breaking rules all the time. I dont think Harry was ever malicious in his rule breaking but he did kind of think they were below him. It was always framed in a we had to kind of way but they didnt really have to. But thats just me. As I was rereading this I could make arguments for Harry to be in Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. But in the end I think Harry belonged in Gryffindor. He could have been any house but thats different than belonging to a house. ,harrypotter,dbxg6nc,14,t5_2qiqi
10177648,0,t1_dbvz16q,Professor Audrey Araminta came to Hogwarts for the  school year in order to teach Defense Agaisnt the Dark Arts having graduated roughly  years ago. Not much is known about exactly what she did after graduation except that she had traveled the world in search of herself. Audrey was a fiery young witch who charmed her students with her infectiously positive attitude. Her room and desk seemed much like her mind full on interesting trinkets from her travels with her important things all over the place. Audrey thought fast and talked faster and expected her student to think on their feet in order to properly protect themselves. She had oodles of rich brown curls that tapered to a rich dark emerald green that could be seen from a far when she piled it in top of her head which she tended to do a lot when she was deep in thought or getting ready to work a difficult spell. She also wore large round gold rimmed spectacles that she didnt need. She just liked the way they looked. Professor Araminta had what seemed to be a natural affinity for dark magic. She taught her students counterjinxes and defensive spells but also wanted to educate that dark magic was not necessarily evil magic with her theoretical homework. She loved to encourage her students to think outside the box. Most students didnt know what to think of their frizzy haired professor with a boisterous voice and an attitude that seemed to fill the room. They rather enjoyed the class but did notice she seemed lost in deep thought sometimes not quite aware of whats going on.  They did quite like how fearless yet practical she seemed about the dark arts as she was always readily available to answer their inquisitive thoughts with open dialogue.Towards the end of the year most of her students noticed that she got lost in thought much more as the year came to a close. The once boisterous teacher became quiet and moody. Professor Aramintas mood seemed to darken until the children seemed quite terrified of her. Finally one dark night an unearthly howl was heard coming from Prfessor Aramintas room. All that was found was broken glass from her window. She was never seen again. ,harrypotter,dbxoxym,2,t5_2qiqi
10179992,0,t1_dbxxp1m,I disagree. To me it was not flawless. In the books Sirius was a lot more immature and Snape was pettier than their movie counterparts. Also imho part of what made the MPPW era kids so tragic is how the war robbed them of their youth and how they were coping  years later and with people pushing  or  in it makes it harder for me to buy into the character. Not the case with others like the Weasleys or McG because in those cases age was not an important element for their stories.Ps Im on a phone with spanish autocorrect pelase forgive any mistakes.,harrypotter,dbxyi8n,4,t5_2qiqi

And if you include everything in it alienates the people who havent read the books. The HP movies are outrageously popular in their own right and I would argue the fanfare of the movies drove the books to popularities that they hadnt reached before. That would not have happened if they catered so heavily to the readers. You complained back at the beginning about the  minute Knight Bus scene. That is a fantastic part of that movie. The dashing through London the shrunken head the squeezing between buses the quirky music score etc. What so many Potter fans love about the books is the detail put into the charm and idiosyncrasies of the world that Rowling created and scenes like that are what give moviegoers that havent read the books those same feelings of wonder.,harrypotter,dc1int7,6,t5_2qiqi

10281121,0,t1_dc9dwrc,Yeah theres something of a rip in the spacetime continuum there read plothole. But the problem is that Hagrid literally pulled Harry out of the ruins implying that he was one of the first people on the scene. Sirius who showed up a few moments after Hagrid mentions that Lily and James bodies were still there. Hagrid tells Sirius that Dumbledore wants Harry taken to the Dursleys and borrows Siriuss motorbike to make the journey.The problem is that theres a full day in which McGonagall shows up at the Dursleys Vernon sees strange people on the street owls are sighted across the country Vernon returns home and goes to bed. And its only after Vernon goes to bed that Dumbledore speaks to McGonagall and Hagrid arrives.So to make the timeline fit you either have to a ignore the first half of the chapter in which Vernon goes about his day or b ignore HagridSiriuss testimony that they were the first on the scene.In some ways its easier to assume a day had passed before Harry was brought to Number Four since it seems insane that Dumbledore would just send Hagrid to pick Harry up without even seeing him or seeing the house first.,harrypotter,dc9f6gb,2,t5_2qiqi

If she chose Harry she might lose Ron even as a friend. But if she chose Ron Harry could still have Ginny and they would all be in the same happy family. It certainly helped that Harry was not interested in her but in Ginny. As a result she shipped these two hard in HBP leaking all kinds of inside dopes between Dean and Ginny to Harry. When these two finally kissed she was BEAMING.Furthermore everyone has been saying how jealous Ron was. But Hermione was truly scary when she became jealous.

10322930,0,t1_dce1mhs,I myself came by way of the books. I think I may have seen the first movie possibly. I didnt really have any particular opinion on the film I thought it was cute but I didnt turn into a fan through the films. I decided to read the series and it was after Order of the Phoenix that I actually started reading the books. So I read all the way up to OOTP.At that point I started going online after Id caught up with the series to discuss the series. It was actually the people who hated Snape that sort of pushed me into the Snape camp. I remember trying to discuss characters back then when I first started going on message boards and just trying to have a rational conversation generally ended up having other fans flip out on you if you also didnt hate Snape as much as they did...and this was even before he killed Dumbledore HBP wasnt out yet at that time.gtDumbledore was really harsh on Snape when he begged for help to protect Lilly and even outright stated that Snape was a cowardNot only that moment when Snape is begging for Lilys life. I find it interesting that back when Snape was a childstudent under the care of Headmaster Dumbledore...the kid is almost killed by werewolf Lupin but Dumbledore insists that young teen Snape keep a promise not to reveal the headmaster is allowing a student in Hogwarts who can potentially kill other students. While we really dont have ever detail of that story I really do wish Rowling would write out the MaraudersLilySnape years at some point. But the timeline seems to show that the JamesSirius worst memory scene attach on Snape happens after Snape has promise to keep Lupins secret  like on some level James and Sirius look even more shabby to me given those details in the Princes tale.But really what if Dumbledore was asking any other student to promise not to tell anyone or even their parents they were almost killed at the school? How exactly would that go over?Sure young Snape wasnt supposed to be there but neither was Lupin...and yes I can have sympathy for Lupin being a werewolf but IF that had gotten out back then. If young Snape had told someone or young Severus had been seriously hurt or killed...Dumbledore would have potentially been fired back then.And its interesting that all those years even while Severus was a death eater he kept Lupins secret...up until Lupin forgets to take his werewolf potion and endangers friendsstudentsetc. Its only after Lupin has worked at Hogwarts are people informed he is a werewolf  apparently all those years Snape kept it a secret  even when he was working for Voldemort. Unless people dont think someone like Lucius would have protested knowing a werewolf was at Hogwarts. Clearly Snape told nobody about what happened to him at .Im not trying to throw Lupin under the bus but from Snapes perspective he seems to be loyal to Dumbledore a lot longer than people remember. He kept that promise as a child and nobody seems to bring that up or people dont think its important to his character that he does seem to keep his promises.Compared to that we shouldnt really forget the whole Dumbledore promised to keep Lily save for Severus and he would doing anything. Dumbledore technically did not keep his promise. Lily died.Dumbledore requested Severus service on conditions and seemingly again nobody gives Severus Snape credit for still remaining loyal to Dumbledore at that point.There are a lot of things that people either forget or let slide because they feel the need to dislike a character.I agree that Snape is fairly a grey character and even the author states now that is what he was meant to be readviewed.And sorry if I ramble and am all over the place your post just got me thinking about some points about Snape I hadnt really touched on in a while.,harrypotter,dce5sz8,3,t5_2qiqi

10404107,0,t1_dcnbx7y,I love the scene between Harry and Luna at the end of OotP  one of my favourite scenes in the whole series actually. Luna is probably my absolute favourite character out of the all the younguns and that scene is part of the reason why. I just think that scene shows a connection that those two have as friends I didnt feel anything more there. I dont think Harry would stomach that level of zaniness! I never really knew that it existed as a shipping on a similar scale to HarryHermione!I agree Ginny couldve done with a few more scenes but at the same time I think her development was visible each time we saw her as she became more and more confident. A large part of her journey might have taken place off camera so to speak but I thought that was the point. She was intentionally backing away from Harry until she was ready to deal with him. Or something like that!And of course people are free to ship whoever they like. I have no fundamental issue with those who ship HarryHermione or HarryLuna as much as I have no issue with those who ship NevillePadma and you can bet your bottom dollar someone does!. But the militancy of some people does indeed tire me especially when theyre going to try and tell me that Im wrong and the canons wrong. Leave the canon alone for Gods sake! In your head the canon doesnt matter and I wholeheartedly encourage people to reimagine the series but with the shippings that they would like to happen! But its not canon!As for the Cursed Child bit I honestly dont remember how they developed Ginny in that. Will have to do a reread. I cant pretend to have loved Cursed Child but will be interested in being reminded in what it does for Ginny!,harrypotter,dcndfb8,2,t5_2qiqi

Theyre not even mutually exclusive. Dumbledores plan was to have Harry sacrifice himself to end Voldemorts tie to the earth and let someone more skilled take over and beat Voldemort. Even by his plan that would obviously require a DADA position. I am pretty sure youre misreading Dumbledore badly. Youre also prejudiced against some good teachers. You dont know how good Quirrel was at his subject. Just because he taught Muggle Studies doesnt mean he has no experience. Maybe he was seriously a good teacher. Heck even Harry noted in Book  that Quirrel was a good teacher with one drawback. Lockhart was incompetent we agree. Lupin was good. You cant argue against that. Dumbledore hired Lupin on purpose and he was good. Moody was his friend and the dustbin incident actually turned out to be legit. He was STILL a good teacher. Snape... was a good teacher just not for Harry which actually proves my point that Dumbledore protects Harry but education wise puts the rest of the school first.

We have nothing either foragainst this in HP but my gut feeling is that it conforms to this trope more often than not. At any rate we have nothing to suggest Dumbledore was at his prime vs Grindelwald and certainly nothing to say that he was rusty old against voldie.vs voldemort Dumbledore had the Elder Wand and he failed to win. Neither was capable of truly harming the other. The closest Dumbledore got was imprisoning Voldemort in the crystallised water but that couldnt hold him. I think Dumbledore knew this as well but he would ultimately win that fight because his reinforcements aurors would eventually arrive whereas voldemorts allies had already been rounded up.vs grindelwald grindelwald had the elder wand and he was beaten and imprisoned in his own fortressprison.the only stuff weve seen of grindelwald so far hasnt been particularly promising. He takes on and looks like hes winning vs a small crowd of macusa wizards before being caught by newts creatures. hes capable of fairly strong wandless wordless telekinesis as well.voldemort on the other hand instituted massive spells like the Taboo were yet to see grindelwald do anything nefarious like that maintained a small army of inferi regularly tortured people into insanity via legilimens alone every other mention of torturing someone into insanity weve seen has been via crucio. If were going by moviefeats we kinda have to if you want to use the moviefeats for grindelwald above then compositevoldemort was capable of destroying the massive Hogwartsshield in one spell whereas his entire army had been barraging it for minutes before with no visible effects. he had enough of Salazar Slytherins influence to be able to control the basilisk hell his first horcruxmurder was moaning myrtle.

10710823,0,t3_5t6wr6,I think the biggest bummer for me is definitely CC so Id change that. The first Harry Potter book in nearly a decade approved by JK Rowling and its this poorly written thing? No thanks.The potential is there for a great story follow Albus and Scorpius adventures at Hogwarts. Show how Albus is different from his dad and maybe even resents him eventually. Yet Harry still tries to help him out and is a good understanding father unlike the asshat we got seriously what kind of parent ever tells their child they sometimes wish they didnt exist? A terrible one thats what kind. You could even keep parts taking place from Harrys point of view as he tries to solve whatever mystery is going on. Yet perhaps ultimately Albus still has to save the day and on the way he learns just how hard Harrys time growing up was. They reconcile and instead of watching Harrys parents die like masochists they play a family game of Quidditch or something.Basically take what we got and remove all the time travel all the alternaterealities all the bad parenting and all the deusexmachinas like Dracos OP time turner and Delphi being Voldys son somehow.

As for Umbridge and the centaurs its a known fact that centaurs in Greek mythology are rapists because they have the perversions of man and the lack of control of animals.  The next time we saw Umbridge she showed no physical injury but what they did to her was so traumatizing she blocked it from her memory and would go into a PTSD panic when students made clopping sounds to mock her.  Thats one hell of an unfortunate coincidence.I dont see how pointing out a character acting like a blatant sociopath makes me bitter.

10997845,0,t1_dee3qdp,Ill agree that there was definitely laziness from the screenwriters and directors in treating Ron like a comic relief sidekick.  Chris Columbus started that especially with the stupid faces in CoS and it kind of stuck.  Things like agreeing with Snape calling Hermione a knowitall were cheap ways to get laughs at the expense of characterization and since Ron had served as comic relief in the past he was the obvious choice.  Theres a phenomenon I notice in TV and movie series where characters in later episodes become exaggerated versions of what they were in earlier ones which definitely affected this series.I think Fred and George Neville Ginny Draco and possibly others suffered from this sort of lazy writing and directing.  Neville especially was played as a bumbling dork through HBP though he had begun to show his talents in the fifth and sixth books.  Then in DH suddenly Neville had become a badass and it made no sense.  Draco was also played as comic relief for several movies.  It wasnt unique to Ron.I actually think Ron had good characterization in the first film.

Hello Dumbledore? He was once your hardcore follower why did he suddenly turn? Even understanding that question might save you from future similar tragedies. As for you Ministry Black would be a goldmine for intelligence but you just locked him in a prison and forgot about him. How incompetent could you possibly get?Ministry also got several other hardcore Voldemort followers such as the Lestranges and Dolohov. It seemed they were just locked away in Azkaban to rot no detailed investigations no questions about inner working of the Death Eaters no full exposures of their other crimes.This level of incompetence was beyond appalling.

Oh and Hermione returned to Hogwarts after the battle to complete her th year so you can maybe have her make appearancesget involved. Ginny and Luna would also be in their th years at Hogwarts. As far as events go Harry Ron Neville and others went around with Aurors to capture and try the remaining death eaters who fled. Kingsley Shacklebolt became Minister for Magic. Umbridge was sent to Azkaban for her crimes. The dementors were banished from Azkaban. Ill try looking up some stuff to see if we know anything else.

Chances are the magic community would have come out to nomaj more sooner that England. The US was founded with the idea that one could escape traditional norms. I dont see why the magic community would handle the states any different. Sorry went off there a bitMy fear is that it would be just a Hogwarts knock off and not really stand out on its own.

That said he never shows much interest in anything Id be interested in if I were him  Id have been asking all the adults I met about my parents for example from the moment I arrived at Hogwarts.

Aside from being able to turn into a dog he probably spent all of his time thinking about all of the memories he had with his best friends at school and what little time he had as a godfather. He was probably unable to really cope with and accept the murders of his best friends the uncertainty of where Harry ended up and the anger of how this all transpired. One morning hes just his normal self and the next his best friends are dead and hes being framed for their murders and sentenced to life in Azkaban. Its so tragic. I think all of this contributes to how he sees Harry as a surrogate for James and calls him James during the battle.

Its also odd because if the epilogue was one of the first things she had set in stone youd think shed incorporate Ginny more into the actual plot instead of relegating her to a side character.I dont know.  I just thing that the thing that really made Harry Potter work was the characters.  I think she made us really care about them as though they were real people and were actually our friends.
