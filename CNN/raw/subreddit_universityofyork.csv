10634195,0,t3_5rguvr,Current MEng in Computer Science With Embedded Systems Engineering with a Year In Industry student here who is in their placement year!I came to York knowing how to program but badly. I did a GCSE in Computing in which I copied and pasted Visual Basic code without understanding it taught myself only a small amount of Python and had written some BASIC for my AS in Systems amp Control.I found the first term of first year very poor modules were either ridiculously easy of ridiculously hard but I guess this is the phase where they are trying to bring everyone up to the same level. This picked up in the next two terms as we finished two horrendously boring modules one about how to be a good student and how to study etc. and the other about good UI design and started doing the Electronics modules. Overall I found the teaching in first year to be pretty good. My only real criticism is all the maths you do in your first term in discrete and then in second term you begin a continuous maths module. The large gap between the end of A levels and the start of second term means that everyones maths is super rusty and everyone finds the module challenging. For the record I did Maths amp Further Maths at A level and considered myself to be very strong in Maths but only managed  in the module.Second year was really enjoyable. The quality of teaching drops and the lecturers in the AI and Computer Graphics modules are... pretty bad but the content keeps it interesting and all the other modules were good fun. A large chunk of the year is a group project of either building a game in Java or a hardware project on an ARM mbed in C. I chose the hardware project which for my year was building a distance sensing robot. You get to use a variety of languages in second year including C Haskell Scheme Ada Java and MATLAB. One of the strong points of the York course is that in your first year they dont teach you necessarily how to program in any one language but instead focus on the core principles of programming so that you learn how to pick up new languages quickly. I was never explicitly taught any of the languages above but was able to learn my way round them quickly and this skill has become vital while on my industrial placement in which Ive had to use C and Scala which are never used on the course.The course itself is very Electronics heavy for a CS course but after first year you can never do Electronics again if thats not your thing. I think it balances theory amp practice very well about half the modules in the first two years are theory and the other half are practical. Although these two years are more exam based than coursework based you get a lot of flexibility on how to learn the lab work for most modules is non compulsory so if youre a practical learner you can simply get stuck into the labs. Likewise if youre more of a theoretical learner you can bonk off the labs and go and do some reading. If youd still like some practical experience York has some of the best student media in the country. Joining the techcomputing teams at either URY or YSTV which I recommend as its good fun gives you a great opportunity to make things that actually do cool stuff rather than just get a mark on a module.As for placements I found the department does a very good job. They have strong industry links and they bring a bunch of companies onto campus to do onsite interviews which makes the application process a lot less stressful.Overall Ive loved my two years at York so far and cant wait to come back! Enjoy my course really like the student life here and the city is excellent. Feel free to ask me any other questions you might have and good luck with your applicationsexams  ,universityofyork,ddcu451,3,t5_2ss68
