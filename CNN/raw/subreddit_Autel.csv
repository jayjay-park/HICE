10774026,0,t3_5tps62,DJi Mavic   no brainer if the portability is important to you but not a good idea if you want to be launching it from a boat where landing will be hard. Its not the easiest to catch.   Very nice remote.DJi Phantom  Pro  Better camera than XStar premium worse controller IMO.   The pro is has a much better camera.DJi Phantom  StandardDirt cheap. Like  with two batteries.   More signal interference issues than any other Im mentioning.   DJi Phantom  Advanced  Resolves signal issues from the standard but is disproportionately more expensive.  DJi Phantom  Pro  Comparable to the XStar Premium but not really worth the price IMO. X Star Premium  Harder to control than any of the DJi drones and significantly easier to crash than the Phantom   Mavic.  Better camera than all of the DJi drones that are cheaper than it slightly worse camera than all the DJi drones more expensive than it. Better controller than any of the Phantom drones but the range is smaller than the Phantom line by about . All of the above drones have an effective battery life of  minutes anything over than basically needs to be used for landing etc.IMO the only real options are  P Standard  XSP  Mavic  Phantom  Pro  Inspire or other  drone.,Autel,ddr9gys,3,t5_3hqz0
