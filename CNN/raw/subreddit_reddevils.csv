4108,0,t1_ceewc1o,Youre spot on. Those decisions were horrendous. The only one thats debatable is the Young decision. When youre as light footed and quick as Welbeck and Januzaj you go down easily. Any contact is enough contact to be considered a foul. The linesmen were generous towards Spurs as well a few more throw ins should have gone our way. Webb has been against us in all the matches hes officiated this season.That being said we played shit today from the th minute onwards. Why did we only try to attack from the wings when theyre weaker through the middle playing a ? After the th cross from Valencia didnt work because theyre amazing in the air why did we carry on doing it? Every corner in the first  minutes was cleared away easily for them. Nobody was putting good balls into the box today. We started looking dangerous when Januzaj tracked inside the full back. If wed had Young on earlier we would have done that more often.,reddevils,ceewlhw,1,t5_2rxse

Keeps passes simple drives every now and then would be good with Carrick.If having him freed Carrick of much of his defensive burden and Carrick was to be more adventurous with the ball then by all means. However the thing we lack the most in midfield is someone to capably move the ball centrally since RooneyCarrickCleverley distribute wide more frequently. Which is why people talk more about good passers of the football being linked to United than good tacklers.

Just like us their team was relatively the same with the exception of some additions to the team and just like us they had to adapt.Yet unlike us they are producing decent results and unlike us are overachieving their goals for the season under Martinez. Unlike us they are in the top  and unlike us are in a comfortable spot on the table contending for CL but content with Europa if need be.Hes had time. So has Martinez.

His best asset is his work rate and his movement I would say. Problem is he cant score so I dont think he could play as a regular AM for us.I think he could work as a scrappy midfielder to use occassionally because of the energy he brings.

97077,1,t1_cepfmp6,So lets remove the speculation then about whether or not he wanted playing time written in his contract. It is still incredibly immature to me for someone in that position to do what he did. He even admits his impatience. He had the position waiting for him...all Ferguson wanted to do was make sure he was mentally ready. United are great at developing players to their potential. How often did Ferguson promote an academy player to the first team and him not come good? How can you question a record like that? It is not his place to tell the manager if he is ready or not. Conte told him exactly what he wanted to hear but surely Conte knows as well as anyone that pressure can break young players. Also young players arent as disciplined with tactics etc. as experienced ones. Ferguson was a manager who wanted his players to instinctually understand their roles. Ferguson was telling him that he was a hair away from doing that. What more should an  year old expect? This isnt the wing like Januzaj where if you make a mistake it wont hurt you too bad. You cant make mistakes in CM. Pogba had not proven yet in any game that he was ready for the role. In my opinion both parties suffered. Juventus is a great team but they are no United. He would be just as good now if not better. He would have chemistry with players he came through the academy with. He would be the future star of a great team. He would still be in Frances WC squad. I think he knows he made a mistake. He wants PL football back but is probably realizing that that will be unlikely. Arsenal have a lot of midfielders and will almost certainly drop a lot of cash on a striker or two which means they cant afford Pogba. If he went to ManC he would be crucified by United fans for the rest of his time there. Chelsea stand the best chance financially but they just got Matic and I cant really see Pogba there. Who else is there in the PL besides us? I also dont think he wants to go to PSG. Theres no competition in France. Hell never be recognized as the best while he plays there.  Im torn because hes the player we need. I couldnt pick a better person to fill our midfield. But the message it would send would be a disaster. He would have to come out publicly and say he made a mistake that he acted on childish impulses instead of looking at the long term.

172339,0,t1_cey1u8n,Well you just made yourself sound like a really shit fan no offense.... But if its a genuine question then Ill explain...A penalty shoot out is a complete lottery. When it goes to the wire like that tensions run so high. Some people are comfortable with it and some people completely shit their pants. The manager usually comes over to the players and says something like right lads who fancies it? . Whoever is mentally strong enough will say yea Ill take one and others will shy away. This means that sometimes defenders take them sometimes forwards take them and sometimes people who you would expect to take one dont want to take one. The last thing a manager wants is for a player who doesnt fancy it to take one. Hell almost certainly bottle it. Its all about confidence. The manager really cant do anything about it. For example Alex Ferguson had nothing to do with berbatov clipping one down the middle to miss against Everton and send us crashing out of the FA cup nor did his tactical genius cause john terry to slip and hit the post resulting in us winning the champions league. ,reddevils,cey28mz,4,t5_2rxse

187664,0,t1_cezcmaa,If Mata Cleverley Rooney and either Kagawa or Januzaj start tomorrow I think youll eat those words.  Cleverley has looked poor because of the system hes in.  With players that pass and move and float around to make options and get available for short passes Cleverley will flourish.  He cant just play the striker through and if the people around him arent moving he has no option in his skill set but to pass sideways....  With the right combinations he can be a much better player than many give him credit for.,reddevils,ceztbb7,22,t5_2rxse
189130,0,t1_cezp8vq,I agree that he offers a lot when he is on form but he is also prone to having games where he looks very average and has no touch. And again you are right in that there is not many players out there who are like Rooney in terms of his blend of technical skill passing strength etc though I think his work rate and defensive cover is vastly over blown. I disagree with the idea that a new team would be needed to fill in what he does however but that is probably just a matter of opinion and I could very easily be wrong...,reddevils,cezzchg,1,t5_2rxse

220486,0,t1_cf3jysj,Moyes doesnt want to sign a player who will only be better than both Fellaini and Cleverley because lets face it even Cardiff City has better CMs than us. He wants to sign the top tier CMs in the mold of Vidal and Kroos. The type of CMs that wont just make us dominant in the league again but capable of challenging for the CL. These types of players are only available in the summer. It shouldnt surprise anyone if we dont make a CM signing in January. Moyes doesnt want another squad player.The argument of course is that we need a CM right now to stand a good chance of making top  CL football etc. I still maintain that the current squad is already full of average players like Young Valencia Cleverley. Cabaye would only be another one of these players and taking up a space in the  man squad. Before anyone shoots me for that he isnt on the level as Vidal Gundogan Fabregas which is the level that we should be aiming for in terms of CM signings.,reddevils,cf3k4vx,3,t5_2rxse

So if we had been behind all that time with Fletcher on he wouldnt be able to change formation and be more attacking because he would need to bring RVP off at some point.

A big money signing would not come in as cover to Evra. The writing has been on the wall in our attempts to sign Baines and Coentrao. Youre fooling yourself if you dont think Evra is as good as marked for exit or at the very least a lessimportant role. Evra clearly doesnt want to be a squad player and who could blame him. Additionally its silly to suggest Evra would miss any match fitness as hes hardly sat a minute the last few years.

With the quality we have at our disposal this shouldnt be the case. Why I compare this to AVSs Spurs tenure is because once Sherwood came in even the most basic formations provided instant results. Thats because he had the players to do it. Our players need another formation to perform. They had no plan B it was always  whereas Sherwood changed it a bit. I dont consider Sherwood a good manager but he has the numbers and results to prove his position.What I mean to say is anyone just ANYONE who comes in now will make a change. Just anyone will make us look good with the football we are playing right now. This is one of the reasons why Spurs are doing better because the way they were playing with AVB they were playing D boring and uninspiring football. Someone like Sherwood looks like a world class manager right now coz he has quality players at his disposal.I dont want Moyes sacked right now this season is dead and gone.

The point Im trying to make is Pep has such a domineering presence at Barcelona from his footprint as a player to his complete influence from the reserves to the first team.  In this case we have a team that has not know an ounce of change for a whole generation and had our own version of Pep for  years.  Weve taken a system and completely flipped it upside down not even the grass on the pitch is the same.  When you do this irrespective of a league winning team or not there will be unsettled players.  Weve frequently heard people say I wouldnt mind being the manager after the immediate manager.  These are massive shoes to fill for anyone Jose Mourinho Pep Guardiola etc.  The only difference is we would be backing the manager more based on hsi previous achievements and giving more thought into what is happening in the background.  With Moyes its just a straight forward lynching.  Most fans hung a noose for him before the season started now theyve got a reason to hang him...although itd be the same reasons any proven manager would have encountered.,reddevils,cfdh535,2,t5_2rxse

365716,0,t1_cfib85h,Sorry for the late response as I just got home damn uni taking all my time!. gt Do you mind expanding on what type of player he is?Hes a defensive midfielder whos rather good in offensive processes but lacking a bit in defensive ones if he is to continue playing in that position. Hes got a very good pass accuracy every game good marking good at deconstructing plays. Hes good at his position and has lots of room for improvement in his lack of concentration from time to time.gt If this is his first year in top flight football and he is playing as well as he has been doing and he is only   do you not think m is a solid investment for a guy who could only get better and stay with us for years?When you look at it this way it looks like a very very good investment. But theres no guarantee that hell make it in England and are we really in a position where we can afford improving a young player over the years considering what position he plays and the position were weaker in is the same? Its not someone like Ronaldo who cost something like M if Im not mistaken and turned out to be one of the best players to ever play at the club its a M investment. We did something similar with Anderson and it ended up as a major flop deal.gt I dont suppose you know anything about his character? Would he be swayed towards us over another club due to a heavy portuguese contingent we have had here over the years?I honestly dont know. Hes not very vocal off the pitch so its hard to tell what hes like in that regard.gt Ronaldo said we should sign him in your opinion should we?Like I said before its a big investment. Sporting will absolutely not let him go for anything less than his buyout clause M if Im not mistaken. To answer this and your last question if we bring an experienced CM then yes hed be a good buy to develop over the years. If were bringing him in expecting him to be the solution to all of our midfield problems wed be expecting way too much out of him and Fellaini at once as theyd both have to improve their game next season.As you can see my major concern is that its a M investment for a player thats doing really well in his first season in top flight football in Portugal. Id be much safer providing a more detailed opinion on this deal after the WC since I believe hell get his chances there.

For all the people that say Vidal wont come because he loves Juve all we need to do is make Juve a bid that they would love to have and then Vidal will soon be willing to move. No player likes job speculation and Vidals ego will be wounded significantly if Juve dont reject all offers immediately.Id like to think RVP and money probably around million would be good enough to secure Vidal and is a deal both Juve and United could be very happy about. Juve arent exactly lacking in the midfield department and would still have a very strong midfield without him and theyd have enough money to bring in a marquee signing as well as having RVP who still has plenty to offer.,reddevils,cfn0i9i,2,t5_2rxse

423079,0,t3_1yxerc,Im not usually one to be so harsh but...Ive seen more inspiring performances from kids just playing around in the yard. A couple more chances aside there was no real improvement from the first half.Besides Vidic the rest of the defence and especially the right side was terrible. Smalling let his man past for a shooting chance too many times and was definitely Ferdinands most unconvincing performance to date. We need to look at bringing in a right back as cover andor new centreback for depth.The goals really hit home how easily our defence and midfield are being beaten. Maniatis was able to hit a shot just outside the box with noone pressing and Campbell was free to cut into a hole in front of the defence to tuck home with only De Gea in the way.Midfield was nonexistent. No movement and penetration on the ball to carve the Olympiakos defence and no conviction in the tackle when defending. The amount of runs through the middle from Dominguez particularly highlights the ease teams have been having against us this season. Rooney to be honest didnt have too much of an impact in the centre either. Too often he hits long balls to Van Persie often marked by one or even two people leading to us losing possession. He needs to be smarter in possession. On long balls the amount of route one play we resorted to really shows how much the midfield disappeared.Wingers were also uninspiring. Unable to stretch the defence and what chances they had to get the ball in or shoot were wasted.Theres not even that much to say about the forwards who hardly even touched the ball. The wasted chance by Van Persie sums up the night and our season. Get the opportunity to take hold of the situation only to waste it.Come on Manchester United. Lets see the team that we know next match  the defending Premier League champions winner of countless leagues and cups we need that winning mentality back and we need to bring back that fear factor we have on other teams.    ,reddevils,cfom88m,1,t5_2rxse

483989,0,t3_1zm217,Like most of the other guys here Id approach it in a  style like thisMy favourite part of this style is that Kagawa Mata and Rooney are able to rotate and take each others positions when making attacks meaning were not stuck with a player out of position and then screwed on a counter attack.My favourite part of this is that the three men supporting RvP can all play in these three positions and are therefore able to rotate throughout the attack.Fellaini is also able to join the attack with this sort of formation with Carrick staying back as the guard in front of the defense. At the back I went with Evans and Jones. I think whilst hes still our captain we should try to play Vidic less and less. Hes leaving us and we need to start work on our defense for next season. Evans has been by far and away our most consistent center back this season and I personally prefer Jones over Smalling.Players can also be easily replaced in this team. Rooney Welbeck or Hernandez can replace RvP. Fellaini can be pushed up into the number  role if needs be and we have the wingers to replace Rooney and Kagawa out wide. Fletcher Cleverley and Giggs are capable of filling the defensive midfield positions.As for the style of play it depends who we have out wide. Rooney and Kagawa would lead to play outside the box trying to pass it around and making room. If we are playing with wingers it would point towards crossing. I would want to see some of the crosses replaced by cutting back and passing to a player on the edge of the box. ,reddevils,cfva70o,2,t5_2rxse

With the team he has I think thats pretty unacceptable anyway however it looks like that might not even be achieved now.Quite astonishing really. The players are to blame the lack of desire and the inability to make a simple pass is almost unbearable to watch sometimes but ultimately it falls to the manager and Ive seen nothing this season to suggest weve made any progress under Moyes in fact it looks like were getting worse.If you look at the guy its almost like he doesnt believe its written all over his face and surely thats transferred to the players.,reddevils,cg3zs6y,1,t5_2rxse

I would get our CB to drop deeper our FB and CM to drop back to the  yard line and press from there. I would not like to play this way long term but we need to become compact for now. . Give Hernandez some game time not just  mins when we are chasing a game. Go to more ball based training with a focus on passing triangles. Make sure that we put a player on both posts during corners and frees as we have conceded a lot of sloppy goals there. . Reexamine bringing back some of the former coaching staff. . If I am losing a match to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the opposition. . Change the focus to making the opposition worry about us instead of the other way around. . Remove the focus from being so crossing based. . Sign midfielders x who can create and score goals at present there is no creativity or guile there. Giggs is bit part and sell Fletcher who probably just doesnt have the energy that we need. . Look for a new winger and sell Valencia and Young. . New CB.

640969,0,t3_21ephk,To be honest I feel like Moyes is gone already. Even if we would keep him this season and get us up to . next season he would never and i repeat NEVER win the premier league against the likes of Mourinhos Chelsea. He just dont cut it we will never win the PL with Moyes and obviously not Champions league. He just isnt brilliant enough. He will be out smarted and loose against teams with better game plan anyway. That is why I just dont get why he is still in the club. He is an old fashion manager playing in modern football. He wont fucking cut it even if we gave him Bayern Munchen. He does not fucking cut it.,reddevils,cgd4n7r,1,t5_2rxse

644581,0,t3_21j213,...this is the most optimistic writing on United I think Ive read all season. I havent even thought of it on these terms. Damn you for lighting a tiny spark of hope!!,reddevils,cgdjf4z,7,t5_2rxse
644661,0,t3_21j213,So excited for this game. Ive never seen Bayern live and its going to be a special night at Old Trafford regardless of result. Honestly if I could have chosen any draw I would have chosen this one. Any other year I might have thought a bit more tactically but our chances against any team in the quarterfinals are incredibly slim. If we have to go I want to see us go out against the best.The nothing to lose idea is to me one of the most broken concepts in football. For starters we dont have nothing to lose. We have a Champions League spot in the semifinals to lose. Thats significant. On top of that we have further ridicule in the press should we get absolutely demolished. Every single time David Moyes makes a tactical decision that ends in defeat he is chastised by Captain Hindsight.If we play Valencia on the right Moyes will be crucified for not fielding our worldclass and expensive attackingmidfielder Juan Mata. If we play Januzaj people will question why Moyes didnt make the obvious decision by choosing Young or Kagawa instead.None of these decisions are obvious and I can guarantee that if we lose its more of a when at this point but Ill be a good sport our manager will be berated and our players will be cast aside for not being good enough. Probably in nearequal measure.What do Bayern have to lose? They will be thoroughly disappointed to lose to such inferior opposition but lets be honest what happens to the players? Is anyone going to question the quality of Mario Gotze? Right now there is a petition to stop Cleverley going to the World Cup. What will Mario have? At worst he  and the rest of the team  will be excused for having an atypically poor game. Nobody will say Gotze should never play in a Bayern shirt again! other than Dortmund fans. Nobody will say Its a disgrace that we paid  million for Thiago. Theyll just talk about how pathetic Fellaini is.Forget the romantic narrative for a moment. I sometimes get swept up in it too. Right before the Olympiakos game I drunkenly went on about how we were going to beat Bayern next round. It feels like a semifulfilled prophecy. Every time Im at the pub Ill be the one saying Were gonna fuckin dooooo it. Were gonna win it all. But lets face facts.Olympiakos are shit.We had a  year old winger dominating the midfield. Are you kidding me? Bayern wont even allow us a hairs breadth of respect. Giggs or no. I am somewhat flattered that you felt the need to scout the scene and check for a hidden secret within the chaos of abjectly dismal performances but we arent sandbagging. We really are that shit.There are few things more certain than Bayern getting through to the next round. Grass is green. Sky is blue. Pigs cant fly. Bayern are going to absolutely demolish United in the Champions League. Our chances of winning are so slim. So so so slim.To vaguely quote Moneyball There are good teams and there are bad teams. Then there are fifty layers of crap. Then theres us.So with all that said were going to beat Bayern on away goals. . Well draw Barca next round.,reddevils,cgdjqx9,23,t5_2rxse

Rooney was terrible and should have been off at half time. He scuffed our best chance when he was through one on one with Howard. Nani looked like a man who hasnt played in months understandably. Kagawa was poor. Smalling is not a right back. Substitutions that needed to be made werent and changes came too late. Everton just strolled through the game easily defending against us and pinning us back on the counter when we inevitably gave the ball away.

This is a tactic that he often used at Everton. Buttner Smalling and Evra arent capable of that so he cant do that this season. It limits our versatility. On top of that the CM position is Moyess pivotal focus for building a tactical system. Our CMs are poor. He cant do that until he gets players that can which is why hes waiting. gt If his tactics dont suit the team then hes a shit manager. His job is to get the best out of them. Not develop some weird master plan that requires all new players.His job was to build a team for the future. This season was never the target. If it was the target then they should have told him that and he would have went out and splashed a bunch of money on immediate fixes. You dont hire a long term minded manager like Moyes and then expect immediate results when hes planned his whole approach on long term goals. Its not a weird master plan its common sense. Why implement the system you have in mind when half of your starting team wont be with you the following seasonarent capable of doing what you plan. He literally cant do what he wants this season because we dont have the capabilities. gtRodgers at least had Liverpool playing decent football. They had a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes and changes with owners leadership etc.I literally just explained that to you. Of course they did because they had the pieces in place all season to work towards a goal. We dont have the pieces in place to work towards a goal. ,reddevils,cgybw7b,-6,t5_2rxse

That as well as the scouting of possible transfer targets is Michael Zorcs department. So what would likely happen is that Klopp would inspect the squad then create a list with requirement profiles for new players and then we get to watch Woodward bumble about for another summer transfer window trying and failing to sign this player and that player only to end up with some overpriced panic buys which Klopp then has to try and familiarize with his highly demanding pressing system together with the rest of the squad that right now is woefully unsuited to play Klopps style of football. Sounds like a great way to possibly ruin the great reputation he has spent the last dozen years building.I am sorry but realistically you need an experienced and very well connected manager in order to make up for Woodwards shortcomings when you even want to have a chance at success in rebuilding of the squad...,reddevils,cgyij25,6,t5_2rxse

Giggs is still only . He can work with the under  team for a year or take up on a midtable team to gain experience for a few years and comeback home.

893679,0,t3_24cvg7,That would be more down to the managers tactics than the players. Carrick is known more for his defensive attributes than his offensive attributes. Fellaini was brought in as a CDM not a playmaker. Cleverley well poor dude I hope he improves.But really if Moyes told them to stay back defend and when they get the ball to just pass it wide tldr the game against Fulham if you havent seen it its not Carricks or Fellainis fault that they have no goalsassists.Fellaini and Cleverley have been underperforming but Carrick is an integral part of the team if we play with a four man midfield  wingers  CMs. He provides defensive cover for the nonexistent more offensive midfielder. Kroos would be perfect alongside Carrick. ,reddevils,ch5v5xm,1,t5_2rxse

That was a just a pretty shitty Hollywood passes compilation that popped up as one of the top videos on Youtube.gt Thats possibly the worst montage of a player Ive ever seen. The majority of those passes were hoofs out to the wing.Ah that old one  when does a long ball become a long pass? Basically whenever someone who likes it is watching. Switching the play and finding players in space out wide is and incredibly important part of the sport especially when Fergie liked his wing play so much. Dont make Rooney sound like Robert Huth guest starring as a striker.gt That was fine   years ago but football has evolved so much.Right Ill go tell Gerrard and Pirlo that long passing is out then.gt A modern number  needs to be comfortable playing in tight spaces. Rooney doesnt have that. He can put a couple of long passes together very good for the kind of play people were up in arms about Moyes deploying but hes not a modern player made for a fluid system.What about this game? First goal is an intelligent chip to the back post. Second goal is a great swinging cross from deep. The fourth goal he begins the move with a dink over the defenders legs in a very tight space.And what about the other leg? First goal he actually scores it. Fourth goal he slides it through two defenders to find Valencia in the right channel.Just looking at two games and Im pretty sure Ive shown that Wayne has a wide and varying array of passing abilities.,reddevils,choswv0,2,t5_2rxse

1079768,0,t1_chr00w9,I watched most of Bayerns games this season thanks to Bundesliga being aired on a free to air channel for me.Was anyone suggesting that Kroos play purely as a destroyer? Im browsing on my phone and I might have missed it. I assumed people are talking about Kroos replacing Carrick in his current role since that makes more sense given how United play.gtIn possession youll never see their back four intact with their  CMs sitting in front of them.Of course not they always rotate with  person holding back and  person supporting. They arent fixed in their positions. Like I said the players that play there need to be able to contribute both offensively and defensively.United had something similar with Scholes and Carrick.gtI dont understand. First off Scholes was far far better at controlling the tempo of the game than Kroos who is more of a traditional number . He also put himself about a lot and contributed considerably on defense despite his Scholesie specials lol.I wouldnt compare Kroos to Scholes but more to Carrick when Kroos plays deeper. I think you might be underestimating the defensive work both players share in Bayerns double pivot put in together as well especially given how far up the rest of the team usually plays. You can see this from the heat zones of both CMs for Bayern in most matches.Carrick is much less mobile though.gtTrue but wouldnt you rather get the optimal sort of player for that position? One who is technically good has brilliant stamina is always running and contributes at both ends of the pitch eg. Vidal.I think a box to box midfielder would be brilliant alongside Kroos so of course a player like Vidal would fit perfectly. After all very few teams play with a dedicated defensive midfielder a la Makelele anymore.,reddevils,chr0tnu,1,t5_2rxse

The assistant is there to assist himshadow him pork in management stuff so perhaps this is why LVG decided to appoint him as his assistant since he has the club connection can learn the coaching doesnt have to do anything other than what he tells him to and has the respect of the guys so he can carry out tasks a little easier too perhaps. ,reddevils,cideffs,6,t5_2rxse

1319594,0,t1_cii0mmv,Well we keep persisting with Welbeck dont we. And I suppose he has some homegrown value. With Mata and Kagawa around we can throw Rooney up top and I wouldnt be against keeping Rooney up top with Januzaj behind him if everything went to crap. Plus we have Wilson and Henriquez who are going to need chances within the next few years.

Players want to play all league and champions league games.  Khedira is much more likely to start almost every game for United than he will for Madrid...especially if madrid bring in another CM this summer like Vidal Kroos Pogba Carvalho etc...And now lets say that Kroos wants out of Bayern because he clashes with Pep or Schweinsteiger called in his right to Prima Nocta...  He has an option to go to Real Madrid and fight for his place against Modric Khedira Xabi Alonso and Di Maria or he could go to United where he will be first choice to start every match hell be likely to win the premier league in his first year and almost certainly will in his first  and hell only miss out on one year of Champions League before reaching probably multiple semis and finals.,reddevils,cioodeh,0,t5_2rxse

Bilbao is no less of a CL threat than Dortmund the year they made it to the final. They were knocked out in the group stages the year prior in their title winning year whos dominance was quickly nullified Because of van Gaal and Heynkes and others.

1397634,0,t1_cirgynb,Hey man I havent seen you around here for a while! That was my thinking too but a journalist who knows a few people at the club was hinting that the Glazers are now looking for a sale and their aim is only to get back in the top four nothing more a bit like Arsenal I guess. So they might not want to spend a huge amount money on one player. LVG is a good enough manager to make squad with weak points work so they might get one or two more and call it a day. Might go for De Jong and wait on Strootman next year thats my fear. Im not sure whats going on with Vidal but a few clubs are set to move for Pogba soon we either make our move or we lose out on Vidal since they arent selling both.The flip side is that they could spend big and hope for short term success it would make the sale easier. Im convinced they will sale for the right price and I reckon thats been the case for a few years now. Do you have a billion or two?,reddevils,cirh2v9,1,t5_2rxse

Of course you could keep a local team as a second team perhaps so you can get to go to some games more easilygive you something to watch during quiet periods for unitedhelp build the US football fanbase etc HOWEVER you should support who you want!Im moving to the states myself from Manchester in the coming months and Ive been slowly converting my other half and my family out there into Reds...need someone to watch the games with me!

1500166,0,t1_cj461qk,Exactly. There are people who hop around the clubs they support and thats infuriating because thats not being a fan as fans arent that fickle but if you pick a team and stick to it then there is nothing wrong with that.And I think the local aspect is played up. You dont expect fans of a singerband to come from the same country or city to be considered as fans. You are a fan of something because it connects to you in someway and becomes part of who you are and what your entry point was that hooked you doesnt matter. It could be its your local team or family reasons or a moment grabbed you or even just the name grabbed you like Tom Hanks with Villa. Once that hooks been made then everyone is the same no matter if you live metres next to the stadium or miles away.I had to grow up being called a glory hunter We moved from the Manchester Area down South in the late s due to my Dads job. Living down there and my support was never questioned until we won the league when suddenly I was called a glory hunter even from people who would switch between supporting Spurs and Arsenal on a season by season basis.Ive since moved back up North but not back to Manchester and I had a City fan tell me I shouldnt be supporting United as I had moved away. They claimed that if they moved away they would force themselves to switch support to the local club and would make sure that may kids they had in future supported this local team and not City. I just laughed at him as its such a stupid argument that in this day and age where people move around more often than ever for work should only support their local team Not that having a passing interest in the local team especially is a bad thing if you arent in Manchester and getting to every game isnt viable then why not spend a Saturday afternoon watching the local team live especially if its a lower division one or one that struggles to fill its ground.

Play through the middle. The good Ander. Motherfucking. Herrera. He is just what we needed.  Wonderful link up play some very nice  passes fucking TRIANGLES bitches.  Youth performance was solid. Keane was good nothing spectacular but positioned well. Blackett would be a decent emergency sub IMO but only with solid CBs to cover his positioning. Reece James holy fuck. We have a winner.  Rooney is looking like he wants to be here.  Ander Herrera  Mata link up play was gorgeous.  Holy shit Ashley Young. I know its just preseason but what a way to start off your chance under LVG. I really hope he comes back and performs again.  Trying not to be too knee jerky but God Im excited.  times Man United?The bad Honestly the only thing I think was bad was vulnerability on the counter. If we take care of that we have a solid squad once again. So we have been privy to a Louis van Gaal master class. What a show. MOTM Ander Herrera. ,reddevils,cj67r3d,19,t5_2rxse

1516212,0,t1_cj6bzrj,Yes it is irrelevant  because you remarkably ignore the same exact thing applies to the normal formation buying more players will help it work.And no no it is not wrong.The fact you think that shows I can ignore you. Shaw is a huge talent DEFENSIVELY he has remarkable maturity and one on one ability especially for his age. On the offensive side he is nothing special Buttner was better as was Evra as is Rafael as are pretty much most fullbacks at this top level. This is a well known view of anybody who actually knows how Shaw plays. We are buying him for his current defensive ability with potential to expand on that and the hope his offensive side improves in time too.If you dont understand a player be quiet.There are many better options for a left back who can produce the goods offensively in a wing back role like Rodriguez even Blind would do that role better. As it currently stands we are showing a defensive fullback in an offensive wingback role we will be punished for it if it carries on.,reddevils,cj6c0wl,-3,t5_2rxse

1531478,0,t1_cj7wde0,We do have some depth. I mean it is a noticeable drop in quality of course but the options within the youth teams are more than capable to fill in a bit. What worries me is if Evans breaks his leg and then Jones goes killing machinemode to make sure Charlie Adam doesnt win Stoke a throw in  breaking both his arms his left foot and tearing his ear apart. That would leave us quite exposed at the back.Though I must say I am really excited about seeing Keane Blackett and perhaps even Thorpe  whom is great albeit a bit old to be breaking through the ranks.

1582242,0,t3_2cdnpe,Personally today is the day I decide whether to continue being a transfer muppet or become a grateful person and move on.  Its the nd of August the day Juventus fly out to Indonesia. If Vidal leaves for Asia with Juve I will take it as Vidal is not coming to Man Utd and move on to look at other targets and also be grateful that weve got LVG Mata Herrera and Shaw to look forward in the new season.  HOWEVER If Vidal does not fly out with Juve today I will stay optimistic regarding this transfer saga. I will explain why. For the past one or two months United and Juve have been denying reports almost DAILY but the Chilean media just never stops reporting about the deal. Similar to Kroos I feel that this could be the work of Vidals agent looking for a payrise for his client by reporting that United is willing to offer double his salary. If he does not fly out then maybe there could be some truth behind the chilean reports! Many might say that he is not looking for a payrise but a move instead well its just my opinion. Furthermore we also have a match against Real Madrid tonight to look forward to! Even if Ronaldo is not playing our defense will be put to test against Bale and Isco ,reddevils,cjem4wp,5,t5_2rxse

He had  assists at the World Cup and got  goals for Fiorentina from the wing last year. Hed be our best winger and considering our need for cover for Rafael hes perfect.,reddevils,cjibeyf,5,t5_2rxse
1612397,0,t3_2crv0p,gt Can they break the top  like they did a few years ago?Probably not  the top  are a lot stronger than they were a few years back. Besides Newcastle are a weird team in my opinion theyve bounced up and down the PL more than any other team I can think of in recent years. Other than offering Pardew an obscenely long contract they really dont seem to understand the meaning of consistency. I think their final position will be determined more by how many extra points other midtable teams pick up against the likes of United and City etc.gt Who is best to partner Herrera?I really like the way he plays with Fletcher but it remains to be seen how many games Fletch can manage. I can see him having to be rested come January after the hectic Christmas schedule if he plays the majority of games until then. LVGs stellar manmanagement should take the edge off that though. Carrick is obviously my second choice not being a massive fan of Cleverley. If the rumours about LVG turning Kagawa into a proper CM have any truth to them I think thatd be a damn good partnership.gt Do you think either will flop or not live up to expectations?Simple answer nope. For Herrera if the Liverpool game is anything to go by his biggest problem is going to be picking up yellow cards. The Galaxy match showed us how good his distribution can be and weve sorely lacked that. The thing that impresses me most about him  other than his strength on the ball holding off whichever scouser it was and playing in Chicarito for our first goal springs to mind  was that even when it wasnt his day passing wise he made up for it tenfold with his defensive performance. His attitude seems spot on and with a similar workhorse in Fletcher next to him our midfield might actually be a strength next year not that I dont want Vidal too.gt Do you think Luke Shaw can grow into a world class LB?Shaw is clearly in it for the long haul and will benefit hugely from LVGs tutelage. He showed glimpses of real quality last year and being surrounded by some great players will do wonders for his attitude and consistency. Leftback is a position where theres a real lack of genuinely world class players and the ones we talk about most are the best attackers Baines to me is a match of the day fullback great to watch going forward and a bit suspect at the back so I dont really mind if hes not up there in terms of being talked about as world class. He has the potential to be air tight at the back and his attacking play is certainly good at the minute and I actually think the LWB role seems very suited to him when his fitness improves anyway  he got forward well against Liverpool and tracked back quite well too  I have no doubt that hell fulfil his promise.The only worry I have is the lack of competition for his place  we really need to strengthen at fullback on both sides since hes bound to have at least one lengthy injury at some point in the next few years. Fortunately LVG wont let him get complacent. I also think he couldve done with a year being Evras understudy as even though his performance dropped last year Evra would have been a great mentor and Shaw couldve benefited from his example. ,reddevils,cjier1t,2,t5_2rxse

RooneyRVP and Mata  This is going to be the best thing to watch this season since they are all gonna play in their preferred positions finally. I just hope they can all stay injury free and play consistently together.

Do you think anyone on the team gives a damn about what he did? Or what he does?As for the city shtick had he wanted to leave he wouldve left. Ferguson doesnt screw around with players who think theyre bigger than the club. That is just the media blowing it out of proportion. At the most it couldve been about the wages. The nd time he came forth and said it himself that he didnt ask for a transfer. Performance dips do happen when their is tension with the manager. He can fuck a hooker or he can fuck the entire cast of little Britain for all I care he is captain material. De Gea just came to united Rooney has been with us for a decade. Had fletcher not be struck with illness and lost so many years he mightve been the captain.

1687881,0,t3_2dpy72,Well that wasnt the way to cure a hangover. Fuck that was an early game after hitting the bars last night.Bright spots for me  Januzaj showed he hasnt lost much after last season. Hes going to wear that number  proudly.  The service on set pieces was terrific for the most part. Young and Mata combining on those impressed me a lot.  Rooney was a pair of fortunate touches away from a hat trick. That one banged off the post and another denied by a miraculous sliding tackle.  The bad Obviously we need some signings but its shocking to see just how quickly our side falls off after injuries.  Nani and Chicharito were really unimpressive. Just didnt produce anything worth their playing time IMO. I wouldve rather seen James and Wilson out there instead if we cant have WelbeckRvP and RafaShaw. Our passing was cringeworthy at times. Giving the ball away in bad areasmissing easy passes. There was none of the creative spark they showed when playing in the states which had me excited for this season. That aspect of Uniteds game had disappeared. Januzaj was a little too selfish after he had finished destroying his side of the wing. He missed some chances for an assist or two while taking shots from really tough angles or getting into trouble. This isnt the end of the world or Uniteds hope for silverware some changes definitely need to happen though. I believe LvG will turn things around and get the team right. Fingers crossed that we dont have any more injuries!PS  Loved the announcers on NBC Sports today. Their coverage is so good over in the States making even the early games enjoyable.

Maybe Vidal is the exception because hes so highly regarded and we have been desperate for a midfielder like him for so long so I would pay m for him  but then when you think about his knee it does worry you.Dont get me wrong Im desperate for signings too.

The only clubs that have gotten away with this in the recent past have been United and Arsenal. As the article states we can put that down to the fergy factor and the Arsene factor too I guess.Glazers need to either cough up or fuck off. I can almost guarentee that if nothing is spent again this summer and the season starts like it did last season there will be major demonstrations and protests by the fans which will escalate until the Glazers either spend or sell up. ,reddevils,cjtm9if,9,t5_2rxse

I know Martinez got injured but I find it highly convenient that as soon as Utd are strongly linked with him Bayern suddenly appear on the scene and Roma are now allegedly trying to tie him down with a new contract. It all smells of a club trying to drive the price up after we stupidly went on about how much were prepared to spend.

Look at the dutch wingbacks and count how many times they go forward and reach the box and make a cross you can count it with one hand almost. The dutch wingbacks stays in the middle and guard the back most of the time they rarely get caught in wide areas because they know when to move forward and when not to. To me valencia is perfect as a wingback in our squad right now he showed that in preseason. Shaw can become a wingback no problem and young can adapt. Although I am not very confident on reece james. Our wingbacks just need time to adapt and when they do I am confident the  will work. Van Gaal says it will take at least  months to learn this system.,reddevils,cjuc87d,2,t5_2rxse

Though I guess the worry is his mental ability. On the pitch he looks as calm as Paul Scholes did in his thirties which is a rare trait. The whole drunk driving scenario is probably why he is being shipped off again. He is good enough to be a backup in our midfield no doubt. I dont care if hes played CAM or ST last season.

1751483,0,t1_cjzwygs,Barcelona. In goal he inherited Baia. The eccentric and erratic man from Portugal. LVG took an immediate dislike to him and signed a  year keeper from Roda named Ruud Hesp. Hesp was never more than steady but at least LVG knew that he could be trusted. In defence Barca had Ferrer Sergi Nadal Abelardo and Couto. Ferrer and Sergi were good not great fullbacks that had the advantage of being Barca youth products. LVG immediately brought in Reizeiger to push Ferrer out. Nadal was a monster fair play. Abelardo was adequate backup and Couto was another of the erratic Portguese brigade that Robson brought in and that LVG didnt trust. After running out of patience with Couto Gaal brought Winston Bogarde in January. He also used midfielder Celades as a sweeper during this period.Midfield was mixed. Guardiola was far and away the best they had but spent the entire season injured. That left Luis Enrique De la Pena Amor and Roger Garcia in the centre. However he also had a very young Figo and Barca supplemented this by bringing in Rivaldo. Noone could know how these two would turn out. Up front he had Stoichkov on the downswing early s and overweight he made  appearances before being shipped off to CSKA Sofia. Sonny Anderson who really struggled with the league before being shipped off back to France in  and Pizzi... LVG ended up rotating between the latter  options and Luis Enrique and Rivaldo. Such was his dearth of good strikers. Ironically just as he took over the Barca president was completing the sale of Ronaldo to Inter. The next few seasons saw him bring in or promote the De Boer brothers Kluivert Cocu Xavi Zenden Litmanen Puyol Gabri Iniesta and Reina.,reddevils,cjzxl29,62,t5_2rxse

Essentially it means playing as a central midfielder but then providing width having made sudden diagonal bursts. In this particular position Di Maria is arguably the worlds best and it was particularly useful when he played in the same Real Madrid side as Cristiano Ronaldo who always made the reverse movement cutting inside from a wide starting position.The Argentine is frequently misunderstood and often termed a winger which suggests hes in the mould of Arjen Robben or Gareth Bale. In reality at no point in his sevenyear European career has Di Maria played in a front three  he has generally been tucked inside into a deeper more central position. At Benfica for example he excelled on the opposite side of the diamond to Ramires.For Real Madrid under Jose Mourinho he played a disciplined narrow wide role in a  to compensate for Ronaldo and Mesut Ozils attacking positioning again almost tucked back into a midfield three alongside Xabi Alonso and Sami Khedira.

But selling him to our rivals for the CL spot who had rejected our advances for their thirdchoiceout of favour centre back and who would address the problems in their squad with his acquisition was extremely unwise. m seems to be a fair price for Welbeck if the buying club was one of our nonrivals.

Each win is  points draw is  and a loss is . You get relegated by getting less than the required amount of points varies each division  or you get promoted by getting more than the required amount to get promoted. You can also stay in the division if you fall within the two and you can also win the division title by getting a minimum amount of points that usually means you have to win  games out of . The teams you are allowed to choose are the real life clubs and countries that are found in the base game. Also  if there is a weekly update you have to use the newly modified teams with the players either better or worse than they were in the base game. You play against users that are using teams of the same star levels so you wont play against Real Madrid if you are using LA Galaxy for example. You can edit your lineup and tactics and that sort of stuff  but you are not a manager and cannot make any transfers speaking of which  I wish they added a connected manager mode like how they have in NHL .,reddevils,ckguujx,1,t5_2rxse

LvG is a notoriously slow starter and I wouldnt be surprised if we finished outside the top . The board and the fans will need patience if that happens. Also the market prices of players will continue to climb as long as kit deals stadium naming rights tv and competition revenues climb. Hell Ross McCormack cost m. If you think FFP will stagnate the rise of players value then you dont understand the football landscape..On another note if we were to get back into the CL then UEFA have tighter FFP restrictions than the FA and another summer or two like the one just prior then we would Defs breach their requirements.

2004700,0,t3_2hpa6q,Ive only been watching games for  years so my choices are fairly limited. I would have to say when we beat Olympiacos  at home last season.Reason That whole season was obviously depressing and at the beginning it would upset me greatly when we lost games like  vs. West Brom  vs. City but by January I had already become desensitized mostly going Another loss? Whats new? but still continuing to watch every game. When we lost  vs. Olympiacos it wasnt the same as losses such as  to Pool City or Chelsea it hurt MORE by that time to think that I was so relieved we drew Olym. vs Bayern or Madrid I was happy we got the easy fixture. Then we played one of our absolute worst games of the season and it felt almost as bad as when we lost  to City in the  season. I thought we were fucked I was so depressed but I watched home vs. Olym. anyways. I can honestly say that is the HAPPIEST I have ever been due to the result of a single game. When the whistle blew and we had won  I cried from happiness it was just so emotional and such a great feeling to have an enormous weight off my shoulders.TLDR Cried after we beat Olympiacos .,reddevils,ckurjdg,4,t5_2rxse

SAF knew he had potential maybe not to the level he is now but he didnt give him enough st team action for him to warrant staying. He made  appearances for us in total whereas Januzaj has made  and has proven to the world he has the potential to be world class. At the time Pogba was highly rated only by those who followed him in the youth teamsreserves.Pogba left without the large majority of the United fan base realising what a gem we were selling but if united even threatened to sell or even loan out Januzaj there would be pandemonium even with him not being a st teamer in LVGs system.

2029556,0,t3_2i0m0q,A lot of the time he just seemed frustrated and confused as to the total lack of movement and urgency from the rest of the United team. Id see so many attempts at intelligent moves and passes that hed try to start but theyd fall apart because his team mates would either be too shortsighted to see what he was trying or theyd be too slow to react. Hed gone from the quick incisive play of Reus Gundogan Gotze Lewandovski and Blaszczykowski to a United team with a midfield in dire need of reinforcement and a style of play that had become often rather ponderous stagnant and uninspired. It also didnt help that his preferred central role was never really given to him instead being mostly pushed out onto the left by both Ferguson and Moyes. That said he didnt really seem to have the confidence to impose himself on the team and stand up to big characters like Rooney and RvP and say this is my position Im creating this bit of attacking play piss off up front where youre supposed to be. Instead hed just give the ball to them and then be there for a few bits of onetouch football if they ran into trouble.

2142805,0,t1_clc70my,He didnt have the ideal conditions to come in Im not denying that but the reason he couldnt get the players he wanted was because they were either just players we had no chance of getting at the time or he was indecisive about them. He went for Bale when everyone knew he only wanted to go to Madrid he went for Fabregas the day after they sold his competition for a place in Thiago to Bayern and even then the manager has an input on how high they are willing to go to big for a player. He chose not to get Fellaini earlier that summer for a cheaper price with his release clause only to get him a month later for . million. Everyone thought the release clause at m or so was too expensive for him as hes just not very good. With Herrera he decided he wasnt worth the m release clause tried to get him for m when everyone knows Bilbao doesnt do business with clubs unless they bid the release clause and instead chose to get Fellaini ahead of Herrera for pretty much the same price as he was premier league proven. His summer transfer window was disastrous both because of him and partly because of woodward but then so were his results in pre season that year and that only continued into the season and only got worse.Id disagree about looking better with Mata... Maybe a bit better in some smaller games but against big teams we got smashed even worse then in the first half of the season. It just further unbalanced the squad. ,reddevils,clc75qd,9,t5_2rxse

He scored a hattrick for the Us last month and Warren Joyce said that it was just the start of his comeback trail and that he thought  Will is yet to get back that sharpness he had before he got injured. And Warren reckons that with more training and more volume of work he could definitely get back to the level he was playing before he got injured. Warrens commentsgtI think with Will its volume of work that he needs but not too much pressure on him to just do that explained Joyce to ManUtd.com before this weeks cup tie. There will be times when the work will take his sharpness from him. But its continual volume to get him through that and when the sharpness really returns it will get him back to what he was.gtThats the aim. Ive certainly seen signs of the old Will Keane. To be totally honest last year before he went out on loan I didnt see it and thought he went out on loan too early. He wasnt really in top form in training so it was not really a shock when he struggled to find his rhythm out on loan. He was out a while and were trying to build his workload up and well continue to do that to get him back to what he was. Will was the best player in the country at reserves level and you dont lose that ability. You dont lose that talent.

I dont even think Van Gaal knows which he prefers due to all the injuries.Apart from McNair who could go out on loan Jones is the youngest at  but cant seem to get fit and find form. And when he is playing he has to to learn to channel his aggression and not get caught out of position too much.Smalling is  and Ive always liked him. Hes much calmer than Jones although his mistakes usually come from switching off or not communicating. I have a feeling he will become very consistent under Van Gaal.Evans is  and has been excellent at times for us in the past. It seems an age since he was fit and in form and its hard to remember just how good he can be. Hes the man with it all to play for  he needs to come back and show Van Gaal what hes made of.

2734291,0,t1_cne1nmu,gt The first mentions it was chronic prior to surgery but doesnt even imply it was such a problem after it.Uh... there is no outright cure for chronic tendonitis? Surgery attempts to fix the damaged part or in Hargreaves case outright remove most of the damaged tendon to alleviate the inflammation and pain. You dont get a second set of tendons once yours are fucked unless you can get a graft but it wasnt done for Hargreaves so I assume it wasnt feasible. Its a condition you have to manage for the rest of your life. As mentioned in the article part of the treatment to manage it is to relearn how to move your body. Which was why he was sustaining other injuries to his leg muscles since he had to compensate for his knees. Not simply because he had a mental block and was trying to protect his knees like you insinuated.gtInfact it backs me up by stating his comeback was hindered not by his knees but by other injuries.His other injuries were a result of him having to overcompensate for his knees as part of his rehabilitation. Tendonitis depending on the severity alone isnt going to cause a player to retire he played through the pain for United previously. You can even manage it short term through cortisone injections. Its the knockon effects that accumulate and in the long run hurt your body more.gtAnd its hardly silly conjecture.Like I said previously despite his claims of being physically fit again he wasnt realistically going to play anymore. And as mentioned they were the best in terms of  and reputation club to offer him a lifeline. ,reddevils,cnevl3t,1,t5_2rxse

Going from our  in  we are on course to scoring around  goals maybe a bit less. In SAFs last three seasons we scored   and .

Like Koeman said we have trouble building up from the back with it and end up just keeping it with the defenders most of the time. Its not made for a possession style of play its much more suited as a counter attacking formation like how Netherlands used it at the World Cup.

Bad luck for Juan but a world class striker like Falcao would likely have buried at least  of them.  At that point in the game we had Fellaini who was positioning deep at the top of the box Rooney  who was in the box but not moving much Mata  who was moving and finding some space but couldnt convert.

2936045,0,t3_2ts403,Alright. So the rumours suggest that we may soon be lodging a bid for Aymeric Laporte from Athletic Bilbao from Balague. Another rumour including an Instagram post from a teammate suggest that Aleksandar Dragovic is moving clubs and is a target for  million. Both are centrebacks that would help us out. Dragovic is probably the more likely of the two.Nathaniel Clyne has been a rumour but no reputable sources have said anything about it. If this will happen itll probably be during the summer. Strootman is someone that may happen in the summer depending on how his knee is and his performances. He picked up a minor knock this weekend but as far as I saw he was just taken off for precaution.Paul Pogba has come up as being linked to United but every club with financial power will target him this summer. Gareth Bale is another rumour but no credible sources again.This winter expect  more signing at best. At a stretch I see two signings. But nothing more than that. It is very possible that nothing materialises as well. Right now the most likely signature is Aleksandar Dragovic. That may be it for the winter.,reddevils,co1ua3o,27,t5_2rxse

This is not limited to RVP and Falcao. the Chicharito issue needs to be closed either way too. MoreoverJanuzaj is expected to fill one of the wide roles and Danny Wilson looks like he could benefit from some serious minutes playing through the middle.Kanes riding a good wave right now and if United is to dip in to the market for him wed be paying out of our asses for him. If Andy Carroll went for m once I cant imagine what the price on Kane would be like. We must consider the risks attached to this. I like watching Kane play and he should remain on our radar just on the back burner for now while our squad is overhauled. Of course I could be wrong and he could end up at Madrid for some silly  million fee and go on to win the Ballon dOr and oust Ronaldo.

3001274,0,t1_co90opi,I think there is information that may have eluded you making your argument relatively weak Ill tell you why.  You do not create a successful club by constantly replacing players who are either injured or out of form. That does not build the stability that is needed for a championship winning team. In fact that philosophy can be counter productive in the transfer market as no player will feel fully comfortable joining a team that has a reputation of replacing a player as soon as they are injured or out of form  hence why some players opt out of signing for Madrid or even City  players want stability.Additionally when building a club you need that stability you need players who understand the culture of the club and who adds to the overall atmosphere off of the field. I remember reading an article that stated players at United and Barcelona stayed at those clubs the longest with an average at about  years a player.  That was during our last golden era under Ferguson and coincidentally the same time Barca were at their best under Pep.,reddevils,co92w02,2,t5_2rxse

3008720,0,t3_2un3ux,Fair play to him. He was one of my favourite players ever since he arrived from Porto its a shame he was often played out of position which definitely contributed to his below par performances.The guy was one of the best attacking midfielders in Europe who was highly coveted by many. We sign him and decide he would make a cracking holding midfielder and throw him into a  a system where he could use none of his talents. The few matches he played a more advanced role he flourished namely against Schalke in the Champions league in . He just wasnt cut out as a holdingcentral midfielder and would have done a hell of a lot better elsewhere.You could argue that playing the deeper role contributed to his injury problems as it is a more physical role and more demanding in terms of stamina. Everyones body has a limit his body didnt seem to let him play the role we required on consistent basis. Anderson played really well when paired with Hargreaves Carrick and to an extent Cleverley all three covered which enabled him to get a bit more freedom to play his game. One large problem was he was often paired with Scholes who also liked to roam forward and wasnt exactly known for his defensive work both cant go forward so Anderson had to sit.Had he went to Spain or stayed in Portugal and played as an attacking midfielder in an environment that simply isnt as physical then I have no doubt that he would be one of the top players in Europe.All the best Ando!,reddevils,co9unw2,20,t5_2rxse

3134077,0,t3_2w1t8a,I think the summer outgoings are going to catch a lot of people off guard. If van Gaal chooses to go in another direction with the squad and the formation he wants to implement I can see a few of the fan favourites leaving. This isnt even accounting for some of the other players there could be quite a lot of roster turnover. When it comes to Rooney personally Id rather we slot him up front as the CF in an front three with two wingers. I think hed thrive there. It also opens up another spot in the midfield that could be filled by another class player. Someone said it in a previous thread today and Ive thought it ever since Louis got here. When it comes to some of the guys potentially going my mind is telling me yes but my heart doesnt want to admit it. ,reddevils,comuf0w,5,t5_2rxse

3166639,0,t1_copcn4i,If I thought you were willing and able I wouldve been delighted to have an actual conversation with you about your views on our teams problems. Id have proper enjoyed a civil debate over the actions that should be taken to mend these problems. However reading your first post provided enough evidence for me to assume that instead of being up for such a conversation you were just some angry fan who wanted to vent. It was also fairly obvious that your grasp on the concept of what makes a player a good player positional values on a football pitch or even how the game is actually played was lacking. I want you to understand that that my first thought after reading your post was literally This mans head is banjod. Any time Ive read something youve wrote in this thread its been the first thought Ive had.I dont know why you would think a person cant be a true Manchester United fan without being truly football savvy so to speak. I was perfectly able to understand that you were a big fan even though everything you wrote suggested you had no idea what you were talking about. You spewed these opinions and then just got angry when no one agreed with you. Im assuming this thread is similar to the last one you made about the same topic in January or whenever and you still had the arrogance and ignorance to tell people they have no idea what they are talking about even though no one is on your side?

Jones has shown capabilities at RB RCB in a  RCB in a  LCB in a  and can do a job as a DM if were desperate. Smalling for instance is the least versatile player in our squad.There is nothing in van Gaals system where he wants his CBs to do any more than be great defensively.

3178898,0,t1_coqza8t,Thanks for looking that up I was going to but got lazy. Id argue that pretty much everyone on there is at their level so to speak. I dont see Smalling or JOnes making more than they do now at any other club. Their market value may be higher but theyre not making more money in any other clubs wage structure. Evans make more than Jones and Smalling and hes been a worse player this season. So hes definitely overpaid right now. Rafa is a liability in anyones eyes I dont see him making more than he does now anywhere else. Young is DEFINITELY overpaid. .m?! Crazy. I like him but hes def not that good.Were still on the hook for Chichas wages once he comes back. Powell is not going to do better than United right now hes blown his chances and will want to stay here on whatever wage hes got.Van Persie is iffy. I think hed want to stay because of the Van Gaal connection. But I wouldnt be surprised if he was let go. Either way we can afford to phase out an older striker. At the end of the day United has leverage on these players. Theyre not going to make more at other clubs and we re not going to miss them terribly if a few of them end up leaving.,reddevils,corhoxd,1,t5_2rxse

3276990,0,t1_cp1s8nf,Because  wins  draw against City Spurs Everton and Southampton isnt luck. Its incredibly good form. They were miles better than City and so what if they scored from range? Are they not chances? Do they not count as goals? City defended ultra deep to counter Liverpools pace so yeah no shit theyll have a lot of shots from range. Thats what you do against sides who are defending deep and they did it well by scoring two goals. Against Southampton they scored twice anyway so who cares if one goal is scrappy? Again do scrappy goals not count? Against Spurs they were the better side and won ? Are you going to discredit all three goals scored too? Even a  away against your rivals is an okay result but this was a pretty dire game.Arsenal have won  of their last  and  of their last . Again theyre in excellent form in the league and they have the easiest run in. Yes theres a frailty about them but what do you expect? Theyre competing for fourth. Obviously a side whos competing for fourth isnt going to be perfect thats why theyre fourth and not first. Spurs us Liverpool Arsenal all have weaknesses again thats why were fighting it out to scrape into the UCL spots not running away with the league like Chelsea.Spurs I dont neccessarily rate for top  but they do have an extremely easy next  games were the only decent side theyre playing so dont be surprised if they pick up a lot of wins in the next month or so.City will still easily walk to nd. Theyre not in amazing form but even that is overstated a bit given theyve won  drawn  and lost  of their last  and played ChelseaLiverpool away in that period. Their next  games are against Leicester Burnley West Brom Palace Us West Ham Villa and five of those seven games are at home. Needless to say theyll pick up loads of points from such an easy fixiture run and make talk of them not getting top  or even top  look pretty stupid. Especially now Toures back. Theyll get at least  points from that.Mostly why your post is ridiculous though is that youre nit picking tiny hole in Liverpool and Arsenal for things which are ridiculous like goals from range while acting like were not in considerably worse form playing considerably worse football. According to your analysis every tiny weakness Liverpool Arsenal Spurs and City have is going to turn into a massive deal and make them drop loads of points while were just magically going to start playing brilliant win game after game and waltz into the top .

3324689,0,t1_cp77uis,Both. They were a team of champions and things happened that took them to seventh. If you reread my post Im emphasising the importance of Vidic Rio Scholes Giggs and Evra. They either retired or lost influence last season. Rewatch the last Fergie season and count how often tight games were decided the odd goal that came via a key pass from Scholes or Giggs. Then add in Van Persie.  Fergusons art was rebuilding teams whilst still winning. Moyes didnt do that. He lost Scholes from the squad and he was not replaced. Giggs then entered his final season and lost influence. Then add in poor recruitment and the inevitable upheaval of Ferguson retiring. It needed somebody like Mourinho to oversee such a change to get results instantly. ,reddevils,cp78qdr,4,t5_2rxse

3363029,0,t3_2yp57w,Juan Mata. A player whom a lot of fans are concerned about his playing situation. I must admit it pains me to see a player with his qualities both as a footballer and just a genuine nice and relatable human being hugs sit on the bench. But how does he fit into our recent formation? In a  adaptation of the formation we are playing he could replace Fellaini as a no.off the striker but the midfield of MataHerreraBlind would just not being able to do a job winning the ball in the midfield. Blind and Herrera can read the game well but the physicality in the three is lacking.  That would be the case if we look at a  adaptation of the formation as well.  That midfield three would have issues winning the ball back in the midfield putting a lot of pressure on an already struggling defense.  The most effective way to use Mata is as a no. there is just no question that is where he excels.  To do so we would have to change our formation.  I could see Mata fitting into the no. role in a couple different ways reverting back to a  Center Back formation or a Diamond Midfield Taking these options it would seem Herrera becomes an obvious casualty.  Fellaini has to continue to play up top as a striker and will have the responsibility of dropping into the midfield to try and win the ball back or commit smart fouls to stop attacks. I dont think we could play RooneyFalcaoMata at the same time unless a midfielder was scarified for Fellaini.  Mata coming as a sub and changing the formation in the later parts of a game makes more sense with our current midfielders IMO.For the sake of continued conversations what happens when RvP is healthy? Notes If Shaw is healthy I believe he starts at LB and Rojo shifts to LCB and then one of SmallingJones gets dropped.,reddevils,cpblzj7,13,t5_2rxse

Actual Mancs are more likely to have a laugh about a bad ref or simply move on without a tinfoil hatesque claim of bias.The funny thing is I also know a lot of United fans do attend matches and are ultradefensive and wont accept a bad word said about them. I also know a lot of fans who dont attend and have their heads screwed on. I think its massively ignorant you think the ability to affordacquire a ticket for the game or the country you live in depends on how much of your opinion that actually counts. It doesnt make a difference where you are from and if you attend the games the opinion you give is just as important from either perspective. What you believe is based on anecdotal evidence and based on your own feelings rather than actual proof. Fair enough your Manc but I dont think you fully appreciate what the foreign fans actually offer us and I always find it amusing whenever people bash them because essentially without them United wouldnt be close to how great they are today.

3431632,0,t1_cpjbkh9,Chelsea havent though really made that much profit from their Academy. People keep spinning this recently BUT Bertrand is the only significant player really. The rest that get lumped into this are players who were established st team players at another club who Chelsea paid decent money for. Under any of the definitions used by either the FA UEFA or Fifa for what defines a home grownclub trained player they wouldnt have ever qualified even if they hadnt been sold. It largely seems these players were bought with no intention for them ever making it at Chelsea they seemed almost destined to be loaned out to inflate transfer fees before shipping them out. While undertaking this process they have been out overpaying significantly for youth players at all age levels who WOULD if they stayed until they were  qualify as Home GrownClub Trained without them producing any players of note and while not actually making any money from them when they get rid of them.Citys have like Chelsea have been overpaying to acquired players at the youth levels who will when they reach  be Club Trained. Even with FFP they have enough money to keep filling their ranks with solid backups with some pedigree infact perhaps some of chelsea type young but established players that they can loan out and sell on if they dont make an instant splash and then a high cost players every season because their survival relies on that they cant afford the time to blood home grown players because commercially they dont have the clout if they arent in the CL and being susccessful ,reddevils,cpjfkey,2,t5_2rxse

Its also why hes been known to bring in Dutch players in the past id say but thats me theorizing.The current topteams are way better in the tactical aspects and on top of that have the nescesary qualities and balance in their squads.

Whilst id love to win against both the Man City game is definitely more important to take points from. Since theyre right in it with us winning against them could make us overtake them. Plus obviously keeping in front of Liverpool who could very well be  points behind us in the next game if they draw to Arsenal and we win vs Villa is vital. ,reddevils,cpmzxi9,13,t5_2rxse

3471214,0,t3_30059v,I thought Smalling was fantastic he really has been great since that red card. He looks so confident and assured on the ball now and doesnt seem to be making any mistakes.

3472774,0,t3_300m6g,I honestly believe our team with its current form is a prime example of a synergy effect. In a sense that the team as a whole is much bigger unit than a simple sum of its parts. Players are starting to compliment each other and playing as a unit using collective strength to cover individual shortcomings. SAF was a master of creating a great team with a sum of  justaboveaverage players and one or two great player.Lets be honest here. This team has the same frame the last season team has had. Individually I really cant see much improvement on any given players Mata seems to be closing down more Valencia seems to be less rightfootonly player Felaini seems to be able to control a ball under pressure better Jones is still a running hothead throwing himself in challenges recklessly though. All in all most of the flaws or shortcomings that were evident last season are still there yet they seem not to be crucial.And most of the players Smalling for example has benefited greatly from the greater integration the new system brings and asks at the same time. This really shows the difference between Moyes and LVG. It wasnot the skill or managerial competence nor the lack of. Frankly Moyes would have had done almost the same. He did it with mediocre team that was Everton. What he lacked was balls! Or experience. Or selfconfidence. He felt the pressure and rushed into buying the solutions trying to eliminate those shortcomings. This time last year it was evident Moyes could not manage a team give a vision reduce or the fear or offer a hope. LVG did buy also but worked his way into integrating the players into a grater unit. He gave players confidence. And he did it faster than Moyes was expected. Moyes had  year contract remember.And one thing. LVG said his philosophy takes about  years to implement in full. Think about that. ,reddevils,cpo4dur,1,t5_2rxse

3491084,0,t3_308xsz,Whilst the best possible outcomes have been covered in other threads looking at the game itself is a pretty interesting particularly in preferring an Arsenal win. Personally im really hoping Arsenal are somewhat ruthless and dont fuck it up. Its at home for them they are in good form playing against a weakened rival and they really should be picking up the win.  The Skrtel ban is an added bonus from the weekend and how they line up could be a real headache for rodgers. We easily dealt with their midfield in the first half with quick passing into roving players in between the lines something Arsenal do a lot. Sanchez vs moreno or ibe would be an obvious weakness and potentially set pieces as they wont have skrtel who is aggressive in the air. Would be somewhat poetic if Welbeck scores the winner.,reddevils,cpq7ipl,2,t5_2rxse

3661932,0,t1_cq9mepp,The problem with this thinking is that money DOES matter in football. You can see increasingly over the past  years that the clubs which regularly qualify for Europe are pulling away from everyone else. The clubs which regularly progress to the knockout stages are again on another level and its usually the same faces in the semis even. This is because of the increased prize money partly but its also because of the way it increases the profile of a clubs brand enabling bigger and bigger commercial deals.How do you break up that orthodoxy without money? You probably dont. Even before the TV money and big commercial deals ballooned success was still often dictated by investment. A relatively recent example would be Blackburn.You could also argue that the investment in City both with Shinawatra and the Abu Dhabi royalty and Chelsea has been hard on  clubs that would traditionally be bigger e.g. Arsenal Liverpool Spurs Villa Everton who may have qualified for Europe more often without their presence had an easier time retaining players and maybe even challenged for titles. So yeah I would say it was relatively unfair they were allowed to grow too fast and in a completely unchecked way without any regulation.But now the door is closed behind them they are part of the club of teams at the top it seems and noone else can ever do what they did. Which also isnt fair. I cant support uncontrolled spending but I also cant support something that essentially locks everyone in place forever.,reddevils,cq9ookp,4,t5_2rxse

3758663,0,t3_33gfjb,Theres so much in here that I agree with. But I just want to pick up on the last point. LVG has worked in many countries with players from diverse cultures. He understands more than most how to understand embrace and actually take advantage of cultural differences. I believe this experience also makes him more astute in terms of understanding what is needed from him in different cultural environments. This is not just applicable in terms of cultural differences with different countries but also within a city an organisation or a team. I think LVG is experienced and aware enough to understand how to handle himself in the already established culture that is Manchester United. Hell have a tried and tested process I imagine. He understands how he wants to change the culture of the club. And the first step to that is being aware enough of the existing culture and its implications. I dont feel Moyes had the experience to understand what would required of him in the Manchester United culture. He was quite naive in his understanding of how the culture SAF left behind would affect what he needed to do. If any of you have studied change management may be aware of Kotters eight steps of change. You change an organisations culture last after a careful process. I feel Moyes tried to do this the wrong way around due to his lack of experience. Working in Spain will help him. ,reddevils,cqkpr2s,10,t5_2rxse

Yeah I think we should be OK for the homegrown quota just something that will have to kept in mind. ,reddevils,cqrhpqh,1,t5_2rxse

4016083,0,t1_cre1zgw,Difference is that Di Maria is second right? on the assists board in the EPL and has loads of pace touch a magic to give. He just needs a little more defensive effort and to learn where he fits in LvGs system a little bit more and hell shine. Falcao had a terrible ACL injury to recover from which killed his agility and pace which he relied on and used to deadly effect in the past. He hasnt recovered that and while he looks somewhat improved over his last couple of appearances he hasnt added any other dimension to his game. He also has completely lost his first touch and just doesnt know where to go with the ball in our system. I think that without his agilitypace hes unfortunately a square peg in a round hole at United. ,reddevils,cre2b6n,3,t5_2rxse

We clearly want youth where we can afford to get it but you need balance.  You need a few senior players and we shipped off Evra Vidic and Rio.  Where are our experienced defenders giving an example to Jones and Shaw?  Alves would be a great pick up if were getting him on a free which I believe is the point because even if he gets  a week thatll be covered by the lack of transfer fee.

4226805,0,t3_39br9d,The world of betting on football transfers is a decidedly tricky one. When media companies such as Sky also have betting arms such as Sky Bet then the conflict of interest becomes obvious. Sky can publish stories online and have odds ready to click on with many supporters using Skys opinion or reporting to guide their betting judgement and believing that Sky may have inside information. The nature of transfer rumours means the majority of claims turn out to be nonsense and things can change by the day so at one point Sky can say a player is likely to go to club A and then change that to club B with the odds then changing to suit. Their own stories influence their audience to bet and then influence the odds and create more stories.Betfair and others face a similar predicament. With an absence of clear rules known well to both the betting company and customer the reliability and weight of interest can be a concern. Even if those involved are acting in the best possible way it can still create a conflict and influence people to part with money they otherwise wouldnt have done. Bwin showed another potential problem on Wednesday when they tweeted that they thought Ilkay Gundogan was set to join Manchester United. Bwin are a Manchester United sponsor a betting company and are sharing football news too. Quite conflicted. After sharing the news of Gundogan being likely to sign they tweeted the oddsWe were asked our opinion and replied with Bwin copied inTrying to get you to bet. Surely skating regulatory thin ice. And if not it should be.Bwin then deleted the first tweet and the later deleted the second. Perhaps its a good thing that they see something wrong. Still some Manchester United fans think that with Bwin being a sponsor they have inside information which again underlines the pitfalls of transfer betting.,reddevils,cs216fm,7,t5_2rxse

People are so desperate for players they just want something done. I prefer this way where no stupid rumours are leaked and the media making  a donkey on crack humping a Liverpool fan for fun. Of all the Liverpool signings Im not even chuffed by anyone they signed or are about to sign. Theyre still rather mediocre and their manager is still Rodgers. So theyre moving for clyne. Ok but it doesnt mean we arent nor does it mean we dont have someone else. Rojo wasnt a name people were aware of till we were linked. We could well do the same here. Schweinsteiger these deals dont happen overnight like the case of liverpools either as their players bought were all free and wouldnt even sniff our bench or so bar Milner. Yes we were told we want things before pre season tour. Has it started yet? No. Is it soon? Not even that close. So what the hell is up with these posts about  oh no my cat panicked because we arent buying left right centre. Sign Cech! Sign him. People want players who dont even fit our system. Its bordering on ridiculous now and its like everyone expects us to follow every club buying. Has Chelsea strengthened? No. Arsenal? Not yet. Bayern? No. Barca? One guy. Madrid? No. City? No. Liverpool? Big deal. Who cares about them? Apparently you and some others do. Theyre not buying the players we want. So what? Its immaterial whom they buy and even if they bought  players. We know who we want and weve talked to the players or teams in concern. Its just taking some time. But itll be done. And firmino? Big deal. He wont play for them for a long time because hes at the copa still. So even if we signed otamendi today it means nothing as he wont be at pre season at all. And so signing him later also has no impact because it doesnt change when he will play. ,reddevils,csi4rb0,3,t5_2rxse

4431979,0,t1_cspbfub,Yes it would have been ideal to get Shaw for less but fighting off Chelseas competition for a player who can be our starting LB for the next  years could prove to be a bargain in the long run. Paying  million to not have to worry about a position for that long is also something to be taken into consideration. Not many prospective talents at that age who are that promising. You also have to take into account the premium for British talent.You cant blame Woodward for Herrera. Its not like Woodward scouted him and told van Gaal he needed to make room. Woodward was told to get van Gaal and he got him at the only possible price.At the time of the Di Maria signing Di Maria was a top  player.

Schneiderlin is a wanted target and has two years left on his thatll drive the price up. Hes also rumored to move to a team in the same league price up. The club wants to keep him price up.gt but I just compare him to other names which have been mentioned Schweinsteiger Pogba Gundogan and in last window Strootman Fabregas and Kroos.Hes only really halfway comparable to Strootman in that list.

4484532,0,t1_csvwuo5,Have I been to a swap meat or garage sale and negotiated before? Sure I have. I know how the haggling process works. But that isnt always the case with sports clubs. They have an asset that they value at a certain price. If a buyer cant meet that price then they can move along. If a club needs money they arent going to over price a player anyway. That will just end with a no deal. When a player is priced fairly and what is normal for the marketplace then theres not a whole lot of need for squabbling over a few mil here or there. Especially with a club working with a purse of upwards to a couple hundred mil.Arsenal amp Pool didnt squabble back and forth over a couple mil. They made an offer or met the offer and finished deals quickly. No one is thinking them foolish for doing so.

4484851,0,t1_csvk4ww,I dont think thats how it works at all maybe that applies to City and PSG but I think every situation is different for example Mangala looked like on of the most promising CBs in the world when they paid what they paid for him thats the risk of overpaying for potential. But theres also the example of Chelsea who gets their signings done relatively fast and yet they get good prices. Even Liverpool even though they dont aim for the same elite players we are going for did their business relatively quickly and for normal prices.If a player is valued at a certain price things like years left on his contract the clubs urgency to sell the player agreeing personal terms and wanting the move etc all those things will affect the price but to say X club will sell Y player to United for m but would sell it to Roma for m is just bullshit.

There where few times where I got the impression that the goal he set up was what he intended to do. Anyone who watched him saw that his decision making and execution was terrible at times.

We invested far too little across the squad and unfortunately I think this was done because Fergie was able to get so much out of so little. Our squad went to shit from the moment Ronaldo left and its a shame how this side right now is probably the best since those days as we still have many holes within it but the funny thing is our issues have been reversed from recent years where our attack and attack has got worse whilst our midfield has been massively improved. ,reddevils,ct3j66q,1,t5_2rxse

4546321,0,t1_ct3ns8l,If my memory serves me right there were some sketchy rumors about Bastian joining us over the weekend but quickly followed up with Bayern president announcing it on the stage. For Morgan it was the bloodgate which I was skeptical but about  hrs later about  English journalists came out with the story at the same time. These are the kind of indications that a story has a substance. Even with the whole Ramos saga since the way the information came out were pretty strong I think theres some sort of truth to how we want Ramos in exchange to Dave. I do however believe that sporadic rumors should be taken with grain of salt.Im going to go ahead and skip your whole charade about Reddit voting system as I do not use it nor I care whatsoever because I sort posts and comments using new since I basically treat Reddit as a glorified community driven newsreader.

He likes to cut inside from his starting right wingforward role and most of his magic moments came in the center of the pitch. Unlike YoungDi Maria from other side he rarely crosses the ball in. He is a great joy to watch in the center of the pitch. I read in this sub that he is not used in the central role because he is too thinless physical of a player for LVGs liking.

4623570,0,t3_3eaw7k,Our values from Ferguson   Fast paced attacking football    Never overpaying for a footballer always pay his value or close to it   Building a strong core of young players youth team and foreign starters   Core englishbritish spine or talents   Finding potential players that have massive upside diamonds in the rough that can be trained and taught the Utd way.    No emphasis on marquee players. We have our squad of local lads and young talent that have trained for years with the club and we are as good as the Reals or Barcelonas. Every now and then we may splurge on a marquee signing but not something that is our main goal.        Never criticizing players in public massive respect for coach two way respect   Loyalty staff working for long periods of time   Freedom and Enjoyment when it comes to playing. A strong conviction to combine winning and entertaining the fans.  Never giving up until the final whistle.  We had Moyes after winning the league comfortably I believe City were behind us by  points then all of a sudden we accepted this myth that players were not good enough. Moyes permeated this myth and started this trend for marquee signings. Trying to get Bale for record fees. Ended up paying massively for Mata and Fellaini. Also fractured continuity sacked backroom staff immediately putting his men there.LVG comes in with his own values Spend as much as necessary to acquire marquee talent marquee talent seen as worlds best Criticize players in public everyone follows strictly orders or faces being sold  Systematic football to extreme when it works it looks so easy when it doesnt comes off very very boring No interest in players that committed their loyalties to Utd. Welbeck sold after  games. Cleverly same. Rafa Sold Fabio too. Kagawa did he even play any games. Basically dismantling a squad. Playing favorites in unorthodox positions Blind must always play if not in the middle as left back or now as CB Rooney must always play if not in attack then in the middle or if not even in defense Spending obscene amounts selling for peanuts. To be fair weve always been selling for peanuts since Sir Alex but it wasnt as bad as this. No interest in going for more goals score  and play safe more importance in winning than risk. Decimating the core of britishness left under Sir Alex. Utd under LVG is now a proper european club. This may not matter much to some but its important in the sense that you get players that can easily adapt to the social atmosphere whether lodging family etc have some affinity to the area or club via youth training can stay for years Rafa stayed for  years I believe  Ironically the same folks that are celebrating solksjaers signing for Utd could not have possibly signed such a player in this era.,reddevils,ctddijk,9,t5_2rxse

He gets caught up the field easily as well.He gives the ball away easily and his passing isnt that good. When the ball is at his feet I fully expect it to be given away. He just seems lost and confused as to what to do. He also looks like he should be far faster than he is  hes got such long legs he could be a gazelle or something!

We all dream of a game won entirely through pieces of magic or brilliance or genuine jawdropping skill.However sadly the world isnt as ideal as that and usually games are won as I mentioned due to tiny margins or individual mistakes. Usually when big teams play against each other it will usually be won by someone making use of a mistake sweeping generalisation here as sometimes it is the magic that wins games this is where pace is an excellent weapon when it comes to capitalising on these mistakes and a quick forward player can get in behind the defence and win the game.Creativity is useful as in games where the gulf between the teams is usually quite big top of the table team playing bottom of the table The reason it is useful here is that the smaller team will sit back and defend and not let any space between players AKA parking the bus so a player who can create space or pull players out of position will eventually break down the resiliance of the smaller team draw out a mistake and win the game.So it all depends on the game and circumstance but hopefully that gives an idea into how they are our main faults?,reddevils,ctlmc7w,5,t5_2rxse

4756635,0,t1_ctu30j3,Hi there the podcast is brought to you by members from Man United forum redcafe.net. We began the podcast in July last year under the name Football Bloody Hell! and have come back after the summer rebranded as United Hour. There are six regular panelists and we occasionally have guests from the forum on too. I James hosted this episode and we had Nik and Imran as the panelists. You can find out more about us on our new website at ,reddevils,ctu4b01,1,t5_2rxse
4757535,0,t1_ctu85h4,I agree we need an elite CB. But who is world class? I dont rate Otamendi much more than our current group especially not at the prices that were rumored. If Ramos were actually available Id be all for it. However there literally is not much out there in terms of CBs. The young ones have been scooped up in past years and this year Otamendi is like the only one on the market. Our current group is good enough and possibly great we really dont know but they need time and well see. If there isnt a MUST BUY then save the money for next summer. I reckon a lot more people will be willing to move following the Euro. ,reddevils,ctu8dzp,9,t5_2rxse

4770665,0,t3_3g8qa6,Really encouraging match to me we clearly lacked fitness but given the circumstances Im happy. The result was more important than the performance for me today. Going forward we werent at our best but there were bright sparks from YoungMata and especially Memphis when he managed to click a few times. Defensively I was impressed. Blind dealt well with Spurs considering his weaknesses and Smalling dominated Spurs attackers completely.Romero was a pleasant surprise bar some iffy distribution early on good reflexes and strong in crosses.Darmian and Shaw stood out too think theyre on course to become truly world class.  Only players id say looked off a bit were Carrick and Rooney but theyre traditionally players who need a little longer to come back.Massively impressed with Schneiderlein too defensively he was all over the pitch. Schweinsteiger and Herrera were relatively quiet but solid.,reddevils,ctvvvmk,1,t5_2rxse

4842296,0,t1_cu4whut,Sorry but I disagree. Smallings doing great but he isnt near Rios level yet even back then. He had a shaky start to the season when he joined but he was one of the best defenders in the league easily when we bought him. Theres a reason he cost m back then. Schneiderlin and Darmian are great but they are nowhere near prime Gary and Keane. Nowhere near at all.My point in mentioning Scholes Giggs Beckham etc. is to highlight the fact that the team in all other areas was much better in midfield  defense back then than it is now. Scholes  Beckham  Giggs all did defensive work too silly to dismiss that. That team had years of chemistry and years of working together as a unit. Its all well and good talking about the players we have on paper but until they start playing well as a Unit I will remain adamant about the need for us to have a brilliant keeper.The team now is still very fresh playing a new style of football with shitloads of new players. We are a lot more volatile now than our previous title winning teams. Were also struggling massively the past year to create chances in attack so its very very very important that we dont concede goals. The tactics now are completely different to under Fergie. If we go a goal behind now then we really struggle to get back in the game because of the lack of chances we create. Under Fergie going a goal behind wasnt that big of a deal because we knew chances would come after no matter what.I do agree that we wont need De Gea as much this season as we did last season but when was the last time a team won the league with an average keeper?,reddevils,cu4wprs,2,t5_2rxse

4844515,0,t1_cu4g459,I think a lot of people have judged Rooney for a long period of time the past  years to be exact. I think he still has something to add. But I do not believe he should be relied upon to start every match. He should be able to be dropped in favor of Hernandez Wilson or a new striker perhaps. I had a hard time accepting when Giggs was no longer the menace on the left wing that he used to be its hard to see players get older and lose some of the ability that made them the best. I think we are seeing that with Rooney now he is a shadow of the player he was in  and thats not just form but many facets of his game. Like Giggs he should remain as part of the club and be given rest and games off at this stage. Its a tricky situation if LVG views Rooney as undroppable are we going to settle for an entire season of Rooney being mediocre as our striker if that continues? Im not saying throw Rooney out just be willing to change things around if he is not performing. ,reddevils,cu56re5,1,t5_2rxse
4845482,0,t3_3h6s5h,gtgtSo if Rooney could just get a consistent role in the field with great service from our playersFalcao and RVP never had service but both were blamed by Fans for their poor attacking services. We have to persist because Rooney is untouchable under Van Gaal. In my opinion Rooney is not playing any differently than he was last season. Maybe his touch is a bit worse but nothing has changed really. What has happened is that Rooney is experiencing what it feels like for a team to completely ignore its strikers for a team not to create more than one or two chances per game. Rooney still hustles and chases down players he still passes and actually is more privileged than other strikers RVP Falcao in that they were consistently ignored while Rooney ALWAYS gets the ball passed to him. Like others say he doesnt make runs anymore or to be more accurate he runs backwards he drops deep to try and run into the box but theres no more valencia providing them crosses. ,reddevils,cu5b59g,2,t5_2rxse

4942745,0,t1_cuhk9aa,gt He slows up every counter attackWere not an especially counterattacking team anymore though. I think is as much to do with how LVG wants him to play and the fact that he hasnt had the movement ahead of him to thread balls through to. gt constantly cuts in rather than go wide and crossHes a left footer on the right wing so hes naturally going to cut inside. This creates overloads in central areas and allows our fullbacks to overlap out wide. Its a feature of many teams and I personally like it in our team. gt He loses the ball often enough by getting outmuscledI constantly see this levelled at him but I never see evidence that he does this more than any other attacking player. gt often forgets to do his defensive dutiesHe was the hardest working player in the team last season  and I mean that literally. He covered more ground on average per game than any other player and it wasnt even close. He doesnt shirk his defensive duties ever. gt We definitely need a better RW. Thats not to say Mata is a bad player but anyone can see he would be of better use if he was played in a more central position.Im torn on this. Id love to see Herrera get a run behind the striker even if that means keeping Mata out on the right. But Mata is our most intelligent technically gifted and creative attacker we have at the moment so Id also love to see him get a chance in his best position. ,reddevils,cuhkm7r,1,t5_2rxse

4979166,0,t1_cum3u9m,Im actually a fan of Moyes and think he would have done a good job. With that being said I think the team he set up and the way he set them up was built for short term success that put up points against the smaller clubs but couldnt cope with any of the more competent teams. I think that the foundation that Van Gaal is building will be crucial for long term success and is more rigid against the talented teams both in the PL and CL. I also think that having the most injuries in the league last season by a fair amount didnt help van Gaals cause. We were only a few points off second down the stretch despite all the injuries but couldnt cope with the holes in our team in the end. Had we kept up form towards the end of the season then we would be singing a different song right now. Ill hold my judgment on him until after this season. ,reddevils,cum5tjx,1,t5_2rxse

They were arguably one of the better teams in the league and yet failed to even contest for top  year in year out.

5020644,0,t3_3jozek,Exactly right. He is pretty woeful under pressure amp in tight situations atm. Poor close control heavy touch poor passingvision poor decision making cant hold the ball up and bring others into play. Even his finishing is suspect. Hed be a horrendous  and not much better up front so the only other option is RW. Which is fine  Mata would love to play centrally with  speed merchants either side of him  but I get the feeling that LVG wont even try it. And from what Ive seen his best position is clearly LW which is another slight curiousity considering we have already bought a young raw unproven athletic goalscoring LW. Did we just buy a younger Memphis for double the price?The more I watch him the more Im concerned that this could be the dumbest transfer the football world has ever seen. It genuinely could be  years before he is even a moderately productive PL footballer. Wouldnt surprise me if he gets loaned out as early as next season.,reddevils,cur6gl9,-16,t5_2rxse

5105655,0,t1_cv1e7h8,Well in the spirit of full disclosure Id like to confess that Im of a slightly pessimistic nature myself and have had my fair share of critiques about LvGs manmanagement and riskaverse football. Even had major doubts about Blind at CB. But whats a girl gotta do when the man in question keeps putting in  performances match after match? Its come to a stage where even a slight wobble by him would have a chorus of Itoldyousos being belted out of the fanbase when a bigger mistake by Smalling Darmian or Shaw would be brushed off as a oneoff. As far as Mata is concerned I seriously feel hes regressed since his Chelsea days. Has all the talent to be a fantastic playmaker but has just settled on being a final ball merchant instead. And while I havent been all that impressed with our football this season under no circumstances would I argue the fact that were in a much better place now than we were when Fergie retired. Almost for man to man. Still very much a work in progress and my only question is whether LvG would be the man to put the finishing touches on this squad. ,reddevils,cv1f77w,8,t5_2rxse

5116195,0,t3_3l2w6d,Not doing badly so far  the tempo that PSV have played in possession has almost seemed to lift our own especially coming into the latter stages of the half. We were struggling at times to play it out from the back with PSVs high press along with our insistence to pass it to feet causing us to lose the ball in key areas several times early on. This has however also given us opportunities to break down the fewer numbers left at the back. Would like to see us get the ball up the field slightly earlier as both Martial and Depay in particular have been hanging on the PSV line to try and get the ball in behind. In our attacking half we have left the opposition with the problem of have to drop deep and conceding some ground for us to play the ball around in front of the defence. That said their defensive line has been relatively open given how deep they have been and more balls like the one played by Blind leading to Memphis goal needs to be played in between defenders. Thats the sort of first touch that makes Memphis dangerous running at goal  taking the ball in front of him with his initial forward momentum. In terms of our defending probably the best move to have Rojo in the centre and shift Blind wide especially as De Jong looked to try and receive the ball aerially from the left side. We also need to be more careful not to rush into pressing a man  PSVs combinations and quick tempo reminiscent of Dortmund have dragged our men around and opened up space for the relatively faster PSV players to run into. If Narsingh had been smarter with his runs he could have been through on a number of occasions.,reddevils,cv2oya9,2,t5_2rxse

5190113,0,t1_cvbl5lv,By making it incredibly difficult to get some worthwhile players in FUT. You get about  coins per game so only those who play the game religiously and are really good at trading gets the best players. In a way thats fair and shows who the good players are but those who dont play FIFA all the time are more likely to buy packs as shortcuts to better players but even then you arent really guaranteed to get good players. So after spending  euros on FIFA points and getting Turan as your best player it leaves you with a bitter taste. I know that this is the way the game works but I just dont like it. As a casual player I just feel forced into buying packs thats why I wont buy it.

Usually when youre controlling a ball from that range and height you tend to use the top of your toe or foot to cushion it down. Mata put it dead using the bottom of his foot which is far more difficult especially since he doesnt even trap the ball just kills the ball.

5250715,0,t3_3mx27g,The role of Mata in our system is not to give crosses. He plays as a pivot for the fullback to bomb thru and get a cross. Those lovely triangles we play with the fullback mata and the CMs. He drifts to the middle and tries to play like an out of position . This is used to create the extra player in the middle with either Rooney or Martial slightly getting wider from the centre starting from the edge of the box. A short cross in and they can score. Actually him and the actual  keep swapping those runs from the edge of the box. Rooney drops and mata runs and so on. He is also for getting hold of those crosses which go way ward like the last game.At the moment if you notice Mata is playing really well. Even few games back he did miss some really good chances.

5288981,0,t1_cvnpbe0,Youve literally agreed with me and have only worked to emphasise my point.Every attribute you mentioned there directly relates to Carricks ability as a footballer.Hes a conductor he keeps the ball. Players around him are elevated because of his consistency on the ball. You also mentioned Xavi and made two more football related points. Ball retention and great distribution.Those skills are totally different than inspiring the entirety of the squad with your mere presence on the field. Carrick doesnt stand around like the second coming of Jesus staring deep into the eyes of his teammates and propelling them towards titlewinning glory.Players play better when Carrick plays well.What the OP is trying to argue is that the rest of the squad succeed because of Rooneys mere aura as a leader regardless of the quality of his individual performances.When Rooney misses chances the team performs worse. When Rooney slows down attacks the team performs worse. When Rooney takes too much time to control a simple pass the team performs worse. When Rooney gives the ball away or chooses a poor pass the team performs worse.Just because Rooney tends to hop about furiously every time a referee decision goes against us doesnt somehow mean hes a special leader nor does it compensate for the lack of quality in his performances over the last six months.,reddevils,cvnqa6f,5,t5_2rxse

He was never given the licence to roam that he had yesterday. .... so your logic is to ignore how we played yesterday because we didnt always play like it last season? Oh dear.gtWeve been playing a double pivot all season which is two DMs and a No.AM. Just because he was linking up on the right doesnt change the fact that its still essentially a .Heres a couple of facts for you Herrera spent most of his time on the right side of the pitch Mata spent most of his time on the right side but higher up. Schneiderlin spent most of his time inline with Herrera on average with Schweinsteiger playing deeper. Nobody played a single AM nobody played  nobody played second striker thus it was a . Those are fact anybody can see by looking at heatmaps  and touchmaps both of which show different points and end up showing the above. gtEven LVG refers to the role of Herrera as no. in this systemgtLVG on Herrera at No. last monthI started this season with Herrera as number  so it is possibleLove the fact youre posting irrelevant quotes.

Perhaps if Rojo wasnt terrified to attack after being at fault for that penalty by at fault I mean he was far too advanced and outofposition.But being doublemarked with no additional help on the wing I really dont blame him.  EDIT and come to think of it if youre going to knock Martial you need to knock Lingaard too.  He struggled as a winger to hit many crosses at all and even dribbling when he beat a man he failed to do much of note. All of attack on the right came when Valencia funnily enough a very competent wingback came up to aid him on the wing.  Funny that isnt it?,reddevils,cw8q77z,2,t5_2rxse

5463411,0,t3_3pwk9f,Bastian Schweinsteiger admits he cannot wait to sample his first taste of the Manchester derby having missed out on a competitive innercity rivalry while playing for Bayern Munich.Despite making  firstteam appearances for Bayern Munich  where he won countless major honours including eight Bundesliga titles and the Champions League  Schweinsteiger has a surprisingly limited knowledge of derbies and one city having two major clubs living side by side.In fact during his  seasons at Bayern Bastian only made two competitive appearances against the clubs innercity neighbours  Munich and they were over a decade ago quite simply because  have played their football in Germanys second tier ever since the  season.His first appearance against  arrived a few months after his Bayern debut as a substitute during a thumping  triumph in February . The following season he then sat on the bench for a  win before playing a full match during another  victory in the reverse fixture later that campaign. were relegated from the Bundesliga in May  and have not been promoted since. They were later drawn against Bayern in the DFB Cup in February  although Bastian did not feature in that extratime win that was secured by Franck Riberys dramatic th minute penalty.As Schweinsteiger recently explained during an exclusive interview withUnited Review the official matchday programme he constantly yearned for the atmosphere of a local derby while playing for Bayern which is why hes excited to face Manuel Pellegrinis Blues at Old Trafford on Sunday.Asked if he had noticed the rivalry between United and City on the streets of Manchester during his first few months in England Basti told us Not really just yet but I am definitely looking forward to the derby against City. I think it is something very special and we should be very happy that we have two big clubs in one city that are also playing in the Champions League.I remember when I was in Munich we were always looking for that but the other team at  Munich didnt play so well!

5538633,0,t3_3qzd0c,Ander has been absolutely atrocious the last few games I feel he has only been playing due to merit of his Everton performance. He wasted two good opportunities today the first where he scuffed the ball completely and fell. The second when he looked for the penalty he should have been booked for that pathetic dive. Darmian is completely exposed against fast strong wingers and he is a wasted sub he should be coming on later in the game when the wingers are tired. He also offered nothing going forward today which is why Young got MOTM I feel. Young actually pressed with the ball and made direct runs and was probably our best player which is sad. I think what Id like to see next game provided Valencia and Jones are fit is V at RB and Jones on for Blind who seemed to waste passes today Ander off and used as a sub Rooney playing in Anders spot as a true only due to the fact that he cant be dropped Id rather Mata be here. Martial as our CF and Mata on the right with Lingard ready to be subbed on and honestly Id like Memphis to be given another chance on the left. Putting Rooney on the left toward the end of the game was absolutely pointless could have given Memphis a shot at regaining his confidence. The only benefit of this was it allowed Martial to play more directly. Fellaini was a wasted sub also whats the point in him playing if he isnt going to bother jumping for headers?

5583767,0,t1_cwp6fm2,I dont think this is the style LvG wants us to play. You mentioned Alaba ending up in the middle of the pitch. When Shaw was playing you could often see him going to the middle of the pitch even running into the box. That is where he got injured. LvG cant give the same freedom to Rojo because he is not physically capable to track back from there. Still as he gets fitter hell go further up the pitch which was evident in the last game. Similarly with Darmian he used to go very far up the pitch even in the middle of the park. IIRC this was what caused the first goal in the PSV game. But since the Arsenal game I think Darmians confidence has taken a blow.

5779598,0,t1_cxdiccc,The real question is what game did you watch. The only reason people still wouldnt be satisfied with yesterday and recently is because of how awful he was earlier into the season. Clearly its clouding your judgement because he wasnt anywhere close to being bad against PSV. The long balls were clearly a shit tactic from LVG. His ball control was fine overall and ended up creating a chance for us. And if youre thinking of bad decision making then clearly you mistook him for Memphis or Schneiderlin. And the leadership point is bullshit. He just came back from illness after missing a match and still him and Lingard were the only ones who looked bothered to freaking run as we approached the th min.

5783117,0,t1_cxdxj5k,In this regard though the guy has lived and breathed football for nearly his entire life. Hes played football at a pro level. Hes coached some of the biggest teams in the world. Hes won all manner of trophies. Not only that. He knows more than any of us. He sees the training. He sees the players on the pitch. He talks to them he has an understanding of where there heads are at. Even with an endless amount of research he knows more than we ever will. Hes got his own constraints that we know nothing about. Ive had a small suspicion part of the reason he doesnt bench Rooney is people above him want him to break the Manchester United goal record because that will attract attention and money. I dont know or anything and its more tinfoil hat. But even then there are constrictions put on him from up above that we dont know about. Last season he had Jones take a few corners in some games and they didnt result in much. People laughed at him for it. Put him down for it. They have no idea if Jones banged in some AMAZING corners in practice but then he cracked a little bit when trying it in an actual game and LVG stopped it. I mean I get what youre saying I honestly do. I work in a job with bosses who seem absolutely clueless and by no means are infallible. But at least to me it feels very difficult to take the word of random people here over him. EDIT because I want to say. Im by no means saying dont question him. Dont talk about him. Dont say Why doesnt he do this? Thats discussion and thats great.

Which is how they beat all the other top teams so far?So guarantee you if we did get more adventurous we would probably have scored  but Leicester would have scored .

Watch the Leicester game again. We have very little quality in attack to make those kind of Bayern plays at the moment. None of our top  would get into their team maybe with the exception of Martial.

And even close the case...?!I am aware that unfortunately most people only notice the attacking aspect or at best some tackle of a game when they judge individual performances. Which is why forward and attacking midfielders are usually the most appreciated both when it comes to who is the best player in the world? but also about favorites within a single team Mata and Herrera being good examples.But when the first thing you pick when looking at a defender of whether they can make a good pass forward especially in a game when they essentially play the role of a DM we got a problem.,reddevils,cxk5272,2,t5_2rxse
5832374,0,t3_3v15ny,gtVan Gaal thinks Spain and Guardiolas teams are less effective and fun than they can be. Their problem Van Gaal thinks is that they try to gain possession in situations when the opponents defence is well organised. This results in horizontal or back passes and mindnumbing ballhoarding. Less fun to watch he toldDe Voetbaltrainer.So he prefers a different style one which he has given yet another curious name to provocative pressing. By this he means that he will not press the opponent immediately after losing possession. Instead he will yield the opponent some time and space provoking them into surrendering possession higher up the pitch. Then his team quickly passes vertically in order to profit from the space behind the opponents defence  see for example the second goal against Chile in the group stage of the World Cup.The way we are  currently playing under LVG contradicts everything said in these lines.Anyways a very enlightening read which explains a lot about the way LVG sees and plays football.

5844154,0,t1_cxlnwa3,Understand completely but each manager can play different styles. Its not all about wingers and last minute winners. Last minute winners isnt even big for the teams you mentioned because most the time theyve suffocated the game out by then. I dont think were actually that far behind City RM and Barca. I know that sounds stupid but hear me out.When LVG took over our defence was absolutely horrendous anyone who was able to resist the urge to put our mug through the TV when watching the Moyes team would have seen how bad our defending was. Even most of last season with De Gea being the star man we were poor in defence. Now we go into this season where LVG has had a pre season and more time to develop the defence surprisingly the only unit that didnt change over the summer and now they are the best in the league. Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin both new signings. Depay Martial and Lingard all new faces to the front . These players do not look like they have bedded into the team yet. I believe the atrocious attacking football is not completely down to the system itself but there is a shared blame.However I will pick a flaw which I think means LVG isnt the right person long term which he wont be anyway. His football in attack is very one dimensional. He doesnt seem to take the other teams tactics into account on any occasion and the only way we look any different is when Fellaini is put on. It means that as long as a team is very well drilled Im defence its impossible for us to break through. We dont have the balls over the top or the movement that we need to be world class in attack and I think thats exactly why we need someone like Guardiola who is also incredibly heavy tactically but also very good in attack to take over. I dont think what LVG has done for the club should be held in vain on a business stand point hes saved us a lot of money and had the bottle to tell players to get on if they werent good enough not a lot of managers are capable of doing a complete rebuild like he has and I feel he doesnt get the credit he deserves for it,reddevils,cxlp183,2,t5_2rxse

We thought that it clicked during that stretch of important wins last season but he has moved away from that completely this season.Leaving us with such a small squad is entirely his fault. Its common sense to want a bigger squad to deal with Champions League. Instead hes gone the other way and hoped that we survived without injuries. This while seeing how bad we were for them last year. No you wont get top class players to come and sit on the bench. However sacrificing a bit of quality for not having to throw kids into our most important game this season is acceptable. We put on Powell a guy who was reportedly disillusioned with football a few months ago after a dreadful loan to Leicester.

5898149,0,t1_cxsru1p,Yeah I agree. Varela has played so far like he deserves to be a part of the first team for good and he might develop into a solid starter. CBJ is three four years younger but he looks like he can be a good backup to Shaw when he comes back. I think he can slot in in the middle too so hell be a versatile player to have around. Jesse was pretty bright in the first half but I dont think hell ever be a regular starter. Hell be pace off the bench or a jack of all trades across the front  and maybe an emergency fullback. He also seems like a great locker room guy so hes a younger local version of Ash. With Powell who knows. I wrote him off as gone like everyone but apparently hes come back super focused from his injury. No denying he had and probably still has amazing potential so if hes shown enough in training to get a crack over Pereira and Ashley Young maybe theres some hope for him.Edit ages,reddevils,cxss4mf,2,t5_2rxse
5898395,0,t3_3w2bnl,Id really disagree that yesterday was a Moyes like game. Want to know why we conceded yesterday seemingly every attack? Fellaini. He plays best in a three man midfield or as a No. . Playing him as a N.  was silly and he clearly had no idea where he was playing half the time. I get he wanted to bench Carrick if Bastian is out but wed be better of playing him in a much bigger game like yesterday and risk it against a smaller team than what we did.Now were in a weird position with Carrick having played minutes. Hopefully Herrera is back but I wont hold my breath and if he isnt we need to play someone like Goss or even dip more into the academy. The upcoming game this weekend is going to have quite a bit of attack on their end and Fellaini could present a real problem for us if we play him there. ,reddevils,cxstaew,1,t5_2rxse

5919447,0,t1_cxv8vl3,gtWell find ourselves in a downward spiral if we fall to rd seed next yearItll be way worse if we dont get into the CL next year. We increase the risk losing out on a huge chunk of sponsorship money and we will lose out on CL revenue. There is a chance of Italy overtaking England in coefficients this year which reduces CL places to . There are  clubs in the PL competing for those  spots this year. Country coefficients are averages and measure the average performance of all teams from a particular country. There are currently more English teams out of Europe  compared to Italian teams  and this means that they have a higher potential to gain points over us. We are currently . points ahead of them but that could quickly change if English teams get knocked out of EL because they will likely also prioritize the PL over EL. Arsenal and City usually get knocked out in the second round while Chelsea are in horrendous form and will likely suffer the same fate. I can honestly see Italian teams doing well in EL and CL particularly if they get favorable draws. Heres the worst case scenario Italy can overtake England in the very next round. Clubs be it EL or CL are given  coefficient points for a win. If all Italian clubs win both their matches and we all lose both of ours next round they will all gain  points which translates to  coefficient points while well gain . The . point advantage we have will be wiped out instantly thats how narrow the margins are. Our chances of winning the EL and getting into the CL that way is very low considering the quality of teams still in it. Getting rd seed is trivial considering the above. Our primary target should still be to get into the CL by concentrating on the league and ensure we finish in the top . Our thin injury prone squad simply cannot handle  competitions at the same time. Losing out on CLsponsorship money narrow margins in country coefficients and having  clubs compete for  spots this year means we cannot afford to evenly split our focus on Europe and league. ,reddevils,cxvkkd1,0,t5_2rxse

5923821,0,t3_3wgyte,Full articlegtRyan Giggs and Swansea City appear to be flirting with each other via the media if reports are correct. The Independents Mark Ogden had the exclusive and claimed Swansea City eager to speak with Manchester United assistant boss about replacing Garry Monk which was quickly followed up by claims Giggs would be open to the idea.gtA Giggs exit could be good for all involved. Perceptions are often deceiving but he doesnt appear to be the happiest of assistant managers at the moment. He rarely speaks theres no enthusiasm jumping out of him and if were being entirely honest he does occasionally have the look of someone who doesnt want to be there. gtThen theres the Class of  dynamic. Its hard when some are actually coaching and others doing punditry. Gary Neville is now off at Valencia and you can be sure Paul Scholes will be gentle in any criticism with him just as he would be Giggs but hes happy to tackle Van Gaal as rashly as he made challenges on the pitch. gtThat makes it harder for Van Gaal because theres an assumption Scholes must be hearing things from his friends. Add to that the Class of  punditry hangerson and its a difficult dynamic at the best of times. gtShould Giggs get the Swansea job then that leaves Manchester United an assistant manager down it would be assumed Van Gaal would bring in a replacement and the most obvious choice is Patrick Kluivert. gtWhen Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf got their scoop of Van Gaal taking over at Manchester United they assumed Kluivert would be going with him. The two had been together with the Dutch national squad and at AZ with things going well.gtKluivert himself said that hed be honoured to take the assistant job but things changed. gtDutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad explained that intense talks led to Manchester United pressuring Van Gaal to include not only Ryan Giggs but also Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt in roles at the club.gtVan Gaal had wanted to bring in his own backroom team said AD but Manchester United didnt want to make similar mistakes as what they thought happened with David Moyes so wanted to have former players heavily involved. gtGiggs got the assistant job Butt coaches at the club Scholes missed out... which may well explain a few things. gtKluivert is an easygoing guy and there were no hard feelings he told The Guardian in March of this year Louis wanted to have Ryan Giggs in my position and I could understand his decision  he wanted someone who knows the club very well. He also said to me Patrick its now time for you to stand on your own feet and thats why I didnt join Manchester United. So I have made a different step towards the top and I see it as a perfect one towards being head coach of a good club team. It is a nice challenge and Im taking it very seriously  it has come at the perfect moment for me.gtThe  year olds ? Get him on the Old Trafford pitch never mind the bench! next step was managing Curaao the country of his mothers birth. Kluivert is happy but hes got to believe hes capable of so much more and a chance of Premier League experience with Van Gaal would surely be appealing just as it was before Giggs got the post ahead of him.,reddevils,cxw5796,10,t5_2rxse

5937487,0,t1_cxxwgrt,I just dont understand how people can claim that theyre glad hes injured. I remember there was a whole post dedicated to it a few weeks ago. Cant anyone see we play equally as awful regardless of the lineup? Its LVGs system thats the problem. Not the players on the pitch.This sub in a nutshellWere not scoring because its only  months into LVGs reign! year laterIts because Shaw is injured! completely forgetting that our best period of playing well was a  game run after Blind was at LB during last seasons win vs spurs. Its possible that we can play well without Shaw.after another shit performanceWere not scoring because Martial isnt upfront!Martial moves upfrontWere not scoring because Rooney is in CAM!Rooney gets injuredWere not scoring because player x isnt on!I bet anything when Herrera and Schweinsteiger are back keep in mind we didnt play well when they were in the squad either people will blame someone else.Rooney off the bench certainly wouldnt have been a bad option against Wolfsburg or Bournemouth. Especially at Bournemouth where Mata put on a disappearing act in the first half. How many more months will it take for people to realise that were struggling to score because LVG is defensive. The people blaming injuries forget that this is how badly weve always been playing.,reddevils,cxxxo3x,10,t5_2rxse
5939232,0,t1_cxxi4zf,Agreed. I maintain that a proper CB should be brought in and transition Blind back into the midfield. His passing and vision is splendid and hes got defensive capabilities to play in that DM position.We could either double him up with Morgan for more quickness and passing from the midfield or join him with Bastian and Ander for a sweet triangle.Either way I see him as added depth for the midfield. And that is where our transitional offense should originate. Feed the runners when they can otherwise dish out to wingers and keep the momentum moving forward. Smalling needs another strong and reliable CB to hold that backline.,reddevils,cxy5wfe,1,t5_2rxse

The two teams are set to meet at Old Trafford on Dec. .Some around United are also maintaining that Van Gaal will be given at least two games to try turn it around with a fixture against Stoke next up on Boxing Day but the conflicting accounts offered by those inside the club reflect the uncertainty of the current situation. ,reddevils,cy6jil9,37,t5_2rxse

Memphis has promise and was probably worth his price tag.But our scouting needs to be better. We want a mix of one or two world class signings and then younger players with world class potential either brought up from the youth team or brought in from elsewhere.,reddevils,cy6vwwh,1,t5_2rxse

Reevaluate training methods so that players arent picking up muscle injuries so easily I think hes done this a little bit after last season but still.... Tactically overhaul the entire thing.  I would start with something really simple.  .  Allow the front  to interchange and roam. Make sure youve got a holding player screening the defense Morgan Schneiderlin!  a linking player Bastian  Carrick   a more attacking player Herrera.  Standard back four nothing crazy.   Honestly this is so simplistic it hurts to write but sometimes going back to basics is really key. Right now United are so focused on possession and strict static movements it just isnt working. Let the players roam and let them express themselves. Theyll make enough good decisions.. I would show the media that Im not down and out. LVG has to stand up and start to show some belief in himself again and start to command those press conferences like he used to.  This is so important because the media will pounce on ANY moment of weakness. . I would consider buying a striker in January and selling Wayne Rooney.  Look I know this isnt popular but Rooney is absolutely gone. Its time to move on from him. Hes on astronomically high wages and doing absolutely nothing.  The tactics of LVG arent helping but Rooney wasnt exactly setting the world on fire under Moyes either and clearly SAF saw a declining star before he left getting Rooney to play off the striker etc.,reddevils,cydvlc6,1,t5_2rxse

Also he wouldnt fuck up the youth focus. Who says Simeone couldnt come? And Hughes wouldnt be that great of a gamble considering how hes turned things around at Stoke so far. Lolll my point is with Jose as manager the board wont give a fuck about revamping the youth system. The reason it was so great in the past is because SAF had a strong youth philosophy and demanded a strong academy in return. Mourinho or a better youth system you really cant have both. One or the other,reddevils,cyfg68o,1,t5_2rxse
6071867,0,t1_cyeyrf2,yeah but what Im saying is you need to create chances in order to score! if you see a team create no chances in a game you think this team is shit. If you see a team create lots of chances and get unlucky several times you think this team plays well but the strikers are too anxious. Of course scoring is the most important thing but generally you need to be playing well and then goals come.

Look down through the years with players like Philips Beattie and Benjani who all did well in similar circumstances.If his transfer to Crystal Palace goes through Ill be keeping an eye on him because if he does well there I wouldnt be against buying him in the same vein as us buying Sheringham as someone to come off the bench or to fill in to rest whoever our main striker is.

LVGs style doesnt guarantee a win the style is why were out of the CL and the COC you have to be versatile as a manager and we either pass it to martial and hope for the the best or play long balls up. I am also evaluating myself as well as the players. Because of that I am or maybe I should say was a successful manager. LVG said that after the Norwich loss does that sound like a man who was faith in his system.Youre under rating Di Maria massively he was one of the worlds best players when he joined the fact that his game has massively eroded as it was is shocking I think that he wanted to go after LVG lost faith in him. In LVGs system in the first season he was accommodating rvp when he was holding the team back and this season it has been rooney. Lingard is  he puts in a couple of good performances scores a nice goal and now we accept that as good enough its the same with young he will whip in so many crosses and will get praised so much for it . Welbeck was  when he left and we were still hoping his finishing would improve its the same thing with Lingard. LVG has literally had complete control and utd when he joined he had some pitches and carrington torn up and the us I think were also playing a different style of football  for all the trust Utd have placed in him so far this season he has been incredibly poor. LVGs incompetence to be flexible and move away from his system is the reason why were so poor you cant blame it all on injuries we have a good squad of players lvg just isnt using it to the best it can be .,reddevils,cz66zpu,1,t5_2rxse

Although I will admit he did try a more defensive approach in the games before being dropped but it ended up just exposing his lack of defensive ability. Usually opting for elaborate flair passes backheel volleys etc instead of safe ones which almost always resulted in loss of possession.  Pretending to be a younger Ronaldo in that he could take on  defenders and come out on top but hasnt ever really shown ability to beat one outside of the Brugge game.

I do agree that we need a better GK backup than we have now essentially Romero as Sam Johnstone is on loan at Preston and he doesnt cut it yet anyway and I always thought Lindegaard was a very capable GK to have as our second choice.Ill be very anxious if we lose DDG to injury at any point from now to the seasons end.,reddevils,czno6wk,1,t5_2rxse

6597827,0,t1_d01r47n,Dont get me wrong I think there are some serious deficiencies with our squad as well and they are far from blameless. A lot of them are underperforming past it or struggling to adapt. However I still think the players we have are capable of far more than theyre showing and a major part of that is LVGs selection and tactics. Hes persisted with this  all season maintaining the two man defensive shield no matter who the opposition are. Hes been playing our best attacking player out of position for weeks to accommodate Rooney who has been totally out of form until recently and who I still think isnt exactly tearing shit up hes just finally started scoring a few. I find his substitutions absolutely baffling and he never seems to respond to whats happening on the pitch  I was screaming at the TV in the Chelsea game because they had tweaked their formation and were battering us for the last  minutes but he made like for like changes and kept on Mata who is fucking useless when trying to hang on to a lead. Injuries have certainly played their part and weve been desperately unlucky with our full backs in particular but the fact is we came into the season with two specialist full backs and that always had the potential to backfire. The rest of the players who can play there are either youth prospects or players out of their preferred position. Im not convinced wed be doing a whole lot better if we had Rojo at LB or Valencia at RB while Shaw and Darmian are out. As for the team not being connected and intuitive yet van Gaal himself said it typically takes  months for players to understand and adapt to his philosophy. Hes now had a year and a half and they still dont seem to get it. Either the players are the dumbest bunch hes ever worked with or his philosophy simply isnt working as well as hed hoped. A change is needed either way. Id hoped after the Stoke game that we might be going back to a more counter attacking style which our players seem to suit but the Sunderland game was a regression to the slow impotent possession weve seen all season.,reddevils,d01rp9t,17,t5_2rxse

6615234,0,t1_d03gw56,If you look at those players individually how many of them are specialist leftbacks? Definitely Shaw and Rojo the latter perhaps to a lesser extent as he has been split between LB and CB throughout his career although he has claimed to be more comfortable in the LB position.You could also make a case in favour of Blind who initially played as LB for Ajax. But under LVG he has been moved around a lot playing either as DM LB or CB for both MU and the Netherlands.On the other hand Darmian is a rightback while Ashley Young is a winger recently converted into leftback with limited success. While I agree that CBJ is doing solid work and has got potential we still dont know his ideal position just like Blind supposedly he can play DM LB or CB. Plus his recent emergence as a LB has been precisely the product of our injuries. Basically we have been forced to play him as LB and I doubt he was in LVGs mind at the beginning of the season.,reddevils,d03kl6a,5,t5_2rxse

Still under Moyes it looked like the team actually tried. the one game where it was a total capitulation was the  vs Liverpool but in the  vs City United looked like they really really tried but just did not have enough quality in midfield. So in that way I feel that if United waited  seasons with Van Gaal then they could have easily done with same for Moyes. Instead they panicked and sacked Moyes and are now thinking theyre setting something right by letting LvG stay on. ,reddevils,d05182i,7,t5_2rxse

PSG is broke theyve never won the Champions League Mourinho has twice. Ancelotti and Mourinho also have the same Champions League pedigree so I dont see how that changes anything. So yea City snubbed him because they clearly dont rate him. The decision to appoint him is reactionary not always the best kind of option.Edit Also from a quick Google search the BBC denies any contact between the two parties right before Madrid sacked Benitez.

6715376,0,t3_47m6cy,The key against Arsenal will be to win the midfield battle. Herrera and Schneiderlin have been quite good and theyre finally going to get some form going. The reason we got smashed  was because our midfield on the day of Carrick and Schweinsteiger were pedestrian as all hell. I think keeping the same lineup as the one that played today would prove to be the best bet. Lingard can help against Sanchez and if Schneiderlin or Herrera man marks Ozil their main threat will be neutralized.The only thing I would consider changing would be hoping that Rojo would be fully fit and he can slot in next to Blind but theyre both left sided center halves so who knows. The most ideal scenario would be to see Martial  percent fit and have him running in behind Mertesacker. ,reddevils,d0dxeus,10,t5_2rxse

Also just look at his history with DoF purchases if its not a player he wants he just freezes them out completly.

However weve been leaking too many goals lately and so I think Smalling should come back in. Not sure about who to play at LB I dont think it should be Darmian maybe TFM or if Rojos fit put him at LCB and Blind as LB.For me that means Martial Darmian and probably Carrick would start on the bench. Although barring injuries I think Id be keen that they all should get some game time.Edit Just realised CBJs not listed as injured if hes fit he should be the starting LB. Also Jones is due back so Id like to see him on the bench and get some time on the pitch later too if not starting. And I think if CBJs back I may rethink starting Varela and put Darmian back in at RB.

6859924,0,t1_d0tv23j,My point about Real Madrid was that the talent on that team meant that the entire team would literally have to stop playing for them to capitulate as much as Chelsea has. But it is undeniable that he did fall out with that dressing room because of his treatment of Casillas and Ramos. gt Brilliant. No titles for three years before or t all after but Mourinho couldnt fail could he?La Decima? Was there a massive change to Mourinhos squad that Ancelotti won with? Was Casillas not the starting GK that season? I never said he fell out with young players. I have posed this theory more eloquently before. Its not about the age they were when under Mourinho its about the current crop of young players. Hazard seemed to stop responding to Mourinho. Along with Costa and Oscar. I remember an article about Demba Ba saying working with Mourinho was draining. Players naturally seem to get tired of his methods. However for this new generation they usually dont have to deal with that level of abrasiveness and therefore are less responsive in the long term. I recall in the CO documentary Beckham mentioning that their class stopped hazing in the academy. Younger players today given what happened at Chelsea seem to get tired of his abrasive methods much easily than the older generation that grew up with abrasive coaches anyways. Azpilicueta and Oscar also both seemed to decline in form this season. Maybe thats indicative of no longer responding to the manager? Afterall they just won a league title. ,reddevils,d0tvquj,1,t5_2rxse

He also doesnt seem to have much of an ego about himself his ego and pride are about the club unlike LVG. Hes appropriately furious. He understands the expected valuereturn of an investment   million pounds gross have not been wisely spent. Uninterested in media bullshit disapproves of players communicating like apologist weaklings on social media.

Fuck off man. Ill take a one legged Valencia in a heartbeat. Remember that time when he strangled Sterling? Where the fuck was that? Take all the technicality from our side and we are nothing but a bunch of pussyfooted cunts thats what we are. Clyne was Cafu yesterday how did we allow them so much time on the ball? Give him a goddamned sliding tackle to make a point. Who does that? no fucking one. Even an injured Rafael took on  Pool players all by himself. Where the fuck was that?

6878396,0,t3_49yvko,I think at this point it is futile to deny the club is having an identity crisis. Since the departure of SAF it appears the board have tried to figure out a way to create a platform to replicate the level of success weve had under SAF. The initial strategy was to employ what seemed like a long term manager to continue with the brevity of SAF with the hope that a consistency of manager will recreate a consistency of success. Moyes immediately seemed out of his depth. Granted he was left with a relatively poor squad but he seemed to show no real initiative in rectifying the problems he had. Then an alternative approach was tried in the form of LVG. The plan seemingly being to implement a style of play thatll remain consistent and independent of the longevity of any one manager. A style than any manager could come in and continue from where a previous one left off with minimal change. What has become apparent is not that the idea was bad but that the man chosen might have been the wrong choice in bringing about that reality. A series of unlucky circumstances proving insurmountable as well. As LVG has pointed out it isnt uncommon for a club run relatively smoothly under the strength and leadership of SAF should come to a moment where they just arent quite the same. It is easy to point fingers and call the board inept but I still believe their motive was noble. A more successful tenure under LVG would have proven a difference maker in the future of Manchester United. However once again things havent gone as planned and the board must now restrategize. Mourinho could very well be the answer to bring about an immediate influx of success to quell what seems like the dying influence of the biggest club in England. It seems an immediate fix that will at least grant enough time for a more long term solution to be planned and successfully executed. But another failure in managerial appointment could very well mean the end of Manchester Uniteds dominance. At this point nothing is guaranteed but the hope is that the next manager seemingly Jose Mourinho turns things around. ,reddevils,d0vzabe,2,t5_2rxse

Not going to argue with the other  points but Im not too fussed about youth. If our first teamers werent injured and were performing well the youth shouldnt have a sniff.

Hes an outstanding player captain of one of the greatest teams in the world.  His experience and history of things hes won is practically unmatched.  Plus he played for LVG and he was nonconfrontational towards united legends whove arguably achieved less in their careers which stabalizes things as LVG tried to fit in.  Hes the strongest player on the ball weve had since Scholes and hes even scored a couple of big goals for us.  He brings respectability with him everywhere he goes which is arguably the biggest thing weve lost since Sir Alex.  Teams werent afraid to play us anymore.  I swear in Sir Alexs time that last trophy was won on attitude alone.  Schweinsteiger brought a hint of that back to us.  If I had the decision to make I would literally have spent twice that for him.  Hell if he had stayed at Bayern and suffered this injury today Id be knocking at his door tomorrow trying to sign him for next season.  You need a veteran like that on your squad when youre trying to rebuild.  Its heart breaking hes out but hes been invaluable.Edit  I went back to look at him to see if I was overstating things and in November alone he basically got  points for us from the Watford and Leicester City games with late goals.  If we didnt have those points wed be sitting tied at th in the table with Stoke and literally no chance in hell for top .

But nobody should discount the fact that Rooney is a proven goalscorer when he is in form amp undoubtedly a leader that the England squad needs desperately in their dressing room for the Euro .Rooney should start if he is fit.EDIT All the downvotes yet nobody challenges the points I have put forward.

7130667,0,t1_d1omulh,You dont consider were in massive transition too?People keep going on about how we could break records for how few points we have during a season this year but do you know why that may happen?  Because we were extraordinary under Fergie.  And I mean literally extraordinary.  We were freakishly good and consistent and fun and exciting.  Unbelievably so in a way which we dont deserve and most football fans during their lifetime ever get.But while we were freakishly good while we had the class of  another freakish occurrence you may remember that quite a few of the promoted youth failed and quite a few of our transfers that came in didnt reach expectations or even more regularly took a year or two to start to really show what they were made of here at United.So under Ferguson when we were doing freakishly well there was still something consistent.  It was damn hard to actually succeed here and only very specific types of characters and players were able to do it but even then it took time.Why the hell does anyone think those types of things would actually get better and easier when Fergie left?  Nope unfortunately the freak is gone and now were just more like a normal club.  We definitely should be doing better than we have been doing but I dont think we can ever expect things to go back to how they were under Fergie.We might get a few years success here and there but no more than the other big clubs.  And then a few years down again and then a managers sacking then a few years of success.  This league is too competitive theres too much money about for anything like Spain to happen and with Fergie gone we should still demand better than were getting but instead of considering Were Manchester United when others are failing we should be the ones there to capitalise its more likely going to be that if others are failing due to a season like this one well probably fail a bit too.

Surely everyone accepts that Giggs is a football man but being a good player doesnt equate to a good manager e.g. Neville.  We could name a few managers who we think would be good in replacing LVG but I think that is all it is worth.  Guessing....SAF said Moyes was good replacement and asked for patience  never got it and now LVG is getting pulverised which makes me believe it is a poisoned chalice.Flip side is that he could turn out to be just as good as Pep or Enrique both of whom were lucky enough to have Messi playing for them.,reddevils,d1qoke3,1,t5_2rxse

7154587,0,t1_d1rc6hb,Jose never builts a dynasty. Jose buys for the time he thinks to be at a club which is  maybe max  years. Then the magic is gone and he moves on. Its not forbidden or something. I think jose is fine with that but the thing is that he buys players that are in their prime and are end products. Youd say thats good because you have a good chance on success  but the thing is he only buys those players and he doesnt buy for the future. Well he has no plan for the future and He doesnt need a plan for the future because he knows hell be leaving soon. And so the club is left to rebuild a squad from scratch in worst case. But he didnt leave Real madrid in a mess though because the players he had where bought by the board and they bought a well balanced team. In fact even before Jose was sacked the players decided to ignore Jose tactics and from there on things became more positive and watchable on the pitch and when he finally left these same players won la decima under a clever ancelotti who just left these players to carry on deciding what happened on the pitch.The interesting question is who do you want after Jose?Because IF he comes he ll be gone by  max . We might  win some silverware  maybe even a EPL or CL in maybe  and then what? We have to start al over again.No I think the board made the right decision to appoint a manager that builds for the future one that lays a foundation to build on for many years to come and thus to ensure success to become more consistent as like under the reign of SAF. A board with short term vision will lead to ad hoc decisions every  years and before we know it well be the next Real Madrid. Well Id rather be the next Barca because when messi leaves Barca that will b a blow but the concept and style of play is still ingrained in the majority of the players from youth thru to st team players. But when Ronaldo leaves RM they fall down hard and have to see if theres another player around of that calibre. I dont see anyone getting near that level in the foreseeable future tbh. That makes RM much more  dependable on the quality of the players on the market then Barca.If you have to choose then better go thru the hard times now build a new squad and harvest later then becoming RM. with a constant change of managers play styles and no sight on regular success.,reddevils,d1rembf,-3,t5_2rxse

7173747,0,t1_d1tjbf4,Yes and its bollocks.Again an article that ignores the fact that this team still needs to learn a lot. That this learning process has been heavily slowed down because plus injuries last  years and that we are by no means looking at the finished product.The remark that LvGs preferring to play the save pass to keep ball possession in stead of playing the risky pass lacks the explaining that this is because we play so high up the pitch that if you loose the ball your opponent has  meters of unguarded space behind our defense to run into and hit us on the counter attack. No explanation on the fact that playing a risky pass in the attacking part of the field isnt as risky in the SAF way of playing as in the Barcas Bayerns LvGs Ajaxs way of playing because in SAFs style MNU played a sort of counter attack so you didnt have all defenders way up the pith. No explanation on that this BarcaLvGbayernajax style of play requires a lot of playing together to form automatisms that are essential in getting it right. That the more you play together the higher youre ball circulation becomes and the more space will appear in your opponents defense because he has to chase the ball and gets tired and so the more often you will find the opening in which you can play that splitting pass. Barca has a high level of speedy ball circulation and they find the space to play that cutting pass way more often then we do. It shows that LvGs tactics which are very similar are not outdated but the performances of the MNU players arent on the required level yet. Besides having Messi it has most to do with having players on the pitch that played this style for a longer period already. Nothing of all this is mentioned yet the writer makes a comparison between the old MNU and the new ignoring all these facts and concludes that LvG staying Might not be good for MNU.Suggesting that Pep uses the possession based football in an attacking way an LvG not willing to do so again ignoring the fact that Pep inherited  teams that play this stlye of football already for several years. Also Pep didnt inherent a unbalanced team nor did he had to clear out dead wood and buy a lot of new players. Pep didnt transition teams LvG did and is still doing that at MNU atm.He makes a conclusion ignoring important facts and then even concludes nothing because he says it MIGHT be true what I just concluded,reddevils,d1tl63x,3,t5_2rxse

He doesnt deserve minutes over anyone in the  right now. Lingard gets a lot of flack but his work rate would be missed if he wasnt in the team. He links the defense to attack well with his tireless running. You can have your opinion about him thinking hes too good for the us but i dont think he should be getting first team minutes when he doesnt take his time for the us seriously. Hes been to a World Cup sure but I dont think he touched the field. If he didnt it wasnt for long. He hasnt impressed me in our first team since his debut season and he cant seem to find that form again. Not for Dortmund and not for us. So if he wants to get into the starting line up maybe he should step up for the us and stand out in training. Not to say that Im assuming hes been horrible in training like you seem to think is my assumption. He just obviously isnt doing enough.

7209934,0,t1_d1xp48b,gt with the dressing room at MadridHe fell out with Casillas and the players supporting Casillas like Ramos. Plenty of players like Xabi and Arbeloa came out and openly supported him. He was right to turf Casillas to the bench that was the one weak point that kept dropping him points. He didnt have as much political clout as he thought but LvGs done his dirty work here and replaced almost all the fading stars with backroom clout. Right now Mourinhos only problems would be Giggs Rooney and Carrick. It seems like Carrick isnt going to be offered an extension anyway and Giggs probably wants to take on the leading role somewhere else if he doesnt get appointed manager. Mourinho seems to like Rooney but I can see dropping him being a potential problem. Though whoever tries to get rid of Rooney will always have a fight on their hands.

We have been consistently been developing good reserve and good first team players for a while.

Everyone is acting like our facilities are shit when theyre not. Theyre not on the cutting edge of modern technology but theyre more than adequate for kids to develop in. We cant go chasing and revamping our facilities every time a new club comes and puffing its chest and throwing tons of money at theirs. We have what they dont. We have proven success. We have our own magic formula of what works. Nicky Butt just touched on it in a recent interview. He feels that its vital not to give young kids too much. Giving them facilities and pay bumps and all the other bells and whistles doesnt really do anything for them. The magic is in the process the people that we have running the academy. Nicky has a set of principles based on what he knows worked and hes sticking to them. Could we use some updated? Sure.

7285589,0,t1_d269r3f,Th Chelsea youth situation is actually a really useful example. When he arrived by all accounts the youth system was a shambles. One of the very first things he did was to work with Abramovich to completely overhaul the youth set up. This took years to come to fruition especially since Cobham had to the built which was problematic for a variety of reasons. Now were hearing that there are some potential world class stars coming through the Chelsea set up and that can be traced directly back to the work Mourinho did when he first joined the club. Changing youth systems takes a long time now that players join a set up at such young ages. At Porto his team was regularly made up of youth team developed players. Usually around a third of the team. When he joined Chelsea Abramovich told him to put Chelsea on the map and get success quickly. He did exactly that. The fact that Abramovich was desperate to get him back should tell everyone all they need to know about what went on. He did exactly what was asked of him. Real dont really do youth development they do galacticos which he stuck with and remains the only manager to beat Pep to a league title and Inter needed shot term success which he also did.

The clubs hierarchy are keeping tightlipped about their intentions and refused to comment on reports in Germany on Sunday that Mourinho has agreed a threeyear deal to take over at Old Trafford from the summer but the former Chelsea manager believes that is moving closer to becoming a reality. Mourinho is known to have had a gentlemans agreement in place with United for the past few months although the precise details of that arrangement remain unclear.  Van Gaal has not given up hope of seeing out the final year of his contract but despite acknowledging the glut of injury problems the manager has had to contend with and his commitment to blooding youngsters there is concern at the club about the poor results dull sterile football lack of goals and failure to extract more from a squad that has had in excess of  million invested in it. United won  at home to Aston Villa on Saturday courtesy of Marcus Rashfords seventh goal in  games but the onepaced football and lack of entertainment caused more exasperation among worried supporters. If Van Gaal triumphed in the Cup it would offer the opportunity to head into retirement on a relative high if United opted to dispense with his services but the Dutchman does not believe his superiors have made a definitive decision yet and thinks results over the next few weeks could still on a bearing on his future.Despite his calamitous last season at Chelsea when he was sacked in December seven months after winning the title with the club one point above the relegation zone the prospect of Mourinho taking charge at Old Trafford would be tantalising in many respects not least because it would see a renewal of his rivalry with Pep Guardiola.  Guardiola who succeeds Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City manager in the summer was in charge of Barcelona when Mourinho managed the Catalan clubs bitter rivals Real Madrid. United are interested in signing Renato Sanches Benficas gifted young midfielder and Everton centrehalf John Stones this summer and they are targets Mourinho fully supports. Mourinho made a series of failed bids for Stones when at Chelsea and also tried and failed to bring Sanches to Stamford Bridge. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has admitted he would happily play under Mourinho at United with the club also weighing up a move for the Sweden striker who is out of contract at Paris StGermain at the end of the season. ,reddevils,d26sd4r,7,t5_2rxse

And you can see in basically every match where United has been more attacking and aggressive that they tend to give away a lot of really good chances to the other team as in Lukaku had some really great chances that on another day he would more than likely score... btw this post isnt really directed at you just some ramblings based off your first sentenceSo the thought experiment would be how long would everyone really want to play this kind of attacking football if we lost matches where we gave away  to  or  easy breakaways to the opposing team that they scored on to beat us? Its easy to slag off LVG for being defensivenonrisk taking...but you can usually see why he does that because United just dont know how to cope defensively while also playing with so much attacking impetus it leaves too many gaps as well as maybe our defensive players arent good enough. It just would be interesting to see in another parallel universe where LVG plays super attacking yet United end up in a similar league position or worse and people are crying for him to play more defensively and whining about how we need our midfielders to sit back more and break up play etc. Sure its entertaining to watch attacking football but how many losses would it take for people to simply want to try to win more games instead?Not trying to defend LVG because I dont think he should stay but I think he does have quite a few valid reasons for playing the way he does with the squad he has. ,reddevils,d2izacp,6,t5_2rxse

7409479,0,t3_4gn8st,Could definitely see him leaving then if he knows Shaw will be in his way forever and theres Rojo Blind freed up if we sign a CB as people expect and even FosuMensah. It only takes one Prem team to see him as their LB offer him the commensurate wages and convince him to sign. On the other hand he might think he has a shot at making it here longterm with Shaw having injury issues and when I looked at the Prem table to suggest a team I was surprised to see they pretty much all have decent LBs and just lack RBs. Newcastle are a rare exception and theyre going down but that move would still make sense for him and their club. They get a cheap starting LB for the next few years and he gets a season of Champo football or  before being a starting Prem player. Only Dummett would be in front of him so hed play all the goddamn time.,reddevils,d2keqzr,1,t5_2rxse

7577582,1,t1_d33i6sk,Ferguson has spoken out many times about his reluctance to pay the prices and specifically agent fees that were escalating exponentially during the final years of his reign. I find it far more likely that Fergusons stubbornness was the reason for the lack of spending. Its pretty apparent by the players he bought like Kagawa Hernandez Zaha etc. that he wanted to prove that good teams were still possible without shelling out loads of money. Neither him nor Gill have ever once indicated that the Glazers restricted their purchasing power. Additionally the moment that Ferguson left the club announced that it has a lot of money that its willing to burn. Weve made massive bids for several top players. If the reports are to be believed weve offered m for players like Bale. Thats not indicative to me of owners that are reluctant to spend. I think its time that United fans come to terms with the fact that Ferguson isnt infallible. The owners trusted him with complete transfer control because he had earned it. Then he blindsided everybody and left having compiled a team that only he could be successful with. He didnt make the transition smooth and Gill leaving at the same time also not anticipated made things worse. But lets just blame the owners?People act like the Glazers get to pocket the money that the club doesnt spend. Thats not how it works. They pay themselves well but United brings in more revenue than virtually every other sports team in the world theyre majority owners and deserve to be paid higher than clubs that bring in less than United. The Glazers have a lot to do with pushing the club into the modern era. They have made good business decisions that have only increased the value and brand of United. A lot of fans act as if United grew to the size it is all by itself.Guys like Abromvich have ambition but no patience or integrity. Id rather not become a club like Chelsea. United is about more than winning. Theres pride in being a selfsufficient club. Getting things handed to you from a rich owner has its own consequences. Is your only idea of what makes a good owner injecting their own money into it? And the Glazers did gain their money legally. Their father built his fortune from the ground up. He actually was a savvy businessman.,reddevils,d33j9ge,0,t5_2rxse

The game is practically rigged against managers who become fall guys for any failure to protect owners players or even fans from responsibility and theyre not given time to turn things around. He wont deliver instant success unless hes appointed at a top European club and he wont be because of his lack of experience. If he goes to Scotland what are his options? NonGlasgow teams will take a managerial genius to achieve success and those two jobs are occupied he could have had the Celtic job maybe but that ship has sailed. And if he goes to a mid table club whod take him hell likely suffer like Ole who IMO is a great manager.  Personally I think he should lead the Us if Warren Joyce leaves. If he can develop some academy players and achieve success with the youth team he could be in a prime position to take over once Jose inevitably leaves in a hissy fit after twothree years with the club in turmoil. And use his knowledge of the kids in the academy to promote youth and play the United way. ,reddevils,d3hj5fx,12,t5_2rxse

7740498,0,t1_d3m0vli,I dont know. I think a fair  of people hoped hed sign but agree with you that we werent optimistic!.  See discussions here.  . .  Comments includegt I honestly think Van Gaal commands more respect than people give him. Mller has stated that he is Bayern through and through but Van Gaal seems to have a strong relationship with a lot of players that could mean a move is possible.  This would be a fucking massive signing. Hes not flash but he always seems to play  every game. The chance isnt probably big but I think its possible.gt All that considered If the player wants to leave they cant make him stay. But I agree.  million seems to be too good to be true but Bayern arent known for selling or buying with huge prices. I just think Van Gaal has got some serious credentials and a really good relationship that means a lot to people. He gave Mller an opportunity at Bayern same with Kroos and started some of the biggest names at Barca. gt I think pep can alienate some players. Now Im not saying he has done this with muller but who knows. Also he has won literally everything with bayern he could want a new challenge? Two very weak points thoughgt Absolutely buzzing if we get Muller. What a signing that would be and I could see it happening too. gt ,reddevils,d3m1edn,1,t5_2rxse

More to the point hes a fantastic presser and has phenomenal positional discipline.DiMas still a liability for PSG in the CL and for the NT. He only gets away with his recklessness because hes on such an overpowered team in such a shit league. Watch the matches hes awful and misplaces simple passes over dribbles like usual etc. He loses the ball  times a match. Try that much shit with Ibra Cavani etc. up front and one of your errant passes will inevitably lead to an assist. Memphis doesnt even offer DiMas creativity despite being just as wasteful.

Some argue he hasnt reached his full form at Madrid because they have been playing him on the wings.I see Mourinho giving that position to Rooney as I think he likes him as a player and Rooney himself has said he wants to move to a midfield role. That idea of having to fight for a position with the captain whom is also favoured by the coach could make the transfer less attractive to James in my humble opinion.

I feel insulted hearing that not that I expect you to care.Im sorry if I offended you? lol but it wasnt intentional. you can watch the replays and mata said post match pretty sure he didnt intend for the ball to go into the area it did and he definitely didnt spot smalling. but we gtIT CREATED A GOALsure but there were no assurances of that happening if martial wasnt able to play the final ball. mata could easily have put rooney through but hesitated. there have been many times this season where mata misses a blatant pass for a runner in front of him and ends up playing the safe pass. Possession retention is definitely a reason why he hasnt played as well but most of its down to just a lack of ability. gtI think the reverse would be more accurate. Just because he didnt get called up doesnt mean he wouldnt suit spains style of play better than any system in the pl atm. He didnt get into the squad because hes competing with a plethora of spanish midfielders who are definitely better than he is thats all. His Chelsea form was great and all but I still think having the entire team built to his specific strengths bolstered his statistics that season. Im not denying he was a good player and he was def top  attacking mids in the world at the time. But his consistency is close to none lolgtHowever dont say he cant make that pass that Ozil made to Basti and expect everyone to agree.watch the passage of play.

8104551,0,t3_4q7gtc,England scouting  national set up has been abysmal for years IMO. There is so much talent in this country often poorly represented by the national team. Looking strictly at this squad alone though we were in a situation where Rooney had to be involved in some way because our other options were so Dier if youll pardon the pun.The gospel truth of the matter is that Rooney is a striker playing in midfield because hes no longer our best option in the position so a role in midfield was found to accommodate him. Going forward and looking to the future IMO the team needs to be in a position where he has a role similar to that of players similar to himself at least in his new CM role like Cabaye or Schweinsteiger. Having said that we dont have consistent players like Kroos or Gundogan or Pogba or Matuidi. Our team is still pretty young and raw in comparison. I believe in the ability of some of the prospects however I also believe that some of these players have a poor fucking attitude. When the cards were against us every one of those players should have done a rashford and just run. If its not going your way run. show some grit and determination at least. Not loft those useless poncy balls over the top that rose kept failing. Have a fucking go. They looked scared. Lastly focusing back on Rooney one man can only do so much but contrary to popular belief on this sub I dont think he does enough. I think he was the natural choice of captain for the national team at least because he is the most decorated player which youd hope would inspire the youngsters. However I dont think he makes the best of captains. I think we are in this tricky position where Hart would make a good captain but shouldnt be no. anymore Cahill OK at best Smalling being groomed for future captaincy but still needs some fine polish which leaves Rooney seeing as Carrick doenst feature anymore. Rooney is a lucky boy. We cant  shouldnt cut him out yet because we dont have enough decent options in midfield yet.,reddevils,d4r0vs0,3,t5_2rxse

8178663,0,t3_4rc9zg,I dont know what people think about when they say promoting young players. It seems like they think it means grabbing a young player and turning him into a key member of the squad within one season.Most youth players wont ever make it in professional football even after being given professional debuts. Many of the names in Mous list arent big names but here who can remember Deiniol Graham? just to name an example. He was one of the first of the original Fergies Fledglings who played  league matches for us in four years and then went on to being transferred almost once a year and retired when he was about  years old. And there are so many examples like his not only at Man United but at every club.Mourinho wants to win just like Sir Alex did. If certain young players are good enough they WILL be part of the team but its the players job to impress in the first place. In youth tournaments in friendlies whenever they can. In Mous career the best academy hes had was Real Madrids and look at how many debuts he gave. Seems more than reasonable specially given the context of WE MUST WIN ALL GAMES BECAUSE BARCELONA that he lived through in Spain.Lets also remember that the state of our academy currently isnt the best. Their coaching methods and even their scouting criteria have been a bit outdated for quite a while and itll msot likely take time before any youth player takes a role as prominent as Scholes Giggs or Nevilles had so many years ago.,reddevils,d4zvrnt,20,t5_2rxse

I very much doubt Sanches is   he looks like a kid besides he has enough talent not to require lying about his age.  The reason age cheats lie is usually driven by developingbeing spotted late . Assume a lower PL club spots an AfricanBrazilian player whos  and probably close to being good enough to player in the Premiership  hes much more likely to be signed if he says hes  with time to develop than giving his actual age.  Then he gets  years of Premiership earning depending how good he is instead of remaining in AfricaBrazil on a lower wage.  Rooney isnt an age cheat he just developed early same goes for Barkley who was head and shoulders physically above his age group at .

8303032,0,t3_4t82kg,We are way too stocked up with attacking talent especially on the flanks. Martial amp Memphis on the left Mkhitaryan amp Lingard on the right. And then there are Mata Januzaj Pereira amp Young who can play on either flank.Doesnt make sense for us to spend further on another player that will likely play a bitpart role at most this coming season.Better off trying to make the best of Januzaj amp Pereira who are very talented amp needs to make an impression this season.,reddevils,d5ffqan,1,t5_2rxse
8303424,0,t3_4t8vhr,I think they will do much better than last season but not to the point where I fear them the most in the league.Conte will undoubtedly improve their defense but they still need signings there. Terrys not great anymore Cahills not a great CB in general although Zouma is seriously talented. Ivanovic is just poor these days. Kants arrival is huge for them though. In games where they play Kant and Matic in midfield itll be seriously tough to get anything past those two. I think the biggest question is regarding their attacking players like Fabregas Oscar Willian Hazard Costa and how well they adapt to Contes tactics. I dont think Oscar will become any better under Conte so they desperately need Fabregas to perform over the course of a whole season not just the first half.,reddevils,d5fhhio,13,t5_2rxse

8309823,0,t3_4tc37b,Ive been part of multiple tournaments over at rFIFA and rEAfifapc which is now dead due to no activity and the biggest problem is attendance lack of activity.Charging an entry fee will definitely solve both of those problems but not completely IMO. Today across all platforms there were multiple noshowsbyes which I expected cause this is late in the FIFA  product cycle with FIFA  so close by.  The other thing is dont keep two separate times for checkin and playing. A lot of people will just keep the playing time in mind and not give much importance to the checkin time. Just keep one time for check in.What I would suggest is close the registration by a fixed time. After that do the seedings at which point the tournament is officially started. Give  whole day maybe Saturday to play a certain number of rounds and then the next day to play the final rounds. This makes it easier for people around the globe to participate and fix timings as well.For example registration closes Friday evening seeding will be done at that time to determine matches tournament starts Saturday. Enough time for people to find their opponents and decide on a fixed time.,reddevils,d5ga95f,2,t5_2rxse

Fabregas over Gundogan I disagree though Fabregas was great for Chelsea the first six months but fell off a bit after that and he was quite frankly terrible under Jose last season  of the Chelsea fans wanted him dropped. Think it had to do with Matics loss of form which meant Fabregas wasnt constantly defended by him and he cost Chelsea a fair few goals. He improved under Hiddink but not enough to place him over one of the Bundesligas best midfielders. Its just a matter of staying fit for Gundogan.It sucks that he joined City was always one of my favourite players to watch.,reddevils,d5hyzdr,2,t5_2rxse

8434932,0,t3_4v6spa,Wayne Rooney has described new United manager Jose Mourinho as a friend to the players.The striker opened up on life under the Portuguese while speaking to Manchester radio station Key  ahead of his testimonial against Everton at Old Trafford on Wednesday.Rooney spoke glowingly about the yearold and his training regimes admitting he had brought a winning mentality back to the club.He said The training is tough of course its preseason so youd expect that but weve enjoyed it. Hes come in and hes been great with the players. The training has been hard but enjoyable. The players are ready were working hard we know its a big season for us.Hes made in my opinion great signings theyve gelled in really well with the squad so its exciting times. Its always exciting when you get a new manager but to get a new manager in the stature of Jose Mourinho hes first of all great to work under and hes brought his way of working and his winning mentality back to the club which the players are excited about.I think Manchester United as a football club need to win. We have to win and he certainly has that winning mentality. He has that stature of winning trophies wherever he goes and we have to deliver for him so theres pressure on players of course there always is at Manchester United but were ready were working hard and I think this season well give a real challenge on all fronts.Hes the manager but he has a balance of in terms of being a manager and then also being a friend to the players so he has that balance right so you can see why hes been successful everywhere he goes.Rooney also spoke about the charities set to benefit from the testimonial match . The United captain said all proceeds will be split between the NSPCC Claire House Childrens Hospice Alder Hey Childrens Hospital and the Manchester United Foundation.He explained Every penny raised is going to go to charity and the important thing for me being a young father is children and that we are raising money to support children... its something that Im proud to do.,reddevils,d5vwmax,13,t5_2rxse

8447674,0,t3_4vdk9m,Great to see us attack with such speed creativity and freedom in the final third during the second half. Rashford Lingard Mata and Memphis all looked eager to fight for a starting job. There are still a few issues heading into the CS and Season Opener though. Of particular worry is the midfield duo of Schneiderlin and Herrera. Its too weak defensively because neither of them are very good as a DMHolding Midfielder. We all know Herrera is a more attacking minded CM but Schneiderlin is also actually more of a bb player rather than a holding midfielder. Its the role he thrived at in Southampton and i think many of us have been wrongly assuming hes a fitting replacement for Carrick. Its worrying that our only quality DM is Carrick.

8550128,0,t1_d6ab6bi,It was an incredible moment. He reminds me of Welbeck in that hes a scorer of great goals but not a great goalscorer. However hes clearly a better finisher than Welbeck was in general and I hope this season he can contribute with a fair few goals and assists and not miss so many easy chances which will cost us.That was the issue I had. Fair enough misses happen every now and again. But Lingard was missing game changing chances. For example had he not been complacent against Newcastle our lead would have extended to  goals and we probably would have won. In a season where chances were so few every one of them should have been taken with more precision. ,reddevils,d6ac6o1,8,t5_2rxse
8550160,0,t3_4ww68t,This might be confusing but I was less hyped  years ago but more optimistic. This year Im more hyped but less optimistic. Let me clarify.When LVG took over I was certain that no manager could do a worse job. LVG had a reputation for success and being a disciplinarian  something I felt we lacked. He had the World Cup with Van Persie and I was sure hed get the best out of him again. I assumed wed gel very quickly as a team and be very hard to beat. I could go on but I assumed a lot of things would fall into place and that wed be back on top at least by the time his  years were up. However LVG for me wasnt anything to be excited about as such but I felt hed get the job done. This time though with Mourinho Im super hyped. We have fucking Jose Mourinho as our manager  successful and entertaining! Hes entertaining in interviews and he brings us a showbiz element. Weve signed absolute superstars in this window! Its everything weve wanted for years as a fan! Were being glamorous as a club and a brand and showing that we still have the pulling power. Everything looks good for proceeding forward. However past experiences have led me to be less optimistic. Sure it all seems very good having Mourinho and the new signings but we may not actually hit the ground running. Things dont always fall into place. It may not work out. I hope everything goes to plan but Moyes and Van Gaal have taught me not to assume anything in football.,reddevils,d6acbva,35,t5_2rxse

Personally I would love to see Blind move to DM once Smalling comes back he has great awareness defensively and has great distribution. So it looks like a     with Shaw and Valencia basically playing as attacking full backs they can bridge the gap in the midfield.

8682338,0,t3_4ywcca,I dont think we ever needed world class players to get the best of him he was definitely world class in Chelseas CL winning side and was hardly surrounded by world class players in every position. We just needed to play him in the correct system and position. Not on the right in a system that doesnt lend itself to creative players limiting movement and forward passing. Slightly off tangent but Ill never get my head around how that Chelsea side won the CL easily the worst side to win it in the modern format. For reference in that specific final Mata played as a number  with Kalou to the right Ryan fucking Bertrend making his European debut on the left wing and Drogba whod managed  league goals that season up top. Crazy.If we give him an extended run as a number  with Martial on the left and Mkhi on the right with some actual movement up top from Ibra I see no reason why he wont start delivering world class performances is week in week out just like he used to.,reddevils,d6qx0zx,8,t5_2rxse
8682725,0,t1_d6qxeou,I dont know. He lost possession  times  of which almost lead to a goal and he didnt make any meaningful contributions up top unless you count that flick that Zlatan somehow managed to turn into a chance. Id say it was just the usual. Other players can do what Mata does whilst bringing so much more to the table. I feel as though world class players will just make him look less shit. If Valencia wasnt playing right now people would be looking at Mata more... as they did when Darmian was playing RB. ,reddevils,d6qys03,2,t5_2rxse

Hector Moreno  deliberately tried to break Luke Shaws leg. I do TKD and a lot of flying kicks so I understand body mechanics while air borne. If you watch the video closely Hector wins the ball with his right foot when that happens it could have ended with just that but he decides to turn his body and shin kick through Shaws leg. That second part of the tackle was deliberately intended to physically harm Shaw... it was a flying kick simple as that. If he did not intend to do harm he would have fallen flat on his ass after winning the ball or even land on the side of his body... but as you can see at the end of the clip he ends up almost on his stomach because of the turning follow through from the leg breaking kick.There I said it but I know most of you wont understand the true body mechanics of this and downvote me.The worrying thing is that if I played... I could do the exact same thing as Moreno I could win the ball and break peoples legs within the rules of the game.,reddevils,d6y4m8u,7,t5_2rxse

Shouldve started both Rashford and Martial and tried to isolate the full backs out wide before crossing. Which brings me to the crossing i dont remember too many when halfdecent ones today. Also since when has Rooney become a number ?There shouldve been no need to play Herrera at all. Recycling the ball when city go  at the back without a striker isnt really what we should needing to do. We shouldve been more incisive in attack from the start.

Moyes finished th because he was managing the club in an exceptionally competitive year when the top teams all performed outstandingly. Arsenal finished the season with  points and only came fourth. th place Tottenham finished with  points.Points totals arent perfect but theyre a far more accurate measure of core competency than league position. Last season we finished with  points. Two more than David MoyesRyan Giggs season. Its still remarkably poor.gt Mourinho had  months to find the teams weakness and make changes and he did upon taking over but the team has regressed. Totally impossible to say after  games. I mean if we want to base our assessment on such a small sample size of games then you could extrapolate our current points total and were still on course to outperform LVG. At the current rate were projected to achieve  points by the end of the season.At the same time youre completely ignoring the relevant transition period. Mourinho is changing a system and implementing new ideas in defence and attack. Implementing that system effectively is going to involve teething pains but rather than looking at Van Gaals extensive record of experimentation  dithering with formations  putting Di Maria at striker making the squad a revolving door of rotation until ending up with the right formula  youve decided that this period didnt exist and Mourinho doesnt get to have the benefit of your patience.gt Mourinho confidently stated he wasnt shy to say we were ready to win the title and that was the plan.Under Van Gaal we would never have won the league. We most likely wouldnt finish in the top four this season.

Were talking about Memphis consistently hitting screamers and making a complete mockery out of the opposition little over a season ago in the league in Europe and during the world cup.gt what about Lingards more recent goals in the FA Cup final and Charity Sheild against better teams and probably better keepers?Im not sure what point youre trying to make. Nowhere did I say that Memphis scoring goals meant he had potential. It was certainly a showcase of his talent but it more led into my next point that he is low on confidence so to write him off as just another failed Dutch import is silly. The Dutch league sucks but most of what he was showcasing in that league should extrapolate just fine into any other. This goal against Heerenveen for an example is a goal no keeper is saving. Not even De Gea. He scored  freekicks that season. . Some player thrive on confidence and what weve seen of Memphis so far is very similar to what Dortmund saw of Mkhitaryan a couple seasons back. They stuck with him and eventually his quality shined through.What Lingard did in the FA cup final and Charity Sheild was a little special though youd be bullshitting me if you were to call him a gamechanger. I think they might be the only two games he has ever really made his own.gt If were giving players time to settle into a new league before we judge them and the benefit of the doubt which I always do whats the difference between him and Lingard Lingards ahead right now with less overall and equalish EPL experience.Players dont always adapt just like that. We were very fortunate that Martial adapted so well to England but the same cant be said or expected for everyone. In the case of Lingard he had been in and around the first team playing English football for a while. And a genuine question is Lingard ahead? Or is Memphis just on bad form and struggling to find his feet? Id suggest the latter. Again this is why Lingard deserves his spot in the team. He has delivered to an OK level whereas Memphis so far hasnt but were hoping with time Memphis form will improve and then we will have the player everyone on this sub touted him to be just  months ago.I think you can attribute a lot of LVGs system to Memphis performences. Youre being very black and white by putting Rashford Lingard Martial and Memphis in the same boat. Yes they all play similar positions but they are different players and no they didnt shoot. That was the problem with Memphis. Memphis tried too much and losing possession is a big no no in LVGs system. For reference per  minutes Lingard and Martial were averaging . shots between them which is pretty pathetic really. Memphis would average . per . So to say the whole thing about us not taking chances under LVG was a myth is ludicrous there is lots of evidence to support it. I mean did you even watch last season?The last paragraph is sadly something I fear. Obviously I disagree with the first bit. Memphis put on two or three of the most impressive performences from any of our outfield players last year albeit against poorer opposition he clearly has ability and his career didnt start at United. The issue now is obviously where his chances will come from. He has lost a year of development pretty much which is why people would argue he has massively regressed but thats silly. Shaw also missed an entire year. He looks to have matured and developed mentally which is another block I think he had last year and so far has looked positive when played this season nothing too special but positive nevertheless. He still has plenty of time ahead and I really hope we give him a chance because I think he can be just as good as Rashford and Martial. Both of those players are widely regarded as the next big things Lingard isnt and with good reason. He is turning  in less than  months and is still yet to really show anything special. Hell be a valuble squad player but there is a reason nobobody outside of United really gives a fuck about him and are actually pretty pissed when he gets the England callup.,reddevils,d8s2u28,2,t5_2rxse

Liverpool had nothing going forward United kept the ball high up the pitch and the crowd was being taken out of the game slowly.Second half obviously Liverpool played better but even then chances were fairly limited.  The Emre Can chance defenders were in a very strong position but failed to tackle quick enough.  Welltaken chance by Can great save by De Gea.  The Coutinho chance again very well taken and a great save but again the team was very well organised defensively.Allinall the defensive performance I thought was almost perfect.  In the presentday premier league you cannot expect to keep teams from getting chances but the overall defensive positioning etc. was very good.Wouldve liked to have seen Mata come on just because him and Herrera have that telepathic connection and with Matas history with Liverpool wouldve been nice to see him pop up with a winner.,reddevils,d8xcptr,2,t5_2rxse

9510970,0,t1_d9ldxkh,I disagree on Martial. Yesterday he was trying his best to beat his man almost succeeding on a few occasions and subsequently won a couple corners. The problem is there is absolutely no movement around him and no incisive runs that he can rely on so he tries more often to beat his man rather than using a team mate for support. As for tabloid junk I sincerely doubt any players listen to it or even have any time for it. As said in this thread our wide play has been shocking. Partly due to players being played out of position but mostly because we simply dont have enough depth in the squad or lack of quality in those areas. Constantly cutting inside is every defenders dream especially when theres no overlapping runs. They will happily invite a shot to be blocked from distance if it means they dont need to be wary of a player making runs behind them. Shaw and Darmian were substandard yesterday pushing very high and leaving our CB pairing in no mans land when a counter was on. For now I look forward to Swansea and hopefully the team can take the mistakes made yesterday and learn from them. If we havent learned from them we can expect Swansea to punish us which will in turn lead to more unhelpful pressure on our players. ,reddevils,d9lfgdv,2,t5_2rxse

Under Mourinho were also reaching the box too slowly but we are doing our utmost to thread the needle anyway.  Ibra is doing some great work but his presence at the tip of the attack is contributing to the problem in the first place.,reddevils,d9n863w,1,t5_2rxse
9528653,0,t1_d9nd97a,I dont think its something that has been looked into in major detail to my knowledge but The Double Pivot podcast spoke about it in their most recent episode. They mentioned that a study done on Everton when they moved from leftright foot CBs to rightright showed they had significantly less variation in their passing when building up from the back. I think that makes some intuitive sense but of course its influenced by the passing quality of the CBs. So I would assume playing RojoSmalling would yield only minor passing benefits if any despite them having different preferred feet. It is an interesting area  and clearly some managers really believe in it and others are indifferent  but Ive not seen any work on it in great detail. ,reddevils,d9nlvx6,2,t5_2rxse

Maybe give Ibra a rest just too wasteful with the occasional good play. Anytime Carrick isnt playing Herrera and Pogba are just too far from goal. Maybe have Herrera play the  while Mkhitaryan plays the  next to Pogba.Pogba ends up dribbling from deep through too many players instead of receiving the ball in good position from Carrick.

Nothing changes. gt but you can restrict them to having to do things that you know well theyre players will struggle massively to doAgain this is not really a thing. Regardless of the quality of the team in possession sitting back is the default mode for bottom teams. It doesnt matter what they know or dont know about the qualities of the possession team. I get what youre trying to say but youre implying that it was strategic. But it really isnt. Small teams always sit back against big teams. West Brom Sunderland Norwich Crystal Palace etc. They hope they can prevent goals and counter on mistakes. Its not a strategy specific to  United squad under LVG.

9814199,0,t1_damse32,I like the way this arcane sport of gentlemen that is cricket is the one thats using missile tracking technology. The broadcasters took under their wing a technology the sports body incorporated it and adjusted the rules the teams took it in their stride and changed the way the play some were skeptical on specific aspects of it the technology has been iterated upon due to the criticism. In spite of being tacked the multiple negative monikers thanks to the day format that format has been the one thats most receptive to the infusion of technology for be it just plain old replays ultra slow motion cameras thermal imaging and ball tracking. This in alignment with player  infractions being reported by both onfield and offfield match officials with reviews of footage from the days proceedings puts it at a stage that every sport should be looking to evaluate. Sure there a kinks in this and I am showing a rosy picture of cricket but hey at least most of this is implemented and is open to criticism rather than having all this technology in the world today and all the money that football can afford and only being able to imagine what might have been for all these years is appalling. Also got to give credit to Cricket for bringing in replays as early as they did in the early s. That single act is the cornerstone for the sport and its now intertwined relationship with modern technology as weve seen it progress in the last  or so years. If football is gonna take the same time since weve started goalline replays then it might be too late for us to witness it meaningfully in our lifetime. Not for the sport it will witness it at its own pace as long as society progresses with technology. ,reddevils,damt5qc,23,t5_2rxse

Its about given young players the license to express themselves yet Rashford has been burdened with defensive duties when hes made his mark as a striker at first team level. It would be more beneficial to his development if he was used as a wide forward instead of a winger. Rashford being nowhere close to that level is what I mean.

Our entire team was garbage at the time and that didnt help him. Now we have Pogba infront of Blind if we want to play Blind there so I think opponents midfield would not press Blind as hard because they need to be careful with Pogba.I was watching a passing compilation of Blind on YouTube the other day and hes an absolutely insane passer both on the ground and longrange.

10166839,0,t3_5lkzsc,I dont like the idea of Griezmann leading the line in a . Unless you set up as a purely counter attacking side I think this system works best with a taller stronger striker who can hold the ball up and bring others into play. He should also be some sort of a threat from crosses. Now we could change our system to play him at  but then maybe we dont get the best out of Pogba. Or we could play Griezmann on the wing but then we have to drop Martial or Micki. Ideally we could splash out on Lewandowski or someone similar otherwise lets see if Rashford or Martial can step up. ,reddevils,dbwgtu7,1,t5_2rxse

10220699,0,t1_dc2ijbl,You cant deny LvGs track record with bringing talent up through the ranks. It wouldnt be anywhere close if he played it safe by stacking up his senior squad with older and more reliable players. He is absolutely aware that he was giving up short term success in favour of the long but he obviously thought he could deliver regardless. I dont blame him at all for his policy on squad size. Its actually one of the things I respect him the most for though an extra centre back hadnt hurt instead of Blackett and McNair. I do have a list of problems with him though.One is that I think his polarising character stood in the way of creating the sort of atmosphere were currently experiencing at the club.Another is that LvGs training methods are somewhat outdated and in my opinion a part of the reason why we suffered a lot of injuries. LvG never really tailored sessions for individuals which I think is what someone like Jones absolutely needs. I like his tactics. In theory but not in practice. Pep Guardiola took LvGs positional play evolved it and created the beast that dominated almost a decade of football. LvG however failed to adapt with the times and stuck with his overly rigid system that only shackled our players in the final third.I think these three things were more influential in the end than LvGs choice to rely on our academy. A deeper squad might have been a quicker fix but we would still have the problems above regardless.,reddevils,dc2knoy,3,t5_2rxse

10342298,0,t3_5o3ocz,Phil Jones tells how the fans his real friends and the backing of Jos Mourinho helped him overcome his injury woePhil Jones does not even pause when explaining the magnitude of Manchester Uniteds match with Liverpool tomorrow. This is the one Jones says. This is more than a game.Since signing from Blackburn Rovers in  the versatile defender has played in seven of these East Lancs Road shows winning four losing two and drawing once. He has experienced every emotion triumphing at Anfield  in  and being vanquished at Old Trafford  in . Weve had some battles over the years since Ive been here Jones adds. The atmosphere is like no other game. When Im in the tunnel at Old Trafford before the game I know that not only am I ready for battle but  fans are ready to battle with me.He has even been in with the United fans at Anfield last year. United are in my DNA now my club now hopefully my club for many more years he says. When you sign for United you automatically become a fan. Youre honouring the badge the history of the club. I see Sir Bobby Charlton in the changing room after every game and know what he did for the club. That epitomises Manchester United. Hes been through so much been such an unbelievable player and still follows the club.Jones loves the presence of so many strong characters at United. Weve got powerful leaders Ibra Zlatan Ibrahimovic Wazza Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick he says. In the past weve had Rio Ferdinand Nemanja Vidic Patrice Evra Giggsy Ryan Giggs and Scholesy Paul Scholes  big leaders.I dont care who signs for United how much money is spent on them how much wages they are on no one will experience pressure like that at United. Real Madrid and Barcelona maybe but United are different in terms of the pressure put on us to deliver every single day and rightly so. In training the standards are so high. Weve such a great history that that commitment to success should continue.Thats where we are different from Arsenal Liverpool Chelsea Tottenham. They are fantastic clubs with lots of money and terrific players but the demand and pressure when you come to this club is huge. I didnt feel daunted or in awe. I was excited about the prospect of coming here.Jones relishes games such as this one  his th if he features  even more having endured long absences with injury especially last season. It was tough. You definitely learn who your true friends are he says. Not the ones just texting you out of the blue asking for tickets because its Liverpool at the weekend. My real friends are those who stuck by me through thick and thin always saying Youre a good player you will get back.United fans are great. Even when I was injured theyd still walk up in the street still wanting pictures. A lot of players moan We have pictures every day we sign autographs every day but when I was out that period of time having fans come up to me still wanting my picture still knowing who I was was a nice feeling.I never thought it was over because football is my life. I got through it. Im definitely stronger mentally having been through this. That was the biggest part of my game missing. It was nothing to do with technique passing balls heading balls positionally or reading the game. It was mentally.He also analysed his game and any habits that might have contributed to injuries. I learnt from Rio Ferdinand and saw what he was doing. I now do yoga and do the Reformer Pilates machine he says. Maybe I was doing stuff in the past that I thought worked but didnt just going in the gym doing a few weights to beef me up a bit more. Now I get to the training ground before everyone else have a coffee chill out do a bit of work wherever might be sore or tight go in the gym get my strappings and go out to trainingMuch of it is in the head. Even if Im feeling a bit sore a bit fatigued I say to myself Get out on the pitch. I always feel better for doing that. In the past I might have said Im feeling a bit tight Ill stay in. It was frustrating because he is obsessed with football. Just ask my missus fiance Kaya Hall. Ill watch Halifax versus Aldershot on a Friday night he says. I live and breathe football. Jos Mourinho has backed him and started him. Jones recalls their first meeting. I had my blond hair a wild moment he says. The first conversation I had with him Mourinho said Fing hell youre fit! I said Yes. Fit. I then briefly did my knee landed awkwardly somebody barged into me and my knee went inwards and I was thinking Here we go again. He Mourinho stuck by me. Hes always giving me confidence.Ive had three managers whove made me feel like Im really wanted. Sam Allardyce at Blackburn was one. He was terrific with me. If it wasnt for him I probably wouldnt be here today. I owe a great deal to Sir Alex Ferguson who took me under his wing. Mourinho is the other. Hes made me feel part of the team and if Im playing well Ill play. And long may it continue.Jones has tweaked his tackling style focusing on nicking the ball more and diving in less. In a sixgame period before Christmas he did not commit one foul. He has not been booked this season in  games. When I was younger inexperienced I wanted to try and win every ball he says. I wanted to fight the strikers. I try not to go as tight now.He was widely criticised for his animated reaction at the London Stadium on January  when challenged by West Hams Sofiane Feghouli whose red card was rescinded. A lot was made about it he says. If I do that to a Mesut zil a Eden Hazard or a Philippe Coutinho theyre doing exactly the same thing and nothings said. Everyone was coming out and saying it Joness reaction is not part of the game but if you actually watch it his two feet are off the ground. So if thats not being dangerous towards the player I dont know what is.Of course I worry about getting injured. Every time I go into a challenge I think Ive got to keep myself right here. In the past I might have gone Im going to win the ball go right through and come off worse. Ive tried to adapt knowing I cant go steaming into challenges and expect to come out on top every time.He knows criticism comes with the territory. When I first started at United scrolling through Twitter I was thinking Bloody hell what have I done wrong here? Why are people having a go at me? But now seriously it doesnt bother me one little bit he says. I dont pay any attention to it. When youre at a big club people want you to fail. They want to be you. I always hear the story of It could have been me but I injured my ankle when I was unders playing away at Southampton. Is it jealousy? Its part of the game I get on with it. My parents Mark and Helen taught me to be grounded. They said Never let football change who you were as a boy. Never let the money change who you are. If youre buying a chocolate bar and theyve charged you  dont just accept it because youve got the money. Me and my fiance like to go out and eat but I dont think were flashy. We dont have to dine out at top restaurants. Were just normal average people.They dont go out if United have lost. I just hate losing he says. If I lose at Connect Im not happy. If Ive lost a game Ill go home sit down wont want any food not interested in going out not interested in talking to people because I want to put it right. It lasts until the next game. I dont even speak to my missus if weve lost.He does watch how stars such as Ibrahimovic and Rooney take the strain. They handle pressure. Everyone was saying Ibra wasnt scoring at the start of the season but look at him now he says. Hes confident in his ability. He knows when he gets the chance he has the ability to get past the guy and score at any given time any given day. Hes a great lad to have in the dressing room.Waynes got so much criticism over the past couple of years. I dont understand it. I see his class every day week in week out Hes a top professional footballer. Hes given this game so much given England so much given United so much. Yet people still feel the need to have a pop at him. Hes strong enough to deal with it its water off a ducks back hes had it for many years but its strange when people are still questioning him. Hes Englands leading goalscorer.Jones sees Marcus Rashford learning off the likes of Ibra and Wayne dealing with the demands. Marcus is a very wise boy. What hes done for us in such a short space of time is unbelievable. Hell be a worldbeater for this club for many years to come.Such has been Joness own form that he should join Rashford in the next England squad adding to his  caps. When they went to France for Euro  I was in Antigua watching all the games he recalls. I genuinely thought we had a real chance. We had a very very good team full of youth exciting players and it just didnt happen. It was gutting. I couldnt believe the amount of stick they got. Thats where footballers have to be really mentally strong.Hopefully we can turn a corner under Gareth Southgate. Ive not spoken to him personally. But hes a good young manager whos been at Middlesbrough done the unders knows the England setup inside and out and the players want to play for him. Im sure were heading in the right direction now and hopefully we can do well at a tournament.,reddevils,dcgcwq4,70,t5_2rxse

Top  are playing each other very frequently still until March th then another three game weeks in a row. Only thing Im worried about is securing points after the away game at Stoke which arguably is always hard. I think even though we didnt finish our chances in this game out of recent memory we are on a general upswing.

I have no problem with the self promotion articles as the crap ones will be downvoted and the good ones promoted. Also having people self promote articles will hopefully give interaction between the reddevils community and whoever wrote the article which is much more interesting and creates more debate than a lot of self posts as you have something normally better formatted and expressed to deal with. Also I am going to be honest I have never come on reddevils and thought there was too much to read. How many times will most of us throughout a day come back to check and see its all the same stuff we read and checked on  minutes ago. I dont see more content as a bad thing and self posts tend to be crap. Essentially i dont see the purpose in putting artificial barriers between people looking for man utd content and those creating it. In regards to the videos just let the first one stay as it is useful content we want to see and it doesnt hurt the reddevils community in anyway going to these guys channels. edit just to stay low quality spamming self promotion I am bored on with being removed but if its selfpromotion in the sense of here is a blog i wrote on x and y then i think it helps both parties tremendously  ,reddevils,dcvtt2x,1,t5_2rxse

He is making too many fancy flicks in the wrong areas holding onto the ball too long. Needs to put his head back down and get back to basics. Carrick has also really slowed down lately.Also I am the first to praise Jose for his attacking subs when we are losing but fuck me Jose needs to not be so timid when we are i  the lead.

Its unacceptable that Martial keeps getting dropped when he was our best outfield player last season.Tired of this excuse that he has poor work ethic or isnt putting in performances. Everyone was glowing about the kids demeanor approach and performances last season but now all of a sudden hes not committed to playing at his peak level? Just rubbish from Mou and its what hes done in the past blame results or problems on young players and exile or mistreat them.Every single young player on the team looks worse than last season or arent getting games Martial Shaw Rashford Lingard and even FosuMensah these guys save TFM were all big performers for us last year when they played and have now been relegated to rotational players in the squad and arent playing nearly as well as they did last year.,reddevils,dd8o555,4,t5_2rxse

I also did a bulletproof coffee in the mornings with some of this MCT oil and then a large lunch and chicken  steamed veg for dinner. I used myfitnesspal to make sure I stuck to my goal calories Im very overweight so my current limit is  cals. However I still find it hard to eat that much some days.I dont do cheat days etc because it then takes another  days to get back into Ketosis which is just time lost. My thinking is that Ive had enough cheat days in my life already so this year is about focusing on losing weight and gaining muscle then I can slowly bring back carbs etc into my diet!I really think its worth sticking to it and the initial struggle of what to eat? how much to eat? etc is worth it  good luck!,reddevils,dd9x4ra,1,t5_2rxse

10606336,0,t1_dd9x04h,Its nothing like Mkhitaryan. Mkhi basically started one game had a poor performance and got benched. He was then kept out because others in his position started to play well. Then he got injured and that prolonged his return. With Martial he has played well and then benched and ignored. Those playing in his position havent performed better than him in any way. Plus Jose went public with comments against his agent. Its a messy situation and it seems to be one in which Martial is being unfairly treated. That seems to be getting to him too. We know from last season that hes a bit of an introvert and this will in no way help him settle of boost his confidence especially when he gets benched after registering two assists in a match. ,reddevils,dd9ynlk,3,t5_2rxse

10640565,0,t1_dddgp23,I think we need more fluidity rather than the static choices.Personally if we had Rashford Mkhi and lingard behind Ibra and Pogbacarrick behind them  but they switch sides we would run rings around most defences in the league whilst also providing something in defence. Lingard isnt always rated by many but his runs and switching sides creates so much room for the forward which is what Ibra needs. If Marital is switched in with any of the  and they play swapping sides as then e would be more potent. however regardless of this we need to up our finishing. Today even though we won by  we should have a couple more. Ill only be content when we start scoring goals regularly regardless of how well individualplayers play.,reddevils,dddhr2h,2,t5_2rxse

If its Juan Mata whos having a fine season nobody complains that much when hes benched. We need rotation yeah hes playing well but its not as if Rashford is dogshit. Im sure Martial wouldve come on vs Hull if Jones didnt get injured. I dont get the outrage. Its not even a Mkhi situation hes not playing as well as last season and we have  new attacking players brought in who are in form. He still gets games. In form hes our best LW but hes not in form ATM. I think its fine to rotate with Rashford. ,reddevils,dde88b2,12,t5_2rxse

10665774,0,t1_ddg0yvp,Rashford is also far more willing to run in behind defences which is important when most of our other attackers want to drop deep to collect the ball and be involved with the playbuild up Ibra Mata Lingard even Mkhi to an extent all do this. Martial always wants the ball to feet so that he can turn with it ball under control and go at the fullback. Thats great but he never wants to run beyond the full back and receive the ball into the space. I think that is something he can look to add to his game as he develops. If all our players want to come short and nobody is running in behind to stretch the defence then the defence has little to do bar shifting across side to side monitoring our possession. We need those runs to drag defenders away and open up spaces. ,reddevils,ddg3dj2,18,t5_2rxse

10716873,0,t3_5tai4o,Preseason at Manchester United and Jose Mourinho pulls Antonio Valencia to one side. It was one of our first conversations revealed Valencia this week.He said When I was coach at Real Madrid I wanted to sign you as my right back but United said no. It was great to hear because every player needs the coachs trust. For me it was a big moment.Valencias season has not been short of big moments. It was not long ago that many thought the yearold was on his way out of Old Trafford. He feared it too. New attacking players had been bought and it seemed the Ecuadoreans race was run.But as United try to extend their unbeaten Premier League run at home to Watford on Saturday Valencia will be in the team. A winger all his career he is a right back now a switch that looks permanent.He has proved himself good enough to make  league starts and on handing him a new contract last month Mourinho described him as the most accomplished right back in world football.I am very happy and Im very grateful for the managers words he said. I dont believe Im the best but I am really pleased to still be here.There was a time when I saw players of the class of Angel di Maria and Memphis Depay arriving and wondered if my time was reaching an end. Perhaps I needed to start looking for a new club. Thankfully I just concentrated and trained hard and maybe thats why Im still here.That may seem ambitious and the broad grin on Valencias face indicates that he knows it too. You wouldnt put too much past him though.Valencia has already survived one careerthreatening injury to build a second career at United and this season broke a bone badly in his right arm only to be back on the field three weeks later.I broke my leg against Rangers in  and it did cross my mind that I might not be able to play again at all he recalled.It was a bad injury and a hard recovery but I have nothing but thanks for the medical team here. It was them more than my own work that got me back. But I did worry of course.This season it was a complicated operation on my arm but at least you can protect it with a cast. You cant do that with a leg!With your arm you can play as it heals. Its just my arm.There was some pain yeah. At first it was hurting and I was scared about falling. But you just want to play at this club.Thats not because you are scared of missing your place but just because you enjoy playing so much. If I dont play you miss all the fun.Earlier in the season there didnt seem that much fun at Manchester United. Results under Mourinho were poor and everything looked a little like hard work. As spring beckons however United are on the hunt for a topfour place and have an EFL Cup final to play two weeks on Sunday.At the clubs AON Training Centre on Thursday there was certainly much to enjoy. The Manchester United Foundation were holding their third SchoolsUnited event as children joined Valencia Paul Pogba and five other firstteam players to try a series of footballrelated challenges. At the same time  teammates were meeting children at schools across Manchester.Valencia also runs his own foundation at home in Ecuador and said Its great being here and knowing we are helping out and doing our bit to help Manchester Uniteds image and footballs image as a whole.I am always grateful to have this life and football has made that life for me. Its always important to do something for others who have the same dreams that I used to have. The club does lots like this.After the session is over Valencia sits in an adjacent dressing room and looks back over his life less ordinary.He has been a United player since  and is four short of  league appearances. He has two Premier League titles an FA Cup and League Cup and played in the  Champions League final defeat against Barcelona.Asked if he could ever have dreamed of this as he grew up in the poor oil town of Lago Agrio in the northeast of Ecuador he laughed.It would have been impossible to believe because at that age I never thought I would travel further than the corner of my own street he said.Lago Agrio was carved out of the Amazon rainforest in the s when oil was discovered. Its a tough town and Valencias upbringing was hard.His house  a shack in all honesty  was opposite the Carlos Vernaza Football Stadium and that provided a lifeline for a young boy who took his ball to school every day.His education was basic and his school reports modest at best but it was a decision made at the age of  that set Valencia on his journey to the Premier League.Hearing that Ecuador Serie A team El Nacional were hosting trials Valencia borrowed the bus fare from his mother to make the mile journey to Quito. He never told his father and he never came back. It was pure nerves that I was suffering on that journey because I didnt know where I was going to sleep or eat he recalled.I really didnt know what the future would hold but I had a huge hope and desire to play football you understand? Thats all I was thinking about nothing else.I can remember it like yesterday. It will always be etched in my memory because its still a motivation for me.I remember when we arrived at the complex. There were bunk beds in the dormitory. Another kid gave me some sheets saying that was all he had to help me with. Other kids offered their support too. And thats what I remember about my first night there. Ill never forget it.Valencia sailed through the trial the next day and progress at El Nacional was rapid. Recently Uniteds inhouse TV station travelled to Ecuador with Valencia to visit the club.The brilliant programme is called The Amazon to Old Trafford and is on YouTube. In that footage esteemed Ecuador midfielder Juan Carlos Burbano tells how the young Valencia resembled a jaguar running past a cactus. Valencia meanwhile recalls being given his first pair of boots.They were a white pair of adidas he said. Before that I had only plimsolls.These days he is viewed as his countrys best ever player and most famous export. As a young player the regime was strict at a club attached to the army.,reddevils,ddld6q6,59,t5_2rxse

They signed Oscar because he is a known name that they can use to market and bring credibility and exposure to the league.

Naturally quite excited.So I get to him and as a nervous  year old I hurriedly asked if he could sign all three things for me. He said abruptly please.I was confused and he just stared blankly at me. Say please. I then felt very embarrassed having been scolded by an idol of mine yes Foster was one of my idols I was and am still a big fan.I complied and then he just smiled and laughed to himself put a hand on my shoulder and got someone to come and take a picture even though I hadnt asked for one. Its a fond memory.I know hes a City lad but I lived in a small country and there were a handful of people in the entire stadium so that meet with the England squad was quite personal. As the only goalkeeper there Joe Hart took an interest in me and he talked to me about it. Incredibly kind and Ill never forget that he was the one that proactively sought out the conversation not me.Aside from that Ive met Rooney Beckham Kagawa Brown Evra Nani and nearly De Gea but I got a thumbs up and a smile as he walked away so Ill take it. Here are the gloves and United kit I got him to sign. Yes nearly  years on I still regret having the names written on underneath.Myself with our recordbreaking captain as well because why not.  ,reddevils,de9jxyr,13,t5_2rxse

11112058,0,t1_derf5d3,gt But essentially it should be used for any and all decisions with managers or captains if that works better being given the opportunity to challenge  decisions per game maybe more maybe less see how it goes exactly as currently works really well in Rugby.Firstly thats not whats being proposed. We can wax theoreticals all we want but the reality is that the process being implemented is completely up to the refs discretion at the moment. Even if we do take a challenge system there are plenty of inherent problems. I dont watch rugby so Im ignorant to the length and type of plays being reviewed but I also know that football has a lot more complicated and subjective fouls than Rugby. I cant imagine a scenario on a difficult review that takes less than  seconds to a minute. This is an issue. On every single other sport I have watched reviews take quite a long time. Lets look at a hypothetical the manager throws a challenge after a suspected handball who does he communicate which play he wants to challenge to? th official? Could this all be done without interrupting the middle ref?. Maybe it was in the box. The other team has the ball and is countering. You say that its up to the refs discretion to allow play go on which is problematic so play continues and the other team scores. Maybe someone gets injured on the play trying to defend the goal. During play the refs up in the booth have been reviewing the handball but cant determine definitively whether or not it is one the call is subjective as a lot of handballs are. The middle ref and players are standing around now waiting for a decision. After a delay the booth comes to a decision that it was a handball. The goal is disallowed. The injured player is subbed off and the team that threw the challenge now has a penalty which they score. The goal wins them the game. Theres still tons of controversy after the game because no one agrees on what is and isnt a handball. What did the technology accomplish?The fact is that there will still be a percentage of reviewed calls that are wrong. This is an extreme scenario but they will absolutely happen. And what happens when they do? I hear you that youre still cutting down on a lot of bad calls but I dont think youre hearing me that youre sacrificing too much for that.Also you say minimum  challenges per game. How much time does that add up to in stoppage from arguing etc? How does Rugby work in that regard? As Ive mentioned stoppages allow the networks opportunity to introduce commercials. Maybe not at first but mark my words at some point commercials will begin. It has happened to every other sport Ive seen with video review. Who would football be any different?gtLinesmenRefs should be encouraged to be more lenient with offsides so as to facilitate this obviously a few decisions will slip through the net but this will be a mere fraction of the countless wrongfully alloweddisallowed offside goals which occur every weekend and ruin games.Fair enough. Ill accept that this would be worth a trial. I dont see why technology similar to goal line cant be developed but so be it. gtAnd perhaps there should be a rule where you can only appeal decisions which would lead to direct goalscoring opportunities eg. penalties free kicks just outside the box counter attacks where youre clean through offsides etc.. or ones which could result in a sending off which should be determined by the ref at the same  see the comment on frivolous appeals in order to prevent them being used to A Waste time or B Prevent an opponent from counter attacking.Even with the refs overruling ability there will be plenty of instances that allow for a manager to use challenges to disrupt the flow of the game. I can already see Mourinho licking his lips at this possibility. Its pretty easy to have a player dive around the edge of the box for example so that the manager can throw a challenge flag if its not called. Youre adding even more decision making to the middle refs plate by forcing him to confront whether or not he should allow a review. There are plenty of opportunities for exploitation and bias there. gtObviously this wont undo all wrong doing and bad decisions in the game and some decisions are so close to call they just come down to opinion eg. Neymars penalty on Wednesday which to me is a definite penalty but a video ref may disagree but thats fine. I can appreciate understand that some stuff is just pure interpretationopinion of the rules. The main thing I want to see end is the ridiculous offsideonside situation which plagues most game players getting wrongly sent offnot being sent off when they should be and blatantly shitty penalties decisions. If we fix the clear wrong decisions which  of people agree on with replays which are constantly massively changing the outcome of games it will be well worth it.Thats all great and I agree with it in theory. But Im not arrogant enough to pretend to anticipate all of the unforseen consequences. Who knows how the game will change because a manger can challenge now. Who knows how much stoppage everything ends up taking. Who knows whether TV networks will do all they can to push for ingame commercials. My point being by introducing these rules  even if they are minimal at first  will create the possibility for the game to change in a big way unlike anything we have seen before. You cant compare it to twofooted tackles and back passes because its entirely different. It has the potential to completely reshape the game and when TV networks and organizations like FIFA are involved I dont trust them to keep the integrity of the game intact. Once we cross the line theres no going back. ,reddevils,derjjbp,2,t5_2rxse

11135751,0,t1_deu7vgh,Okay I see what you mean now. However wouldnt that just lead to issues that we saw during LVGs tenure? He brought in around  players during his first season and we can safely say in hindsight it didnt work. It disrupts the team and the more players you buy the higher the chance that some wont work out. I feel we need a few windows of buying quality of quantity in order to slowly build the team. We can build the midfield now around Pogba and we have a defence which can be built around Bailly. If we can get Ibra to extend for another season we can slowly add players to replace and play off of him. I just think that after the botched windows of the past we do need to take our time and ensure were buying United quality players otherwise we end up in a situation like were in now needing to replace players that only joined a few years ago. ,reddevils,deu85tv,2,t5_2rxse

His shotstopping ability was never in doubt and Sven Goran Ericsson not sure if I spelt that right apologies remarked after leaving City that the club decided to go with Joe Hart not because he was better than Kasper but because he was English. Hes better than Citys Claudio Bravo imo definitely better than Pools Mignolet amp the other non existent geezer... I could even see him starting for Athletico Madrid. Is Oblak a better keeper than KS? I honestly believe hes that good now. Time will tell where he ends up but there will be no shortage of big time suitors.

11455863,0,t1_dfu3866,Hes been very honest in his answers lately. In the space of  minutes he breaks down and explains a part of the difficulty of bringing up youth at the higher levels. His comments about him giving instructions in the game make me think of dancers rehersing. Why are those comments a bad thing? Dancers get absolutely drilled with instructions. Why is a footballer at that age different? Shaw obviously isnt good enough to start and has pretty much relied on athleticism and instinct but at this level thats not enough.His comment about money are also very true. Getting so rich so young cant be good for everybody. Too many it will get to their head. Hell not even money will just do that simply being signed. How many players have not made it because they thought they were the bees kness thats a term? at age ? Wasnt there a major talent in the  group who basically didnt make it because he was too full of himself and so he didnt train as well as the ones who made it? SAF used to make a point of not giving youngster too much money too early in their career. They had to earn their wages.

11462941,0,t3_63kgl9,Were still favorites to win the Europa League and top four is still ours to lose. We have opportunities in front of us and we have a lot of important games left to play. OP is correct this sub has a section of fans that like to implode when we draw or lose. Id argue its because they fail to see the bigger picture.Ive watched every game this season and have seen a massive improvement from the beginning of the season until now. We arent playing poorly were finishing poorly. The team is creating chances and is providing entertaining football and just needs to work on their end product.We still have a lot of games left to play and all of these are significant. We could still end this season with two major pieces of silverware and a top four finish. Weve done this playing entertaining attacking football that has simply missed the end product. Sure some teams are scoring more than us and some teams will undoubtedly finish higher than us in the Premier League. But what else have any of these teams achieved? A place above us without it getting them silverware? Cool have fun SpursCityPool. Top four is all they have.Point is stop and consider things as a whole. We as the fans begged for one thing the previous  seasons attacking football. This season we finally have it but we just cant get the goal at the end. Its a work in progress and weve come a long way. Just support the damn team and the players and realize theyre trying to provide highly entertaining football as well as trophies.

11472432,0,t1_dfwdr4l,The difficulty of the league is relative to the perspective from which it is viewed. In relation to certain objectives it might be considered harder. In relation to other factors it might be perceived as easier. The ease at which teams pick up points might suggest an easier task to accomplish. All thats necessary for that to happen is a larger disparity in the quality of teams. In any case my original point remains. We werent better than any team that ended up above us.

I was hoping Jose would by now have a fixed eleven but every game there are different lineups formation etc. There was a time in the Everton game Herrera was right back Fellaini and Lingard managed to play  minutes of absolutely terrible football and they werent benched which was ridiculous.Last season De Gea Smalling and Martial carried us and especially martial going forward now its Ibrahimovic pulling the team and its unhealthy to have such an overreliance on a  year old.If we play Chelsea Arsenal Man City Tottenham etc the way we have been playing we will be destroyed.,reddevils,dfwellw,5,t5_2rxse

Well see.I also made hamburgers for the first time in my life last night and they turned out quite alright. I used this recipe as a foundation and modified a couple of things.

11584683,0,t1_dg9427p,Because we had a better conversion rate doesnt mean we didnt have some poor finishing in games. Football isnt about creating the most chances. Several teams ahead of us have score far more goals on far less chances. Had we a better striker wed have done far more with whatever little chances we created. Weve missed more chances this season sure but that doesnt mean we didnt miss quite a few chances last season as well. Ill refer you to the West Ham and Chelsea games at home for a quick refresher. Everyone talks about us creating more chances but its literally been just Zlatan and Pogba. Both have the most amount of shots this season.  Far more than any other player in the team. We had Fellaini instead of Pogba last season. Surely theres no way wed have created as many chances as this season. ,reddevils,dg94pwz,2,t5_2rxse

11610040,0,t1_dgbyi1s,A large part of Pogbas price is because of his young age and future potential though  we didnt buy him back expecting a finished product. His inconsistency inability to take charge of the midfield and relatively poor finishing are all somewhat typical problems for a lot of young players...hell develop the responsibility and confidence as he ages. Thats something that just takes time and you really cant force it. Given that hes young and went from playing with experienced midfielders at Juventus who can help him to playing in a different league under a different manage as the star of the team I think hes done okay this season.

Hes creative when attacking for sure but he isnt in the same league as PogbaVidalKroosModric that would play that more boxtobox or creative role so if we have ambitions of beating squads like the ones Real and Bayern put out last night he probably would need to be upgraded in that spot. Playing farther back I think avoids that since he can do the dirty work while Pogbanew player do the creative and controlling work. We very well could just bring in a new CDM and have Herrera be cover when we play a  or be the rd when we play a . Playing him deeper just gives us more options as to who we could target. ,reddevils,dghko3f,11,t5_2rxse

11765006,0,t1_dgtl019,gt Frankly I think the role of captain is overrated.Definitely.gt Zlatan Rio Evra etc. were never captains here but having that veteran presence is really important. You cant replicate it and its silly to throw it awayAbsolutely but it has to be presence that delivers on the field. If they cant actually play and be out there organising on the field then it doesnt mean shit.Without being on the field theyre not offering anything that the manager or coaches arent bringing and were not paying coaches k a damn week.Amazing captains or better yet leaders and experienced players as captain is just a title like Terry Puyol Keane etc.. make a difference on the field a massive difference of course especially defensively.But if theyre not on the field they aint doing shit. Barca didnt win in  because Puyol was on the bench all season. Chelsea didnt win this season because Terry was making inspirational speeches at half time and we didnt win in  because of Bryan Robson.Its extremely clear at this point that Rooney isnt an on pitch player anymore. He plays vs shite sides where we dont need to help. In big games when players are fit hes lucky to make the bench. So his experience to me is worth nothing but whenever we need experience he isnt good enough on field to actually play.

11777525,0,t1_dguzvsb,To be honest I havent seen more than  Monaco matches this season so I cant comment on Silva. His stats are pretty good though Im often wary of wingers coming from Ligue . They often perform so much better in Ligue  than in the premier league. Koke? Hes mostly played CM for the last two seasons I believe and can fill in on the wing. Not sure hes exactly the cutting edge kind of player we need. Yeah of course there are players that scouts can pickup I was more talking about big established players that I can say are a level above Mkhitaryan. I think its much harder to say that on players relatively new to the scene  especially given I havent seen most of them...I get that though Ive always thought of James as someone who really loves to play football above all else. Di Maria left Real cause he wanted Ronaldos wages not because he wasnt being played. That is the sort of player I dont want. If James moves to us its because he wants to play top level football again for a big club I dont think hed suffer the same fate as Di Maria.,reddevils,dgv0q27,1,t5_2rxse
11778132,0,t1_dgv3476,That one I agree with you I thought he should have been subbed between . Pogba also could have taken it easy and not made those crazy runs he does for the last  minutes but I dont blame him for that. I also understand Joses thinking. We needed to win and only had a one goal cushion. If they nicked one right after Pogba came off all of a sudden its twitchy ass time at the end. It was only a  lead regardless of how dominant we looked. ,reddevils,dgv37ch,5,t5_2rxse

11789819,0,t1_dgvxtej,Oh I dunno some here have been wanting to replace him for quite some time. I didnt realize there was this much support for a player who doesnt have the skills or the style to match how we want to see this team play. Yet everyone has no shortage of reasons why they want to keep him around. Its a selfish way of thinking. He deserves better too. He deserves to be in a team like Everton where he would be used properly and reach that level of heights again. Keeping him her bc he could be used in a pinch or we need a Plan B or he did well when others were injured are all selfish reasons that arent really why we should have a player of that level here. We can do better in that role and he can get better opportunities elsewhere.,reddevils,dgwez21,6,t5_2rxse

11792272,0,t1_dgweryq,I for one voted everyone apart from Januzaj to stay. Why? Because we cant properly strenghten our squad and replace these players in one transfer window. I agree that some of them might not be good enough to play at that level but they are still some kind of squad option. We need to have big squad given our injuries problems in recent years and another year in Europe. Of course I reckon some of them might want to leave in the summer and I wouldnt say no if they asked to leave. Its just that if they are happy to play smaller role in the club I wouldnt force them out.,reddevils,dgwozk6,1,t5_2rxse
