5769762,0,t3_3tv8ah,I had been meaning to suggest this for the previous nonUWP app but held off because I knew there new one was coming.It would be great to have the option to turn off NSFW images for wallpapers and lock screens. In the previous app they were included if theyre off by default in the new one then I guess users would appreciate being able to turn them on.Getting a bit more advanced now but it would also be awesome to have an alternate setup for a specific time of day. Nothing too advanced simply a start time and end time like Quiet Hours has. During this period it will update from a different set of subsNSFW configurations.,readit,cxcajit,1,t5_2qhc3
