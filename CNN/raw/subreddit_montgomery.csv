3057026,0,t1_cobj3zr,I highly doubt anyone will protest. If you want to talk about throwing stones you should start with the boulders that the lgbt community has been tossing especially Patricia todd and her threats to expose the private lives of her coworkers.I have no problem with recognition of same sex marriage but it has to be done without the lbgt community doing stupid shit like suing private businesses in order to get their way  example  the case against the baker who refused to design the wedding cake.Probate judges can legally stop offering marriage ceremonies at courthouses none of the judges ever said they wouldnt offer tje license they just stopped ceremonies. ,montgomery,coeuwsf,0,t5_2se3j

5917537,0,t3_3wcutj,The wings place that took up the former Sonic building in the Forest Hills shopping center on Atlanta highway isnt bad. Baumhowers is OK I guess. The new Buffalo Wild Wings is a damn sight better than the old one. If you find yourself in Troy Trojan Zone has pretty good wings. I dunno. Im not a wings connoisseur. Others will have stronger opinions. ,montgomery,cxvbjm0,2,t5_2se3j

9201753,0,t1_d8i34cb,Ok do not explore anything off any of the exits off of I. Everything north of you is a high crime area and they target people with out of town plates specifically. For a walmart the one on Chantilly Parkway is the best one for you. Also dont get off any of the exits on I from where it begins till at least Perry Hill Road unless you know exactly where you are going. Avoid most of the Boulevard after dark and pretty much everything inside it except cloverdale. Parks Try Prattville. Places to eat We have most major chains and a few decent places. Expect lousy service at any chain. For shopping other than walmart type stuff there is eastchase. Dont go to Eastdale Mall. Edit If the kids are old enough we do have a really nice zoo. There is a playground in there as well. Just dont hang out in the neighborhood around the zoo. ,montgomery,d8ie1np,7,t5_2se3j
