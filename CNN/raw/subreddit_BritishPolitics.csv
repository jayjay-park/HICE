This has been controversial especially when some of the unemployed ended up as stewards for the Queens Jubilee celebrations. ...is an absurd way of justifying workfare. ButgtOverall his proposal sounds to me like something that wouldnt look out of place in a Conservative briefingIn a caricature of a Tory briefing Id say. This kind of sums up my problem with this kind of position given that its now mandatory to be in some form of training until the age of  this more or less extends that period to  unless the individuals concerned are in a position where they can support themselves while they find a job without jobseekers allowance. It actively punishes people looking for work. It adds to the growing assumption that people are expected to live with their parents into their twenties.

2767154,0,t3_2rra4y,I wrote a longer post a couple of months ago about thisgtThe quality of a debate which is normally low as it is is inversely proportional to the number of participants. You cant have debaters properly crossexamining each others policies when there are too many people to do that with in the time youre given. Whats more you have less time to make your points the more participants there are. It means you quickly approach a cap on the number of participants before the debate is rendered entirely pointless  and a series of interviews would be more informative. So with each participant added you have less time to make your points and more points to make... You cant take an as many as possible approach though it would be nice if the debate format realistically allowed it.gtIf there is to be a solid criteria it should be on the basis of a combination of factors. Labour and the Conservatives should be included as the only guarantee about the next Government is that it will involve at least one of those parties. The Lib Dems have a substantial number of MPs and are part of the current Government and deserve to defend their record. UKIP poll higher than the Lib Dems and have come second in every? byelection for the past couple of years with the exception of that one two now that they won as well as the European Parliament elections where they topped the poll.gtThe fifth party if we exclude regional parties and consider the Greens of EampW and the Scottish Greens to be the same party is the Green Party. While they do occasionally poll higher than the Lib Dems they dont on a consistent basis like UKIP which polls a multiple of the LD support. While they do have an MP thats pretty much all they have and a bit like Respect its due to concentrated support in a single constituency not a nationwide trend like UKIP. The Lib Dems have just under .gt...gtLets put some numbers on this. Suppose a debate is  minutes long. With  debaters as is the result of your proposal that having a single MP should qualify you for a national debate each speaker gets a mere seven and a half minutes. Less really because thats not taking into account that the moderator will also be speaking as well as probably members of the audience. You cant have a meaningful debate like that. The public cant possibly take anything from it. Put it up to two hours  thats still only a theoretical ten minutes each.gtIt does not follow from the idea that democracy is healthiest at its most diverse that a debate is the best way to go forward with this. In my opinion they are not compatible with a parliamentary democracy. ... It puts too much focus on a presidential style and you rarely get anything of much substance out of them.gtA series of major interviews broadcast at prime time would do better. Doorstep campaigning would do better. Debates are one of those things which sound like a good idea but they really arent. And worse still when we increase the number of participants beyond the capabilities of the format.It goes without saying Cameron is doing this either as a way of getting out the debates there were years and years between the USAs first and second presidential debate rounds or as a ploy to try and split the left vote and dilute the coverage UKIP gets from them. In my opinion if we are to have debates at all which we shouldnt the Green party have no claim whatsoever to a place on them and indeed it would be damaging for them to do so.,BritishPolitics,cnim5b7,9,t5_2qo7h

They then resolutely failed to follow up on these people being served ANs.This report and its predecessor the Jay Report is definitely worth reading from start to finish even if it does take you a couple of hours. The bullshit being slung by the right about this being a race issue is only a tiny part of the terrifyingly incompetent and malicious whole  reading this makes me sad that there isnt an equivalent of an Inquisition to immediately take control of Rotherham as the incumbent council is manifestly incompetent corrupt and possibly colluding with the abusers.,BritishPolitics,coaxm6u,6,t5_2qo7h

3048773,0,t1_codm0fg,gtUnfortunately the economic bottom line prevents the ideal conditions from being the norm. Of course it does. Current ethical standards allow for a bare minimum of humane treatment in my opinion and even then many suppliers and providers fly as close as they can to that limit sometimes beyond because they cannot afford to do otherwise. When Tescos and the like pay dairy farmers so little that they make a loss on the herds they keep you know somethings wrong and those that manage to stay in business somehow are often thought no source to hand to break the law in order to do so.Nobody should feel guilty about having meat in their diet. And given the current economic climate its understandable for people to seek out cheaper food. But my beef ho ho! is with the supermarkets that practically force farmers into unethical standards so that they the supermarkets can still turn a profit.Where we the public come in is our use of supermarkets because they are cheap and convenient. We are content to not question where our food comes from as long as it looks nice.There is no doubt that animals reared for food deserve as decent an existence as we are able to give them but the truth is that the majority dont get that. The truth is that standards are set too low and farmers in order to stay in business dont always adhere to those standards either because otherwise they cannot sell their product at the measly prices the supermarkets set. And supermarkets are too willing to buy food from overseas at an even lower price where standards may be even lower.

Theoretically the SNP could be as conservative as UKIP. But because they reflect Scottish politics theyre broadly socialist. Thus having socialist policies are a sideeffect of those raisons detre but it is those sideeffect policies that draw people from outside the core demographics Scots and environmentalists to the SNP and the Greens and give them that broad level of support.,BritishPolitics,cq8yia7,2,t5_2qo7h

In fact Labours economic policy diverts a considerable amount of money that comes out of cuts into investment and getting the economy moving again so there is a withinmeans stimulus featured and its not a noninterventionist attitude. The horrific mispresentation of Labours economic policy as well as what economists were saying in the Tory policy bash is not an endorsement of the radical public spending plans of groups like the Greens in the slightest its a criticism of the noninterventionist and ideologicallydriven version of austerity the Tories have adopted.

4896347,0,t1_cub3z0i,I see your point but I think it is a little more complex than that.  From a purely business perspective a resource that costs  million per year is different to one costing  thousand per year.  In any other type of contract the  million deal would require much more scrutiny and protections to make sure that the company gets value for money.  But hiring is completely different than that.  As salary increases the risk to the employee is reduced and the risk to the company increases.  You get a highly incestuous relationship where good performance is attributed to management and poor performance to the lower paid work force.  There is very little penalty for failure.  It feels a lot like a monopoly where a cartel try and increase prices through artificial scarcity instead of competing properly.Beyond a certain salary people should be treated as a separate business with contracts that protect the company.  It should always be possible to fire those people without any cost if they do not perform. An interesting approach would be to treat corporate governance in a similar vein to accounting or legal services.  You engage a trusted firm with experience to provide CEO services.  Instead of a single premadonna you get a team of experts.  ,BritishPolitics,cubq1yb,3,t5_2qo7h

ISIS must be stopped they are a truly evil organisation. However military intervention is not necessarily the only way or best way or even a good way to stop them. Military interventions can have enormous unintended side effects the rise of ISIS itself for example and their direct effects can be pretty atrocious too even with the best of intentions all those various civilian casualties in our wars in the middle east.gt Only ISIS is to blame for the executions they have committed.I completely agree. However the UK US and others all share a large part of the responsibility and blame for the existence of ISIS in the first place given that the organisation grew out of a situation directly created by our military actions in the middle east.  We therefore have an obligation not only to fix the mess we made ie stop ISIS but also not to repeat the same mistakes as before.Regarding the Kurds as well as religious minorities and GSRM people in the middle east those are all examples of groups who obviously we should support in their fights for representation and freedom from oppression. I understand that for the Kurds in particular theyve been forced to fight this in very literal terms through actual warfare. However that doesnt mean that is the only way to fight for these minorities. Direct external military intervention on our part has been the source of a huge enemy for these groups in ISIS and has undoubtedly harmed them in the short term obviously well have to see in the long term. Though our military actions in the middle east could be seen as supporting these groups and honestly Id need some convincing that that has been even a minor consideration in why were actually at war in that part of the world it has unfortunately been actually harmful to them. If we want GSRM people in the middle east to be protected and represented there are many ways to go about it other than military intervention.,BritishPolitics,cxkz31m,1,t5_2qo7h

9317866,0,t1_d8x3lv0,Whether migrants are more educated than the British population is irrelevant we should have high standards in any case.Well assimilation takes multiple forms cultural is the primary. To truly take root its only really down to the nd and rd generations for that. Ethnic assimilation is course very long term youre looking at maybe  generations or more and that assumes that they interbreed with the native population. Given the way migration is handled at the moment thats just not what happens people have an ingroup preference and side with their own. I wish we truly were one human race and all that but people keep to their own I learnt this through seeing other ethnicities religious groups etc. do so. Muslims are probably the most obvious group as theyre readily distinguishable and have no real desire to assimilate to British culture.Never assumed you were having a go at me no worries friend.No assimilation should be cultural a blending into society around them. As previously stated Muslims do not really integrate well into society they have their in group preference and do not wish to forgo their religious ideals for a western secular society. Them having conservative views does not equate them to this kind of assimilation. Culture is a difficult thing to define by its very nature attitudes and behaviour does encompass it to a large part but thats not the whole story. At the risk of repeating previous comments made it really only ingrains into people if they are born directly into the culture. ,BritishPolitics,d8x3vy3,1,t5_2qo7h
