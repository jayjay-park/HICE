530285,0,t1_cg0ipdj,Yup. I cant attest that mainline Clojures innards are exactly the same but  in ClojureScript at least  the entire process to compile a string of code into an executable result looks something like this Read the string of code and parse it to produce primitive data structures lists vectors sets maps symbols keywords numbers strings... basically anything for which theres a literal syntax. This is handled by the reader. Note that at this point nothing has been executed or evaled yet  the data structures produced by the reader arent really executable in and of themselves. Locate and expand data structures forms produced by the reader that comprise macro invocations. Basically if one of the readerproduced forms is a list whose first element is a symbol that names a macro the corresponding macro is executed with the lists remaining elements as arguments. The original list is then replaced with the expanded result. This phase is called macroexpansion or just expansion for short. Walk the Clojure data structures forms produced by the expansion phase and construct a corresponding abstract syntax tree The AST is composed of expression nodes that represent primitive special forms  things like let and fn that have special syntactic significance as well as collection literals like vectors and sets and constants like numbers and keywords. This is called the analysis phase. Finally take the AST produced by the analyzer and emit it  either as JVM bytecode in the case of mainline Clojure or a specific subset of JavaScript in the case of ClojureScript. Only the result of this compilation or emission phase can be independently executed to run a Clojure app.Macroexpansion actually happens pretty early on in the compilation pipeline  just after the read phase but prior to any kind of analysis or compilation proper. Thats because macros operate on forms which are a fairly highlevel representation of Clojure code compared to the AST or raw bytecode generated during subsequent phases of compilation.,Clojure,cg0jtq7,3,t5_2qkej

610254,0,t1_cg9f5a2,In Clojure zippers are the de facto way of dealing with XML data of any significant complexity. This is because of immutability. You cant modify you data so you need to have a way to input a tree to a function and get a new tree back. At least as far as I understand the problem zippers are a way of applying Clojures immutable data structures to trees.Ive mostly been using zippers for extracting and modifying data from XML docs. After I got through the initial conceptual problems it has been a fairly pleasant  way to work.Huets article is also from a functional programming point of view and the examples in the paper are in OCaml.

865249,0,t3_23z5n7,Might sound like a hack but works really really well Windows as main OS running Ubuntu Server inside VirtualBox. I do all development on the virtual Linux tmux  vim  vimfireplace. If I have to reboot Windows Ill just pause VirtualBox i.e. hibernate it. After the reboot I can resume VirtualBox and continue exactly where I was. I connect to it with PuTTY.I have mapped my Linux home directory to Windows as a separate drive via SMB so I can use GUI tools like Beyond Compare on Windows to resolve merge conflicts. Same story for Excel and Photoshop etc.Feels like this gives best of both worlds. Textbased Linux is great while I prefer Windows as the main OS. And this setup works even on my old laptop with slow HDD and only  GB memory. Linux for Clojure development works fine with only  MB RAM in VirtualBox.Ive used plain Linux and plain Windows but this setup fits for me by far the best. Maybe you should give it a try!

4553919,0,t3_3davoe,Hey so I actually had a similar problem to you though coming from the other direction! The last time I did real web dev was back in the CGI days so I totally didnt get the new way of doing things with reverseproxying and stuff like that.Theres not much really integrated framework solutions in Clojure like what I think there is in the node.js world instead its sort of bringtogetheralotofpieces to build your stack. Ill try to describe some of the pieces of interest from generallylowestlevel to higherlevel. HTTP server. You get to pick one but until your project seriously grows a lot just use the next piece of the stack... Ring. This is a library for passing around HTTP requests and responses and munging them until you get the final result for a web request. It takes the initial HTTP request from the HTTP server and it comes with one by default  Jetty and you eventually get a response to feed back to the server. On top of this everything else is layered. Ring is responsible for handling HTTP concepts like sessions and cookies as well. Compojure. This is a minimal library that sits on top of Ring for turning URL paths from requests into function calls. I use Enlive for transforming HTML into what I want the output to be. I dont know anything about React or frontend stuff. For handling user accounts and roles and whatnot you have a couple choices. There is the lowlevel choice of Buddy and the higherlevel choice of Friend which should handle a lot of what you want for you. For persisting things you pick a SQL database that has a JDBC implementation basically all of them do and use org.clojurejdbc to execute your SQL commands against it. You could of course use a nonSQL database too but who does that!Hope that helps. Not sure if I missed anything for you or not.,Clojure,ct4n5ib,2,t5_2qkej

4775976,0,t1_ctwdlwn,The disagreement here is whether having a data representation of the code is the same as being able to manipulate the code directly.Obviously any syntax has to be parsable into data in order for the compiler to work. So this can then be encoded in data structures of the language and manipulated.However the problem here is that you end up manipulating a different representation from the code itself. This incurs additional mental overhead when doing metaprogramming. Meanwhile the sexps syntax allows one to directly manipulate the code without any additional indirection.,Clojure,ctwjylg,2,t5_2qkej

4830282,0,t1_cu37hat,Sure I made a mistake combining the if statements. Thats really tangential to the point of the discussion is it not? Your MathematicalOCaml macros arent handling the else condition either as far as I see and the macro would behave the same way as those in a case of only a positive statement being passed in.However with Clojure I can very easily transform the expression further    defmacro transform if foo if bar x y       cond          not foo nil          and foo bar x          else yThe code I template in the macro looks exactly like regular code I would write by hand.gtAre they used elsewhere? Isnt x special syntax for unquote x?No more than  is a special syntax for hashmap ...gtObjectively the Clojure code is over x longer than the Mathematica code.And?gtThat is true of all three languages.We already went over this about a  times. Clojure allows me to treat code as plain old data structures that can be manipulated by any function that allows me to manipulate a data structure.

6192225,0,t1_cyocryo,Component is ironically the thing that drove me away from Clojure.  Not Component itselfI think Component is a great librarybut rather the realization that after all the shininess of Clojure has worn off the experts still felt a need to have an OO model on top of Clojure to get serviceoriented work done.  I had been feeling it too before Component came out but thought maybe it was me doing something wrong when Component came out it was an affirmation of sorts.Almost immediately Clojure lost its appeal to me.  The REPL IMO the best part of Clojure became less useful as functions either required too many parameters to bother typing or entire dependency trees had to be reloaded just to test one function.  If I was going to work on an OOlike IoCdriven system without a useful REPL Clojure was feeling more and more like an awkward language to use.  I generally use F on mono these days also a great community.I havent tried mount and my initial impression is that it seems a little too much like the old bunchofglobalsingletons mess from the early days of OOP that eventually got replaced by IoC containers.  So it seems a step backward from Component in a way.  However I certainly see where youre going.  It pushes dependencies up to a global def so that your apps functions dont have to take all these dependencies in as parameters.  This allows the parameter list to be short sweet and REPLfriendly and avoid the necessity to reinstantiate your whole protocol tree for every change.  This brings new life to the REPL in serviceorientedapp scenarios.  So maybe.Whatever the case I do agree that Component while it does many things right does the REPL wrong.  And if Clojure is to be more useful in SOA systems this needs to be addressed.  ,Clojure,cythodv,2,t5_2qkej

Ive been doing this for years and my Java Interop normally consists of a few hundred lines of code so its not bad at all. But more importantly most wrapper libs in most languages not just Clojure are pretty subpar. IMO this because they are maintained by volunteers instead of by vendors with skin in the game.

6370083,0,t3_42s4az,Closure compiler has munged my code and now it doesnt work giving the error d.jh is not a function.  How do I debug that?More details I have a Duct webapp that displays a single HTML file which loads a reframebased client app client and server communicate via Sente websocketsserver push.  I have set it up so that it works from REPL ClojureScript is compiled with optimizations none.  The catch is that I have a foreignlibs clause in which I include a JavaScript file that came to me from the previous unClojure version of the app.    foreignlibs file resourcesmyapppublicjslegacyxx.js                                 provides myapp.legacyxxIt all works fine until I make an uberjar with optimizations advanced.   I run the uberjar from commandline making it  listen on port .  In the nginx config I forward everything to ... location  gt tryfiles gt proxypass gt upstream.  Now most of the app works  except the page which has the legacy JS file.  Which gives the aforementioned d.jh is not a function.Now with optimizations none and uberjar I have discovered the similar error pattern goog.inHTMLDocument is not a function.  So this variable might be the cause of trouble but Im not sure and even with simple optimizations the generated code is unreadable.The most curious thing is that if I go to the site through localhost then that page works.  It fails only when I go through localhost i.e. nginx. That was a red herring.  The reason was that Ive copied public files to Nginx directory earlier and forgot about them.So my troubles are several I tried changing optimizations clause to simple or advanced in the dev Figwheel environment but it didnt work I dont remember the exact error. I have no idea how Closure compiler works or how its called from Leiningen its an opaque black box and I dont know how to debug its output. Code that went from ClojureScript to JavaScript to munged JavaScript is no fun. The legacy file is not munged by the Closure compiler but is added asis to the compiled main.js.  For production it would be a good idea to minimize it as well.  How can I do that?In short it was bad enough to setup the ClojureScript toolchain for dev environment now the difficulties in setting it for prod are threefold.,Clojure,czdpiib,1,t5_2qkej
6446120,0,t3_43xtf1,This sounds more like a MapReduce question but Ill try to relate it to Clojure at the end.Assuming that the MR job needs to read in the data before you process the data then the InputFormat that you use determines how the input files get split up.  Ex If you have a text file and are using the provided TextInputFormat that logic is already implemented.  But the way a text file is split is completely unaware to the identifiers in your dataset.  So a stretch of consecutive occurrences of identifier X may straddle the split boundary of your input that is identifier X may appear in separate input part files that get sent to individual mappers.  And you likely wont want to implement your own InputSplit.  So you have to leave it to the reducers to do the grouping you want.  I say grouping because what youve described your output to be is the equivalent of GROUP BY in SQL.If distributing your computation across a cluster werent a requirement and you could run your input through a regular singleprocess Clojure program then partitionby and groupby would split up your particular input into the same groups in different ways.  Just as map operation would do you no benefit neither does the mapper approach in MR make a lot of sense.If you must distribute your computation via MR I highly recommend Cascalog.  Its the highestlevel abstraction on top of MR that Ive seen in Clojure or any other language  its like SQL but with less syntax.  And ultimately what youre describing what you want to do is a SQL GROUP BY  a SQL aggregator fnUDF.  Under the covers Cascalog creates a MR jobs so its all the same as whatever you do in Parkour.Best of luck.,Clojure,czm2htc,1,t5_2qkej

I have a single atom that represents the data model. Then I have different widgets such as text fields dropdown etc. All of these are initialized using a cursor. Whenever the widget updates it notifies the model that the change happened and the model runs any business logic associated with the change. The model is then responsible for updating the fields inside the atom.So lets say we have widgets like weight height and BMI. Whenever the weight or the height are changed the BMI is recalculated. Then both fields are set in the atom and the widgets looking at these fields get repainted.,Clojure,d345jdw,1,t5_2qkej

None of it is necessary to start using them or Reagent however.gtScroll down and look at that dataflow conveyer belt it has !! steps in the conveyer belt. That looks complicated to me!Thats reframe though not Reagent. Its opinionated and it provides its own benefits at the cost of some added complexity. The discussion isnt about reframe though.gtEvent handlersdispatchers In Hoplon event handlers are just jQuery events you get the event passed in and you update the state of whatever is the component.In Reagent components are repainted for you when the Reagent atom changes. The components register observers and are kept in sync with the data. Reagent is responsible for figuring out the minimal change set in the UI and repainting it. In vast majority of the cases you can simply imagine that your entire UI repaints whenever the data changes. This provides a very simple mental model. You can read more about this here with some examples.gtApp db Each component has its own state so youre free to tailornamespacewhatever it to the needs.Reagent is completely agnostic regarding how you structure your data or store it. All it requires is that the data is tied to an atom. You can have one atom many atoms whatever you like really. You can use datascript on top of it and so on.gtHiccup Well Hiccup is a data structure standard that you need to pass to something else to render. Hoplon doesnt have this at all as the HTML tag functions directly create the HTML as soon as they are called.I think this is a huge advantage for Reagent. With Reagent Im just writing data structures describing the UI. The UI declaration can then be manipulated as plain data. This is really powerful because I dont need any tricks like macros to transform the UI. I take advantage of this in my reagentforms library.gtReagent This step doesnt exist in Hoplon because the HTML tag functions already made the DOM and javelin handles stateActually the way Javelin and Reagent atoms work is pretty similar. In Reagent you write the UI using Hiccup and it updates when the atoms change.gtVDOM This step doesnt exist in Hoplon because javelin cells stop propagation when the values do not change and the DOM is only ever changed if a watched cell changes valueHowever as discussed in this thread without the VDOM you cant have batched updates and have to handle certain problems outside Hoplon manuallygtReact Hoplon uses jQuery which is about as simple popular and robust as javascript libraries comeDOM The DOM already was created statically  steps ago but if a cell changes its value we can swap out an attribute or similar or use an iftpl to control the existence of an element. Ive been using Reagent in production for over a year now and I have only a passing familiarity with React. Just like you dont need to know jQuery internals to use Hoplon you dont need to know much about React to use Reagent.gtWe dont try to rebuild a DOM from a VDOM or whatever that sounds like a complicated process.Perhaps you should actually try using Reagent to spike something up instead of speculating about it though.

10566195,0,t1_dd5ruj3,Thanks for clarifying. EDITIt sounds like that certainly puts Vase at the safer end of code generation tools from a commercial perspective.I of course do not to profess to understand how Vase works in detail but looking at actions.clj specifically the actionexprs functions it does appear as if Vase is generating code based on template functions into which data provided by the the user in the form of a Vase API Specification is interpolated. Please do correct me if I am wrong. Another clearly problematic part of the project is the leiningen template that you include which is also EPL licensed. This also makes its way wholesale into apps based on the template.Both of these mechanisms at the bare minimum raises the question of whether or not apps using Vase andor the accompanying template constitute derivative works of Vase with the licensing consequences that follows from that one being that if such apps are distributed they must be accompanied by source code. That might be fine for some scenarios but clearly not for all.As to the EPL being business friendly I am not sure what that means. It is categorised by most scholars as a weak copyleft license often compared to the LGPL. But it still requires that source code is provided if a derivative work of the EPL licensed work is distributed.The sponsors you list are sponsors and backers of Eclipse not the EPL. The EPL works for eclipse and its sponsors amongst reasons because it effectively prevents closed sourced derivative of eclipse. That doesnt mean that it is the right choice for other software.,Clojure,dd5sq67,1,t5_2qkej

10760386,0,t1_ddpqnqq,Warning grumpy opinion inbound. What I think is that these people really dont know what theyre talking about. Rust isnt even close to the same problem space as Clojure. And Go..well Im not sure how anyone can take that language seriously. The type system is really bad and the lack of proper error handling makes it even worse. But enough about other languages. What I think youre seeing is Clojure no longer being on the hype train. That is to say its now over ten years old and so the people who bounce from one language to another every  years have lost interest. Personally Im not concerned about this demographic. If they come to Clojrue...great. But theyll leave as soon as the next hotness arrives be that Elixir Elm Rust or whatever. What I care about are people who pick language for features and matching design tradeoffs not for whats cool. Clojure is really oneofakind. It has some of the best the best? Java interop of any JVM language. Its fast dynamically typed and favors simplicity over all else. This all results in a powerful tool that a small team can use to accomplish complex projects while still leveraging an enterprises existing infrastructure. This is something no other language can boast. Just recently someone told me We adopted Go early on...so were used to maintaining all the libraries we need to talk to databases from Go. What a horrible world to live in! In Clojure when Ive needed to talk to Cassandra Rabbit ElasticSearch etc its as simple as pulling in a JAR from maven and Im writing app level integration code in minutes. If I wanted to talk to one of these libs from Rust Id be writing my own driver for the next few weeks assuming the protocol isnt proprietary and that I can even get documentation for it. Once all thats done good luck getting vendor support on the code you wrote.So all that to say I think youre looking at the wrong metrics. The sort of people who use languages like Clojure day in and day out tend to not hang out in Reddit. Clojure is so powerful that few new features need to touch the core language and instead are implemented as libraries core.async adds Go style primitives and is just a library.Anyway thats my take on it highly biased since Ive been a full time Clojure dev for some time now. But Im one of those people who learned Clojure and never looked back. ,Clojure,ddpuro7,23,t5_2qkej

10886796,0,t3_5vjq54,Theres absolutely a bias we have as software developers to follow the herd. Were reassured when we see lots of recent change lots of contributors and lots of new stuff appearing.In reality I think thats almost exactly the opposite of what should reassure us. With change comes risk. With novelty comes the repeating of mistakes. With lots of contributors comes complexity pivots and politics. For example if I told you that you should buy a KitchenAid blender because the design was worked on by a small team of experts who perfected it such that it has not needed significant change for decades and is expected to last for decades after purchase youd probably give that serious consideration.What if I instead recommended to you blender.js which is a new type of blender that everyone is talking about right now. It was created about a year ago by someone who has never owned a KitchenAid blender but studied blenders in school and is reasonably smart. It has been changed thousands of times since it was created including one major redesign from being ceiling mounted to floor mounted. The last change was a few days ago. Two dozen contributors have committed modules for the blender so you can blend anything  obviously anything you could possibly eat but also scraps of wood aluminum cans even used car tires. The only question is whether this is the right blender for you since you heard Google themselves are sponsoring development of GopherBlend which is a cloud based blending system that can scale up to blending entire neighborhoods.Obviously I understand theres nuance here Im not capturing. But I think its worth thinking about whether we are approaching these things with the right mindset.,Clojure,de2w8vx,82,t5_2qkej

11185022,0,t3_5zfikp,Great talk IntegrantDuct certainly look like theyre going to be an excellent option for building Clojure web apps.One part Im curious about is how the modules would work in practice. Ive considered this approach for Luminus a number of times but ultimately could not find a satisfactory solution.For example you mention that you could have a ClojureScript module and then simply add it to an existing project. However I find that the majority of the change ends up happening in project.clj where I need to add the Figwheel configuration ClojureScript compiler options and so on.My experience is that this type of configuration tends to be fairly project specific. Id be interested to hear more regarding how the DuctIntegrant approach handles configuration and customization for modules.On the other hand if I want to add something like a new database thats just a matter of adding a dependency and a couple of lines for mount defstate. That never seemed like something that would be improved by using modules as opposed to plain libraries. Similarly swapping web servers in Luminus is also just a matter of changing dependencies.Another concern is around flexibility. Since modules require having a common API for each type of module it means that the only thing that can change is the internal implementation. For example depending on whether I use Hiccup or Selmer I would structure the code using these libraries quite differently. Another example would be HugSQL HoneySQL and Korma. Each library facilitates a different workflow. It seems like modules would lose at least some of the flexibility afforded by using libraries.Ultimately I found that the HTTP stack was the one place that could be meaningfully abstracted. Since HTTP stack is a common problem for any web applications it makes it possible to write composable modules. I see Ring middleware libraries effectively as modules providing different functionality around the HTTP stack.,Clojure,dezt58k,6,t5_2qkej

11555257,0,t3_64nv78,A few quick notes for people looking at the TechEmpower benchmarks  Fortunes tends to be the best test for comparison.  In other tests its easy to cheat by skipping large sections of platform processing.  Fortunes forces the test through the entire stack.  The Json and Plaintext tests produce interesting completely useless numbers.  In the words of a wise man these kinds of benchmarks shouldnt be taken too seriously.  I dont think any of the Clojure submissions have been fully tuned  There are thread pools connection pools etc.  Weve all just opted for the most sanecommon defaults using the most common libraries.  I apologize to the community for putting off the Pedestal benchmark for so long.  I never found the TechEmpower benchmarks too compelling and the Pedestal submission was woefully misconfigured.  This has all been addressed but only to the same degree as the other Clojure submissions.  As mentioned in the comments were just waiting for round  to be published.  There are further optimizations we could all do that are more common when tuning production services.  For example the Servlet tests skip routing all together by creating two separate applications and using a conditional check in the main handler.Also I think there are still many optimizations across all the Clojure libs that we havent done because they are low priority minimizing certain allocations string concatenation etc.  Pedestal has some open issues for these if you want to contribute!.,Clojure,dg5sj47,2,t5_2qkej
