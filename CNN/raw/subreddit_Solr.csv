7322345,0,t3_4fngj6,I cant speak for Blacklight as I havent got it up and running yet but in Windows for the Core queries or by using the Velocity UI semibaked into SOLR you can receive the path as a URI that looks a little like fileltpathgt.You can either paste that directly into a browser window and you will receive the option to download the file or you could present it as a clickable hyperlink achieving much the same effect.However in the real world youd more likely want a link to preent to the user the folder area where the path is stored in some form of file explorer. To do that youd have to apply transforms to the URI to handle spaces and other characters but Im afraid thats where my limited knowledge ends.I am also a bit of a newbie at this if a real expert could chip in Im sure we would all be grateful!,Solr,d2ai0vl,2,t5_2si5d
