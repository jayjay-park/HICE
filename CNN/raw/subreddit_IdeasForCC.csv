4155785,0,t1_crtflg8,gt When its just a few regulars and everybody is happy to do so in the room well just break the rules anyway because were familiar with each other. So if its best to make the time limit short its of no worry to me. I have plenty of short songs I can play and Ill play the long ones when there is only a few people in the room who are happy to listen to longer stuff.I also think that im gonna make some statement that if there are not a lot of people in the room that the mods will be a lot less strict and a lot more casual...,IdeasForCC,crtyzwv,1,t5_334nk
