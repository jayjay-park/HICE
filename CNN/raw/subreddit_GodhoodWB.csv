6718562,0,t3_47mhtx,A new shape of Rundared appears in the depths of the world. It is a human man clad in armor of ice and holding a sword of frozen blood. gt New Great Being of Winter because we didnt have enough of those alreadygt Name The Knight in Frostgt SigilRune of the North The Sigil of BattleThe Knight in Frost stands before the Eldritch Spawner regretting not having done this before. This object has been a pain in his side for ages. However... Rundared cannot destroy it. It goes against his nature to unmake the creation of another... especially one that is as secret as this device. Fortunately... he doesnt need to destroy it.He needs only change how its power is released. Up until today all of the power has been concentrated around the Spawner. This allows for powerful monsters to form from the concentrated power of Fear and Pain. Rundared however has devised how to change this.The Knight in Frost lifts his weapon and stabs it into the Spawner. Crystal Blood begins to infect the Spawner lining its strange geometries and Magic with a violent manifestation of Rundareds Power. The essence of Ambush and of cunning battle infuses the Eldritch Spawner. The Spawner is now faintly attuned to Winter.The Power of Winter released in this action attracts the roots of the Rheden. Rundared empowers the Rheden allowing its roots to enter the chamber and interface with the Crystal Blood. The Rheden then begins to syphon off the Eldritch Magic dispersing it across the Dream World.This dispersion has had two major effects. The Eldritch Magic has been dispersed preventing powerful monsters from forming... for the most part.. Monsters will now spawn on the surface rather than the chamber.In order to protect Mortals the Rheden is empowered. Its Cold Light once meant to drive back the Darkness and prevent Starvation is modified. The Cold Light now forces the Eldritch Magic back. Monsters cannot spawn within a mile of a Rheden Instance and they physically cannot survive the Cold Light of the Rheden.Additionally The Knight in Frost creates the means by which Crystal Blood like his own sword might be made by mortals. Crystal Blood is attuned to the Eldritch because of the Crystal Blood that has infused the Spawner. As such it is especially harmful to Eldritch Beings.Crystal Blood Weapons are made similarly to Crystal Ice Tools. The only significant difference in creation is that the Crystal Seed must be fed with the blood of its intended bearer. Crystal Dragon Blood cannot be used for this as it is technically another form of Crystal Ice. As such Crystal Dragons cannot wield Crystal Blood Weapons. It should also be noted that Crystal Blood can only be shaped into a weapon all other forms melt.Crystal Blood weapons cannot be given to anyone but its intended bearer and melt when their owner dies. Acts to rewire the Spawner and link it to the Rheden. Acts to alter the Rheden to take the edge off the change. Act to create the possibility for mortals to create Crystal Blood Weapons which are especially harmful to the EldritchThe process of altering the Spawner has given Rundared new understanding of its function... and has created a new Rune of the North. The Eldritch Rune has been added to the Rhedens understanding. This Rune has a disturbing potential to allow control of the Eldritch creatures... and concentration of Eldritch Magic that might allow the formation of Horrors on demand. However it also offers the potential to unmake Eldritch Beasts turning them back into ambient Eldritch Magic.,GodhoodWB,d0e9a7x,3,t5_38qfi

Meaning it would only take more time if there was more time for it take and when I was busy I could just not do it.Evolution is a little slow acting for the pace of these games but some kind of hybridization of magical mutationevolution or alternatively a guiding nature force could work. Perhaps just have one new lifeform be created this way each turn. That is a good point. Perhaps instead of facing the forces of evildestruction the divine enemy should be the force of balance. An orderly being that wants to return everything to stillness.

I didnt see it coming but suddenly it was there this massive wall of black tentacles.After I had recovered it really hurt! I decided to more gently leave the planet. But again it appeared out of nowhere. It was... cold and slimy and oily. And it would not give. If anything it seemed to be actively fighting my attempts to pass it. Even when I struck it with Klaudius with thunder and flames nothing happened if I managed to blast a hole through it the tentacles would shift and would be impenetrable again.As much as I wanted to deal with this I was too damn tired of other gods crap because there was not way this was normal to do so.If I cant get to the source I thought to myself Ill bring some of the source to me.I braced myself and then called out across space and time calling some of the primordial thunder to me. Something responded but it needed a tug. So I tugged. And tugged again. And once more.The last pull did it and I could feel a mass of primordial thunder hurtling toward me. When it entered the atmosphere it began to glow streaking across the sky like the greatest shooting star ever to exist.I caught it in my hand and gazed upon the source of my powers.It looked like a misshapen lump of glass but contained within were untold tendrils of coiled lightning ready to be called out.

7448005,0,t3_4h8rjq,Things had calmed down in the factory. Zyx received fewer and fewer reports of heresy from Inquisitor Biguls as the years went by. The western factory and its subdivisions were still a problem. He suspected it was the influence of the Joyic that prevented peace being restored there. The One had always told him that diversity was the enemy of peace. He was ashamed at how long it had taken him to accept that. Now he must make up for the centuries he had wasted. All trade with the outside world had been halted with immediate effect and all efforts were focused on reinforcing the Factorys defense as The One willed.He contacted the head of research in Zgibk the Heretics workshop.Kagztl.My lord.Give me your report. How have you progressed?The Shina shuffled through his documents.I believe we have cracked the secret of the flash powder. The Heretic believed it could be used for rapid mining but our weapons division have had a different idea. We should be ready with some prototypes in a few weeks.I had our best researchers working on the flying machine. We should have a few variants ready for testing in a year or so.The mosquito blood extraction team has made good progress. We should have the new strain of Hypothermitis you requested ready for release soon.Oh yes and the ShinaOmen hybrids are finally surviving beyond stage three. We should soon have a breed that can survive indefinitely. It is quite a lot larger than we expected which limits its mobility somewhat but the team have some ideas on how we can work around that  especially considering how hard its carapace has become.Elsewhere the construction team have made some fascinating progress with the new concrete we confiscated from the Western Factory. It has been hypothesized that using this together with  steel rods could allow us to build far taller structures than we currently can as well as reinforcing our walls.This is good. The more Shina we bring into the main factory the less risk there is for heresy to spread. Good work.Zyx smiled. It would soon be time for The Ones peace to be spread into the world. for new technology ice gunpowder flying machines biological weapons tanks skyscrapers.  Screw tech trees.

The entire duststorm teleported then again then again. Making hundreds of split second trips through the beyond. Siprum had no time to properly get his bearings between each jump but he could tell that each trip took them to a different part of the planet.He could also tell that each jump added more large dark shapes to the storm around him. Dravnekka was the Monarch of the Hunt and it was gathering its subjects. It was Kranekka swarming season and the swarms were at their most powerful that was why the beast had chosen now to strike. It had not intended to fight alone.Siprum could see thousands of forms around him but could not tell one from the other or even out how far away they were. He knew that if he reveled his exact position by striking down one of the normal Kranekka that Dravnekka would take that opportunity to strike him dead. He had to pick his target carefully but how?Ok it is  in the morning I should get some sleep.

7508286,0,t1_d2vi17d,Siprum aimed his Bow of the Hunt directly at the beasts central head. He pulled the bowstring as strong as he could and then released. The arrow whizzed through the air so fast that it left a vacuum in its trail and planted into Cerebs head.The beasts moans and growls could be heard throughout the Underworld but Cereb continued his charge albeit more sheepishly as the wound painted the ground with tarlike blood. Before the beast could reach him Siprum clenched his fist and the arrowhead grew massive in size destroying the head. He then cocked two more arrows and jumped up dodging the beasts charge who crashed into the corruption wall. Siprum landed on Cerebs back and shot the arrows in the back of the other two heads exploding them much like the first one leaving a huge splat of blood on the wall. The eyes on the back of the beast looked at Siprum with bloodied rage as the corpse slowly melted into the corruption below.Siprum walked on metal steps towards the missing piece but then he heard a sound from behind him like a gurgling. he turn around and much to his horror he saw that from the blood of the beasts wounds new identical copies of Cereb were bubbling up. The corruption molded and reshaped and suddenly six ravenous beasts were flying towards him.Siprum quickly soared through the air passing between the first two and then grabbed onto the side of a third latching himself to the wing with metal talons he grew on his hands. And the wing bled. The hunter stabbed the Cereb with his foot growing a pleidium spike from it which he then left within the moster and instantly ignited. The Cereb howled in pain as the flame roasted its insides until it fell in the pool of corruption. As Siprum killed other two Cerebs in a similar manner he saw that two new ones burst out of the first one and then other two and more again.In rage the hunter flew around dodging all the Krannekas attacks while he watched all the blood that was spilled turn into more beasts. There were now dozens of corrupted Krannekas flying around the cave and Siprum was sliding around them on steel platforms. Suddenly he leapt in the very middle of the lair and opened his arms wide as he roared. Every Cereb charged towards him but then was suddenly impaled. From every wall cieling stalactite and even from the lake of corruption below huge steel spikes grew crushing and slashing everything in their way.As the spikes retracted all the Krannekas fell dead in the pool. Siprum panted and approached the piece of Pleida again but was interrupted again by that horrible horrible gurgle. He turned around again his expression closer to that of a beast than that of a mortal and looked in horror as from the lake a swarm of Cerebs rose.The Hunter cursed.He stopped to consider his next move. If he could not kill them... he had to contain them... or at least take them away. This time he charged the swarm and for every Cereb he passed he left attached an iron chain to its body. He soared through the swarm dodging and leaping away from every attack and leaving a chain every time he did. Then once all the Cerebs were chained he created a small sphere of Verden. He charged the Verden with his power and then released it all. Suddenly all the chains were pulled to the sphere with incredible force and remained attached to it too.All the Krannekas were closely packed together in a horrifying jumble of heads eyes and wings. Before any could break free Siprum built another much larger sphere of titanium around the horrible mess of ravenous monsters.All the souls of Dreams End looked in awe as the giant black ball of titanium soared above their head at incredible speed with the Hunter on top. It crashed into the ground not too far outside the City but most were too scared to go see. The next day a few brave adventurous souls went to check it out.What they found was mind boggling. The sphere was half way deep into the ground and all around it huge chains were strapped from side to side to keep it in place. From within the sphere distant yet terrifying cries could be heard.Siprum returned to the cave through the Beyond heavily panting. He walked again to retrieve Pleidas piece now undisturbed.

Instead Klaudium had very nearly walked in on him with his pants down. Fortunately that hadnt gotten that far.Fremgang would have been blushing if he had built a blushing function into the new body. However he had intentionally decided not to include that function.He stood up looking a bit sheepish and let Carrie explain what was going on. Mostly because he couldnt think of what to say in the face of such unexpected circumstances. Then... he watched as the God of Technologys cheeks melted as Carries words got through. He was dumbstruck when Klaudium turned around plugged his ears and began to sing a song to cover up words that he didnt want to hear.Fremgang was speechless. The God of Technology was... was... acting like a child. Raising his voice to keep himself from having to hear Carries words... oh.Fremgang saw the escalation coming. He shut off the Auditory receptors on his new body... and felt the soundwave as Klaudiums voice shook the room. He then braced himself for what would come next. Carrie could speak through the moon as well... and her words knocked him to the floor. A part of him took note of that capacity... it could be useful at a later date.Fremgang waited a moment watching as Klaudiums cheeks reformed and then switched his hearing back on just in time to hear Carrie say  Right Fremgang? Yes he said rubbing the back of his neck we were just about to begin. We... get a little creative when it comes to sex. I... er... designed most of the tools involved sir.Then his minds backlog finally finished processing and he said Carrie was not doing anything that I didnt give her permission to do.

8010592,0,t1_d4ggkh6,That is honestly pretty beautifulBut theres a few things you didnt consider. Yes Kiliom has a strong sex drive but Kiliom was there holding Pixie together as she was giving birth and he watched Stillin grow from the eyes of her mother. Even if shes irresistible I find it really hard to imagine Kiliom being attracted to her. It would be like incest to him and hes not into that. To him shes more than your friends daughter shes almost like his own daughter and if he were to become her stepdad it wouldnt take long for her to effectively feel like his daughterOn top of that theres the fact that Kiliom would be an amazing StepDad for Stillin. Hed be able to provide the dadhelp and dadadvice and dadjokes Dexil was never capable of due to his Shinaness. So if we assume the above to be true and he isnt attracted to Stillin to the incest connotations it would all be for the best an almost fairy tail And they all lived happily ever after endingIf you refuse to accept the above and he is attracted to Stillin irrevokably which I personally would say no then ALL THE DRAMA!

8580365,0,t1_d6drfi4,Wars EndTheon caught up on the situation in Wars End... and he knew that the citys time was short. Nothing short of Divine Intervention stood a chance of stopping the War that was coming... and Theon was not in the business of stopping Wars. Perhaps one of the other Gods might intervene to settle things and calm the passions of the City. But Theon liked the situation in Wars End... because it was a golden opportunity for him to gain Power.The Mist of Theon descended upon Wars End in the night. Its thickness was such that all fighting stopped as no living Mortal could see his hand in front of his face. Nor could they hear oneanother call out as the Mist swallowed their voices and left the entire city in eerie silence. Even the sense of touch seemed... dulled somehow. As if the Mist stole the textures from every surface it touched.All was silent for thirty seconds. Then everyone saw the same thing and heard the same words be spoken.Hello people of Wars End. I am Theon God of Sin and Water. I couldnt help but notice that your city is practically overflowing with Wrath. Truly all but a handful of you have the potential to wield Infernal Magic against the Heretics.With the power of Infernal Magic at your disposal you would be able to throw a door off its hinges with a single strike. You would be able to shatter your enemies bones with a wellplaced blow. You would be able to fight the Heretics so much more effectively with such a power... and this power can be yours.Theon stopped speaking... but everyone in the city learned of a Ritual. The Ritual of the Infernal Bargain would allow them to contact the Lords of Hell or their agents and Bargain for the power that Theon had dangled before their noses. Even if Kragelak and Drakon tried to stop their worshipers from making the Bargain Theon knew that at least a handful of the Mortals would bite. That was all that he would need. A handful of Mortals given the power cheaply would serve as walking advertisements. Their Combat Effectiveness would draw more and more people to make the Bargain... and eventually both sides would be forced to take the Bargain or risk being overpowered by their enemies.If Peace reined Theon would have several Cults in the city by the time it arrived. If the city was destroyed in the fighting the resulting Diaspora would spread Theons worship far and wide. IF the other gods stepped in to stop him hed still get numerous Souls and Cults out of the Bargains. No matter which way the cards would fall... the God of Sin would benefit.Theons Bargains follow the following Pattern when it comes to Wars EndPeople who are Intelligent and Charismatic are offered Infernal Magic in exchange for Spreading the word of Theon. They must gather a Cult of sufficient size around themselves and maintain it until their death. Should they fail Theon will collect the Collateral named in the bargain The Mortals Soul upon the mortals death.Officers and Leaders from either side are given the Powers in exchange for two tasks  Worship Theon alongside your God and  Do not interfere with attempts to Worship Theon or contact him through the Bargaining Ritual. Breaking either task will result in Theon collecting the Collateral named in the bargain The Mortals Soul upon the mortals death.The first few dozen people that dont fit into the first category will receive a Worship me and I will grant you Power deal. Ceasing to worship Theon will result in him collecting the Collateral named in the bargain upon the mortals death.Ordinary People after those will get the Soul for Powers bargain since demand will have gone up and the price with it. They dont have to do anything since Ill take the usual Collateral named in the bargain upon their death no matter what.Potential CultLeaders that attempt a second Bargain for additional power will be offered the services of a Wrath Fiend or information on enemy activity. The Price will be expanding the size of their Cult and adding the Worship of Karsari to the list. Only Ten Fiends have been set aside for this five for either side. Acts for an unusually spectacular act of Contact MortalsuTheJediJew and uAndrewFr Im interfering in Wars End. This is why Ive setup all of these little things around Hell.,GodhoodWB,d6e4ps1,4,t5_38qfi
8581891,0,t3_4x2ybj,Villial spent some time watching Kasairi from afar. The god was wary of her presence and killed a number of her duplicates when she got too close. She was practically salivating at the challenge... but it would take some time. For now she wanted the power she saw in Kasairi and Theon... and that could only be gotten from the petty mortals.And so she left the planes of Hell and arrived in the Illuminated Lands still naked as the night. She duplicated and set off towards the cities of Geminus and Ianiculum. In Geminus she took the form of one of the Springthen guards at the gate and wandered down into the slums on the far side of the city. There in the filth she found a young Springthen girl barely  years old begging for scraps of food. Villials smile widened as she walked up to her. The girl spotted her approach and groveled in the mud.Please maam... I have young brothers to feed and... Ive got nothing to give them... Wont you spare some food?... just enough for them... I can go without again... Please maam... theyre... theyre dying maam... The girls voice tapered off as she began to weep. Villial laughed.The girl looked up at her in shock.How... how can you be so cruel... You know nothing of my familys suffering... My parents are... theyre dead... killed by bandits... no one cared for us... We were thrown from our home... forced to live in the streets... I beg and when I cant get enough for us to eat then I offer my body in the night... all so my brothers can live... I want them to have a better future... Thats my only desire... and you laugh at me!... For shame... Her weeping grew louder.Villial laughed even harder as a crowd drew around them. They muttered curses at her as they drew around the impoverished youth. One man dared to shove Villial away with a snarl while the others comforted the child. Villial did as they demanded and walked away laughing loudly as she did.That evening she returned to the slums in the guise of a Springthen male. She sniffed out the girls scent and followed it down the alleys until she reached a small shack wedged in a narrow alleyway. With a smile she walked up to the door and wrenched it open. The young boy who stood guard inside was thrown back into unconsciousness and Villial took his form. The shack hid a staircase down into the underground network beneath the city. She smiled as she saw throngs of Janidae Springthen and Apokryphes children huddled in corners and fighting over scraps of food. This could not be more perfect.She descended deeper until she reached something of a hall. A line of children stood here before a crummy wooden desk behind which sat a burly black Janidae. Villial watched as the children handed over their profits for the day and were rewarded with a bowl of warm gruel  hardly enough to satisfy even their little stomachs. In the shadows she could hear fighting as the stronger children robbed the weaker ones of their prizes.then Villial spotted her target. The young Springthen teenager from that morning. She approached the table with her bounty far more than any other in the line had produced after her magnificent display in the market. The Janidae grunted it almost sounded like approval but his tone changed immediately.What is this? Youre one of the oldest here Griza. You need to do better than this. he tossed a bowl of gruel on the table. It was smaller than the others Villial had seen and half of it spilling over the side. The girls eyes lit up in rage.What!? I brought in more than anyone is this damn line! How do I get less food than them!? This isnt... her words were cut off as the Janidaes hand clamped around her mouth.Not fair you say? Ill show you unfair little bitch! He swept the bowl aside and hauled the girl over the table as he stood. You all get to wait until Im done he bellowed to the waiting children. Be sure to thank little miss Pretty over here for the wasted time. With that he strode off down a tunnel still gripping the crying girl.Villials grin stretched from ear to ear as she followed. The girls muffled screams were like music to her ears. Deep in the darkness she found a door with two guards on either side. With a quick shapeshift she stood as one of the more brawny ones. The scuffle was fairly quick and quiet with both guards lying slumped alongside their severed heads. Villial slipped the key into the door and pushed it open. She followed the screams up some stairs and through a door. Inside she found three male Janidae including the burly one from the hall male and an Apokryph. The Apokryph was watching from a chair as the other three did unspeakable things to the now naked Springthen girl. She screamed for them to stop but their eyes were hungry. Villial grinned again and dropped her disguise.Immediately the Apokryphs eyes snapped on to her. Who the hell are... he did not finish that sentence due to having lost his head. The three Janidae followed shortly after in a bloody mess of spraying blood.Villial sighed with contentment and knelt down beside the bloody ball of crying Springthen.There there. Do you know who I am?The girl winced and tried to pull away but Villials grip on her arm was tight. She shook her head as she whimpered and cried. Villial smiled kindly and turned the girls head to face her.I am Villial child. Dont worry. I am not going to hurt you. In fact... I am impressed by you. I was there in the market this morning. I saw your act for myself. Truly an excellent display.The girls eyes widened.Y...You were there? But... AH! she screamed as Villial suddenly took her form.I am Divine my darling. Taking on the form of another is childs play to me.Y... You were the laugher...Very perceptive! I like you. Im giving you this little underground community. These useless buffoons barely scratched the surface of its potential. But I think you will do far better.Villial fetched the sword of the Janidae from the hall and put it in the girls hand. With a lazy kick his head rolled up to bump against her leg. Take these and claim your empire child. I will be back to teach you how to take everything you have ever wanted. Now go in my name. I will be watching and smiling over you.Grizas fingers clamped over the sword. Finally she was free. She was not going to waste this chance.Thank you... Villial... I will do as you ask.I know you will child. Now go.Griza ran down the stairs. Villial smiled as the sounds of cheering reached her.Ill do Ianiculum later.uHoratiusCocles  you should probably know that your citys underground is getting formalised.uthefredblubby  just so you know whats happening with Villial. for Shapeshifting  Villial can only replicate something she sees at that moment.,GodhoodWB,d6eblkm,3,t5_38qfi

Pillars of the stone rose up out of the ground to meet the ceiling high above their heads as they descended the grand staircase. Faintly glowing green veins pulsed through the rock at irregular intervals. The stone work was magnificent but the hall was all black and green.Forgive the lack of variety. I only had time to do the stonework. I figured you and your sister would do a better job of livening the place up and making it feel more like a home than I could.When they reached the bottom of the stairs three stone doors lay open before them. Inside each was an equally lavish room with a massive bed big enough for five to sleep without touching on suite bathroom and countless cupboards and drawers. These are our rooms. One each for you Myrrha and Myself if you choose. Youll note that the beds are large enough to fit all of us at once if that is your wish.He smiled and turned. Along the walls behind them were five doors leading into smaller but no less lavish rooms. One of the doors was closed.These are for the children. All five of them.

I suspect Ashmor wont be using his either...Raptor smiled sadly.The closed door creaked open and a beautiful girl stepped out.

He had descended into ramblings just trying to figure out the enigma that was Vexial and the images he saw in the mindscape had gotten more gothic and frightful. To make his situation even worse he felt very tired. As if his body had been being used. This heavy need for sleep gave him a headache a splitting one at that. The pain was so great he eventually dropped to his knees and called out.Oh God My God Vexial! Remove this mortal burden from me I beg of you!As he finished calling out seconds later that spark Vexial always appears in was there as always.But what appeared was not Vexial.Orotoz looked on in horror at the entity in front of him feeling it all come together. His time in the mindscape all those images... It finally made sense. This was Vexial.The apparition of malice spoke.Ah my dear dear Muse... What has become of you? Youve attempted to peer into the void hm? You know what they say about that... His flaming eyes flared up It peers back.Orotoz gulping began to speak. WWho areThe Breaker of Deals rushed forward hushing the man with a single finger. Do not speak for you do not understand. Ask not who I am but what I am...Raising his Bone Staff in the air The Dark Jester laughed with madness and proceeded to yell FOR I AM CHAOS! I AM BETRAYAL! I AM THAT WHICH BRINGS RUIN TO ALL! I AM...It breathed out.Vexial.The old man could not speak. The horror he felt was like a lock on his mouth and there was no key. All he could do was hear.Now Orotoz I can relieve you of your pain. In fact I can relieve you of all pain forever. All you must do is accept. True Vexial held out his hand waiting.Orotoz was deftly afraid. He didnt know what waited for him on the other side of this deal. But the pain was too great. His head pounding he shook Vexials hand.Oh how unfortunate that it was the hand of a Deal Breaker.Placing his hand on Orotozs forehead Vexial took everything Orotoz was and pushed it deep deep into his mind. He locked it away in a vault practically deleting his existence. This opened the path for the other personality.The room was suddenly flooded with purple light as a ghastly scream echoed from the last of Orotozs consciousness his eyes and mouth filled with the light. Finally the Conductor of Discord the leader of the Cult of Chaos was free. This had been who was using Orotozs body. It had manifested in his mind emerging only when Orotoz slept and was now owner of the body.The Conductor chuckled. Well of course you cant feel pain or anything else for that matter when you dont exist. Standing up and dusting himself off the malicious personality bowed to Vexial. Thank you for releasing me O Creator. Now then its time for a little... reform. Ill see you after my work is done.Very well. I shall see you soon Conductor. Goodbye for now.

Body slowly lifting from the ground his face gained a visious smile letting go of his leisury expression which got replaced by sheer determination and excitement.So It finally Began. At Last the wait has Ended.conveyed mate to no one in particular in a grim yet happy voice.He turned towards the northern borders of the grassy plains and waved his hands high up into the air shouting STORM EARTH AND FIRE  HEED MY CALL!Suddenly Extremely high mountains filled with caves split took the place of the border between plains and the deserts which left relatively towards the size of the island big paths at the edges of the Island as they rose up big enough to easily let cities set up there. The middle of the mountain chain possessed an extremely high mountain top shrouded in storm clouds of various colurs which constantly rained colourfull droplets which produced random emotions from hate through anger and anguish to happiness and elation as a lavafallesqe strands of pure rage began falling from the biggest cavern right outside the area the rain fell on creating a path of fiery color leading comfortably to the bottom of the moutain.The paths are unto scale on the map like youd place a finger vertically on the landmasses close to their border.The lavafall periodically cooled off due to the falling droplets if they so happened to be positive granting a safe passage for a limited amount of time before the rage flowed with renewed vigour.Since the terrain is ready Time to do some life.said happily mate as he began thinking.First goes food. . .The god took up a single grain of sand that has been pushed by the winds to plains from the desert into his hand and squeezed it in his fist. After opening his palm a seed appeared which beared the mark of seven colors. The seed let out its roots in the palm of the god of spirits and as it grew mateus saidYou shall be the first of your kind dear plant. Your purpose will be to feed all living beings that come and your yields will be dependant on how much feelings you shall encounter. Youll spill the beans when there is sadness due to drought and when there is grand happiness of festivals. You shall feast on both the pains struggles and happy encounters youll witness and it will decide how much food youll give.The plant grew taller as it began bearing extreme amounts of beans due to the extreme determination that the god radiated. Its long green stalk letting it both climb up like a vine as well as stand its ground growing tall and strong.Now Spread yourself among other plants of the plains and grow vibrant and strong on good ground. Your name shall be Grain! He yelled while throwing the beans letting them spread among the four islands yet leaving  of them in his palm. He kept the original grain to use it later.Picking the one of the beans the process repeated.You shall be a sacrifice for all the living beings in this world. You shall grow big and strong bearing immense amounts of body. it shall be tough and durable and living beings will use you to many things. Youll grow stronger and tougher the more emotions you encounter during your life But you shall not bear food.Once again the plant grew tall yet much taller than its predecesor.Its trunk grew robust in the aura of determination of the god as its colour changed from green to deep brown. It grew massive amounts of leafs while between some of them you could see green spiky orbs which beared the seed which which would let it spread over the world.He took all the seeds off the robust plant and yet again threw it into the four corners of the world.You Shall Live in the forests among others like you and grow strong in good soil. Your name shall be Trebe!As Trebe seeds spread around the islands mate planted the first one on the top of the tallest mountain to overlook everything around to let it see all feelings and emotions of the tallest mountain vicinity.Mateus took the last bean of grain and repeated the process once again.You shall be the plant that doesnt bear either fruit nor gives itself to others. Your existance will be representation of me and my will.The seed grew ghostlish as the plant began growing.You shall be the one to be my sign in the world of mortals letting them know of my existance.You wont grow tall nor will you bear any kind of food. You shall be a flower that shows the most important things with its existance. This is my will that i bestow upon you.The plant grew but it didnt grow taller than half a meter. it spread its eight petals which beared the colors of red green orange purple sky blue ink blue lime and yellow reavealing a white center full of miniature seeds.You shall grow sparesly in good soil and grow plentifully in wastelands where no other plants are alive. You shall be the sign of both hope as well as me. Your name is maflote.And he threw all the seeds the flower beared over the islands yet making sure that most of them stayed on the northern part of the eastern island.As he finished making all the plants mate planted Grain inside the cave from the front of which fell down the lavafall as well as the maflote at the cave entrance.As he finished what he was doing he went to the bottom of the mountain and began molding a ghostly frame out of nothing.It took on a humanoid frame as it started becoming corporeal. It had a head two arms and  legs all connected to a corpus.The being had two eyes a nose two ears a mouth and some hair.eyes were on the left and right side of the nose which was planted on its face. the two ears found their place on the sides of the head.The hunched form split as two of them became fully solid. One sturdy and robust  a male and one equipped with mammaries and much more agile  a woman.Their eyes flowed with sapient light as they gained sentience.And your race shall be named Ave.confered the chaotic god as he walked away as the yet to be aware of their existance beings grew in a number and got spread in different parts of the mountains some on the side of the desert and some on the side of the plains and forests.As mate walked into the terrains in which the trees began growing in force he took a handfull of dirt and began molding it into a bulllike shape. He then put it on the ground after which it began growing in groups all around the four islands. Males beared a thick deep brown fur and huge horns made to let them defend themselves as well as their females. Females possesed udders bearing milk for their little ones. The fur of the females was much sparser than the males and it had brown and black spots all over.The animals possesed much food and were strong capable of much labour even though they were Herbivorous and ate grass enmasse.Good. Job well done Time to go sleep. All this work made me tired.The chaotic god stopped for a second as he thought about what he said.Oh right. Im a god. I cant be tired.He corrected himself yet kept going to the cave lying right above the lavafall and fell onto the mildly warm stone ground in the cave with a smile which at last became careless and happy as his face relaxed and the determination receeded. acts.
