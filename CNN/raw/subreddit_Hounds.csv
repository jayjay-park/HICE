2814083,0,t3_2s7eg3,We adopted a horribly picky Redbone Coonhound. We eventually started feeding him Royal Canin MAXI dry food and now he loves it. Also he earns every single piece of food. We either handfeed him each piece during training all two cups of it or put the whole meal in a KONG Wobbler or some other slowfeeder puzzle and sometimes even put the Wobbler outside during nice weather so that its more challenging for him to sniff out the pieces he missed he always finds every last bit. He gets really excited about mealtimes. Too excited haha.Edit We have since switched him to Arcana Wild Prairie GrainFree dog food which he loves even more.,Hounds,cnnyc62,1,t5_2udkt

3557673,0,t1_cpxlw6y,So cute! And wow I think I just saw an exact preview of what our puppy will look like when shes grown. She has the same patterns of colorsmarkings as your dog red ticks on her paws and legs a red face with darker brown ears black saddle black base of tail and blue ticking on the tail tip blue ticking on all of the white areas of her body and a similar ear and face shape.Does Tracker do tracking? Were thinking about enrolling our puppy in tracking classes when shes old enough because thus far it seems like shed be really good at that.,Hounds,cpxsryo,1,t5_2udkt
4442603,0,t3_3buegb,Yeah my TWC will do that sometimes but she will always aquiesce when I tap on the remote. Remote collar training makes life so much easier I think every hound dog owner should seriously consider making the purchase. ,Hounds,csqobm4,2,t5_2udkt

5244655,0,t1_cvhl4cw,I use a shock collar not reluctantly at all.  It gives my dog the freedom to enjoy running and the mental exercise of smelling tracking etc that she could never get on leash.  It has greatly improved her quality of life and our relationship because I can give her what she needs.  I have to say that I did a lot of research and ALOT of training before using the collar.  My hound  understood what come meant before the collar.  She just couldnt or wouldnt obey.  Also my collar has a vibrate setting which is all I need most of the time.  I also have to say my dogs temperament is quite hard and she can take a lot of correction without showing any negative effects.  This is generally true for hounds but there are exceptions and hound mixes may be quite a bit softer.  Please dont put an ecollar on a soft dog or on a dog who doesnt understand exactly what youre asking of it.,Hounds,cvi64yy,3,t5_2udkt
5369911,0,t3_3o6oou,Oh my gosh  The paw crossing thing. My foxhound Penny does that all the time! It does make them even more adorable.,Hounds,cvy2eh8,3,t5_2udkt
5370384,0,t1_cvvevz4,Thanks for the reply. I only wanted the mix because I love both dogs so much. I am not against shelter dogs but I really want a pup from my dog as my next dog and I was not worried about nobody wanting the pups I have enough people interested. But it sounds like it is a major hassle so I will probably get a shelter dog.,Hounds,cvy4kwc,1,t5_2udkt

5756298,0,t3_3tw9uf,Do you know what breedbreeds he is? Our pup looks very similar and our best guess is that hes a Walker and a Bluetick. ,Hounds,cxamghm,1,t5_2udkt
6782050,0,t1_d0l0uug,Its cute for a week or so. She know how to get attention and will bay until she does. ,Hounds,d0l13z4,2,t5_2udkt
6996202,0,t1_d19cnxs,Well i say the age thing because most shelters will guess lower rather than higher.  People are less likely to adopt a  year old dog over a  year old dog.  I say they lied because while they said she was   at almost  now she has a lot f gray coming in fast in her face and paws.  So i think she was older than what they said.  As far as puppy mannerisms thats a Plott hound trait they never go away.  If I didnt know my dog was at least  years old I would think she was a  year old puppy with how much energy she has and how much she loves to play.  Plott hounds are considered working dogs and have been bred to have large amounts of energy to hunt Big games they require a lot of exercise to actually tire them out.  I can run my dog walk my dog chase her around wrestle with her until i am exhaust she will take a  minute nap and be right back at it. ,Hounds,d19d2f9,1,t5_2udkt
7055175,0,t3_4c7wpb,Its like having a cat and anticipating the occasional puke. Its gonna happen regardless of the health of the dog unfortunately nothing is wrong just try and give him a wide berth to protect yourself from that smell!,Hounds,d1g2ahb,1,t5_2udkt

11676450,0,t1_dgis5sl,Ah man. I wish there was another way you know? Ive gathered is that a dog companion helps with the anxiety. But thats not always possible.,Hounds,dgjjiv9,2,t5_2udkt
