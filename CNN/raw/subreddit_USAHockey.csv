188729,0,t1_cezsjz3,I dont think theyre available on the USA Hockey site yet. I think your best bet might be to find the players NHL team website and see if they do onlinephone orders. Like the Sharks for example will let you call in an order and theyll ship it so if you wanted a Pavelski one you could do that. Id imagine that the other players respective teams operate similarly. ,USAHockey,cezxp3e,2,t5_2z1lh

395875,0,t1_cflii65,Russia put up more KHL players than the NHL players. There has already been a ton of reports out of there that the entire goal was to beat the US with minimal NHL players to prove that the KHL has great talent there. Bylsma did a terrible job. He was not making adjustments to get better matchups and even adjusting the scheme. Instead it was dump and chase hockey with one forechecker going into the zone to try and recover it. Honeslty it was like watching the Minnesota Wild play hockey. Meanwhile you had a Canadian team that was coming into the zone on a  breakout and had the ability to either cycle and wait for their defense to come in and pinch or even take the shot to and hope for a rebound. You can tell this team was coached by two of the best in the business in Babcock and Julien. If it wasnt for Quick that game could have been a lot uglier. USA didnt get it done the way they were able to score during group play. And when that failed it was terrible shot after terrible shot into Prices chest. ,USAHockey,cflsr6p,3,t5_2z1lh

11193862,0,t1_df0irlg,I would say that the market where theyre paid more wouldve shown itself by now if it was there. Weve seen past leagues folks due to financial issues so its not like there isnt precedent. I would also say that this is a issue that other countries deal with this problem and they accept the facts that they cant afford a league like that either. Theres no example of a league of the level they want working. This sport like soccer is a sport where its filled with expenses from the beginning. Its understood as a part of the sport and both sports still grow.,USAHockey,df0t7dw,1,t5_2z1lh
