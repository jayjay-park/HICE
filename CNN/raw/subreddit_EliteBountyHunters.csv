However there isnt one. Only time Im getting one is if they are wanted to start with.. but the kscan bounties arent working for me..

2771235,0,t1_cnitz9z,You have to fly around for a little bit. When I first get into RES I see mostly Sidewinders and Eagles. Not worth much to me so I ignore them keep flying around a bit and you start seeing k Cobras ASPs and Vipers. A lot of people seem to get luckier than I my targets always have shields but they burn off quick.If you stick around long enough you will start to see k Anacondas. Let the local security forces drop them to  Hull and then engage thier Power Supply. I racked up k in less than  minutes I got lucky and it was  Condas within km of each other.,EliteBountyHunters,cnj2v6f,1,t5_35agu
2865494,0,t1_cntrw7r,Weapons have a max rating for the class so if you have bought them already then they are maxed out for the viper!  Only larger ships have access to class d c etc.Space trucking is not an exact science.  In general you want to buy at a station with high supply and low prices and sell at one with high demand and high prices.  Its doable in game but without the ability to make notes for each system its a chore to manually check prices.  Google the elite trading tool on phone or I would link it is a crowd sourced database of commodity prices among other things.  Theres a nice feature that lets you put in your current location and find a trade route nearby.  Then you just do the route it gives you until profits start to be less than k a ton rule of thumb and find another route.  If you can registering and helping update prices in the tool helps everyone.  If you prefer to trade  without a tool you can see what goods are exported from the station youre in and where they go and shuttle them between.  An always profitable route is to take gold or other highsupply highprofit metals from refinery systems to high tech systems and bring consumer electronics back with you to sell.  Seems to be reliable profits if you can get a good route going.I would advise having at the very least  mil before you buy a type  unless you trade in the viper.  This will cover some early cargo and FSD upgrades and give you enough money for insurance.  As far as what to get get D class on everything but FSD for weight reduction and upgrade cargo holds.  I dont recommend dropping shields as its a big risk until you can pilot the ship without brushing up against things.,EliteBountyHunters,cntt2oq,1,t5_35agu

Enter RES.  Check the rank and ship type of your first two or three radar contacts.  If the very first couple of contacts on your radar are not wanted Pythons of at least Dangerous rank log out and in again to reset the RES.  Repeat the above step until the first two or three wanted contacts you see are Pythons ranked Dangerous or above.

8837079,0,t1_d7a35kn,yeah the courier is just an awesome ship still my favorite alongside the clipper and the Ieagle. and yes smaller ships can be annoying especially since i run fixed only weapons because man mode but the courier is probably one of the best equipped small ships to go after larger ships along with the vulture. my conda is running A thrusters so she actually turns surprisingly well especially with knowledge of how to maneuver to get the most out of it. ive been flying big ships like i would small ships for a while now and its really fun to flip a FDL or clipper around in the same manor as one would a viper or cobra and the conda when fitted for light and fast is also surprisingly compatible with this tactic. ive never had trouble keeping any ship larger than an asp in the firing zone for my gambled weapons long enough to get the kill but i cant tank hard enough to fight multiple big ships. ,EliteBountyHunters,d7a3bxn,2,t5_35agu

10916905,0,t1_de5vv5h,Groups like us which play with the background simulation tend to track our efforts missions bonds etc so that we can determine our effect on the simulation and control our states wars and expansions.  Having extra random player effects that we dont know about is the last thing we want.  So while Im sure with a little effort you could figure out where we are and do as you suggest we would much rather you joined up with us so we could track your efforts too.  The advantage you would get by joining is a bunch of guys to wing up with in Combat Zones.  In a wing youll stay alive longer and get kills faster  and as the main source of income is kills for Massacre missions this is the fastest way to make some cash.  It will even get a little better in . when they stop dividing bond payouts for kills.Or if you really prefer to go it alone there is no reason you cannot pick any faction you like in any system near you and push them into a war.  Its actually fairly easy to do especially if the system has a low population.  Just do missions for them until their influence equals that of another faction or do missions for another faction to equal them either way.  Make sure the factions have different government types so that you get a Civil War and not an Election.  Note that the actual faction property that determines the conflict type is hidden but Government type is the closest visible property to it.  Once you get them into a war you fight for one side then the other side then back again and keep the war running as long as possible reaping all the rewards.  Stacking massacre missions each time of course.,EliteBountyHunters,de602ie,1,t5_35agu
