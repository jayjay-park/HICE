496300,0,t3_1zt32q,If any of you Wolfe fans arent on the Urth list already I recommend joining.  As you may know Wolfes wife Rosemary passed away a few months ago.  It looks like he has been writing quite a bit lately and his new novel A Borrowed Man was nearly done as of late January.  The brief description I came across a while back said it dealt with a far future library where it was possible to check out synthesized authors not just books.  ,genewolfe,cfwoljx,6,t5_2trh7

3974861,0,t1_cr9bymp,It was Pajarocu which is I think? where Horn and his son took the lander to Green. I have that quote saved as wellgtWhat they have done instead is to duplicate its plan to perfectionwithout duplicating or attempting to duplicate its substance at all.gtgtThere are streets paved with grass and fern between buildings and manteions that are no more than clearings in the forest marked in ways that are to our eyes almost undetectable. When the adult citizens we sought to question were willing to talk to us they talked of gateways walls and statues that did not in fact exist or at least that did not exist here on Blueand described them in as much detail as if they loomed before us together with colossal images of Hierax Tartaros and the rest called by outlandish sobriquets and the objects of strange cruel veneration.gtgtBut when the streets are too badly fouled or the river rises this phantom Pajarocu goes elsewhere which I think an excellent idea. Our own Viron was built on the southern shore of Lake Limna when the lake retreated our people clung to the shiprock buildings that Pas had provided when they ought to have clung to the idea that he had provided instead the idea of a city by the lake. Many although certainly not all of Virons troubles may ultimately have been due to this single mistaken choice. Listen to me Horn and Hide.gtgtListen all you phantom readers. Buildings are temporary ideas permanent.,genewolfe,cr9d8ut,2,t5_2trh7

6569612,0,t1_cxp6hq9,Hello again as it turned out Gene Wolfe did not end up attending the convention at all. But I did have the chance to talk with him on the phone for a short while. I blathered on for a little bit and thanked him for his work which is my main inspiration. He was very gracious and kind. So I did not get the opportunity to formally interview him unfortunately. But I feel as though I passed on the spirit of the way you feel about him even if I wasnt able to ask him about his favorite four books. Thanks.,genewolfe,czyuovf,1,t5_2trh7

10859006,0,t1_ddzwq9y,I dont have it here right now and I suppose this is a spoiler soSpoilers The best description I can remember was right at the end of Short Sun when he meets SilkHorn. I recall noting that it was somewhat different than the appearance he gave himself in New Sun. Of particular note was how Silk found him to be moderately ugly.,genewolfe,de01378,3,t5_2trh7

11517293,0,t1_dfnpqpz,I thought Jeannine was the sister of Number Fives father in the same way that David is his biological brother. Its pretty much confirmed in the text. The reason she is crippled is for the same reason David is hospitalized by Number . I also find it likely that Number  and also his father both intentionally hospitalized their respective siblings. David for Phaedras affections and Jeannine for some unknown but similar reason. That said its pretty clear that their familys last name is Wolfe. ,genewolfe,dg1hj4y,1,t5_2trh7
11634523,0,t1_dgebzy1,Pas is two headed as well. And in the character index for the last book he is described as a digitized tyrant. I believe he was as bad as he was when he built Whorl. But I do like Pas it connects to the theme that even the most evil people have a good part and somehow in Pas the good part of Typhon appeared. And I suppose they could have edited them but Scylla the most similar to Typhon of his children still demands child sacrifice and is seemingly unedited.,genewolfe,dgesax0,1,t5_2trh7
