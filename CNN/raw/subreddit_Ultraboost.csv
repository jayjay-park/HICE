9345207,0,t3_58hec1,Same here too.  Are they brand new?  Mine did this after a month or so until I broke them in.  Now I have no issues.  Also try loosening the laces.,Ultraboost,d90klo0,1,t5_3eco8

10715479,0,t3_5t9s5d,They both fit identically the same. Only difference on many earlier .s are the outsoles compared to the .s continental outsoles which last longer. A good thing to keep in mind are the fit for the .s Although its the same sizewidth these are looser because the primeknit design has a baggier fit. Some people choose to size down or just stick to regular UB sizes.,Ultraboost,ddl809g,2,t5_3eco8
