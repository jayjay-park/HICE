6003235,0,t3_3xp2dr,Sorry cant help you. But i know the problem.   Steam does not provide the right assetId when a trade is done. I think it this has something to do whit trades being delayed.   So you get a offer accepts it steam sets the new assetIds of the items. Steam is slow and cant process the items. So they come into your inventory between  sec   hours and once they come into your inventory they get a new Asset Id. its all just bad coding from steams part... So I reconfigured my system to work whit markethashname instead of Id.  Hope you understand and that this helps.,SteamBot,cy6jyj9,1,t5_2xalm
