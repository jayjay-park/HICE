480576,0,t3_1zl3ci,I started training at . You need to be careful not to overdo it. Your body is still developing and any injury now to a growth plate such as a stress fracture will have bad results. Obviously at  I was thinking I was invincible sorry hit send before done typing. You are able to do a lot but right now focus on getting the most out of high school stay in shape. Heres what you need to do. Join the trackcross country team as well as the swim team. School programs are developed around kids your age as opposed to most SEAL PT schedules which are for older guys. Dont get super caught up in being a SEAL. Enjoy high school as much as possible stay in shape learn as much as you can and stay out of trouble. Build habits that will serve you in the future. Regular bed times consitently good diet no drugs etc. I was in high school too you may go to parties with people drinking smoking etc. Its something you gotta give up if you want to be devoted to training. One of the biggest things Ill say is at  your view is most likely romanticized. When you are a bit older Id recommend going to Virginia for Don Shipleys Extreme SEAL experience. Take both weeks dont skip hell week. I saw a couple  year olds there and they didnt seem to get the same out of it as the older guys. Good luck. HooyahRob,navyseals,cfuw7rf,4,t5_2vp9k

4855383,0,t1_cu5ve4s,Theyre definitely not in the inner circle.  USNA guys have generally all known each other for at least  of the  years of Uni.  Theyre usually in the same SpecWar club training with SEALs and doing miniBUDS activities together long before they arrive at the real deal.  They hang out together on weekends they get houses together their wives know each other etc.  Those friendships persist for decades afterwards.  Maybe they end up working closely with an OCS guy who earns their trust and loyalty and respect but guys from outside the inner sanctum have an uphill battle that guys within dont have.  Im not an expert but Ive heard form Os that its extremely common for that initial handicap to end up as a ceiling around the Captain level.  Typically its for a lack of leadership ability.  Theyre not super demanding on tactical prowess otherwise a lot more of them would fail but if theyre consistently atrocious tactically and the cadre dont think they have good underlying leadership skills then theyll be targets for performance drops.Ive worked with a few good ones.  The stand out one in my mind Ill call Ryan.  What made Ryan great was his humility.  He seemed slightly uncomfortable about his role.  He was the last one to speak the first one to ask for help or advice.  He put his boys first and was always leading from the front.  He worked hard and he expected hard work but he wasnt a cheerleader or a slave driver he just made his expectations known and asked that we all do what we could to help him achieve those expectations.  I think thats the biggest thing any O can do to do well respect your guys enough to know that theyre not trying to fuck you and that they have every bit as much right to be there as you do.  Treat them like theyre your friends who came over to help you build a deck and not like day laborers you hired from outside of Home Depot.  I couldnt tell you.  I would suspect that SEAL O is as far as most people need to look on a resume and university doesnt matter to many.  USNA might be a door opener to some places though maybe.Its pretty expensive.  The only guys I knew who did it were Os and they were  or  to a house and they make pretty solid housing allowance.  Commuting in SD is usually NBD.  No worries.  ,navyseals,cu6k2wg,3,t5_2vp9k

All of these factors will help you in the various phases of AampS and the follow on Operators course.  Furthermore IOS is one of the best schools in the entire DOD.  But it is a gut check very early on in your career.  Military Athlete even has a training program centered around a single evolution the combat endurance test.  The CET is a major point of friction in the course and it happens on day  or some shit. I believe any O can attend the MARSOC AampS if their package gets approved as long as they attain the rank of O.  Same thing with Recon but things have already changed a bit since I left active in .However ground intel officers get billeted as STAsniper platoon commanders if theyre hot shit so you may also want to consider that option.One unforeseen downside is that assuming you graduate from IOC.  After some time and experience you may be given command of a WPNS platoon.  The sheer number of liberty incidences DUIs assaults rape accusations NJPS... etc your platoon will accumulate during the course of your command will for sure rob years away from your life because somehow this is all your fault for not properly guiding and mentoring the personal and professional development of the Marines under your charge,navyseals,d3zyqti,1,t5_2vp9k

11376040,0,t3_62ajm9,When I was exercising a shit load getting ready for MEPS and PST i felt like i had to do so much recovery work. Warm up took at least  minutes and if I didnt roll out at night Id feel it the next day i felt like shit all the time and everything always hurt. Then I got injured shoulder impingement biceps tendinitis and I had to stop exercising. it took me a long time to recover and deal with other injuries I had accumulated torn hip flexors herniated disc abdominal tear. I learned that even though it looked like I was doing things the right way I really wasnt. My body was misaligned counter clockwise rib cage rotation etc. and I lacked true neutral posture and had sub optimal breathing. Which meant that none of my movement was optimal and stable. Now im back to exercising and warm up takes less than five minutes because I know exactly what I need to do to get aligned and I dont need much recovery work at all.I believe the same thing applies to other athletes some people seem to need way more recovery than others. Part of that is genetic but if someones got hidden movement and posture dysfunctions theyll need much more than the next guy. That being said selection programs are going to make everyone hurt. But the point is that optimal movement not recovery might be the answer your looking for.Theres little harm in grabbing a foam roller and working with it consistently but if you really want to ensure you remain injury free spend some time going through basic basic movements and checking with laser focus either videoed on your own or ideally with a movement professional to see if there are any asymmetries or lack of ROM through joint actions. For specific techniques I think most athletes could use diaphragmatic breathing drills with deep core activation hip ROM checks arm overhead ROM checks and thoracic mobility.,navyseals,dflgdj9,2,t5_2vp9k
