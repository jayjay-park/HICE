1441084,0,t1_ciwwtmy,Really shines when it comes to oral use doesnt it? V. pleasant even compared with JWH smoked mixed. When talking dosages mind that my tolerance for cannabinoids is quite low since I dont smoke weed very often and havent kept up on cannabinoids since JWH really. Overdoing oral ABFUBINACA is something best avoided since it lasts so long.,noids,ciwwzuy,3,t5_2tvgs
7072645,0,t1_d1i14nw,AFAIK yep! I was at . ohm ..V  W cotton eleaf  and would take a couple shovels and make some milky goop in my mod! If youre already researching noids and tolerate em add about triple to four times your avg foil dose in a full tank... go from there and titration by experience will help ya.Remember to clean the gunk every now n then supersaturated the solution by heat dissolve cool method or just supersaturate the solution at room temp by dumping some powder in the liquid n shaking whatcha mama gave ya lol,noids,d1i1pzq,1,t5_2tvgs

10112286,0,t1_dbnklth,Thanks I will keep updated if it works and Ive been sending feelers for acodmt for quite some time actually hopefully Ill get lucky soon I love boomers so its always really interested me that it metabolizes into psilocin in your system the same way but especially because mushies make me queezy sometimes so it would be cool to just have a nicely flavored vape juice to avoid taste and stomach issues,noids,dbpn24q,2,t5_2tvgs

11643591,0,t1_dgfawfr,Brilliant.  Thank you for the information.  Just to confirm youre saying that doses above .mg FMDMB can or have the potential to actually kill a user?  Or is that hyperbole?  Im assuming you mean that literally.  Ive read that all of the fluorinated MDMBs are ultrapotent.  I think Im gonna pass on both after reading this...  Man these drug laws are just the most nonsensical backwards and ridiculous things Ive ever seen in my life.,noids,dgftc7p,1,t5_2tvgs
11671258,0,t3_667xq9,I was an all day noid user when I had to be herb free for a few years. I was terrified of the potential withdrawals but when I was able to switch back to real herb there were no withdrawals. Maybe the natural cannabinoids prevented them. So if you are worried about withdrawals smoke weed.,noids,dgiybhp,1,t5_2tvgs
