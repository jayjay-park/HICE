3825941,0,t3_3459ts,gtReally? Really? Cmon guys Martin wrote. Go look at the last five ten years of Hugo ballots. Count how many men were nominated. Count how many women. Now count the black writers and the Asian writers and the foreignlanguage writers. Yes yes things are changing. We have a lot more women and minorities being nominated than we did in  say or even . But the ballots are still way more white and way more male than not.Heaven forbid they reflect the author pool or their audience.Oh but we should reflect the global racial makeup  fine put your money where your mouth is and nominate nonEnglishlanguage works and figure out a way to get people to recognize the value of works in languages they dont speak or something. Or admit the effort is futile and that the name WorldCon is no more reflective of some progressive globalcultureinclusive worldview than the World Series in baseball.Quick fact check of  WorldCons three have been held outside of Australia Canada the US or the UK. None of those were in South America or Africa and only one was in a nonmajoritywhite country Japan.,TorInAction,cqse1gn,2,t5_37qdu

4715236,0,t3_3fgy8b,Its somewhat of a non sequitur but since he actually mentions Anne Leckie I have to admit that I actually enjoyed Ancillary JusticeSword more than some of the other Hugo Nominees this year.Yes the gender stuff was a little distracting and moreover didnt actually add anything to the story but the story itself actually kept me reading.There is a somewhat female proclivity to keep talking rather than shooting but the action when it comes works for me and the story itself has in interesting and novel premise and is executed well.Shrug In my votes I put her third...,TorInAction,ctow7e9,1,t5_37qdu
4912773,0,t1_cudgt3h,Message from a gamergate supporter I wouldnt regard anything from gawker network as factual. Theyve misrepresented nearly everything regarding gamergate.For example when mike morhaime of blizzard made a carefully worded statement condemning harassment which was worded as call for civility towards both sides this was reported as a condemnation of gamergate on the gawker network.It wouldnt surprise me if theyre twisting things here too.,TorInAction,cudsi6u,3,t5_37qdu
4954571,0,t3_3ir301,What this video highlights is one of the things I find so damn funny about the Puppy Kickers. So many of them cannot understand that No Award is what Vox wanted all along. I mean he flat out said it well before the awards. So many of the PK morons dont seem to know that and pretend he is just making things up as he goes along.The Sad Puppies want to save the Hugos. The Rabids want to burn them down. The only reason Vox did not have all his people go No Award is because the SPs asked him to give them one last chance to save things. ,TorInAction,cuj2b06,6,t5_37qdu
