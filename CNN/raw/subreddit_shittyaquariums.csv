11739643,0,t3_67iv4b,Original text    Little more than  weeks ago me and a bunch of bored college roomhostelmates decided to pay a vist to a local pet storeThis is in India. The original idea was to buy a pair of hamsters but the store had none at the time so we settled for a young betta. It grew it in a cup until it jumped out the next day. We had spent quite a lot of time staring at it and decided this was something we should further expand on.  And expand it is what we did. Wed seen an old cracked aquariumg lying about the hostel. We patched it with adhesive and bought a decent starting pack couple of young betta a pair of mollies guppies and standard common  inch fish. Not too bad until we realised we were a lot more enthusiastic about fish.  We brought pretty much every cheap pair of fish available at our  LFScheap for us was under .. And what was available at the LFS near our homes. And what we could catch in ponds and other water bodiesyet to go big on this. All were small fish though largest would be a couple of  inch goldfish. We also had a particular liking towards pregnant fish which we would separately grow in bucketsg.  Then it dawned on us that we could use a better aquarium one that didnt have dirty panes or an immediate threat of crack reopening and killing all the fishwe were beginning to look at more expensive fish at this time. So we got ourselves a g brand new aquarium for . No filter.  decorated with pebbles. A part of a pipe left behind by a plumber is the only other decoration.  Ok here is our weekold tank with these fish  zebra danios  tiger barbs  mollys  balloon molly  swordtails  small guppysurvivor of an experiment to see minimum size of guppy that can live there.  goldfish  inch and   inch  young bettas  fish that look like goldfishinch common fish noted name earlier but forgot  platys   inch common fish  inch common fish  angelfish  tiger oscars inch  blue  plain gourami  common plecos  filters plants or other equipment About  guppies in other g tank  pregnant molliesplatyswordfish in  buckets. A jar with fry  Recently learnt that this doesnt look good. This whole setup cost less than  shared between us for fish. All  of us have some previous experience keeping fishes as kids. Although it was in a more limited fashion back then we kept the fish in pretty much similar conditions and they lived for quite awhile. Since the  weeks weve started doing this the only fish weve lost to poor water conditions is a balloon molly after pregnancy and a black ghost knife fish because we didnt know shit about raising itit was on the st day so it could be other reasons. To justify this Ill give these reasons I must say in my country we dont look at fish as pets just something fancy to see grow and swim about. The conditions is our LFS arent much different. Heck the other day I bought a pregnant molly from a tank filled half with dead fish. The owner pulled out a dead one with the one I was looking for in the net and asked which one do you want?. Fish is cheap equipment is not. Space is premium in the  metresquare room  of us share. Weve had past successful experiences of raising fish like this. I truly believe fish here are a lot more resilient. We are more interested with getting all the types of fish.  Future plans we are getting a couple of filters from previous fish owners in the hostel this week including a small aquarium. Also planning to add some aquatic plants. But seems like well also be adding a black ghost knife. And a small alligator gar. Probably keep a tank to raise shrimp. Maybe add some locally caught fishes.  Feeling a bit ashamed at its current state so Ill upload pics next week after weve sorted some of the things out. Mainly want to ask how cruel is overstocking fish like thiswe change  water daily? Will it only limit growth? Will they die or just not be happy enough?    Annotated pic by uLimosa ,shittyaquariums,dgqpvi6,1,t5_3be2l
