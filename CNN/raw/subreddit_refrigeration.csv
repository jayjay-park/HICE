888159,0,t1_ch58fhg,Yeah a lot of the older rinks in warmer climates use water cooled evap towers to cool the gas coming back in it evaporates and is replaced by a constant stream of ground temperature water the only problem is if they arent properly treated for calcification you get a massive build up on the coils and it reduces efficiency. ,refrigeration,ch58jmx,1,t5_2ufef

5046816,0,t3_3jjl5x,It could be the sound of vapour rushing through the capillary before the refrigerant starts to condense properly and become a liquid? Refrigeration is based on two pressures  a high pressure side and a low pressure side. The two parts that provide these pressures are the compressor the hum part and an expansion device  possibly the raspy sound. On domestic stuff its almost certainly a capillary tube which is just a long thin tube with a very small internal diameter designed to provide the right amount of pressure drop to take the high pressure side in one end and make it a low side by the other end.When the system first starts up the pipes are full of gas which rush through the capillary really fast  high velocity. This makes a fair bit of noise. Once the gas starts condensing in to a liquid the capillary gets a liquid seal over the inlet side and the velocity of fluid through the capillary slows right down and becomes almost silent.Thats where Ill put my best guess at the minute.One way to test it might be to turn it on and as soon as the compressor starts humming turn it off and get your ear up nice and close to the evaporator probably a white plate with raised lumps on it. If you can hear fluid rushing around and its a similar noise to what youre talking about then voila! I take cash cheque or bank transfer P,refrigeration,cuubzbt,1,t5_2ufef

8874015,0,t3_51ss91,I am a lowly frozen clerk at a grocery store that probably cares way too much about her job. Over the years I have had various stages of frost build up on my pint and odd sizeshaped ice creams ranging from completely covered and unable to read what the product is to small amounts thats clinging to the side of the carton like the small magnets in a Wooly Willy toy. Every time that our refrigeration techs come out for it all they tell me is that thats just how it is its because of the shape of the carton and the circulation and so on. Its not that I dont believe them. Its just that that answer doesnt help me get rid of the problem nor does it help me understand the problem andor fix what I can fix about it to prevent or slow it.I guess my question is is there anything I can do to alleviate this from happening or is there something I need to suggest to the refrigeration techs or upper management to do? I cant remember offhand what the brand of my freezers are atm. I linked hopefully  pics of what Im referring to. I dont have any of when it was really bad.,refrigeration,d7ej57x,2,t5_2ufef
