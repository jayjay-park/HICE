6603753,0,t1_d022ewz,I played him and consistently carried with him in Gold last year with similar scores to whats in the guide. This year I havent ranked up yet so I didnt post my OP.GG. Ive played him with every build imaginable and I really dont think you could get a better build if youre looking for consistent success.It sounds like youre playing him incorrectly to me. Kogmaw should be zero threat to you at any point in the game and die instantly the moment he gets within  range of you. At  items you should be able to consistently and easily v a  item kogmaw or a  item Vayne Ive done it regularly. I think the mistake youre making is youre trying to stack blight before your ult or trying to hold onto your ult too much. AP Varus should not be played in a DPS focused manner. Hes a burst mage with gameplay patterns similar to Annie the difference being that you can auto attack after blowing your intial cycle of spells for added damage and prep.  I almost never auto attack before I ult. The only time I stack blight before my ult is if Im attacking a juggernaut chasing me someone isnt paying attention to me in a teamfight someone is running from me within auto range or my opponent just thinks Im trading in lane but Im actually going to allin after a few auto attacks.Instead you should lead with your ult and use its new passive to get a quick  stack.So for example when Kogmaw walks into range you should R gt auto gt E the E will land about the time your ult puts  stacks on gt auto  times gt tap Q dont charge. After getting just two items Rod and Nashors you can do that before the root from the ult even wears off and it will take Kogmaw from  to . He cannot contest that in any way or form no matter how farmed he is. This combo is your bread and butter and you should do it every time your ult is up. With  CDR thats about every  seconds.  You want to choose your target to blow up in this manner just like Annie holds her ult to look for the perfect time to drop it on prime targets. Target the carry in the teamfight if you can else use it to protect yourself if youre getting dove. Because of your ult combo you should take out at least one person in almost every teamfight because no one but a tank can withstand that burst often two since one is a freebie. If you do this by the end of the game everyone should have learned to never get within  range of you without their team because it should spell instant death for them. You can duel almost anyone this way after getting your core items. You have incredible zoning potential. If they dont respect it you should get really fed.Unfortunately if theyre grouped as a team and you lead with your combo youll usually die because youll get stunned before you can finish or get  man dove after blowing up your target which is why you play in the back and wait for someone else to engage and then enter the fight at the right time to blow someone up when their attention isnt on you.You should also be using this combo to get picks. If you see an ADC pushing up in lane farming gank him! Shoot him with your ult from the bush and combo him! Before he can even flash he should be dead! Dont walk into lane and lead with auto attacks.The mana is only for Q spam early game where youre leveling Q before W. It wins you lane. In teamfights as long as your ult is up you should feel comfortable getting in range to auto attack the closest target similar to how an ADC plays. Thats usually the tank. Dont use your ult on him unless he rushes you and theres no peel hes the most fed person in the game or hes low health and about to get away. Instead just auto attack and use QE to chunk him and wait for a carry to step close enough to the fight to ult and blow them up.If someone dives you exhaust him ult him and blow him up. Because of exhaust your extra  health resistances that fit in your build path and how quickly and powerful you can burst the only ones that should ever kill you by diving on you are tanks and juggernauts. Thats why you take swifties if you need them to kite these champs.If you dont have your ult up youre in a much more vulnerable position and will have a hard time dueling a champ like Kogmaw. You still can duel late game ADCs though  you just need to either start attacking them when they are focused on attacking someone else or exhaust them at the very start of a v duel to win. Normally though you can v an ADC without your ult or exhaust until they get about  items.,VarusMains,d02dsi8,3,t5_38r02
6883299,0,t1_d0wg2j1,At that point I would most likely sell mercurial if your positioning is good enough you wont need it Steraks is quite good so even if someone catches you it should save you. Though you can always sell it and replace with a full damage item.,VarusMains,d0wjdml,2,t5_38r02

8849112,0,t3_51fg1w,So in all honesty if youre against a burst Mage or assassin in solo queue youd probably be better off going AP RoA into Nashors then build defensively to survive while you blow people up with passive procs.But if youre dead set on going AD Poke then Manamune into Ghostblade then depending on the matchup and enemy team comp you can go Maw BT or BC. Pick up a QSS if you need it upgrade whenever. Duskblade is a good item too but youll get a lot of shit if you try to use the passive optimally because you wont be doing as much auto attacking.But to answer your questions best matchup is another poke champ or somebody without a good amount of kill pressure. People like Ori and Cass. And the worst is basically anyone else Kennen sucks GP can be awful once he gets sheen and phage AnnieLBTalonZedInsert assassin here all suck. Its totally possible to play him into any of these and do well but its obviously better to go for a good matchup.,VarusMains,d7bjd10,1,t5_38r02
9272417,0,t3_57b0u0,I thought the best way to find what youre looking for is to check Varus skin texture  the D image that somehow gets added on top of his D model. There are websites that create custom skins which have that texture image or recolored versions of it. I found one but... to my dismay this basic texture by itself is surprisingly bad at showing the tattoo.Heres what Im talking about. There are  pictures in the page Im linking to check the rd one thats Varus Classic skins texture except recolored in red.  Note to the mods Riots stance on Custom Skins is hazy so if linking to a website about them is against the rules please let me knowAgain these D textures look remarkably bad by themselves not to mention its difficult to know which part goes where on the D model. You can see the tattoo in  pieces in the bottomleft and topmiddle. Honestly I think youre better off with a screenshot of his model as the others have posted but Im posting this just in case it may be of use.Only somewhat ontopic but Ive always been curious about that tattoo. Varus backstory claims its a tattoo of The Clever Owl which actively fights back the Corruption. Yet it hardly looks like an owl. Maybe a wing at most.,VarusMains,d8rcg75,1,t5_38r02

10646185,0,t3_5s8l0a,You dont buy Elixir of Wrath for the AD you buy it for the Deaths Dance like healing.  The extra sustain on physical damage makes you just that much harder to kill late game which is important because surviving teamfights is essential to taking objectives as ADC.,VarusMains,dde2m0h,1,t5_38r02

11235812,0,t3_60brhf,Basically the idea here is that not maxing Q basically gives you  spell instead of .Yes E max is very strong. It gets up to  base damage at rank  which is very similar to the  max base damage on Q except that its easier to land has a lower mana cost and isnt reduced by passing through units  not fully charging like Q damage is. However a rank  E is still a strong spell whereas rank  Q is not.Compare a Q max Varus to an E max Varus. Q max has a shorter Q CD with loads of damage and his rank  E has its slow grievous wounds and good base damage  with  AD scaling. E max has a very strong E with a stronger slow but Q  is completely worthless with only  base damage at rank  and the maximum possible CD which is  freakin seconds if you dont detonate blight.There are other factors to consider. Since E deals equal damage to everything in the AOE its definitely better at waveclearing than Q max which deals drastically reduced damage after passing through melees. E also has a lower mana cost so its possible Qtpie is trying to retain the waveclearbot capabilities of prenerf Varus. This is only a guess as I havent seen it played and dont know if a maxed E oneshots waves. If so thats pretty lame because the entire point of the nerf was to make varus less uninteractive and require him to get into position to trade with the enemy. E max is weaker poke than Q max but its still poke all the same.,VarusMains,df5kayr,3,t5_38r02
