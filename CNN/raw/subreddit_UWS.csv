Select the unit section of your appropriate course and tick the boxes of applicable actions e.g. DISCONTINUE. After this just select the box Proceed to Checkout button and continue. Check the new status of that particular unit. When Census date starts you wont be charged for any units you are not enrolled in at the deadline. ,UWS,cpfar33,3,t5_2rsj1
3986328,0,t3_35xa4f,Hey dude For the Data anylysis test It should almost the same only difference should be the values in the Test. You should study the Sample test thoroughly. Now since its an open book test you can take in your lab book and lab manual which should help you. If you know how to complete every question in the sample test already you should have no problems in acing it.  Im not to sure about this Pretty sure its lecture based considering the analysis test is prac based aint it?. I doubt he is going to refer back to the pracs in the final exam. Check the past papers for physics . They are a great insight into what will be in the final exam. Id recommend redoing a but b and c are pretty good. Id focus on part a more right now. If you are really that worried about the loss of  marks Look at the questions you failed on for part b and c prepare for them in the final exam. My advice is look at the past papers for the final exam. Study them and when you make your   pages that you take to the exam bring in notes focused around questions from past papers. Its very similar each year. They make physics  so easy to pass its like you have to try to fail it. ,UWS,craodpi,1,t5_2rsj1
