7530790,0,t1_d2y7hxn,When I took it in December of last year I was convinced I failed because i ended up having to guess on like  of the questions on both parts. I did not feel confident when I left. But sure enough a week later i got the email that said I passed.My friend also just took it as a Mining Engineer Major huge difference in curriculum and had a similar experience but he passed as well.,FE_Exam,d2y7pv8,2,t5_38k9a
7627846,0,t1_d38v8r5,Reference handbook is a PDF. Here is a video shows how you can usesearch the handbook. How to search the onscreen NCEES reference handbook I had one problem using the Psychometric chart and I just eyeballed it. You have approximately less than  mins per question and simply dont have time to plot.  hrs sounded more than enough to me before the exam. BUT on the exam day I didnt realize how time went by so fast technically it is only  hrs and  mins. I was short of time and yup I had to guess some answers. If you are prepared enough I think it is good enough time for you to solve everything. gtThere are questions that require no calculations like questions where the answer is a definition or known property of a system how many do you think there were on the test? Meaning these types of questions tend to free up time for other questions that require more time to calculate. Were there enough of these easy ones to give you time for the hard ones?Yes maybe there were about  questions like that? I cant really recall how many they were exactly. For instance ethics you can use your common sense. There were some questions like you can just search a formula and plug given numbers in. They are easy but you want to be careful with units and make sure that you put all the numbers correct.   gtWere the charts psychometric steam tables phase diagrams interest tables etc used a lot? Did you rely on the reference book or did you have a lot of this stuff in your head? Obviously only the charts and graphs could give the required answers but did you find yourself using the book alot or was it not needed as much?I used some tables. You will definitely need the interest chart to solve Engineering Economics problems. Well I think I used the reference handbook  percent of the time. It is definitely useful but a lot of problems require you to understand concepts in order to solve. You wouldnt be able to solve many questions if you are planing to rely on the reference handbook only. gtHow was the Computer Measurements and Controls section of the test?Typical problems I dont recall anything special about it. Most of them were from Block diagrams and System response. gtDo you recall the Mechanical Design portion? Were they basic questions or were they fairly in depth?Some of them were in depth and some of them were not. Personally I spent quite a lot of time to solve them.  gtDid you Lindeburg review manual do a good enough job to prepare you?I cant really tell you if it is good enough or not. I just solved some of the diagnostic problems the first page of each chapter and did not go through the entire book. All I can say is that the book helps me to refresh my memories and to familiarize with each subject. ,FE_Exam,d398tzo,3,t5_38k9a

8723825,0,t1_d6udx9c,Id say the actual exam followed the exam specifications closely and sequentially. It started off with math first and ended with thermodynamics. However some topics werent tested in my exam such as psychometrics even though it was outlined in the specifications.,FE_Exam,d6w4b7h,2,t5_38k9a
8775881,0,t3_508o2h,Hi! Hope I can help with some of these.   . I dont recall them being grouped together so I would study as if they wont be.   . The search function works exactly like Ctrl  F. But keep in mind it can be difficult to search for equations so you should still be very familiar with your handbook.   . There is a tab where you can see the questions that you have marked. However once you take your break you are closing the book on the first section and you cannot revisit them. Finish the entirety of the first section before your break and be diligent about your time management.   . Yes. Nothing is permanent until you leave on your break. There will be a tab that tells you all the questions that you have left unanswered or marked. Its intuitive.    . Yes. The handbook will have all subjects.  . The NCEES practice exam is the same duration of the actual test. Its a good simulation of the actual test if you can get yourself in a quiet place with no distractions for . hours. Plus Im a firm believer that the best way to study is to do as many practice problems as possible. The problems on the practice exam are probably a little harder than what youll see on the actual exam though. Heres my reasoning The NCEES has a huge bank of questions. Questions that they have paid engineers to create. If they are top notch questions theyre staying in the bank for future exams. If theyre a little wonky maybe a bit confusing well hey they bought them so they might as well use them somewhere. So they throw them in the practice exam. ,FE_Exam,d72nibo,2,t5_38k9a

10580882,0,t1_dd76tig,Awesome happy that helped!For this problem you are seeing the correct formula that you should use in the NCEES Reference Handbook here is a markup of that page for anybody who wants to see where its atPolar Moment of Inertia  Hollow RodHowever in the solution of that problem they are also using a correct formula just in different terms.They are referencing the DIAMETER whereas the NCEES Reference Handbook is referencing the RADIUS...and this must be accounted for.Obviously we know that r  d and when we account for that in the way the formula is presented to us in the NCEES Reference Handbook then that  factor that is created by the value of  in front of the radius must be dealt with in some way to maintain the integrity of the formula.  ...which means if we use the diameter instead of the radius then our result must also be divided by  to keep everything in line.The way its laid out in the handbook we are already dividing by ...add that factor of  and now we are dividing by a total factor of ...and thats why you are seeing it there.I hope that helps! ,FE_Exam,dd7c44v,2,t5_38k9a
10685182,0,t1_ddhtsyc,The probability of passing goes down every time you take it. I have a theory that it is because people become discouraged andor they start to doubt their abilities. you know this stuff its just a matter of getting that onto paper ehem...screen in a timely manner. I would say at this point taking times practice exams is the best strategy for passing unless you have a pretty big knowledge gap in some important areas. ,FE_Exam,ddi3gms,1,t5_38k9a
