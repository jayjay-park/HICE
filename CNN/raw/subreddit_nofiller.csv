948711,0,t3_24yr4b,This is no compilation without any MellowHype. Astro Primo Hell Loco Rico and BankRolls are just a few tracks I would consider. Extinguisher by MellowHigh should be on there too.,nofiller,chc4jns,3,t5_31jn1
1148222,0,t1_chyeubu,haha sorry. Its just my personal feelings on an album. I listened to the album and really didnt like a majority of it. It came off as really generic and I just asked myself Would you listen to this again? and it the answer was no.So I narrowed it down to these particular tracks. Call me snobby whatever its just how I feel about something. These abridged versions arent the ultimate abridges. Thats why there are multiple versions of albums floating around this sub.If you hate it make your own.,nofiller,chysdfc,0,t5_31jn1
