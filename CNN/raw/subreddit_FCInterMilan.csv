455208,0,t3_1zanzn,I loved the fact that Icardi started I feel he works hard. We seem to get a good amount of corners from our attacking chances but dont convert them often unfortunately,FCInterMilan,cfs07yv,2,t5_2vvzn
483665,0,t1_cfv4u9e, GuarinHe was the best midfielder before Inter signed Hernanes. Sometime hiis inconsistency is infuriating but when he played in its position right midfielder hes always been good hes strong quick he can strike and he provides a lot of assists.Dont get fooled by the VucinicGuarin fiasco last year Branca promised him a renewal with an higher wage. Then Branca pulled out this offer.When he asked Juve for Vucinic Branca suggested a swap with Guarin. Guarin who was still angered agreed to the operation because Juve matched last year Branca offer.Since then Guarin spoke with Thohir and he went back playing better than before the winter stop.Its Brancas fault Guarin always said he wanted to play here. StramaccioniI dont think you recall how we were playing in the early  seasonNo tactics at all a lot of luck mixed with the good form of the veterans.Stramaccioni wasnt respected by his players the argentinians Zanetti Cambiasso Milito were ruling the locker room they didnt think he was experienced enough to coach them nobody took him seriously.Cassano even punched Stramaccioni in front of all the other players after an heated argument.Stramaccioni agreed to sell Coutinho and buy Schelotto he conceded an extended Christmas holiday break plus bland and short trainings.All those things bit him in the ass the team suffered from a lot of injuries and he lost control leading to the worst season of the last  years. MazzarriMazzarri isnt a bad coach per se. He is more suited to modest team his teams play a boring and defensive football and he cant manage young players and he usually blame his players for any inter loss.Montellas coaching style is more modern he showed his ability to manage young player and modest squad while achieving big results. ,FCInterMilan,cfv8v9k,1,t5_2vvzn

597716,0,t1_cg7xs3t,Totally agree.  Last season we saw what aged strikers can do when injuries hit.  Palacio needs backup.  He cant keep up that pace all year round because other strikers are injured either.,FCInterMilan,cg87pms,1,t5_2vvzn
1787160,0,t1_ck4evfv,Rotations. It looks like Osvaldo has already made some small mentions during the game at how much he should be fed the ball. Ill be interested at seeing how they work together but Palacio is the best SS and Icardi seems to be doing a seriously good fucking rockstar impression of a CFStriker but Osvaldo is the most selfish by far.Should be interesting how they play. It seems like Osvaldo is a fairly good playmaker to me if he can adjust I think SS could actually be perfect for him but I dont think hell ever achieve what Im imagining.Also I can imagine Mazzarri putting in an extra midfielder and keeping a lone striker up top at times in a pinch.,FCInterMilan,ck4fa0e,1,t5_2vvzn

2169295,0,t3_2jvxpr,A big swing and a miss. Thohir wanted big names. Unable to fund big names that were young he got a big name on the cusp of a major decline in ability.He was directly responsible for a goal against Palermo as he was fucking around in the box and gave the ball away and directly responsible for the first goal conceded from Callejon Sunday when he couldnt clear the ball with his head more than  meters.He has been beaten numerous times even by Higuain who has been awful this season. He has given  penalties to the opposition. Along with the two aforementioned assists that led to goals the  penalties and the red card hes given up  goals just by himself. This doesnt count the numerous goals he played a part in giving up. At times he throws a decent tackle in here and there but that doesnt come close to making up for his mistakes thus far. Andreolli deserves playing time over him but with their investment they wont swallow the loss this early. Im sure communication and adjustment plays a small role in it but this has been almost laughable.Correct me if Im wrong.,FCInterMilan,clfkglg,2,t5_2vvzn

3783278,0,t3_33qt0w,Indeed Rano seems more confident when paired up with Vidic. Both played very well in the pre season tournament Inter took part in. However fast smart players often have no problems dribbling Rano or just positioning themselves better. Dont get me wrong Ranocchia is a solid player however we need our backs to be consistent smart and with an allin mentality which he really is not. He would be a good rotation player if we want to play in Europe any time soon. ,FCInterMilan,cqnit99,2,t5_2vvzn

4908801,0,t1_cud9z3m,im not sure we watched the same gameedit ill elaboratehes very precious as always for defense but in these kind of games at san siro where the opposing team just turtles in their area for  mins we need a more qualitycreativity oriented midfielder. Medels passing is just too basic and slow. we lost kovacic who could break the pace of the game by dribbling  players and do the decisive passthrou and we need another technique midfielder. Kondogbia is defensive enough to handle the low amount of pressure we got in these home games.,FCInterMilan,cudahq3,6,t5_2vvzn

5504012,0,t3_3qh8g1,Ok quick thoughts. Melo is giving the ball away too much in midfield. Unnecessary fouls to add to that. I still feel like Im dreaming every time I see him in an Inter jersey. The rubentus is strong.Kdog makes positive runs and links up well. His passing and balance lets him down though. I would like to see him beef up a little. Hes quite lanky. Also he needs to be careful about those late tackles. Not only is he going to injure another player but he is going to get himself sent off like our good friend Mr. Melo.Perisic made great runs but seemed to become really confused as what to do next. Just ended up making a poor attempt of a pass and breaking the attack down.Brozovic suffers from decision making coupled with a weak st touch. When he gets it right its fantastic but theyre few and far between. Needs more consistency. Was lucky to be fair with the through ball to Ljajic..Icardi was hardly involved in the game. Hes way too isolated. Needs support or to drop a little deeper.Stagnation. Combination of poor passing slow decision making no support for Icardi. Frustratingly slow buildup. All very predictable and easily defended. Same buildup over and over. Bologna just sat back and waited and countered.Were very lucky to come away from this game with  points. Unconvincing win which leaves me with more questions than answers.Also why was Mancini complaining about Melos send off? What did he expect was going to happen..I havent covered all players Im just a little drained from this performance.Really should not be depending on Handa to make last minute saves to secure  points. Anyway Im happy with what I see from Ljajic Kdog and Biabiany..Playing  men..  Defense did well. We have a rested Jovetic for Roma which makes me more optimistic. Want to see him combine with Ljajic. They seem more on the same wavelength. Forza ragazzi!!,FCInterMilan,cwf6ta3,10,t5_2vvzn
5541028,0,t1_cwjudkj,Who do you consider the best in the world at keeper right now?Im too biased to say anything other than buffon but I feel if handanovic played in europe people would rate him higher.Icardi seems like the kind of player that does better when hes the only attacking option I hope he can figure out how to be more effective.,FCInterMilan,cwjwy2w,1,t5_2vvzn
5592099,0,t1_cwpeqmv,Im confused now. Did he come for Seedorf or Pirlo? ,FCInterMilan,cwq93j5,1,t5_2vvzn
5614626,0,t1_cwt0ei6,You dont agree and you say you believe in the contrary yet nothing you wrote talks about that.    Icardi is a striker. Hes not a support striker.    You call him lazy yet he runs all game which no offence makes me question whether you watch the matches. He literally is running all match forcing the keeper and defence into pressure situations. Really dont understand how you can call him lazy. Hell the reason Mancini is often times subbing Icardi off is because Icardi has been running all match and Mancini wants fresher legs to finish off the match.    As for Icardi not going deep into the midfield thats not his job. Icardi is a striker. Jovetic is a support striker. Theres major differences between the two. Icardi will finish chances in and around the net. He doesnt need to nor should he go deep into midfield. If Mancini asks Icardi to go deep into midfield to retrieve the ball we would be sitting here questioning whether Mancini is insane.    I believe you arent a fan of strikers and want support strikers. Personally I dont think you can build a team without one striker but I wont try to convince you otherwise. What I will say is you need to understand the difference between a striker and a support striker. You are criticizing Icardi for playing his position and his role when you think his role is different.,FCInterMilan,cwt1ri4,4,t5_2vvzn
5818984,0,t1_cxie4xi,Ljajic is a real gem. Wish he would have squared that pass to Bia after the Perisic put him through.. My heart suffered in the last  minutes.,FCInterMilan,cxiee2l,3,t5_2vvzn

6372254,0,t3_42y6hb,He would most likely be Guarins replacement.  Personally I believe he would be an amazing signing.  He isnt as physical as guarin but he has the capability of pulling those key passes we desperately need.
