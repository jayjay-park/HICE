6125528,0,t3_3zfqmt,Really depends on the person. I worked for four years at my theate. Popcorn has always been my comfort food and remained so during my time there and to this day years later. I ate what I was allowed to eat during my shift which was as many small cups full as I wanted. Small cups of pop were free too. Everything else at the concession stand was discounted on my shifts but I could only have it on a break. Full price concessions when I saw free movies. I often bought popcorn because thats what you do when you go to a movie.Some of my coworkers loved popcorn and ate a lot of it like I did. One guy used to use double the oil and his popcorn was renowned in our community. We tried to deep fry popcorn once and made a mess in fryer. Some of my coworkers hated popcorn. One manager who worked there for eight years said he had never liked it. He seemed to me to be genuinely disgusted by popcorn. He never said so only said that he hated it but I payed attention to him because he was cute. He was totally grossed out by popcorn.Sometimes that smell lingers. I would get home and take a shower step out and smell butter again an hour later. I dont miss that. Most things about the job however Ill always miss.,TalesFromTheTheatre,cylwq46,2,t5_2yofp
6764733,0,t3_48d1js,I really love working for regal. At my location everyone is really friendly and we pretty much all work together really well. It really does feel like were all part of a team. That is of course my location and doesnt necessarily represent the company. Employees get free movies and we can bring our immediate family and one non family guest. Family can also get in for free without the employee being with them my parents go see movies all the time I just have to call and let management know theyre coming. Employees also get free drinks and popcorn while on shift for breaks and when you leave. We also get half price concessions. I altogether really enjoy working for regal.,TalesFromTheTheatre,d0j28ow,2,t5_2yofp

11361652,0,t3_624ua4,Coming from a theater in the American Southwest.When do you find yourself going to the theater?  If theyre serving you the fresh stuff Im willing to bet a few quarters that its a slower time of day and theyre rate of popcorn consumption is so low theres no reason to pull from the mountain if you have a fresher pile Stalking TalesFromRetail earlier Im betting this is to avoid the angry customer that thinks the staff doesnt like them because they arent getting served the freshest popcorn. If youre there when it is busy...I really cant say.  My theater is set up with  kettles feeding into one massive bin and in my ventures around the country Ive learned that this isnt the norm so its hard for me to have a definite answer for you.,TalesFromTheTheatre,dfjtlr2,1,t5_2yofp
11407068,0,t3_61k7ax,Last summer during an EXTREMELY slow week we got a Spanish kids film titled Un Gallo Con Muchos Huevos. Its a theater in Texas so it attracted a good number of people but I had never seen anything like it before. Its dialogue was completely in Spanish with English subtitles. From what I recall it was pretty dang raunchy too. ,TalesFromTheTheatre,dfoz70g,1,t5_2yofp
