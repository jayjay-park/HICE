I think thats why I enjoyed the  game NM video because he actually put up strong moves so it made you have to think. If you check you actually played slower against him than you usually play against other people and there were multiple times you knew what he was going to play he does something else and you go hmmm... I guess he can do that... as you think about that missed idea. Its more entertaining to see a good fight between strong players than a strong player crushing a weaker opponent.EDIT Also longer time controls could present itself as an opportunity to build a larger repertoire with different openings Queen pawn games and Id maybe say if you feel its not busted from the get go some kind of pet line for a Sicilian would be interesting to make happen as main lines your opponents play would probably be thrown out the window.,crazyhouse,d173a6z,2,t5_38hev

8675671,0,t3_4yqgvt,Here are a few from the weekly event. black vs mathace tried out a new line with an early h to prop up the LS bishop instead of exchanging. Think it turned out decently and I navigated the middlegame complications okay but fell apart under time pressure in the end. Im sure an improvement can be found shortly after h where I sloppily give up a full piece and another critical point was around move  or so where I managed to get the initiative back but couldnt capitalize under time pressure.. black vs. LaViejaVisillo was much worse immediately out of the opening. How should I navigate this early d better?. black vs. IM penguingim similar early d line except I tried Ne instead of c and it worked out better. Fairly pleased with the way I defended this one and managed to come out on top but in this line white does seem to get a strong initiative and youve got to defend very precisely to have a chance as black. Any obvious improvements?Thanks for any feedback!,crazyhouse,d6q2yi1,1,t5_38hev

9253817,0,t1_d8ot55k,FICS is a free server that hasnt been updated in many years lichess crazyhouse is much better because of the interface and bigger community.regarding bughouse chess.com has a long way to go imo for example this futures are missing from chess.com. boards are not on the same size this is so annoying that your partner board is smaller and yours is bigger and it makes no sense.. need to copy fics partner communication buttons its so much easier then communicating with slow typing.. fix some minor bugs and glitches. show who is online and who is open to partner up or play against. leader boards and maybe tournaments ,crazyhouse,d8ozkrl,2,t5_38hev
