6985832,0,t3_4bd7mg,I swam for a while exhaustion cradling me but never hurting.With a swift front crawl I caught up to a passing canoe and hooked my fingers around the rim. I halfexpected to be swatted back down on account of my waning popularity but a hand hauled me up.Sup said Phlegyas. The son of Ares was an okay guy but he wasnt the sort of companion I had in mind. Short tempers make for rash decisions. Yes I couldnt get into Limbo so Id have to start with Lust. Heresy would do nicely too come to think of it along with some of the Bolgia in Fraud.Bored. Any chance I could hitch a ride to Lust? I winked and gave Phlegyas a nudge flopping onto a bench.The demigod king muttered under his breath and continued rowing. Surprised you dont spend more time there really. I might if I had time between this and being entombed starved and tormented.Yeah thats rough man sorry I said.Phlegyas silently stroked keeping a wide berth around the wrathful sinners. You owe me one he said.I nodded and we lapsed into silence. From afar a vista of Circle Four emerged. Dante was right many clergymen were on Team Avaricious and their yelping carried through the evening. I didnt recognize many of Team Prodigal but I doubted now was the time to ask Phleg for a tour. The groups were just finishing their joust.Pap Satn pap Satn aleppe boomed Pluto from his throne. I had always wondered what he was on about.A stream of a shortcut lead old Phleg into Circle Three. Gluttony was a fine place to hide on good days. If demons decided to tempt the gluttons and if Cerberus wasnt on his toes I could often snag a meal that would make Gordon Ramsey weep. Today was not one of those days. A frigid rain of filth pelted us puddling in the bottom of the boat. Phleg rowed on unperturbed. Ice rattled off wood.Shortly after my faithful gondolier banked us. Not a chance Im heading into the storm breaker. Walk from here he said.I clapped him on the shoulder and vaulted onto land. I owe you one I confirmed.The hurricane never stopped in Circle Two. Dante says it symbolizes the power of Lust to blow one about aimlessly but he was super judgy. Ive always thought it was just to buffer Limbo from the inner circles. I trekked inland wet and flustered seeking a familiar face.With a whistle Bakasura landed. Immediately he devoured me.It was nice and warm in his stomach. There was much to be done though. Sighing I regrew my severed limbs squirmed kicked and tickled where I thought his heart might be pressing. It took some insisting but eventually the gelatinous walls heaved retched and flung me out into the storm.Oh its Painbreaker said Bakasura.The very same I said.Eating someone doesnt really hit the spot if they dont suffer a little. Suffering is like seasoning said the beast.Baka Ill leave you alone if you point me in the direction of someone interesting.I could hear his tummy rumbling over the wind. He crouched. Im hungry. Hop on and keep an eye out. Ill eat the first sinner we find then you can hang out with the next one.,Hermione_Grangest,d186ndo,13,t5_3c46n
