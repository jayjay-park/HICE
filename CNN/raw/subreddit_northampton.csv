6626757,0,t3_46fr3u,I dont have the greatest adult perspective as Im  a teenager but I have lived here my whole life and really cant give Northampton a good enough recommendation meaning its really good especially in the categories you listed. I dont plan to stick around here after college but my family often jokes that theyve essentially ruined my adult life in terms of finding a nice home as nothing is as nice as Northampton. Of course this is exaggerated and biased but I think it does show that Northampton is special and a place that I will always want to come back and visit. If you definitely want a town and not a city and your limited to within Springfield vicinity Northampton is without a doubt the best choice.,northampton,d04ribu,5,t5_2rgbi

Clean wellrun wellstocked traditional American delicorner store with pretty great sandwichessaladslunches togo. Im only occasionally in State Street but Ive always had a good experience there as well. Its really sad that Serios Market has closed but were lucky that we still have not one but two locallyowned grocery stores in both downtowns.,northampton,dfyy9z0,1,t5_2rgbi
