900381,0,t1_ch6d7sa,The main problem is that while were normally fine with speculation we generally prefer to avoid speculation that we know is about to get proven wrong. The Others are very mysterious and there are large gaps in their lore that are likely to be filled in TWOW and ADOS. To add the Others to the game we would have to make up our own ideas about all of the following and a good chunk of it would be guaranteed to be wiped out when the next book comes out  Their originnature  Their social structure  The identities of their leaders  The location of their strongholds?  Their goals and the extent to which they are willing to talk to humanity. The answers are probably freeze everything and not much respectively but we need to have some idea what would happen in the event of a successful Long Night so that we could model the result of a successful Other invasion ingame.  The existence and nature of female Others implied to exist by the legend of the Nights King but never actually encountered onpage  The nature of their religionNow personally Im willing to bite the bullet on many of these but not everyone on the team agrees. We have talked about the idea from time to time as the Others would serve an important gameplay purpose making the lategame more interesting for holders of the Iron Throne and are also a major element of the lore.

4340741,0,t1_csdg1f1,Id start by recommending that you start simple.  Whatever your long term plans are start with something much smaller.  No smaller.SMALLER.My goal was to create a start date that took place at the end of Dance of Dragons.  No not a fully fleshed out scenario.  Just literally  Can I create a start date?Start dates are called bookmarks so I went into the mod folder and searched for bookmark.  That showed me the relevant file.  I opened that file copied and pasted a bookmark and changed the date to the one I wanted.I started up a new game.  My start date was there!  I tested it out.  It worked!  Goal one accomplished.Next question  Could I kill a character?I searched found the file of a character I wanted to kill off for my start date found other places in that same file where other characters had died and copied and pasted that to the character I wanted to kill off changing the details as needed.Then I loaded up my game...and it crashed.  The answer was no.  I could not kill someone off.After a lot of poking around in the files I figured out that the problem was that I was trying to kill off a character who was scripted to lead an army at the time I was killing him off...I had to change who would lead the army.  After that it worked!So I killed off the characters I wanted to kill off to represent the world at the end of Dance of Dragons and tested after each death to make sure it worked...fixing errors as I found them.There were some surprising things.  DANCE OF DRAGONS SPOILERS  I wanted to replace the Commander of the Nights Watch.  I thought I could do that in the Nights Watch folder but it didnt work...turns out there was a seperate The Wall folder and I needed to replace the commander in both files for it to work.There was probably a smarter way to do most of the things I did but I can tell you that with a lot of patience a lot of trial and error and a lot of CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THE GAME STILL WORKS AFTER EVERY SINGLE CHANGE I was able to do most of the things I set out to do...except events.

4622110,0,t3_3ea9xz,Not necessarily what you mean but one of my favourite characters was a little Baratheon girl the granddaughter of Stannis and Cersei. I cant remember exactly what happened but Stannis died at some point and the family lost the Stormlands. So Stanniss daughter only had Storms End. Cersei though became lady of the Westerlands... but remarried while still of childbearing age. Her daughter not wanting to lose her chance then committed a spot of matricide and became lady paramount of the Westerlands. However her vassals didnt like this kinslaying ruler too much and promptly asked for her to abdicate which she did.So I ended up playing as this wee girl from the Stormlands in Casterly Rock with many Lannisters hanging about.Cue many many rebellions and wouldbe usupers trying to press their claims. I was convinced the girl wouldnt make it to adulthood. But she did and proceeded to become an awesome ruler claw back the Stormlands from the usurper and live to ripe old age as the matriarch of a once imperilled but now thriving house Baratheon.,CK2GameOfthrones,ctd6x4h,10,t5_2vx0p

Mainly with prisoners and your children.

8103774,0,t3_4pjta7,Ive played a few games as them. The first one was the best though.As Rodrik I raised my levies and abandoned Ironrath to flee from the larger Whitehill army along with the forces from the Clansmen up North what other choice was there?.I got lucky and the Whitehill army got wrecked by Stannis forces and I was able to siege Highpoint all the way as everyone just ignored my army. I won the war a bit miffed that I didnt take Highpoint from the Whitehills but eh. Sadly Rodrik died a few days afterwards due to his crippling injuries leaving Ryon as Lord of Ironrath since Asher was disinherited wish there was a decision to allow him to inherit like in the game.I trained Ryon in the ways of court intrigue and roleplayed him as a vengeful young man who despises Houses Whitehill and Bolton for the pain they caused on his family and the loved ones he lost by their hands.I fabricated a claim on Highpoint by this point old Lord Whitehill kicked the bucket and had his eldest son forgot his name as Lord of Highpoint. Now one thing I noticed was that my levies had replenished faster than Whitehills meaning I had a slight numerical advantage. I took a loan from the Iron Bank and hired some Hedgeknights to help out marched to Highpoint crushed their army and sieged down their holdings gaining me a second county. Unfortunately Ryon then became a tyrant after refusing to give Highpoint to his uncle since Ryon was still only a count.In the meantime Lord Roose was waging wars of reconquest on the Northern Lords for some reason they became independent after Stannis lost his bid for the Iron Throne. Ryons lessons in court intrigue also payed off and was now the Spymaster for the regime in the Dreadfort.Now Ryon schemes to overthrow the Boltons and either put a Stark back in Winterfell or if he must take the North for himself.For some reason I just stopped playing nowadays Im not sure why.,CK2GameOfthrones,d4qxqye,1,t5_2vx0p

11585074,0,t3_65clx4,You only get to claim the Iron Throne if Robb is ambitious which he doesnt start with so you had a choice between Renly if hes alive Stannis and power vacuum. You picked power vacuum and Tywin was closest and took power probably because he was coming for you. Robb wasnt fighting for the Iron Throne which is why he usually doesnt get to claim it.If you end the war with the Iron Throne before the other wars then the megawar system kicks in which Hoster or Edmure will be independent and will decide whether or not to help you in any wars.Twywin didnt conquer anything  the Stormlands Reach Vale and Dorne simply returned to the Iron Throne as the megawar system dictates at the end of a war.Since Tywin joined the war for dawn the Iron Throne split again as per the megawar system and each Lord Paramount could join or not.After that war finished they all returned.Im unsure about Trident declaring war on Iron Isles perhaps Bloody Vengeance casus belli.Iron Throne declared war as the Iron Isles is de jure Iron Throne territory and they wanted it back.When Hoster or Edmure died the war ended and Tywin won his war and presumably stripped Balon of all his titles and so now owns Pyke.There are several ways to gain lands. Invite claimaints land them and invade. Since you have an Emperor title you can do this for Kingdom titles. Marriage into your line to gain claims for your heirs or marriage into your line to get claims for children in your dynasty eg marry Harry Hardying to Sansa matrilinearly Harry dies giving baby Stark a claim to the Vale. Conquer the Vale and baby Stark becomes one of your vassals.,CK2GameOfthrones,dg96bf8,5,t5_2vx0p
