8017275,0,t3_4p18t6,Hey thanks for the great feedback! Awesome! D That is a good idea and I played around with something similar in development.  I personally felt the game dragged a bit much with only  spells but starting with all  does indeed make things more chaotic... Some others have mentioned this to me also.  Its partly due to the fact that the Raid difficulty is a bit random.  But I think youre impression is spot on.  Ill hardcode in some logic so that the first raid is guaranteed to be easy!I hope you continue to find the game interesting and compelling as you progress! ,idlemageattack,d4h7si5,1,t5_3deiv
8142573,0,t1_d4vco9e,Ok thanks for the report  Ill investigate today.  This would definitely be a painful thing to happen.  The InventoryPack code is pretty clean though so I should be able to either find the bug or rule it out ,idlemageattack,d4vd85x,1,t5_3deiv
8268693,0,t3_4sp6nb,I was able to do my first meditation as in beat the portal at power q. and my second at s. I think. Currently going for my rd Meditation. I think to beat the portal after every meditation it increases which zone you need to get to in the portal by a few levels.The idea is once you clear the portal meditate ASAP. You dont get any benefits for going past the point of Meditation AFAIK. So do that  times to create the Omega Lumen stone and then beat the final boss at . which unlocks NGDo that all over again  more times and you will officially do all the content there is so far. But I believe TopCog will be releasing loads of more content before anyone even gets anywhere near NG,idlemageattack,d5b57z9,2,t5_3deiv
8304129,0,t3_4t9gs8,For me enchanting takes   hour. Its not bad for me because I use the time to level up spells to get passives. What I usually do is I constantly use runs every  seconds until I get the time down to an hour which takes about    minutes for me. Then I either use items to speed up the remaining time or leave it alone and do something else. I also only enchant every  levels at least which doubles the power tending to reset every  or . If each run gives you lt increase its time to enchant. If a run gives  then  runs about  minutes of active playing doubles your power.,idlemageattack,d5fknd1,2,t5_3deiv

8938870,0,t1_d7mbcet,With a low CD build I dont think you can kill them. The only thing that will hit them is probably inferno. Try raising tempered magic. It might be better than than this build for now,idlemageattack,d7mbj9t,1,t5_3deiv
9098589,0,t1_d85hrl4,I even thought why TopCog didnt nerf very good spells like meteor or icy prism and didnt buff others like icicle which for me is completly useless.By the way nice stats dude!,idlemageattack,d85i4wm,1,t5_3deiv
9157391,0,t1_d8cqucv,gt would you rather see the damage without the freeze status factored in?Absolutely.Its pretty obvious that things like freeze burn etc as well as other utility effects like Sparks will unquestionably have impact on DPS. Spark for instance is mostly awesome because of the fact that it improves the DPS of another spell entirely.Although having that clear in the help file would be important too. IE The Base Damage in the spell description is an approximation of the amount of direct damage the unaugmented spell is expected to do per casting of the spell without any consideration for secondary damage effects such as cooldown bonuses or status effects. For example the Base Damage for the Light. Elemental spell indicates the approximate total expected damage done during the entire time that the elemental is summoned without shock effects or augmentations factored in.Incidentally even with augs firebomb still doesnt hit three enemies at full damage. Unless Im missing something?,idlemageattack,d8crlae,1,t5_3deiv
9208084,0,t1_d8j4lt6,It appears to be immense amount of status effects on one enemy causing the lag. Im getting it with this set up as well no runes same x. cooldown bonus ,idlemageattack,d8j6yv1,1,t5_3deiv
9695092,0,t3_5dxth0,How do I petition the devs to change the skill name to meatball,idlemageattack,da84jm8,2,t5_3deiv
9963859,0,t3_5hgytb,One wordSPARK    spark have the insane property of reducing s CD to the skill on the leftAugment so the other skill is boost massively. Because the s is fixed if you are able to cast spark  times per sec your main skill would cd per sec. One thing to keep in mind is If your main skill is .CD it will NOT cast  times for each sparkspark reduction doesnt carry over. Because of this you should be taking skill that is  or more times longer than spark ,idlemageattack,db6bf4m,1,t5_3deiv

10557493,0,t1_dd4f741,I would also like to thank you for telling us which spells increase SpellXP. I knew the elementals has it didnt realize there was more,idlemageattack,dd4t7qo,2,t5_3deiv

10711348,0,t3_5t7u9h, I feel like two hours total is a little long. I usually have the game open and check it every ten minutes or so for periods of about  hours at a time so Id like to be able to watch an ad every thirty minutes of active play without the two hour total timer. If you implement this design in any form would the Reward Rune stick around after recall? More than a minute? If not could it interact with the Lantern so that while the rune is floating around the Lantern cant auto recall?gt Gives Stable Runes equivalent of a Rune Cachegt Also gives a Stable Q Health Rune Q Death Ray and a small amount of Runite gt Immediately activates a Q Combat Rune casts a spell every  sec for  min not a typo changing it to  min in v. I feel like these rewards that you currently have set are a little too much for the time for an ad viewing. I think that you could remove the first of the three stable runes as if from a rune cache and it would still be worth it to view an ad for the other rewards. Except for the Q health rune but I typically dont use those anyway.gt Once you activate a Reward Rune the next one will not spawn until  hours have passed and you have logged  minutes of active play tracked in the normal way. If I decide for whatever reason that Id rather not watch an ad and just take the rune cache would I still have to wait out the current timer before Id get another Reward rune? Suggestion only start the timer after an ad has been watched. Unless you think people would rather just take rune caches to avoid the timer.Edit formatting sorry Im new to reddit,idlemageattack,ddksmyy,2,t5_3deiv
