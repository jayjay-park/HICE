1971778,0,t1_ckqk6hd,Great. Thanks for the info. I am on OSX so LoopBe is out. Im still getting the hang of both programs so it will be some time before I try to integrate them I think at least beyond sampling etc.cheers.,renoise,ckqssxr,1,t5_2s7qc

6673567,0,t3_470uyz,Ive done a lot of experimentation with this in the last year. Its totally normal. But here are some things Ive found that help me. On the free tip it helps to listen to other music and pay attention to where things sit in your headphones. Takes practice. Also Ive found Voxengo Anspec helps me as an analyzer to see where things sit. Ill load up songs I think sound good into a sample slot and play them through the analyzer to see how they dance. It gives me an idea of where things should sort of be.On the pay tip these things have been quite beneficial to me. Redline monitor plug in from db helps make headphone work a bit clearer. They explain what happens in headphones way better than I could on their product page. Its an interesting read and reasons why your speakers sound so different. Also Sonarworks headphone calibration is quite good as long as your headphones are on their supported list otherwise you can send them yours to get a profile made. One last thing is the subpac. Its a device that simulates sub frequencies you put on your chair. That one costs the most as the other  options are fairly cheap but I do find it really helpful when forced into headphones. A lot of pro friends are doing very nice mixes on headphones these days and Ive managed to do a couple that were great as well. It just takes a bit of practice. So Im quite convinced you can do great work in just headphones.One benefit of headphones is youre not going to have any room correction problems. Each of our home studios are bound to be really problematic so headphones is actually a benefit regarding that issue. ,renoise,d09lry6,2,t5_2s7qc
