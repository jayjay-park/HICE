971097,0,t3_2584q4,Fl Studio Fruity Edition is available for less than  dollars. I started making music with FL Studio and now have moved on to Ableton but Fl Studio is a fairly powerful program that with practice you can create very power tracks like Martin Garrixs AnimalsDisclaimer Martin Garrix does not use Fruity Edition though he uses the full versionThere are couple of free DAWs out there in the link on the bottom of the page but honestly I have no experience with them. The advantage to using paid applications is that there is usually a community behind them that will create high quality tutorials on how to make music with the respective programs. I would recommend looking up How to make techno with insert program names to see if you like one program over the other. Be it the look the workflow the sound whatever that will make you want to come back and play with it more look for those features and go for it!All programs usually offer free trials as well so look into those to get a feel for each program. ,startwithabill,cheo8vf,4,t5_2ybkw
