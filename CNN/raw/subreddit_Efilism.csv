5544980,0,t1_cwkamn7,You said just asking so I thought maybe you were honestly curious. But I now gather from your last response that you werent just asking you were commenting. Well I attempted to give you an answer above but Im guessing youre not really looking for an answer.So seriously what do you care. People think and do what they think and do.

Are you really so shocked everyone doesnt rush right into a major decision like that?So yes what is it to you if they follow through or dont. Their life their choice.,Efilism,cwkemi1,0,t5_2w5p7
