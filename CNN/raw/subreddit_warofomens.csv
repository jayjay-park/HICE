Ill be looking into MP in a few days then after I have continued to see if I can upgrade some more cards and learned a bit moreabout the CardMechanics that might help.,warofomens,co53lzl,2,t5_30jbg

3785640,0,t1_cqns4av,Right. The difference between that and forgery is forgery HAS to be played around. Its not going to stay on the field long because the other player is going to buy cards.Overflow isnt really something that happens in a lot of games. Either theyre starving from resource denial or flooding from synods. In either case spending  gold and a bank slot to get one card that they have control of if they flood isnt a good deal.Basically with the effect so circumstantial it needs to be bigger. ,warofomens,cqnsjlh,3,t5_30jbg
