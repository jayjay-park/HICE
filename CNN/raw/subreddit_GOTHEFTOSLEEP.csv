2921505,0,t3_2tkace,So we ferberized our then oneyearold adjusted age a couple months ago.  He sleeps through the night except for maybe a onceamonth crying fit that lasts about  minutes.Most nights hell go to sleep without a peep or maybe a minute of complaining.  A few nights hes not quite ready for bed and will complain  minutes before sleeping.Naps are another story.  Hes still doing  napsday and for a while he was taking naps without too much complaining but its gotten much worse in the past month where hes crying sometimes very hard for  minutes before finally going to sleep and then hell sleep for at least an hour.  Its possible his nap requirements are changing so its hard to pinpoint when the best time to start the nap would be.For these naps I  think from a Ferber point of view were at the point of minute checks so I will just watch on the baby monitor.  If hes starting to settle at say  minutes I wont go in.  I will stop trying to get him to nap if hes still active at  minutes and thats almost happened a few times he conks out at  minutes.,GOTHEFTOSLEEP,co06mtz,0,t5_34xqg

My LO is  months and its hard to imagine toys being a hazard to his breathing at this point as long as theyre baby safe with no removable parts. But I kind of feel like theyd keep him way too stimulated to sleep. It doesnt take much to distract him from sleep.,GOTHEFTOSLEEP,csfl5es,1,t5_34xqg
