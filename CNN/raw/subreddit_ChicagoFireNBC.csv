The finales end would have been much better and would have built up more suspense for the offseason had they had the ex stab both Kelly and Kidd offscreen and then fade to black with both of them bleeding out on the ground.This would leave the audience guessing the whole time whether Kidd dies Kelly dies both neither. ,ChicagoFireNBC,d3b4qj5,4,t5_2usdz
