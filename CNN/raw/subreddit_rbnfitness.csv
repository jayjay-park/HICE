If he treats people like that regularly rest assured that he will be the one who is alone and maybe not physically but if you lie to and manipulate people you arent connecting with them on a real and honest level. Please do not blame or hate yourself. Rejection hurts but you may realize you are better off without someone like that you are.I would recommend focusing on loving yourself some great advice has been posted here. If you try to date while you are feeling vulnerable you may attract some wolf like people who are seeking weak partners to prey on. Find your strength something you are good at and work on mastering it find little things you like about yourself start small. When you are stronger you can protect yourself better. You are worth loving! Edit Oops I didnt realize this was in the fitness section of RBN. I didnt say anything regarding. Ill share with you what Im trying myself.My therapist suggested to find an activity any activity of low intensity that I like. The key being that I enjoy it. Im told that if you are physically moving and also finding pleasure in it is when your brain starts to release those feel good chemicals and give you more energy. Ive been trying tai chi. Yoga meditation martial arts dance running with an mp player are some suggestions. Im not at a regular routine but Im starting to like the time out it takes rather than dreading and picking myself apart like in the past with intensive workout and restrictive eating. Try to look at physical and mental health like two pieces of the whole. ,rbnfitness,cq6v6mt,3,t5_37m4i
