Considering that you are in UK i do not know what is preferable.Second do not make any statements in that respect in public. Since your statment deviates from the facts established in criminal trial it could be considered slander if you still have it in UK. On the other hand you can hinder the prosecution. Third maybe the prosecutor is aware of the lie and is trying to compromise the statement of the defendant in the later stage of the proceedings with some other proof. ,LegalAdviceUK,cldxgji,1,t5_32g6u

Which IMO if very vague as vague as the terms and conditions of the privalegeclubcard.There will be video signature and bank records to show that some one other than myself has picked up the items and has always claimed to be some one else.If they fire me for my clubcard being used shouldnt they also fire several other employees that allowed the orders to go through? e.g. the employees that let him collect knowing that he wasnt me or even the employee that signed for the item once signed as me not him instead of giving him the pad to sign.What annoys me is that even if he or I was selling them its a daily occurrence. I witnessed several managers buying reduced priced electrical goods Think Laptops for  tablets hard drives for under  and other electrical items for pennies filling trolleys with them then leaving the store.I also witnessed a manager selling one of the laptops to another member of staff I had reported all this to Head Office and no action was taken I could not report this to our HR rep because one of the managers that was committing this was in a relationship with the HR manager at the time.I would never want anyone else to get fired but it seems like a weird way to act.,LegalAdviceUK,co91y2x,1,t5_32g6u

That seems more difficult when they cant talk to the person in question in the normal way but frankly I dont see how much more secure it is to talk directly to the person as theyre hardly going to recognise their voice anyway.Businesses should all have policies that set out how they verify consent in these situations under the EA   a password or security questions are commonly used. ,LegalAdviceUK,com21hx,2,t5_32g6u

With no contracts signed and no fixed employment it seems pretty unlikely that the university can argue that they have sway over any pending patents that you file in regards to the solution. Largely in the universitys eyes putting pressure on you to hand over the IP is riskfree and high reward so I believe that they dont think they have a chance in court or anything of the such and theyre just seeing if they can make some easy money by effectively defrauding you.

4369943,0,t1_cshjtd5,Yeah but you dont just get to walk in there and review the entire list because youre curious.For a start do you have any formal legal training at all?  Or are you as I suspect a legal layman?  If the latter how do you plan to ensure that the detentions are lawful simply by looking at a list of prisoners?  Even if a prisoner were being confined unlawfully would you know the difference?  The process of charging convicting sentencing and managing prisoners is controlled by a complex collection of common law case law primary legislation such as Acts of Parliament and secondary legislation such as Orders Regulations and Codes of Practice.  Some solicitors dedicate their careers to the understanding of these rules.  What knowledge of these do you have?  How would you be able to apply that knowledge to a list of prisoners?  Do you have the time to dedicate to reviewing each individual case there could be hundreds in your chosen prison each of which might run to hundreds of pages of evidence and trial and sentencing reports and crosschecking all the details against the rules governing detention?  Moreover when detention is decided by judges who frequently have decades of experience with criminal law... why would you want to?  What commentary of practical value could you possibly have to add to the decisions of legal experts?Secondly it is the responsibility of the prison service to weigh the benefits gained from letting just anybody walk in and look at the list of prisoners and the very real risks to personal information which that incurs.  The prison service is bound by the Data Protection Act and names and addresses  even of prisoners  are personal information and therefore protected by the Act.  Moreover some prisoners  especially organised gang members  might not want just anybody finding out where they are.  Indeed they may have some very dangerous enemies outside of prison.  And some people are imprisoned for very emotive offences such as child abuse.  The risk of vigilante justice by some nutjob is too high to have that information available to just anyone.Given the two above why would they give just anyone access to prisoner information?  Given that . of the public will not have the knowledge necessary to help anyone inside the prison its far more likely that any such right would be abused by those wishing to harm the prisoners either in prison or on their release.  I think its far more likely that youre just looking to sate your own curiosity rather than having a true altruistic aim in mind and youve confused todays whim with a right.Lastly each prisoner has access to free and independent legal advice.  They each have access to their own private legally trained solicitor to represent them.  I dont know what you think youre going to achieve by just walking in there as a layman and looking at a list of names when each individual prisoner has access to a solicitor.gtit is impossible to find out if they are being confined lawfully or not.To ensure that prisoners are confined lawfully is not your responsibility.  Unless you have actual legal training what you are asking is like saying I would like to access a list of the locations of all of the UKs nuclear warheads because I want to make sure theyre being stored safely.  Its not your concern and even if it were you dont know how nuclear weapons are meant to be stored you dont know what storage is safe and what is unsafe  you dont have a clue what youre talking about and would be able to make no headway at all to what is a very lofty goal.  The same likely applies to ensuring detentions are lawful.,LegalAdviceUK,csi87bk,3,t5_32g6u

4452919,0,t1_csrv2gx,Re  there are no damages but there is an effective statutory compensation in place that is triggered once the deposit has not been protected within  days as required. There is no need to show damage and the law is quite straightforward but the process to get the compensation is a bit complex.OP First bear in mind the agent need not always transfer the deposit some schemes allow the agent to purchase a kind of insurance policy and keep the deposit themselves. Make sure they have not done this instead before saying anything. If the deposit is truely not protected the law is very much on your side but the process to bring a claim is a bit complex on deposit compensation. Further only bringing this up in response to a different dispute would likely make you a lot less sympathetic. So you may wish to try to use the threat of it as leverage. Dont start proceedings without warning  first because it costs money and second because the courts dont like that you should try to resolve a dispute before starting an action. The situation re moving out early will be very dependant on what was actually said and done by the tenant and agent cant really say more than that.

4945353,0,t3_3in4jm,To be honest the above is not very clear and hard to understand. Have you had advice on making this claim? Some comments concern me like portray them in negative light due to their stupidity. People often get caught up in the issue of making the other side look bad but looking bad is not a legal argument. Have you clearly established a legal basis for the claim? A claim of X was stupid and it caused me Y in damage is not a legal argument. A claim of X owed me a duty of care evidence they acted negligently in breach of said duty evidence as a result evidence I suffered Y in damage evidence. Is a legal argument. Your basis for claiming isnt clear Tort? Contract? but even if you can show what you say that isnt enough to show they will have to pay. There are concepts like remoteness and mitigation. Mitigation means that if the gym renewal is costing you  for a year but it would have cost you  to get a taxi to go there in person to cancel then you should have done that and your damages are  not .Based on the above I would go and try to get some advice even if free advice from CAB.

Either way probably legal.gt All the residents are on shortterm licenses to occupy not real tenancy agreements. When the agent moved in I was told this means my deposit called a refundable administration fee is not considered a deposit under The Housing Act . I was told if I wanted it secured I had to pay more but I couldnt afford it. The contract also says that the administration fee might not be returned for  weeks or longer depending on when they secure a new tenant.Potentially massively not legal. Your landlord or agent doesnt get to just decide youre living there under licence. Use this work work out if you have a tenancy  Generally speaking if you have exclusive occupation pay rent and do not live with your landlord you will have an assured short hold tenancy and are covered by all relevant legislation.If you do have a tenancy your deposit needs to be protected else the landlord is liable for up to x the initial amount of the deposit as compensation plus your original deposit. Consider this your bargaining tool.gt Iwe are contractually accountable for the inventory plates cutlery utilities etc. even for things that were missing when I moved in.

Dont pay anything if they dont give you your deposit back its small claims court time.gtThe contract contradicts itself in a few places it talks about giving  weeks notice whenever I like but also talks about a hard checkout date with fees for late or changed checkout. No checkout date is defined anywhere. Im now outside the date of the agreement i.e. the start date  length of the agreement has passed but Im told I cant leave for another  weeks. If its an assured shorthold tenancy then after the initial fixed or agreed term then your tenancy will become a statutory periodic tenancy.

5762341,0,t3_3u2r2x,To answer your question it is possible that this would be regarded as a bad faith prosecution a type of misuse of process.  Bad faith prosecutions are abuse of process so if it ever did get to court and the judge decided that the prosecution was an abuse of process he could dismiss it.  So although there isnt written law anywhere about it it is effectively illegal.Selective enforcement of criminal law is legal and is done all the time but not in the way you describe.For most charging decisions there are two tests that must be conducted the evidential test and the public interest test.  The evidential test is conducted first the person making the charging decision if a police officer then likely a custody sergeant or civilian evidential review officer otherwise a prosecutor from the Crown Prosecution Service looks at all the available evidence and says Using the evidence in front of me alone is there a reasonable prospect that the suspect would be convicted if they appeared at court and pled not guilty?  If the answer is no then either more enquiries need to be completed or if all enquiries are complete then no further action is taken against the suspect.If the evidential test is Yes then and only then is the public interest test applied.  The public interest test should never be applied to cases which do not meet the evidential standard.The public interest test is a little more subjective it asks What is the aim of prosecution?  What harm was caused and is it proportionate to spend public money prosecuting this case?  Is it ethical to spend public money on a trial for this offender? For a full explanation see hereIt is very rare that a prosecutor will judge there to be no public interest in proceeding with a case  Ive seen cases fail the public interest test only a few times and always for very uncommon reasons such as offender is terminally ill and would likely be dead before trial or offender is already in prison serving long sentence for much worse offence.  But it does allow the prosecutor to selectively drop cases where theres no point in prosecuting.,LegalAdviceUK,cxbdeg8,7,t5_32g6u

5848684,0,t3_3va5xv,There are multiple benefits to reporting a crime even if you quite rightly in this case do not expect the police to actually devote resources to investigating it or catching anyone.Firstly you get a crime report number which will be helpful if youyour landlord claim on insurance.Secondly crime reports go through some pretty advanced analysismetaanalysis tools to identify patterns and correlations helping to direct police resources more effectively.  If your area is seeing a sudden upswing in instances of criminal damage then this will help your local neighbourhood team work out which areas need more frequent patrols and work with the local government to direct community safety funding as well e.g. by adding or improving street lighting or CCTV coverage.Thirdly lets say that at some point in the future the police catch someone on CCTV spraypainting the same tag design somewhere else and they identify the culprit.  If they have your report then they can go back and take that report and ask the offender about it  they may even get a charge out of it or have the offence taken into consideration at sentencing.

Youve done a modification to your phone which Motorola specifically warns you will invalidate your warrantyThey specifically warn you more than once on that page both in legal language and plain English that doing this means bye bye to your warranty. They even saygtYou have only yourself to blame. Unless you have a Developer Edition device once you get the unlock code your device is no longer covered by the Motorola warranty in other words please dont blame us if things go wrong even if they appear unrelated to unlocking the bootloader.Every single tutorial or thread Ive seen on XDA or wherever specially warns about warranty when doing these kind of mods. For this exact reason. Youll have a hard time getting a court to back you imo. Warranties are subject to fair behaviour with the item and possibly clauses within the warranty documentation. Adding a nitrous oxide kit to my car will void the warranty cutting a hole in the glass of my fishtank will void the warranty unlocking my Sony Xperia z will void its warranty and this is precisely why I havent done so with this phone as its within its warranty.I think youve just learned an expensive lesson here.,LegalAdviceUK,cxp5ji5,-6,t5_32g6u

Also remember that adverse inference is not actual evidence just something that the jury is allowed to consider and inference alone cannot prove guilt.All of this only applies to interviews under caution it may be different under different circumstances most notable terrorism offences so dont expect to have a right to silence at a traffic stop or stop and search.

I can count on one hand the number of times I have been able to refer to previous calls before attending a call of this nature.

Is the Council or the Tenant making a private prosecution?A private prosecution is a prosecution brought by a private individual.  Therefore a prosecution brought by the Council is not a private prosecution by definition since the Council is a public body.A tenant could bring a private prosecution if they were not given the information required by the Landlord and Tenant Act or the Housing Act in the same way as a shopkeeper could bring a private prosecution against the shoplifter.  However this is a complex and often expensive process for the legal layman.  He would have more luck reporting the breach to the Council who could then institute criminal proceedings in the same way as the police institute proceedings for other crimes.In short any person may bring a private prosecution against any other person for any criminal offence.

Contact the management company and request that they reimburse you for these costs.

You dont have to pay etc.The best to way to proceed is to have an independent engineer produce a report giving you a cause of the problem.If it is your fault and you are joint tenants then you are likely to be jointly and severally liable for the costs. The landlord can also keep your deposit to pay for the works. If the damage is valued at more than your deposit he can take you to small claims court.Also the landlord has a duty to carry out repairs even if you are likely to have to pay.

Unfortunately just because no injury was caused doesnt stop people saying it was hoping for compensation. That could cause police to make an enquiry with you  however you wont be looking at a prosecution unless what really happened is drastically different you sped away she has a broken foot etc and they have solid proof you would have known. With the circumstances you describe genuinely your worst case scenario would be the female lying about a minor injury police speaking with you and the matter down to your insurance to argue she was lying which could have a knock on effect for your premiums.

Doing this requires a certain level of both maturity and mutual respect and I accept some parents are truly unreasonable.

9889062,0,t1_daw4ula,I agree with your conclusion  the estate would need to pursue your brother for the back rent and I dont see how your mother is liable for it.I mustnt speculate but I imagine things the other way around  that it is your aunt who owes your mum money and the other sibling because it was her job as executor to pursue the tenant for rent or evict him in good time.I think that would be crazy to litigate but equally your aunt must accept your mum has no liability. I think that is the compromise they must arrive at.I read the other day that its quite difficult to remove an executor from their position some links in this comment  I think instead youd get a solicitor to send your aunt a letter appraising her of her duties and then her own solicitor will tell her she cant get away with depriving your mum on these grounds. I wrote a few months ago about finding and choosing a solicitor and also the other weekIf youre in England or Wales then ensure Tim Murden is amongst those you speak to  he specialises in wills and probate and Im sure hed know how to proceed. I ended up with a different company but the solicitor I originally chose is no longer with the firm so cant recommend them so unequivocally as I would have done before.,LegalAdviceUK,dawkg4w,2,t5_32g6u

Even if you make no profit then you would still need to register.  Realistically speaking though.  HMRC investigators are intelligence led.  You would technically be within the hidden economy so in the extremely unlikely event you were investigated it would be done by a human.  That person would not take your earnings on face value they would want to see evidenc going back a few years bank statements etc.  At the very end if you have told the truth any potential fine is the lost tax plus a percentage of that on top.  If you realistically arent expecting to earn much all that would happen is you are compulsorily registered for S.A.  In April newl rules come into effect though where you can earn up to  a year on projects such as this without registering.  If you can wait until April then consider doing it then.,LegalAdviceUK,dbwsgo9,4,t5_32g6u

10723632,0,t1_ddm23nw,The problem is that I simply cant pay it back over the next six months. I could afford it over  months. Another aspect to the problem for me is that my boss has known about this for several months but chose not tell me because she knew it would be upsetting. In that time  i.e. since I returned to work I signed a new tenancy agreement locking me in for the the next few months to a rent I now cannot afford. My only option now will be to take some kind of loan to pay them back and then move home with my parents as soon as my tenancy agreement expires to save enough money to back back the loan. I just find it difficult to process that Ive been forced into this situation. In addition to all this I apparently am supposed to meet with HR and bring my bank statements with me to show them. Part of me wants to be helpful but another part of me feels like this is a bit of an invasion of privacy and Im not feeling especially welldisposed towards them. ,LegalAdviceUK,ddm2a47,5,t5_32g6u

11068205,0,t3_5xq66r,Update My partner spoke to a solicitors on Sunday morning and ultimately we found out that what my bfs parents had told us couldnt have happened because social services dont work that way.Contacting the NSPCC  times within a year doesnt count as harassment  it would only count as harassment if I was constantly contacting them with information. Even if I was contacting them constantly social services or police wouldnt say that Ive been malicious or harassing because thats accusatory. Fran would have to say Ive harassed them and would have to provide evidence that my behaviour has damaged the relationship with Harry.Fran cant put out an injunction against me based on the above because its gonna cost her money to do it and shed need to prove that I was somehow harmful to Harrys well being. What she can do is attempt to take Harry away from my partner but shes not likely to do that and if she does she knows full well that well end up fighting it and she will probably lose as theres not enough grounds for it. My BFs parents also talked about something called a preventative steps order which doesnt actually exist. Theres a prohibitive steps order which relates to parents or legal guardians needing to ask permission before taking the child out of the country or changing schools. But thats nothing to do with me and my boyfriend hasnt attempted to change Harrys life in any way without his mums permission so why this is being brought up is baffling. My bfs dad turned up at the flat last night and exploded at my bf. Their behaviour has been quite irrational throughout this entire thing theyre insisting on keeping us both in the dark and becoming irrationally angry when we ask questions and tell them what weve found out. None of it makes any sense and I dont understand why they are reacting the way they are. Im wondering if theyve massively overreacted to an empty threat made by Fran or whether theyve made the entire thing up themselves. Is there anything I have missed? What can I  should I do in this situation now? Im uncertain about contacting my bfs parents because of how irrationally angry they can get. Any help would be much appreciated.,LegalAdviceUK,demkjsg,2,t5_32g6u

11097646,0,t3_5ygi8j,gtIs he looking at serious trouble?Not serious trouble but it might be a little trouble.My reading of the situation is that your friend has sought out the dad of the children and shouted at him telling him that he would be subjected to violence if it ever happened again.  I am assuming that in addition to his threatening words he didnt use or brandish any weapons or use any action like shaking his fist which could be interpreted as violent or threatening immediate violence.This conditional element negates any form of assault or an offence of causing fear of violence under s.  Public Order Act  since for either offence the violence must be anticipated in the immediate future  the conditional element negates this since the violence is being threatened for some future unspecified time when the bullying recurs.The most serious offence I can think of is an offence under section A Public Order Act   Your friend used threatening words causing another person harassmentalarmdistress and intended to cause them harassmentalarmdistress.It could also be viewed as an offence under section  which is where a person uses threatening words and causes someone else harassmentalarmdistress but without the requisite intent.If your friend has a clean criminal record and admits to making threats then this sounds suitable for a police caution or even a PND a  fine which doesnt result in a criminal record if the offence is downgraded to a section .If it did somehow make it to court the sentencing guidelines indicate that this would be at the very lowest end of the sentencing range  a fine and little else.  But I doubt it would ever make it to court.,LegalAdviceUK,depwptu,5,t5_32g6u
