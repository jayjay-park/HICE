369987,0,t3_1ybx59,Expect its paywalledRichard Stallman the president of the Free Software Foundation has long been an advocate of individual liberties. Mr. Stallman says software should give users freedom and not restrict their actions. He recently shared with CIO Journals Rachael King his thoughts on how technology is being used in the context of government surveillance. The following is an edited transcript of his remarks CIO Journal With Edward Snowden and the NSA revelations do you think that general awareness of security and privacy and individual rights has been raised? Richard Stallman Yes thats a very good thing. Snowden is a great hero. Three cheers for Edward Snowden. CIO Journal Why in your opinion is he a hero?RS Because he told us about the dirty things our government and other governments are doing to us secretly. Theres a famous question who watches the watchmen? Now we know the answer. Whistleblowers like Snowden watch the watchmen if they can. This is why we must make sure its safe to be a whistleblower. If we want democracy we must make it safe to be a whistleblower. But thats not easy to do with all the surveillance there is because the surveillance is used to identify whistleblowers.If you require that much heroism to be a whistleblower and not get in prison were not going to have enough whistleblowers. So we have to make it so we cant catch whistleblowers.CIO Journal How do we do that?RS First I want to explain what will not work. Laws that limit when the government is allowed to access the massive databases that are being created about all of us will not do the job. The reason is that once the government labels a whistleblower as a criminal that will be the excuse to look at the databases. Its a criminal investigation.  Now the state has to have some surveillance power. It has to be able to investigate after a crime is committed. What it must not be allowed to do is access databases about everybody that were collected. It doesnt make a difference whether its in the governments hands or the phone companys hands as long as the government can consult it whenever it decides its allowed to.We need to make sure those databases do not exist.CIO Journal Will that hamper legitimate criminal investigations?RS Of course it will. A state which has access to all the data it takes to find every real criminal is a state with no democracy. We have got to decide what we want what our priorities are. Those who want more surveillance will always say give us more data about everybody and well find some more criminals but they dont find the big criminals. Any claim that we need more surveillance of everybody in order to catch criminals in the U.S. is a joke.CIO Journal Are there ways in which technology communities can respond to surveillance and mistreatment of users?RS We must demand the redesign of systems that dont belong to us such as phone company systems Internet service provider systems license plate cameras toll payment systems all sorts of things.Write to rachael.kingwsj.com,snowden,cfj44u2,2,t5_2xjl1

1050664,0,t1_chng03h,gt Well to be fair there are no clearly defined rules for posts here so its not all your fault. a matter of perspectiveTo be honest I am as interested in the bullshit written about this subject as I am about the facts because the bullshit can be more influential than the true story.  I expect people who visit this subreddit to have a strong enough grounding in the material to be able to decide the difference for themselves although I encourage editorialization to make the point more strongly if that is required.This subreddit is unashamedly proSnowden.  If thats not your bag than you dont have to stick around.gt The CIA reportedly engaged Afridi to stage a fake vaccination campaign in the city of Abbottabad Pakistan ... with no links to sourceThat fake vaccination program is common knowldedge.gt Then you get the obligatory anti vaccine comment in the comment section.Are you really castigating us for comments written on another website?Im sure that antivaxxers posting here will be treated as they deserve but it hasnt yet come up.gt I just see pieces like this as click bait with no real news in it.The news is that the White House has actually acknowledged that hijacking vaccination programs for national security purposes is causing a resurgance of polio around the world.  If thats not news to you then what exactly do you care about?The reason that it is appropriate for this subreddit is because of the obvious hypocrisy of complaining about hypothetical lives lost caused by Snowdens leaks when the White House demonstrably does not care very much about lives lost in other countries caused by its national security agenda.gt  I moderate a sub you have in your sidebar..NSALeaks.

1111449,0,t1_chulzym,There is a concept in common law called attractive nuisance. An attractive nuisance is something like a very sharp blade that happens to be in the shape of a childrens toy... if a child walks along and picks up the toy and cuts himself the ownercreator of the nuisance bears at least some responsibility even if the nuisance was on his own property and the child should not have walked over to touch it.The government cannot just create any hazards it likes and then disown the very predictable consequences when those hazards materialize. Inevitably government secrets leak... and illegal government secrets ought to leak in a free democratic society. NSA not only created arguably legal programs that are probably way too risky to be justified on purely pragmatic grounds but they are simply breaking the law under any interpretation except their own classified interpretations of it. Most of these programs even the arguably legal ones are an attractive nuisance in my view. They were always bound to leak in one form or another cf the  leaks regarding the NSAs taps on the ATampT backbone. With so much potential for economic damage and with so much difficulty in containing the secrets to prevent that damage I think a free and open debate of these programs was bound to lead to the conclusion that they just arent worth it even on a purely pragmatic calculation.And as any civil liberties advocate knows the law itself is fraught to begin with. Look at the stopandfrisk program. No one can doubt that such a program is inherently racist and agitates against a free and open society. Many of the programs revealed by Snowden are the digital equivalent of stopandfrisk... except theyre stopping and frisking everyone and tracking their movements and communications etc. etc. Wiretapping is today generally taken for granted but there was a time when the wiretapping power was controversial.Personally I dont see how the government should have the right to do anything that a private citizen cannot do. If the private citizen should not commit assault neither should the police officer. If the private citizen should not tap his neighbors phone line neither should the FBI. The entire architecture of the post powers wielded today by the major intelligence agencies NSA CIA FBI DIA and the other  agencies that report at least dottedline to DNI is built on the foundation of the wiretap power as if it is a wholly uncontroversial power. Its not uncontroversial. Its been abused to spy on civil rights leaders such as MLK Jr. and has been used to collect dirt on political enemies of the state and intimidate democratic social activists in the peace movement just to name a few wellknown examples. It doesnt take much imagination to see how the power to read anyones emails or phone calls  as well as pull a record of all their past movements according to their phones GPS  translates directly into political power.,snowden,chumoxf,3,t5_2xjl1

3211079,0,t3_2wwrr4,Russian journalist Andrei Soldatov has described your daily life as circumscribed by Russian state security services which he said control the circumstances of your life there. Is this accurate? What are your interactions with Russian state security like? With Russian government representatives generally?ESGood question thanks for asking.The answer is of course not. Youll notice in all of these articles the assertions ultimately come down to speculation and suspicion. None of them claim to have any actual proof theyre just so damned sure Im a russian spy that it must be true.And I get that. I really do. I mean come on  I used to teach cyber counterintelligence their term at DIA.But when you look at in aggregate what sense does that make? If I were a russian spy why go to Hong Kong? Its would have been an unacceptable risk. And further  why give any information to journalists at all for that matter much less so much and of such importance? Any intelligence value it would have to the russians would be immediately compromised.If I were a spy for the russians why the hell was I trapped in any airport for a month? I would have gotten a parade and a medal instead.The reality is I spent so long in that damn airport because I wouldnt play ball and nobody knew what to do with me. I refused to cooperate with Russian intelligence in any way see my testimony to EU Parliament on this one if youre interested and that hasnt changed.At this point I think the reason I get away with it is because of my public profile. What can they really do to me? If I show up with broken fingers everybody will know what happened.,snowden,couttmm,5,t5_2xjl1
