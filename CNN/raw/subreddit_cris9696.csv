818113,0,t3_23h7la,hello thanks for this post. the problem is that you used a . in the name of the app. A period tell the bot that the command ends there and everything after a dot gets ignored. If you omit the dot the app will be found without problems because the bot seach for Mr Number and not only for Mr linkme Mr Number.,cris9696,cgx9t39,3,t5_2w3my
