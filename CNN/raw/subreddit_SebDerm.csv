7667987,0,t1_d3dsbba,hmm interesting predicament. My view is fk doctors and fk dermatologists. But he has credentials up the wazzoo. But... I dont think that dermatitis is purely dermatological. Certainly not in origin. So theres the detla  desaturase issue but even that is remedied in theory with gamma linolenic acid so diet. But I think its a fact that dermatitis is an inflammatory condition and such conditions are intrinsically linked to the immune system and the gut. I mean jeez what isnt dietrelated?? try it and see if you can prove him wrong! do an elimination diet for two weeks. Im on week three now and my face is still good with no skin care to speak of.,SebDerm,d3dt1da,1,t5_31r3z
8336407,0,t1_d5jaxcw,Well Head amp shoulders has a specific shampoo for seb derm and you really should buy a bottle of Biom. Probably once or twice a week I use a zinc soap bar or a coal bar just to get something new on my face. Ive managed to keep mine under control but if I go say  days with out any treatment I feel the beast starting to spread on my face. I just want to let it do its worse just to see my real self for once... lol. ,SebDerm,d5jlsw1,1,t5_31r3z

9345133,0,t3_5883hp,I mentioned this in another post but I had no luck with any of the normal remedies sea salt dandruff shampoo honey face mask etc. and then i used Lucky Tiger Ointment. Within a few days I am completely clear. No scales and no sores. Its one of the few topicals I have seen that is specifically stated to help Seb Derm. Its pretty cheap too,SebDerm,d90k9ib,1,t5_31r3z
10996100,0,t3_5swcna,Just looked up the ingredients of the Malazepam cream and it contains mineral oil and safflower seed oil. You dont find that these make the SD worse? I also tried the Noble zinc soap and it worked for two days and then my SD flared. I attribute it to the emu and olive oils in the soap even though I wash it off. I literally cant use any oils at all ugh!,SebDerm,deedh9v,1,t5_31r3z
11121980,0,t1_dejq94i,Yeah Ive read a lot about this  my skin is more sensitive to a flare without the coconut oil and it gives my skin such a glow on top of what the honey does. It honestly depends on your own skin type.Plus you only use a tiny amount of the oil  it sinks under the skin and renews. Its a strong antifungal like the honey. If you used coconut oil in its refined liquid form  it would not work. But each to their own ,SebDerm,deso1bk,1,t5_31r3z
11143740,0,t1_dery9nm,yes  I was using diluted steroid cream every day  which worked but is not a long term solution. Now I simply try and keep as moisturised as possible physiogel is the best moisturiser I have found and I havent had redness in a long time well every now and then when its hot and humid  but I attribute that to ,SebDerm,dev4qhx,2,t5_31r3z
