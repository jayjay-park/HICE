6968363,0,t1_d166yq9,gt  Its just textbook prerendered.You seem to be making a huge jump in logic with some big assumptions. First of all the actual video is horrible quality so it is hard to judge the quality of the gameplay but also many apps that use the phones camera end up with a much lower resolution than the true camera which would make sense to save battery with the AR.Also if this was all prerendered then why wouldnt the pokemon have perfect interaction with the background? Even the pokeball and masterball drift around on the ground while they are shaking if this was prerendered then shouldnt they have made that not happen?Youve given  evidence that this is actual prerendered video vs live camera other than very very limited suggestive thoughts so to jump right to saying that this is prerendered rather than it could possibly be prerendered is totally misleading.,TheSilphRoad,d1677ru,3,t5_3c2d7

7790089,0,t1_d3r7ypb,Do you mean when you are attacking a gym? You can only ever use one of your own Pokemon to attack a gym at one timeit doesnt matter if its your teams or another teams. If it belongs to your team you train the gym giving it more prestige possibly leveling it up. If it belongs to another team the gym loses prestige points maybe causing it to drop a level and therefore a defending Pokemon.edit see SpiderBrads comment above,TheSilphRoad,d3rnv79,2,t5_3c2d7

When I get stressed I can definitely come across condescending.  My wife is laughing over here agreeing with you that its a character flaw of mine.It was crazy doing a broadcast immediately after the live thread as we had no time to prep  we were literally transcribing the live broadcast right before  so errors like the LED colors definitely happened.  We said we suspected the field testers were super fans  but we definitely didnt recognize them as JWittz or Aaron Cybertron Zheng until after the stream ended.So thats all pretty embarrassing. But its good for me to hear to be honest. For the record for most of that broadcast Moots was silently working tech miracles.

8228940,0,t3_4s39sq,Honestly this whole thing got blown way out of proportion by a single person who latched on to an idea panicked a little and had a fair bit of skill at writing up their concerns such that people would pay attention.Internets like that sometimes nobody really asked for sources beyond a comment saying you were gonna apply to be an LLC because its easier than nonprofit and specifically said the web app would be free the very next line! and nobody really considered that there are other revenue streams Silph Road swag for instance which would honestly be fine even if you WERENT putting the vectors up for download which would complicate matters and that if youre turning a profit in ways that dont affect the free services provided then the net result is WAY BETTER free services.Seriously. This is how Google operates. They use their other revenue streams to offer stuff like Docs Gmail Analytics and of course their search engine for no cost to the consumer. And Im not even saying that Silph Road should do this! Just that even IF they were going down the road of going full forprofit salaried employees public stockholders the whole nine yards youd still get your free web apps. Its arguably the most successful business model in the tech world today so even if Dronpes here was purely out for profit SPOILER hes not youd STILL get your free web apps.So my impression is that one person maybe with prior experience of things like this going sour and so easily alarmed at even the slightest mention of profits jumped the gun and posted a big persuasive bit about it a bunch of other people saw that and took it at face value and here we are. I doubt anyone had any real ill will towards anyone and while I dont see a problem with people taking steps to ensure that Silph Co. keeps itself honest if they need the peace of mind I seriously doubt that they will ever prove necessary.Will verify that this sub has massively improved my GO experience.

And it would seem several more coins were spent on incubators probably enough to have  eggs going at a time at least  from the number of eggs he has.  So between lures incense eggs lucky eggs etc this seems pretty average.  Nothing wrong with any of that but its not as baffling knowing the context.  Its more important to note that OP isnt lacking and hasnt spent a dime presumably since the Pokemon inventory space is at its default and he has  eggs meaning he likely is only hatching one at a time.

8300738,0,t1_d5f4nv8,The reason I disprove of using Chansey in general is because it is much more advantageous to use something like Vaporeon. Eevees are uncommon in all areas if I recall correctly while Chansey is either area exclusive or km only. The resources required to get Chansey to  requires a significant amount of dust and candy. Vaporeon has only two type disadvantages being grass and electric. Grass types are out of the window because of the amount of rapidash charizard and arcanines being used. This means Jolteon is basically the only viable counter to Vaporeon in the current meta. Jolteon has much lower cpl than vaporeon though so that makes him slightly less viable than vaporeon in the current meta.With Chansey you are locked into defending which it does a worse job than Vaporeon. The two moves sets are either going to be a fairypsychic psychicpsychic or psychicfairy being  for power of moves and none of them receiving STAB. Psychic would be best option in locations flooded with Primapes Hitmonleechan. Fairy it only good for dragons which Dragonite isnt in this patch.Use what you want but Chansey is not efficient to use at all in the current meta.And yes I have both a  chansey and a  vaporeon.,TheSilphRoad,d5f5ey6,2,t5_3c2d7

Theres a spreadsheet going around that sorts Pokemon by offensive capabilities and  of the top  use Water Gun the other  being Kadabra and Alakazam with Psycho Cut and Golem with Mud Shot.

8320140,0,t3_4tgofw,The first person to put a pokemon on a gym should almost always be a Flareon! Flareon is very easily beaten by pokemon lower cp than it so it makes it much easier for other people on your team to raise its prestige. It hits hard but attacks relatively slow and almost never uses charged attack. This means its very easy to take down a Flareon even with a huge level disadvantage. Everyone after the first person should always put a pokemon of a higher CP than Flareon to help defend the gym.Ideally this is probably one of the best ways to raise gym prestige. First person puts a  flareon in the gym. Everyone else trains against it with a  cp vaporeonstarmieetc and gets over k prestige per battle.,TheSilphRoad,d5hknrw,5,t5_3c2d7

That should narrow the range enough for you to determine if they are keepers.From your list Eevee  and Eevee  are definitely keepers. Anything  is worth hanging onto and eventually evolving unless you happen to find better ones before you are ready to evolve. Those two will be very strong relative to the general Pokemon population because the majority of Go players arent nerding out on IVs and stuff like this.

There is a pokemon LEVEL cap that is influenced by TRAINER LEVEL and therefore a CP Maximum can be determined but each pokemon has a different CP maximum. The proof is that if you look at your current pokemon you can have one that has a more complete semicircle but has less CP than another such as dragonite or gyarados and other high CP pokemon even though their semicircle bar is smaller. When you evolve the pokemon it becomes another species and therefore have another CP maximum.,TheSilphRoad,d5rhuqg,1,t5_3c2d7

8406459,0,t1_d5s4yyp,There cant be. Different levels have different ranges of possible results so a  relationship is impossible. At best if you knew how they determine the level you might be able to use one or more known levels to narrow down the possibilities. So you definitely cant in general determine what level one person would get by knowing only what level someone of a different level got. And even if that much information were possible to obtain I dont see what use that would be.Id be curious to know how they do it anyway though... I might do some experimentation with my bro. Id guess theyre either generating a large random number and taking the modulus of the level which would be somewhat predictable  if you know several different levels people of different levels observed you might be able to narrow the possibilities someone of a particular level would see or theyre doing a proper HMACunique value per spawned pokemon | player level in which case you cant extrapolate anything.,TheSilphRoad,d5scpqy,1,t5_3c2d7

The notifications inform users how far away it is how long itll be there and tapping on the notification pins the coordinates on Google Maps and routes you to it. According to my eggs I walked a little over km tonight in about  hours at a local park chasing Clefairy Magikarp Gastly and the like. Its like I get to play the game again and its a great feeling.

8414216,0,t1_d5tazbd,What convinced me the theory that all caught pokemon from the wild are integer level was indeed false was exactly this eevee I linked. One spreadsheet gave me no combinations found one gave me combinations  perfect. I then used a proxy to find the exact IVs and compared them. The spreedsheet with no combinations found but lying and entering that I had powered up my eevee yielded the exact IV combination the eevee ultimately was. The spreadsheet with combinations  perfect did not have the combination the eevee ended up being. I then lied on that spreadsheet as well to pretend I powered up and found the IV combination again.Everyone else may be a doubting Thomas but I have definitively seen the light and know for a fact it is possible to catch pokemon at noninteger levels.

8431102,0,t3_4v1m8x,Things Niantic should do Add the information who caught it to every Pokemon. At the moment this information is easy since there is no trading but after trading hits it is really important. If a cheater gets banned every Pokemon he caught gets purged no matter who has it now. Yes this means that innocent people might lose a Pokemon if somebody bought it from a spoofer and traded it with another player but thats just a natural risk. Marking the original owner of the Pokemon and purge them from the game in case the owner gets banned means that selling botted Pokemon on eBay will be highly discouraged because you can never be sure to keep what you bought from the botter... Only allow trading locally and with some sort of connection between the two smartphones  be it NFC Bluetooth or even a cable. Otherwise spoofers will sell botted Pokemon and deliver them with spoofing to the buyer. Hire a programmer who knows the scene buy all those cheating programs find ways how to identify their users among your players and ban them in waves  without any exception and permanently. I just wanted to try it is not an excuse! Use cell phone tracking methods every few minutes maybe in a random interval of  to  minutes and compare the location with what the phone tells the server.

8435628,1,t3_4v6uu6,I dont think it is a really good idea to level up a gym yourself especially when you are the first one to put a pokemon on it. First if there is any trainers on your team and they put their pokemons up its  instant prestige and whats even better is they can train it too so it will be much more efficient. Second if there happens to be an enemy trainer around heshe can easily take your gym down even you build it up to like  prestige because all you have in the gym is a cp magikarp and we know that prestige goes down much more quickly when being attacked by enemy trainers. The only situation I imagine this works is that there is no one nearby but in that case you can probably get away with  prestigeassuming you take this gym because it is close to your reward timer.  You could do it for the xp. So in this case you want something that defeats the defending pokemon in less than  seconds but still gives  prestige. I think any low cp pokemon with watergun can do it faster than that.  TLDR In my opinion it is not very efficient to level up a gym by a single user. Use a pokemon with watergun if you really want to do this.,TheSilphRoad,d5vzref,0,t5_3c2d7

8459473,0,t1_d5yk8ze,Niantic is highly unlikely to ban accounts based on this information. Info taken from Because of how much noise there is in this location data. Location services on your phone can vary in their accuracy of finding your exact location over time as you go under bridges into buildings move to areas with less reception etc. The middleman service queries using your location once per minute at all times during the day while Pokemon GO queries Niantics servers for Pokemon using your location every  seconds or so but only when the Pokemon GO app is actually open. So the times and exact latitudelongitude of location data received by Niantics servers are unlikely to match up between queries sent by the Pokemon GO app and queries sent by the middleman service.In addition you are protected by the noise of the crowd in two ways You are not the only one in your area sending location data to Niantics servers everyone around you playing Pokemon GO is also sending that location data. So if youre at a PokeStop with a lure or just walking around the city or even just hanging out in your backyard with a friend in all cases there are multiple people in the same location all playing Pokemon GO and sending their location data to Niantic. Because of this Niantic has no way to distinguish which users in a location are using PokeNotify and which are not. Niantic is not going to risk banning users it is not sure are using PokeNotify  remember they are trying to get as many users playing this game as possible and trying to make money off of each and every user. Youre not the only person in your area using PokeNotify. Over  people have already downloaded PokeNotify and thats just in its first few days available. All of these people are looking for Pokemon in their area. The middleman service is smart though  it doesnt look for Pokemon in an area if its already looked in the last couple minutes. Instead it just continues to use that slightlystale data when responding to the PokeNotify app. So every couple minutes only one user using PokeNotify in your area is actually having their location sent and that user is very unlikely to be you more and more as more users use PokeNotify. And due to users turning off their phones enabling  disabling the PokeNotify app at different times and changing locations this means theres probably a different users location used for your area every couple minutes not the same users location every time.,TheSilphRoad,d5yyw9i,4,t5_3c2d7

8462658,0,t1_d5z7f2a,Pokeballs are the smartest money move by far. Theyre ineffective and that requires the player to buy higher numbers of them. Those high numbers fill the players bag and force the player to buy bag upgrades. Great or ultra balls are effective enough that they do neither of these things as well and thus cut into profit. Selling ultra balls definitely would cut into bag expansion purchases in particular. Business wise its always more profitable to sell a buttload of ineffective products than it is to sell fewer but more expensive ones. Expensive scares away potential buyers while cheap affordable pokeballs work more like an addictive slot machine. You put in your money again and again hoping it will one day pay out. Sometimes it does but more often than not the dealer puts the majority of your cash in his pocket.,TheSilphRoad,d5zda0b,9,t5_3c2d7

I also saw a stop listed on a pokestop finding site that I thought would be a stop its a large gazebo in the middle of a small park one of the more recognizable landmarks in my city but doesnt appear to be one yet.  Its possible that because its listed on that site it will later be added or that theyre drawing information from Ingress and that stop was removed for some reason.

8470074,0,t3_4vonjv,What a great idea for a thread! gtnew gym mechanicsWhat new mechanics are you referring to? Sorry Im a bit behind in this part of the game since I dont battle much.Im level  and this is what Im doing to continue enjoying the game Im using PokeAdvisor to help me quickly weed out low IV Pokemons. This tool makes the game fun again! For normal Pokemons I only try to catch them if their circle is green or yellow. I only try to capture orange or red Pokemons if they are something I need for evolution. I focus on hitting Pokestops getting eggs and hatching them. I love walkingjogging so it is something I want to do anyway. This just makes the process more rewarding. I no longer take nests for granted. I lived  minutes away from a Dratini nest but didnt go often because I assumed it would always be there. Now that I know nests can go away Im going to be hitting a Charmander nest this weekend to finish my Charizard before that goes away too. Im still trying to hit . I know tons of people have already done it but I still want to be the first among my friends to do so. Im looking forward to capturing more  IV Pokemons.

8474008,0,t1_d60rvsa,I agree with what you said but I just want to add that it does put more strain on the servers not by it itself being a hog but because it means people can use the pokemon go app and the website at the same time.For example when Im at home I have the app open most of the time on my phone to catch the pokemon that spawn around me at my house and then Ill also be scanning with the website on my computer so I dont minimise the app its still going to see which pokemon are just out of my app range so I can go outside and get them. So thats one user requesting twice as much data or whatever probably not twice but definitely extra from the server due to being able to use  things at once.Theyre not really relieving the load on the servers much by shutting it down though because then people just go to other sites that work worse. Or multiple sites to see which is better. ,TheSilphRoad,d60sj8t,2,t5_3c2d7
8474410,0,t3_4vp0bs,Um...I actually saw the majority of player angry at the hidden fixes  like making Pokemon harder to catch have a higher flee rate etc and the main escalating point seemed to be the fact that they removed a buggy feature without communication.

8496779,0,t1_d63flii,I agree with all this and to add to what OP was asking about wrt attacking and defense IVs it sounds like the defense one is part of a multiplier to see how much damage you take. Dont remember the full formula but the important part was attacking Pokemons attack statdefending pokemons defense stat times some other stuff so basically having the  for defense will help it take less damage and the  helps it give out more damage. for dragonite in particular tho its base ads are  so your ones IVs make it  . better than a dragonite with s for all IVs. Since stamina is the lowest base stat you get more of an effect out of having a good IV their i.e.  a  in stamina makes it  better but all in all its not overly meaningful your dragonite is already a high cp and from what I understand has the right move set for playing defense so you should feel fine with it as is but you can also power up if you want too as you know it has the move set for what you want it to do,TheSilphRoad,d63ncz8,2,t5_3c2d7

8505437,0,t3_4w7fd1,Edit After actually doing some math with assumptions and writing this post as I did it I think that  is easily obtainable within a month if you focus solely on exp have time and spend a little on lucky eggs. Probably  or something would be tougher not sure how much exp it takes to get there read it somewhere but forgot.Second Edit I had  or  of my regional pokemon Far Fetched I know I transferred  not sure if I transferred  as I have  candies so I know one of them was from an egg at least. Just good luck although Onyx Aerodactyl Kabutops Omastar Chansey Weezing and the two slimey things still evade me...Lures spawn monsters every  minutes so maybe you can be a bit more generous with your math although that extra  exp per catch is already quite generous though evolution exp makes it not as significant. I believe pokestops refresh every  minutes? So that would be an extra  spins per hour too that I dont think was calculated in there.With this you could modify it so that they spend slightly less time per day catching pokemon and spend some time evolving some of the pokemon they catch throughout the day which would give considerable exp.So that would be  pokemon per hour per poke stop so  pokemon per hour. Which along with the  pokestop spins should be    exp so  per hour without lucky egg and throw bonuses. With lucky egg thats  exp per hour farming  lure spots. If you play for  hours a day doing that youll get  pokemon and  exp. Im not sure how common pidgeys weedles caterpies are in relation to other pokemon but Ill assume  of them are those three so we will have  per day which will allow us  evolves may be a bit less or more but around there.  So thatll be another  exp and only take an extra hour or so assuming the person also had to manage his inventory etc while farming. So that comes out to  exp per day without that  exp bonus from throwing excellent every time. Which to me seems very doable and could have started on day  as some people are lazy and dont like to move or care about catching rare pokemon etc.Although  of them being the  evolution pokemon may be a bit generous but thats ignoring the other  not evolving so I think it makes it a relatively safe assumption.Now this person has only played for  hours a day when in fact I believe  hours is quite reasonable for someone who has a bit of time so even if we factor in some pokemon escaping and the occasional really tough pokemon to catch along with another k exp or so from hatching eggs per day assuming  k egg and  k eggs per day and ignoring the hatching of some k eggs getting K exp per day isnt too difficult for those solely focused on grinding exp and this isnt even the most efficient way though it probably is one of the least physically taxing methods and financially cheaper methods as generally the  lure spots Ive seen have an uptime of around  so youd really spend money on lucky eggs and incubators.Meh I guess I should have focused more on exp then hunting rares with little luck apart from Snorlax who seems to follow me everywhere lol had  Snorlaxes spawn right on me well  was a lure that I farm while at home.,TheSilphRoad,d64qfz4,3,t5_3c2d7

No super strong indication of rare Pokemon spawning however there was a significant observation upon returning closer to the city area. As soon as our nearby map picked up a Pokemon our next incense spawn was that exact one was the case for a pidgey and venonat picked up by all  of us subsequently..So having a clear map overall did allow us to catch more rare Pokemon but its all relative to the area..

8522777,0,t1_d66vuv1,I dont immediately cap my heavy hitter nor second and tertiary offensive Mon.  So I could get a spawn that has higher CP and top tier IVs.  An example is an hour ago Nidarino thats  ths of the way across the CP meter.  Had a Nidaran m drop that was also exactly ths same Stardust cost that is .  If it was higher level Id have candied the Nidarino and evolved the Nidaran.  If Id been blowing Dust on the Nidarino just three levels having a higher levelCP drop would negate that Dust.  So basically since nothing is capped when you rise in level a drop might be higher level.  Ideal moveset obviously matters most but if spawns are aplenty where you play its likely something else good will come along thatll save you having to level up along the way.Also do you need that many Mon powered up?  I take down midlevel gyms with one somewhat powerful one and a handful of lower CP Mon.

8536839,0,t3_4wmddj,I was in the same situation yesterday but ended up evolving mine to Vaporeon based on this Theres no way of knowing if Umbreon or any future Eevee evolutions will be as OP as Vaporeon.  Youre  guaranteed evolving Eevee into an OP Vaporeon assuming you havent used the Rainer trick That said if you wait and choose Umbreon you may have to hope it doesnt randomly evolve into any other evolutions. Adding more Eevee evolutions only decreases you chance at that.  even if you get Umbreon no one knows what movesets will be available so theres a chance they may straight up bad. Again this is just based on what we know today. There may be another balance to bring Jolteon andor Flareon up. Maybe there will be another Easter egg naming trick for Umbreon. So yeah a guaranteed OP Vaporeon now is far better than hoping for Eevee to randomly evolve into Umbreon we know nothing about. ,TheSilphRoad,d68o6ok,1,t5_3c2d7

Im not here to astroturf but the deployment of the application was built around data harvested from another game that did not attract major interest in rural areas. I have no idea if Niantic wants to fix this by allowing user submissions for rural nodes  it would be wellappreciated and yes it is a bit disingenuous from an advertising standpoint but Niantic does not presently have a way to collect new suggestions for pokestops or gyms.

8555225,0,t1_d6avjb5,yes this is definitely what I am interested in! I do not think there is any highly resolved Census data available in Germany but I will check. The source code related stuff is definitely interesting but so far I have by far not seen so many different biomes and also no consistency between different cemetriesplaygrounds. So we probably have to be a bit careful there because this could be stuff that is already deprecated or still coming. Nevertheless I guess this is definitely a good lead!I would definitely expect that the biome data is calculated offline server side simply from a security perspective otherwise you could just spoof arbitrary bioomes or maybe even cheat yourself to specific spawns.,TheSilphRoad,d6az7p4,6,t5_3c2d7

8561611,0,t1_d6b8wpe,Roughly speaking a higher health stat and lower defense would give more charge attacks and dps although I have had many battles training gyms up where the opponent AI doesnt use their charge attacks at all. For example in one fight I was training against a Flareon using Seadra. I would consistently beat it but win with different amounts of health left without dodging and only using my primary attack Water Gun. I noticed in about  of the fights it used Flamethrower just after being taken below half health sometimes it used it when at about  hp and in several fights it either didnt use it at all or attempted to use it right before it fainted resulting in it not finishing the animation or doing damage.Although this is annoying for us when trying to do the science of finding best defenders I do like how it is similar to the games where the AI will randomly use suboptimal moves.,TheSilphRoad,d6bs1no,3,t5_3c2d7

8568635,0,t1_d6ccbjr,Yeah exactly this.  The other side of the argument though is that against hyper beam I can usually get ish water guns in while its charging along with a couple extra afterwards.  Body slam has a lot less charger time to the move so you may only get one extra attack against it.  Also Body slam encourages your opponent to dodge twice taking up more of their attack time.  Basically theres even more to the attacks then what the posters suggesting...  The informations good though.  It would be great if someone could spell everything out for Niantic so they can give the trash charge moves at least some sort of perk.  ,TheSilphRoad,d6cnron,4,t5_3c2d7

8588376,0,t1_d6dxaa8,Seriously.idgaf what niantic wants. Ultimately all they really want is my money. Which is fine and I will be happy to give but not like this. Ive been waiting for their issues to die down and have been eager to buy incubators. With this information Im really not sure I want to bother...I actually pumped up my bike tires after years of nonuse just so I could hatch some eggs and play the game. I was going to buy some rollerblades.Now Im just sad  When I can get more egg hatching done by attaching my phone to my roomba than by getting out of the house Im pretty sure Niantic didnt have that in the master plan.,TheSilphRoad,d6f4wfs,1,t5_3c2d7

8592184,0,t3_4xguqo,Well perhaps when they introduce the next generation those  in paticular will be redistributed among the next gen commons. I expect its mostly related to there just needing to be a trash tier in general to promote ball usage and in the first generation only a small handful are trashy enough. I certainly see more Venonats than Spearows and more Caterpies as well. However those top  the trinity of trash are pretty much the dominate spawns around here too. Hopefully down the line there will be enough trash to at least have a variety. I have noticed that the trash tend to be harder to catch in general too.  Likely because I refuse to use a greatultraRazzberries on them but things like paras poliwag Gastly GOldeen tend to require less balls to capture. Pidgey and Rattata are the worst they will have like CP and bust out of GreatExcellent curveball throws still. It really feels like they force a ball sink into the most common spawns. I caught a Snorlax last night on the first throw. I have had seen Beedrills require  Ultra ball throws w Razzberries before being captured. I pretty much only throw one ball per rattata anymore if they bust out screw them.,TheSilphRoad,d6fm3jj,4,t5_3c2d7

8605918,0,t1_d6h3w66,There is definitley a correlation between spawn points and rarity. Usually when I go down to my spot there is just a bunch of paras pidgey and rats but at every  hour there seems to be a rarer pokemon. It seems to me as it generates from a pool although some are probably more likely. The most common rarer types i get are a pidgeottoworthless eevee jigglypuff and abra.. which are good for farming candy. Occasionally I will get a really good spawn though. In the last few days I have found multiple raichu  jolteons a machoke charmander bellsprout and electabuzz. If we can share data about how to find the best spawn points like this we can maximize the efficiency of short trips when playing nearby home. I wonder if there is anything that can be mined or if there are particular places that are hotbeds for pokemon cellular data usage that dont have pokestops. It is funny to me that highschools arent too busy when there are thousands of kids on their phones there everyday.  ,TheSilphRoad,d6hc1xj,2,t5_3c2d7

There is nothing special about a new account that the eggs you hatch or the pokemon you catch in the next week or month are more likely to be  IV compared to your existing account. What I would consider is what happens if you find a low level  IV? With an established account you can be relaxed and invest as many candies in it as you want.

8611360,0,t1_d6ejx2w,Yes they will definitely need some kind of solution for trades between players of vastly different levels.First I think they cannot disallow trading completely. For instance when encountering wild Pokemon everyone sees the same species. If they had made it so that being a higher level allowed you to see rarer Pokemon then that would have fragmented the game severely and it would have prevented the community from forming the way it did.I think the easiest solution for trades to a lower level player would be to keep the same species moveset and IVs but to lower the Pokemons level to the other trainers current level . perhaps since you can power them up that far if youre not Level .,TheSilphRoad,d6i0m0c,1,t5_3c2d7

I think that you have to be outside of the radius of spawn locations by  kilometer or more BUT within another radius of spawn locations of say  kilometers or less. So if you downloaded the free app Ingress you could determine if you were outside of the range of spawns show up in INgress as white energy particles but still within range by approximately  kilometers of spawns.

The lower leveled you start off the more stardust you will consume.Especially for low level starters that have a final stage with a bad moveset. If you find a magikarp thats  IV but only level  or so youll think hard because youll be spending  candies just to see what the moveset is. The final product will have minimal use unless you power it up. And that is before the  k stardust you will need to power it up to level . if youre level .,TheSilphRoad,d6ohmg0,1,t5_3c2d7

I usually let mine die rather than switch out before they die because Ill get  of their max HP for free from the revive which means less potions have to be used. ,TheSilphRoad,d6omyg0,3,t5_3c2d7

8673322,0,t3_4yqhvk,So just to throw in a little hearsay I had  k eggs all lined up to hatch at once. After reading this post I went and checked the spot I pulled over to see what hatched. Specific longlat point of  k eggs hatching was . . well.... maybe not precisely but it was like within a few meters of that point. This is a street called Emerald Drive in a forest and near a few lakes. The outcome of these  eggs was  Onix  Lapras and  Eevee I was so pissed eevvee are everywhere in taht area!. I suggest the lake was what triggered the Lapras and the general area triggered  damned Eevees Argh!!!. The Onix was interesting as I have previously collected a lot of data suggesting street names and local businesses have an effect at what may spawn Magmar sited twice ever Embers Ln and Auburn rd Snorlax generally found at Restraunts or homes near roads with food type names such as Berryhill and Ive a lot more data on this in my notes. Emerald Drive hatched an Onix. I have only ever seen one Onix in that area and it was on Chipper Ln about  mile from where the egg hatched. This theory is very interesting to me as it may provide a means for testing spawn triggers without using ToS violating software.Update Oh god the place that the eggs hatched was a subdivision called Crystal Creek.  A Water type as well as a stone type from the results. As well as more Forest type than anything as it is the general topography of the area. There are some fighting types I really want to nab I am going to test this theory near some recreation parks that I have seen Machops and Mankeys spawn.

This ends up resulting in a reverse glitch of the old  hp enemy glitch that plagued the game in the olden days  My pokemon will vanish from my screen and I wont be able to attack while I have to wait for the enemy pokemon to slowly whittle down the remaining hp I actually have until my pokemon actually faints.Example  Earlier I dodged a hyper beam with my vaporeon but immediately after seeing a small amount of damage register on my screen I took full damage and my pokemon fainted.  Even though I couldnt attack I could swap out my pokemon so I put in another to win the gym battle.  Afterwards my vaporeon wasnt fainted but rather was at  HP.Edit  To clarify I also agree that there is a dodge cooldown of sorts although Im not sure exactly how long it is.  I have also noticed as perhaps a separate or even related topic that sometimes Ill dodge and then my client will still think I took full damage causing other shenanigans to ensue.,TheSilphRoad,d6tbyz2,7,t5_3c2d7
8701899,0,t1_d6tc52m,IVs are the base numbers that your pokemons actual stats are derived from. There is some behind the scenes math that helps determine what your pokemons attack defense and HP are at each level and the IV is the base number that that is all based on. The higher the IVs the better your pokemon. Theyre unchangeable and basically a representation of your pokemons genetics.EVs dont exist in pokemon go but in the main series games theyre Effort Values basically every time you fight another trainer your pokemon gains not just experience points but also improves just a little bit in one of their six possible stats. So if you fight a whole bunch of fast pokemon your pokemon will become faster. Each EV is equal to th of an actual stat point.,TheSilphRoad,d6tdc0r,1,t5_3c2d7

We understand them they are concentrations of certain types of pokemon tied to a park parklike area areas of cultural significance zoo library town hall college university. By tied I mean that they are either in the area of these or very close to them without fail.What we need to avoid is classifying areas without geographical markers as nests as they are actually probably just smaller more concentrated biomes. We definitely dont fully understand how biomes work though. Right when we think weve got something about them nailed down a few more anomalies pop up.What you do bring up which we dont know for certain is the frequency of the changes or if nest changes are all the same.

Then you round up a bunch of players and take it down  players means its  vs . I like those odds. If its a Valor gym it shouldnt be hard to find enough Instinct and Mystic to tear it back down.gtIm prepared to bet theres considerably more players than gyms and being able to gym hog would be a massive problem  thats why theres such a turnover at the moment  because theres  million players all of them want at least one gym capture per day preferably . But why do they choose to go after enemy gyms instead of friendly gyms? Its to easy to tear down an enemy gym and too hard to train a friendly gym. I rarely see gyms greater than rank  that I didnt train up myself which in turn makes them super easy to tear down compared to training up. Hence high turnover. Assuming that every player wants to get their coins and there are only three spots being filled in each gym then only  of gym space is being utilized leaving gyms weak and easy exploitable.gtLack of training I agree but I think thats people missing a trick a bit. Training up a gym is actually quite a good way of holding it because it means more runs needed to defeat it  and spaces for others to add to it. I think it needs a bit more value added though but I think thatd be best done through training rewards rather than fundamental changes to the gym balance. No the first thing that needs to happen is prestige rebalancing. Boosting how much you get for training it up makes it seem less grindy and difficult is where i wpuld start. Finding that one pokemon in your collection that will give you decent prestige without randomly getting massacred because you didnt dodge at the right time is incredibly difficult and nobody wants to do it.I dont want to get rid of turnover. Turnover is healthy. I want to see a good reason for players to care about their own gyms and invest in them. Perhaps better rewards for bigger gyms? Perhaps team only benifits? Im not sure but it has significant room for improvement. ,TheSilphRoad,d6us8mt,3,t5_3c2d7

Simply because ban is a terminology used for punishment only.This is why we should call what happens on a plane or highway not softbanned but speedlocked.

Its not intended by the programmers and should be fixed.Whilst its true that theres no rule that says IVs have to be totally random but the developers have intended it to be totally random but screwed up in the process of delivering the intended gameplay.

8734745,0,t1_d6w3orm,Agreed. Ive only seen two growlithes on my nearby caught one and hatched one but thats it. Hatched two Ponytas but never seen a wild one let alone a Rapidash. Never seen an exeggutor in any incarnation except as a defender in a gym once which I have no clue how they pulled that off unless they spoofed or were from out of town. We have no exeggcutes here  Ive caught one and hatched one just like the growlithe.However I gather bellsprouts and parases like freaking spearows and oddishes are close behind. Im not even sure how many glooms Ive gone through and I have a vileplume and a victreebel right now and could have more if I wanted to use the candy that way. So it for sure is different depending on location! Maybe grass types are becoming more common in more rural areas or something which would make sense. I did find rattatas and pidgeys and spearows in town the other day but here in my own little tiny rural area those are always matched or outnumbered by oddishes parases and bellsprouts to name a few. I gotta admit its starting to have some perks being rural. ,TheSilphRoad,d6xhnjk,2,t5_3c2d7

8737386,0,t3_4zpu9p,The following info is for Ingress but Im sure it would apply to Pokemon GO as well.Item drop rates have been analysed to a great extend in the years that Ingress has been out. Changes in one items drop rate sometimes change along with other items sometimes they didnt. I dont believe there has ever been a hard total drop rate that required adjusting individual drop rates.Ingress adds a deeper level of complexity in that item themselves have levels and portals can have faction alignment. Items drop at the level of the agent or portal whichever is lower. On top of that item levels can very from  to  levels. So if the portal is L and the agent is L the items will vary from L to L. Conversely if the portal is L and the agent is L item levels will be LL the max level of itemsportals is L  Items drop at a reduced rate if you hack a portal that belongs to the opposite faction. I dont remember the exact drop rate but IIRC its about  vs hacking a portal that belongs to your faction.,TheSilphRoad,d6xtlv3,1,t5_3c2d7

I recently visited a small town in another state and the mystic presence was strong  mystic gyms over lvl   valor gym lvl . I spent a while leveling a mystic gym out of the way middle of a hiking trail from lvl  and put in my second strongest Vap so that it sits in the top  of the defender list. This ensures that if someone attacks the gym they would have to take it down  levels before i get kicked out. With so many mystic players in that town chances are they will build it back up before the gym gets to level .

People need to try out different pokemon and stop being so worried about what other people and websites say because if their IVs or movesets arent perfect people get all upset for no reason. When it comes down to it with the way the game is set up until there is PVP I am going to beat every single pokemon you stick in there as a defender regardless of its IV or moveset...because I attack faster and I can dodge.

8778952,0,t1_d5n27ha,TLDR save your evolutions until much later past level  so you can feel like youre making progressIm mostly free to play I bought a bunch of lucky eggs and am just waiting to use them. Since playing from the start Ive realized that a good solution to this long haul  Pokemon Go fatigue is to save all of your evolutions until youre in the high levels.The reasoning is that in terms of overall experience it doesnt matter when you do a mass evolve. To reach level  getting K on your first day is no different than getting it on your thirtieth.But psychologically it would make a difference. To get through the first bunch of levels say up to level  its something you could do without evolving at all and still feel like youre progressing. Youll still make a dent in your experience youre still entranced by catching new pokemon etc.But past level  it gets harder to actually see any progress in your experience bar youre unlikely to catch new pokemon and mass evolutions no longer are enough to level you.If you keep all your evolutions up to that point which for me at level  is  and evolve at those levels you could do a single mass evolution and have only a little experience left to go to reach the next level. Instead of looking at a ridiculously demotivating amount of experience to get you now only need a reasonable motivating amount.If you extend this further and buy the extra storage and wait until you have nearly  evolutions assuming you have  pokemon you want to keep then you have enough to go from level  to  easily. But thats a little over  hours of straight evolving which would be mind numbing so you should probably do that over a period of days say  per day or break it up more. And if youre playing this much then in two weeks you can probably restock your evolutions and keep this momentum going until you reach .,TheSilphRoad,d731egg,1,t5_3c2d7

Camp A Its a Nest if you can easily find Pokmon X that is otherwise difficult to find.Camp B Its a Nest if the spawns follow very specific criteria namely that the spawns are limited to low IVs and rotate when the other nests do.The official Silph Road video about their Nest Atlas demonstrated a Dratini nest because Dratinis were widely available in a particular area apparently conforming to camp A. While thats a practical way of defining nests I think its inappropriate and potentially confusing considering nests and biomes both influence spawn behavior but are very different mechanics.

8807767,0,t3_50sb17,Ive had a theory myself for a long time that each stop has its own egg table. This would by proxy also include which ones give K eggs as well as which ones give rare pokemon. Unfortunately I cant get anyone to help me test this theory. The way I had planned on getting test data is as followsHave  players all clean their egg inventory. Stop using stops catch only super important mons to save on pokeballs for a day or something while you walk all your eggs off. This gives us control.Restock your entire egg list from ONE stop and only use that stop after you clear an egg from your inventory. This maintains our control and doesnt poison our test pool.Maintain a record of everything you hatch. Id say hatch at least and here is where I lose everyones interest  eggs in this manner per player and compare results. Why ?  is still on a percent base a small sample size but it stops you from having to go to an absurd number like  if you can get  people involved. If you compare numbers and theyre reasonably similar You have an approximate drop table in your hands.,TheSilphRoad,d76knxs,3,t5_3c2d7

8809518,0,t1_d76njt7,I agree with the per person issue. Spawns are shared so  spawn in Times Square and  spawn by the little store of a small town would still give everyone a pokmon. In other words if spawn density was exactly the same all across the US that would allow everyone to catch at the same rate and the game would be better for it.But would it really? Pokmon Go is an augmented reality game with the explicit intention to get people out there walking traveling and discovering new places. One way to incentivize that is by having different biomes and nests i.e. heterogeneous diversity of catches but I think another big and critical incentive is by having different densities of spawns pokstops and gyms i.e. heterogeneous opportunities of catch. For example since I started playing I discovered many new parks around me because of the higher density of spawns Im visiting neighborhoods and downtown areas in order to restock in items Ive made some enjoyable trips to big cities around me to chill at different spots with  lures at once.Now the method of mobile service that Niantic used to generate this heterogeneous density has flaws for sure. But I believe most often than not it achieves the main go of getting people moving.Also the heterogeneous density might have been the other way around rural areas booming with pokmon and cities empty and still have achieved the same goal in game design. Im totally fine with that and it would have been cool for me to visit wild regions of the US. However this would likely have limited the player numbers of PoGO and made Niantic less money.,TheSilphRoad,d76s8db,2,t5_3c2d7

I do walk a looot because of this game but certainly didnt walk anywhere near what its tracking but because the tracking is inaccurate it ends up tracking way more than what you did actually walk at the end of the day.

8829441,0,t3_514deq,Every Pokemon has a level. The level is hidden information  the game does not show it to you directly. The pokemons level is used as part of the formula for determining its CP which obviously affects how it will perform in battles. When you Power Up a pokemon with stardust and candy that pokemon gains half of a level. The stardust and candy cost is relative to the pokemons level  higher levels cost more to power up. When you catch a pokemon in the wild it will be a random level up to your trainer level or  whichever is lower. When you hatch an egg the pokemon will be exactly your trainer level or  whichever is lower. Both eggs and wild pokemon are always generated at wholenumber levels e.g.    etc. never halflevels e.g. . . etc.. When you power up a pokemon you cant power it up higher than your current trainer level  ..,TheSilphRoad,d796bvr,9,t5_3c2d7

8839897,0,t1_d7acwr6,I think the discussion has been very microscopic and we can think of it in two basic camps.  CPIV vs STABMoveset.For most of the game poor IV on a Pokemon can be compensated by leveling up your game.  I will qualify that statement to mean trainer level  rather than exp or time.  Moveset and STAB are mechanically derived benefits which means that there benefits are based on user play style eg dodging attack frequency and Pokemon choice.I am level  and most of my gym attackers were just high cp wild Pokemon that I evolved and I got decent move sets.  It didnt matter what IV they had due to my knowledge that I was not going to invest stardust.  My gym defenders that I invest stardust need to meet two qualifications ideal moveset and a A CP .  I have made exceptions for Dragonite due to rarity and sheer CP power.Just my thoughta,TheSilphRoad,d7afi2c,3,t5_3c2d7

I am trying to hatch eggs to get pokemon with good IVs.If star dust is not a bottle neck due to insane exp requirements limiting my power ups and candy is not a bottle neck same as star dust but also the buddy system is coming then isnt buying egg incubators to try to get more nearperfect pokemon the best way to go?I would be getting the huge stack of lucky eggs so that I never have to worry about them. By the time I use them up I probably will not care to increase my experience quickly any more. They also come at quite the discount since theyre  coins each in the big bundle and  coins to buy individually.

8889486,0,t3_51x45s,I want Gen II so that there is more depth to the gym battles.  At the moment there are only handful of strong gym pokemon for offense and defense.  Getting more pokemon with different type varieties will hopefully allow for more counters to the pokemon with few now Dragonite and Snorlax for example.  Additionally I just like the idea of catching and collecting new pokemon and as it is Ive caught most of the easy to find ones. I totally understand the nostalgia factor gen I is the only generation where I am familiar with all of the pokemon and I only played a handful of pokemon games outside of it.  I hope that they continue updating and developing the game over the next few months and that they do something with the Gen I legendaries before they release later generations but I do look forward to the new generations coming out.I think the best thing to realize is that given how much revenue the game is generating we know that there is a very large incentive for Niantic to keep new content coming whether its new generations of pokemon or updates to gameplay for the foreseeable future.

I hope that they are doing this to more or less buy that same amount of time to make solid and realistic changes that focus strictly on cheating. This is not a solution as cheaters will continually find workarounds but this is likely slow it enough to focus resources on development. Buddy system is great but their focus on doing away with cheating takes a huge amount of company resources away from adding more cool features like this as well as fixing the combat system up some. I am totally cool with this if its temporary likeIngress was.

I think as you get closer to cp you could pull it off with a BiteHyperbeam one though.Still take a look at the vid I made  I happened to come across a cp Vape on a trip into town while running errands and chose cp Raticates to show you its better than you think it is.The first cp Raticate took the Vaporean down . I got really sloppy after that and got tagged with specials on the last two so it took  Raticates which is probably a decent rule of thumb given no one has a perfect game every game and they wont all be BiteHyperbeam Raticates. This wont help with cp mons in your own teams gyms but trust me there isnt a lot six throwaway mons cant take down on an enemy gym by dodging specials.. Maybe only  mon if its incredibly good or youve got some cps on your team but hopefully  mons and if youre lucky or as your throwaways get stronger and with a few  enemies maybe  mons.Oh Im sure you know but a cp Parasect with Bug BiteSolarbeam will prestige the hell out of that gym with an cp Vape on the bottom rung and let you put your own in or maybe power it up a bit to cp if youre using too many potions. I only just got a k Tangela with Solarbeam that I havent tried yet and my Vileplume is too high to prestige but my .k Parasect was one of my favorite mons for a long time because of the amount of Vapes around.,TheSilphRoad,d7m8gti,1,t5_3c2d7

8952807,0,t1_d7nv2sx,gt If youre a programmer then I wonder why you dont see an issue here. There are myriad potential problems.I dont see a myriad of problems because Im a programmer. I see a simple set of requirements with a straightforward solution. So if you want to talk shop Im game.You seem to be perplexed by the notion that a single creature could be both a Ditto and a different Pokemon at the same time surely some sort of major technical changes would be required to support that? Actually that can be done with very few changes to the existing system and Ill explain how.The application has some form of persistent storage which holds all of the permanent game data including all of your Pokemon and all of their statsmovesetc. This might be a traditional database or some sort of NoSQL data structure Im not sure specifically what PoGo uses but for simplicitys sake Im going to refer to this as the database going forward.When a battle is initiated all of the relevant data is loaded into memory. I guarantee you that the app is not doing a database call every time it needs to check what move a Pokemon is using. This means that the Pokemons data is read from the database and loaded into a temporary memory structure.When Ditto uses Transform the game just needs to read the opposing Pokemons species type and moveset and overwrite Dittos inmemory stats with those new ones. You dont need to remember Dittos original moves or type because they are no longer applicable to the current battle. From here on out everything proceeds exactly as if Ditto is the new Pokemon. When the battle is over you write Dittos new HP total back to the database as you would have done anyway and...thats it. All of Dittos original stats and moves are still in the database unchanged no further logic required.The ability to swap out a Pokemons model or its speciesstatsmoves midbattle is already there because thats exactly whats happening every time you switch Pokemon midbattle anyway. In fact you could probably reuse a lot of the code for swapping Pokemon to do Dittos transformation. It just needs different text and a new animation and a bit of new logic since youre applying the new data on top of Ditto instead of pulling him out and putting the new data in his place.None of this is particularly new difficult or even interesting a firstyear CS student should be able to come up with this solution. It is not a technically difficult problem for Niantic to solve and given that theyre running a mostlystable mostlybugfree massive online game Im positive that its too hard is not the reason they didnt include Ditto in the initial release.,TheSilphRoad,d7nzsgm,15,t5_3c2d7

And more to the point all of those Transform glitches are involving complex scenarios that dont exist in Pokemon Go which is a much simpler game than the GBDS entries. Im not saying that implementing Transform in those games would be easy.

If the defenders are weak andor few its a good way to gain some extra and cheap XP about  if you manage the battles well in exchange for just a couple of potions especially if youve got a strong team. Also if you hang around quite a bit people would come to put their pokemon in it giving you even more experience like an XPTrap lets say. Last but most important in my opinion the nerf on revives makes it quite an expense to leave a strong defender while a weak one may give the other teams some cheap XP a bit greedy I know.I also believe there are a lot of other people that have though about these and play the same way.,TheSilphRoad,d7p9y4m,16,t5_3c2d7

8976939,0,t1_d7qvob6,Well unfortunately if people really enjoy taking gyms and they see them as a challenge rather than a grind then there is really not much you can do. However I would recommend this do not take the gyms instead deprestige the enemy gyms to level . This will force them to train against their own players. I can pretty much guarantee that if all they care about is attacking then they will be terrible at training. So what happens when you force novice trainers to train against their highest level pokemon? They effectively get locked out of their own gyms. Continue doing this until they relent a little then pick your gym and prestige it up if they dare take it down then repeat the strategy above. ,TheSilphRoad,d7qw48n,3,t5_3c2d7

I didnt use razz berries or greatultra balls aggressively.Once I ran out of Lucky Eggs at level  or  I quickly I realized I was going to need a lot more pokecoins if I wanted to keep upgrading my bag and keep progressing at a decent pace. So I started battling more which meant I also went through more healing items resulting in me micromanaging my bag less.Ive considered dropping the  once and maxing out my bag and storage but since thats been a driving force to keep battling gyms which I find a lot of fun good thing since Im on Instinct I think it would actually make the game less fun for me if I wasnt working on that.So ironically Id likely play the game less the more I spent on it and I like playing the game  and the fact that it gets me out of my apartment which has multiple benefits.,TheSilphRoad,d7rh5bu,1,t5_3c2d7

At least in my area which has a healthy amount of players but isnt a giant city there are a some gyms here and there stacked to the top with  pokemon but most gyms are contested enough that anyone who is at least level  can take down a significant portion of gyms. Its definitely not a privilege enjoyed only by the elite players. Players who are  can at least participate in some of them although they might not be able to finish off a gym. Sure the lowleveled casual players might not be able to do much but people who are below lvl  would be wasting their time on gyms anyway.

8997166,0,t3_53idfq,Same with me. My buddy is a Snorlax. I recived a Km egg and it hatchs a Snorlax.,TheSilphRoad,d7tbj1s,2,t5_3c2d7
8997204,0,t1_d7t2u7w,Im currently using a combination of abundant screenshotting and postwalk notetaking from those shots. I also delay starting incubation of new eggs to make sure theres more than .km difference between them. And if I have any open egg slots I dont spin any stops until Ive started all the eggs I currently have. This particular method is based partly on the logic of the problem and partly on personal factors such as what does or doesnt interfere with my enjoying myself while out on a Pokewalk. More detail When I receive an egg and am still on the pokestopspin page I take a screenshot showing the name of the stop and the items receieved. This establishes where an egg was received and when as granular as I want to go with the image metadata automatically captured by the phone though Im not using that potential much.  Then I open the egg bag as OP puts it and take a screenshot. As long as Ive remembered not to spin any stops while Ive got an egg waiting the new egg will be the only egg not in an incubator. This establishes what kind of egg was just received.  If any egg currently in an incubator shows less than . km walked I delay starting the new egg until all have at least this much. This ensures that all eggs will show a unique distance in eggbag screenshots. If I need to walk further to get gt.km on all prior eggs I dont spin any stops while doing so this is the part Im most prone to mess up Ill sometimes forget and spin.  Once that .km requirement on all prior eggs is met Ill start the new egg incubating and the a screenshot of the egg bag. This establishes the distance gap between the new egg and all of the eggs already incubating.  Whenever an egg hatches I take a screenshot of the hatched Pokmons page andor a screenshot of the Journal. This establishes what hatched and when. Then I take a screenshot of the egg bag now with one less egg. This helps me detect errors in my postwalk notes and associations. I have my screenshots backing up automatically to my Google Photos so they are there for me to go through whenever I feel like collecting the data from them. To establish the track between egg drop and hatch I basically make a running table. The rows are dropped eggs and the columns are eggstatus checkpoint times. I add a row based on each set of screenshots around an egg drop noting the pokestop datetime and whether k k or k.  I add a column for each screenshot of the egg bag.  If the screenshot is from immediately after a hatch I figure out which egg hatched. This can be figured out by looking at the column just prior to this one. Whichever egg had the the smallest difference between distance walked and distance needed is the one that hatched. In the current column instead of a distance I mark this one as hatched and note what the hatch was from the screenshots of the hatched Pokmons page andor journal. I also doublecheck my tracking by confirming that the egg type is right for what hatched. Having taken account of any hatches for an eggbag screenshot I then enter the distance on each egg. I know which egg to update with which distance because whichever egg had the most distance in the last column will still have the most distance then nextmost and so on. And this is how I slowly accumulate a list of hatches with the Pokestops their eggs came from. Edit minor text fixes.,TheSilphRoad,d7tboys,3,t5_3c2d7

9014826,0,t3_53qan0,Yeah I have so many pokemon that I havent transferred just because I hope ONE DAY stardust will be as easy to get as experience and they can be used. The only things I can afford to power up are top tier things vaporeon lapras or things that can be used to take out said top tier things victreebel wigglytuff. Like there are plenty of things that could be absolutely great pokemon right now but instead I am stuck making duplicates of them because it is literally easier to catch a dozen new pokemon and evolve a new pokemon with higher CP then to power one up. I have  psyduck candy and my strongest golduck with hydro pump is cp because even though I have so much candy its not worth wasting on it when I could power up a vaporeon. Even vaporeon really I have like  of them because why power one up when I can just catch another eevee and evolve it?Also like its another big issue if you are ruralsuburban.  of my stardust right now comes from gyms because if I dont find lures Im looking at catching maybe  pokemon a day if I spend hours playing. Like my desperation level is id probably use an ultraball on a weedle if I have to at this point. I can level up just fine because gyms give xp for battling them not just holding them for payout. Ive had so little issue with experience I am not even sure why anyone buys lucky eggs. But I currently only have  stardust and I dont get to power up more then maybe  pokemon per day if Im lucky and spend alll my dust. So Im stuck with this paradox if almost all my stardust comes from gyms and I can get a maximum of  stardust from the gyms a day how do I have enough pokemon strong enough to hold said gyms?The answer is I dont. I dont have a single pokemon over cp and only  of them over cp. So Im usually stuck in the last slot of the gym and often get knocked out pretty quick. As of right now I am only holding  gyms and at least  of my pokemon that are still in them are in the very bottom slot. The maximum amount of gyms I have gotten is  and the average is more like . I have a ton of pokemon which would be GREAT for gyms if I could power them up but well I need at least one pokemon that can beat really strong things so I cant afford to power those up. Honestly for me this isnt just making the game boring if it keeps up I wont actually be able to advance anymore. My level doesnt matter because lack of spawns means most of my good pokemon come from eggs... that are capped at level  so I now have to power up anything I hatch to use it. All the stardust I saved up went into a lapras I hatched and its not strong enough to hold gyms anymore... I am sad. ,TheSilphRoad,d7vfx2e,12,t5_3c2d7

Alternatively theres  gyms within reasonable range and I battle in them if I have some time to do so  am prioritizing gyms. Theyre all locked down currently at level  being the minimum which takes too long to take down during a break.Other than that I often have my phone on at home because GPS drift is quite strong there and I end up finding a lot of pokemon and hatching lots of eggs.The main time I play is with my girlfriend.

9023185,0,t1_d7w8yzk,gt Hyper Beam is better against players who dont dodge which is sadly most players who will be attacking your gym. Yes lots of players dont dodge  but those players are not the players who are willing to attack a highlevel gym with  or  Snorlaxes in it. The average i am level  and cant dodge casual player generally rarely fights gyms and if he does he doesnt fight those gyms that are heavily fortified.This is why your argument is irrelevant. The only players who are a danger for highlevel gyms with a highCP Snorlax in the top spot are those who can and will dodge. And these are the players you need to stack your gym against. The icantdodgecasual wont attack your high level gym anyways at most he will attack the bottom  or  Pokes a few times...Apart from that i even know some players who usually dont dodge but specifically say that the only moves they do dodge are things like Hyper Beam. Because Hyper Beam has such a long animation and deals so much damage even the i am to lazy to dodge faction realizes that dodging this one is definitely the right thing to do.The next point btw. is that Hyper Beam often creates a lot of overkill. I remember fighting Gyms where my attackers were down to  when starting to fight the Snorlax and when it finally charged up the Hyperbeam my Poke was down to  anyways  so yeah you just DPS as much as you can and let your Poke faint. Have fun with your massive charging time massive animation time move that effectively dealt  HP damage...gt Hyper Beam is better on defense. Period.Hyper Beam generally is a terrible move on defense.

And realistically by the time you see the  Dratini you need for a Dragonite only a couple of those would be CPs and the odds would be extraordinarily low for one to not only break out but then also run away. I feel like youre literally igroring everything Im saying just because you dont like my numbers. I already said ill use ultras on Dratinis just not CPs. And I wont use them on starters either unless theyre a red ring. My capture rate on startersdratini is  and most that ran away where when I was low levels before I had greatsultras. Personally I save my ultras in the hopes Ill find an ultra rare. Ive heard plenty of stories of Dragonites taking  ultras. Ive also used plenty recently on things like Muk Dragonair Hitmonchan Exeggutor Golduck Electabuzz Rapidash these things take a lot of balls. So its not exactly Im rolling in ultras but I also like to make sure to not waste them just in case I run into  or  ultra rares. Again Im not telling you how to play. Just letting you know the odds are absurdly high that a low level Dratini or any starter will most definitely NOT run from you. ,TheSilphRoad,d7yteoe,2,t5_3c2d7

I fail to see the difference.You also put way too much emphasis on being the kingpin of a gym. Its just the highest CP defender nothing more. Having the defenders get dropped randomly when a gym loses a level suddenly removes any reason to always put your highest CP mon in regardless of how useful it actually is in defense and instead gives you incentive to put in your best defender to try and stop that  in X chance that yours might get the boot.It also preserves the lowest to highest defense order which just makes intrinsic sense based on everyones shared idea that bosses should get bigger as you go.

9055204,0,t3_54atwl,Tested the update on the Bubblestrat about an hour ago. With only the Bubbler in my case Horsea occupying the gym it was easier and somehow faster for my attacker in my case Dratini to finish the combat without missing a tap. HOWEVER there can be a bit of a problem once another Mon a higher CP Mon occupies the gym. Based on my initial experience the last action I did with my battle with the Bubbler was carried over to the next battle mainly because of the button mashing. Twice I was unable to flee from the subsequent battle due to the queued action and hence my attacker fainted. If anything I think it is best for Bubblestratters to rely now more on the specific number of times that they had to tap per battle with the Bubbler so that no action will be carried over to the next battle thus making fleeing easier. This of course will depend on the type of attacker you have for the Bubblestrat.,TheSilphRoad,d80ahcq,42,t5_3c2d7

9071897,0,t3_54ibdt,I understand what youre saying but your advice is not really helpful in the long term. I am level  and have a horde of fully poweredup Vaporeons and the difference in CP between above average and wonder is already  CP and it will only get wider. Just using Vaporeons as an example... yes it makes sense to keep Vaporeons across the entire CP range in your inventory for training. Yes for battling enemy gyms the IVs dont really matter. And yes if its your first or maybe second Vaporeon and it has decent CP you should probably power it up no matter what the IVs are.But when you have progressed in the game beyond a certain point like you at level  then its always a good idea to pay attention to IVs and use your precious stardust only on the best candidates so you will be able to power them up as close to the max CP as possible which will not only move you up in the gym ranks but even more importantly give you decent fighters for the upcoming promised PvP battles.,TheSilphRoad,d82amq2,10,t5_3c2d7

9079832,0,t1_d837yw2,No the main thing that makes defenders valuable is how long they draw a battle out for.  When youre counter prestiging a gym if the attacker can wipe out your Dragonite in sec it is twice as fast for enemies to bring your gym down and thus takes more to actively resist an offensive attack on the gym.  You want the middle rungs to stall for time the bottom rungs to be easy for prestiging and the top rungs to wipeout weakened remains of an attack team.  Theres one theoretical composition where Dragonite fits in but its niche and mainly only for type diversirySo relatively speaking if a type seems strong against players who simply can effectively beat just by having a counter to it doesnt that also mean everything else is also still a better pick relatively speaking?If its good enough to be effective vs the top . of players its also the best option against the lowest of subpar players ,TheSilphRoad,d838yah,1,t5_3c2d7

9090479,0,t1_d848l6r,Ive found since level  you dont really want most of your wild catches. This is true pre as well but even after  you dont necessarily find the strongest Pokemon all the time. There have been multiple instances where my mon is  Im level  and my friends have been  hes . In order to get a great Pokemon from the wild you need good IV a relatively good level no point in powering up a CP  Arcanine when you can just evolve a  with slightly worse IVs and the good movesets. I find that getting all  of these at once is nearly impossible. The strongest wild one Ive ever found  Lapras with Ice ShardBlizzard was only  IVs. Of my wild catches probably the best ones are a . Snorlax with Zen HeadbuttBody Slam best defensive moveset but only  CP in the wild and an  Exeggutor with ConfusionSeed Bomb great defensive moveset but only  CP in the wild. Ive caught higher CP but getting the combination of the three is incredibly difficult. Over the course of the grind to  could you find good IVmovesetCP Pokemon? Probably. But Im just over . of the way there and Ive caught nearly k Pokemon. How many total would it take to find a full team of these good combinations? I find that saving up good IV egg hatches is the best way to decide what to invest stardust in. It allows you to control two of the variables as much as possible and makes moveset the main deciding factor. If you get lucky enough to get that magical wild catch then power it up!

9098386,0,t3_54vtpb,The Gym system is a pretty bad on the whole. The first signs of this were really when botters were able to post pokemon way over the level of legitimate players. Its not that these pokemon were unobtainable to the legitimate players but botters were getting them far quicker.Why would it be okay for a legitimate player to pokemon like this and choke out newer players coming into the game? The thing is of course that its not okay. The gym system as its designed is only there for people who play the longest.However thats not the only problem with the gym system. I know a lot of the regular players in the park right next to my apartment. Many of them are my neighbors. Ive made a couple friends with my fellow valor team members and thats pretty cool. But Ive also made a couple not so friends who are on Mystic and Instinct.Its always a bummer when I run into my not so friends because I know theyre out there running gyms too. It started out where wed just back stab each other when we saw what we were doing and were just in a better position to gank gyms they had just taken down. Now however were more civil about it. We see what gyms we currently have then say okay. Ill take this gym you take that gym and well cash out.Its dumb its stupid and it should be better.I think the worst part about it is that its setup as a rich get richer fashion. You need stardust to get more powerful to control gyms and one of the better ways to get stardust is to be in control of the gyms. The reward for defending a gym needs to be different.First off I think gym defenders should be gated off by combat power. Only  spots in a gym with the levels being CP       Players can then arrange a team of  to take on the  posted in the game and get reward with Stardust maybe coins too for how many pokemon they defeat. Youre only allowed one shot per gym every orso minutes and the same cap on stardust and coins that currently exists applies. I think k stardust and  coins per day?What about rewards for defending gyms? I think AffectionFriendship should be in the game. The way to get this would be by healing walking as a buddy and defending gyms. To put a pokemon as a defender you need to challenge instead of the previously mentioned battle. Challenge would be just like training. Oneonone battle with the current defender of the same CP range. If I challenge with my  Gloom Id be playing against the current CP defender. Upon winning my pokemon then replaces the defeated defender in the gym. Players can only have one pokemon defending any of those spots at one time.What do you get from affectionfriendship? As your affection increases yoru pokemon gets a few bonuses in battle.  of those bonuses would obviously be more attack defense and HP. A couple others I think would be cool is a chance to automatically dodge and a chance to use a charge move on death if a charge move is available.What about team bonuses? havent thought about that too much to be honest. Perhaps the defenders your team has in a gym the larger the gains you get from that gym. That means you can get your daily stardust and coins faster as well as max out affection on your pokemon faster by going to a gym your team controls. Or perhaps the inverse if you want to be more competitive. Battling and posting defenders in a gym your team does not control gives you these rewards faster.A system like this would open up gyms to all players. It would give all players access to the same rewards to power up their pokemon. Players also still have incentive to use the system as it enables them to get rewards from it faster and easier. Furthermore it avoids stagnation as once affection is maxed out on a specific pokemon there is no incentive to keep him in as a defender only exploit him as an battler.,TheSilphRoad,d85h9aj,1,t5_3c2d7

That ratio would be the rate limit  if I don t spam click attack maybe Im watching to dodge and you do you should  increase the ratio of your attacks relative to mine.I understand that the game doesnt behave this way but intuitively that approach would make more sense than the current system where fast but light hitting pokemon are inherently weak.

People dont want bad ladder position so they pick their highest CP mons and theres only like  in the game that have the highest CP.

9174421,0,t1_d8eowfn,Well that example was more separate from the purpose of the OP. I just happen to have those two pokemon and they are almost never in gyms. They are just what I use when I start to run out of better pokemon which is happening currently  I have  gyms so my team is spread thin.I usually put the snorlax in the gym at the bus station near my home. That gym doesnt last usually so I may as well make it annoying for opposing teams. Casuals playing on buses will drive by and drop in their pokemon usually quite weak so my low CP snorlax doesnt really cause any problems. The gym doesnt really last anyway.However when it does last I will often train the gym some more when I get home. Adding slots at a hightraffic bus stop gets tons of random weaker pokemon thrown into it so you can basically guarantee a new training dummy pokemon.I think people will train on a snorlax if there is a good reason to.

There are hardly any L Instinct gyms in my area.  They will still get taken down in under  hours but its nice to see it standing there for a few hours.  I dont even care if I dont have a top defender in it.

9227843,0,t3_56nrdn,Id like to see a game driven story to make pokemon go feel a little like playing the pokemon series in real life.Imagine this you have  gyms and an elite four in real locations near you perhaps choosing pokestops near you. You can progress through a story like the original game series. Youll be paired up with your chosen teams leader and theyll have you to run errands and help with any troubles they have from defeating team rocket to waking up that snorlax with a flute. Along the way as you complete certain quests you can get rewards like stardust and incubators and end up encountering certain pokemon too eg. waking up a snorlax with a flute force an encounter with it.Naturally youll fight gyms as you progress through the story. Then youll encounter one of the legendary birds given your chosen team. You then end up fighting the elite four with the champion being a real pokemon go trainer who has most recently been crowned the champion.If you defeat this pokemon go trainer you then become champion until someone knocks you out.I think this creates a pretty interesting experience which is trying to imitate how you would feel like playing the pokemon games in real life. Youll enjoy a story along the way and aim to build a team which can fight for you. Pokemon go being an existing and live game Niantic can further add more story elements beyond post game after you defeat the champion.,TheSilphRoad,d8lp3d7,1,t5_3c2d7

9262185,0,t3_575fo8,In regards of my personal expierence and fun with the game Im still enjoying it. But as pretty much everyone else Id like to have an update regarding the ingame tracker. From what Ive seen of the SFtracker Im not convinced that it is the improvement everyone is hoping for. What Id like to see as kind of a quick upgrade is that they bring back rustling grass but only for active spawn points which are nearby. This way you would have an idea where to look in your vicinity instead of wandering around trying to work it out.The thing that I miss is the decline in people playing together at hotspots or nests. I really enjoyed meeting all kinds of people wandering around in a nearby park looking for Charmanders helping each other out. I think besides the natural cause of this decline as the hype of the game is slowing down is the fact that the tracker websites dont work atm and a lot of players were relying on them. Everyone has an opinion on this subject but I really thought it was fun being at a local hotspot when someone noticed a SnorlaxLapras a few hundred meters away and a crowd started getting there.,TheSilphRoad,d8q1r6y,1,t5_3c2d7

We put all our strong guys into one or two gyms and intentionally leave bad ones in other more heavily trafficked gyms. This is so the Mystic and Valor players will use their time attacking the weaker gyms and leave our big ones alone. Usually we can hold a big gym for a week or two at a time. They usually only go down when there is a big push from some lvl  Mystic guys from out of town that come through every few weeks. ,TheSilphRoad,d8q8wyp,1,t5_3c2d7

9263940,0,t3_57agdd,Agreed on the choosing low CP pokemon. It should either be updated to only count pokemon you use or it should have all the slots be empty and you add pokemon if you want them. If Im going in with a full team I would hand pick them all anyway.I got into a gym this morning and trained on it first time with new system. My pokemon was the only defender so it was just stupid to have to fix my whole team for one battle.Anyway with attacking and training gyms being more similar maybe they will make a good system for picking your pokemon instead of the garbage it does now it always uses all my grass pokemon against everything right now  even fire pokemon and ice pokemon. If they make a new system that works properly it will fit for both attacking and training.

9264413,0,t1_d8q8chl,Sightings list that combines same pokemon into single dude on ya sightings list so if youre in a nest its completely pointless.Training at a gym automatically starts with a team of your highest  CP pokemon which would give you the lowest possible prestige rewardedNormal type potions continue to drop at pokestops regardless of trainer level.Bubblestrat is still the most effective way to prestige a gym despite Niantic knowing about it and patching combat nerfing movesets and changing gym prestige mechanics multiple times in  months.San Francisco has some weird tracking system that no one else in the world is allowed and it probably works like crap anyways.You cant reverse sort.Scrolling through a list of  pokemon is pathetic UI design.When you have a pokemon in a gym you cant click on it to see which gym it is in the status of the gym or anything. When that gym is taken down and pokemon returns to you you dont know which gym it came from.Who would ever pay  coins for  pokeballs?Speed stat is meaningless in PoGo and means a bunch of pokemon are useless.HP is overpowered.Unbalanced special attack vs. normal attack and vice versa pokemon are useless  severely underpowered.The reward for beating a Level  gym is too low vs. amount of potionsrevives consumed always better off finding something weaker there isnt even a bounty worthy of encouraging high level players to bother with them when training your own teams gyms are more important. At least increase the XP reward or add some stardust.

9299814,0,t3_57scgv,I have hatched three Lapras two with Dragon Pulse we dont talk about....and one with Frost BreathIce Beam at  IV. Got  candies and the last one is now at CP.  I really recommend you to power up a strong late game attacker to make sure you can easily destroy the gyms full of  Dragonite. As the game dying it is very easy to control a lot of gyms with Dragonite with steel wing an army of VaporeonExeggutor and wild Snorlax. Also throw some spot stealer like Arcanine Flareon and Gyarados. I can control  daily even in Instinct team. Defensive Lapras would be now pretty useless.  Once I put my Lapras in gym and regretted it because I lost it for almost two weeks even if it was in the traffic and promised myself to never try again. Now hes back I feed him with dragon blood !  Also  bar attacks are usually better than  bar due to flexibility and ability to dodge better. Exception is Solar Beam.

9300962,0,t1_d8uhun8,I think youre making a good point insofar as how power leveling via lucky egg mass evolves can leave you behind in the stardust game. It does so by . You get k worth of XP arbitrary number and  dust in that  minutes and . You just leveled up and now have to spend more dust to keep Pokemon maxed. The latter is more important to me. The faster you level the less stardust you have to spend on keeping Pokemon maxed out AND the more stardust you need to keep them maxed out.  If youre at a level that requires k experience to level up after catching the necessary  pidgeys to level up via lucky egg then youre sitting with having gained only k in dust. If you had slow leveled youd be looking at k.So you are right as far as stardust goes power leveling can leave you behind. But that doesnt make it an inferior strategy. If you power level to get to  ASAP then youll most definitely end up catching in dust because of how much the necessary XP increases each level.

You could raise the cap or adding more gyms would do the trick without making it harder for an opposite team to take it down.

9331664,0,t1_d8yt9o3,Question is whether team attacking is actually faster and more resource efficient than staggered attacks. Charged attacks have a higher dps during their attack duration than a quick attack so having multiple players attacking separately may actually take a gym down more quickly because you would be able to collectively increase your damage output by being able to use charged attacks more frequently. Less battles in turn means less damage taken probably means less resources required.,TheSilphRoad,d8yuuf8,1,t5_3c2d7

Many people have tried to take down this gym on different days and at different times and have reported the accounts over and over but it never goes below level  for more than a couple of seconds.If its just a dedicated player then they dont sleep eat or work.  Lets just call it botlike behavior for now since it goes beyond what a simple dedicated GPS spoofer could do and I have no other explanation as to how they could be maintaining it nonstop.,TheSilphRoad,d93dbf0,11,t5_3c2d7
9368548,0,t1_d93avao,Thank you for the detailed reply!Your formula matches your data very well no doubt  its constructed as a best fit. What Im interested in is purely comparing the data against each other because it almost seems like they have been playing a different game than you.TSR sort of raw data The level distribution of caught Pokemon or at least the CP distribution is in the article Probably its too vague to easily do a statistical test against your data though as I said in the edit to my previous post.Finally about thisgtbut I suspect it may have to do in part with averaging. the catch bonus is an exponential function. Its multiplier is less effective the higher the base. Averaging it out tends to make things a bit screwy.do you mean the effect that can be seen when comparing the following two facts from my first post in this thread assuming the GUCT formula i.e. your data?gta Pokemon with . catch rate on straight throws would have a . catch rate with curveballs gtA level  player who has a . average catch rate with straight throws on . BCR Pokemon has a . catch rate with curveballs.Of course they had several people of different levels but that should change very little and the averaging effect seems nowhere near close enough to explain the difference in results.,TheSilphRoad,d93j3qc,2,t5_3c2d7

After that gyms seemed to rotate pretty evenly. Within the past month Valor fell off pretty hard and Instinct rose to power with  trainers regularly building gyms downtown and a couple of contested gyms turning into L Instinct in a matter of hours. Now Instinct seems to have fallen off and the other two teams particularly Valor are back in power.Some of that might be due to territory settling though. Instinct has a block of  gyms on one edge of town. Valor holds one dedicated gym near me and a pair of gyms on another edge of town. Mystic keeps one gym near the Valor pair.

9386808,0,t3_594nax,For reference the main series damage formulaDamage formulaThe damage dealt when a Pokmon uses a damaging move depends on its Attack or Special Attack stat the opponents corresponding Defense or Special Defense stat and the moves base power. In addition the various factors of damage modification will also affect the damage dealt.The damage formula isDamage  Level  AttackDefense  Base   x ModifierwhereLevel is the level of the attacking Pokmon.Attack and Defense are the working Attack and Defense stats of the attacking and defending Pokmon respectively. If the attack is Special the Special Attack and Special Defense stats are used instead. Some moves like Psystrike use stats other than what moves of this category would usually use in case of Psystrike it uses Special Attack and Defense.Base is the base power of the attack.and Modifier isModifier  STAB x Type x Critical x other x randomwhereSTAB is the sametype attack bonus. This is equal to . if the attack is of the same type as the user and  if otherwise.Type is the type effectiveness. This can be either  . .   or  depending on the type of attack and the type of the defending Pokmon.Critical is  for a critical hit in Generations IV . for a critical hit in Generation VI and  otherwise.other counts for things like held items Abilities field advantages and whether the battle is a Double Battle or Triple Battle or not.random is a random number from . to ..The result is rounded down as remainders are not kept.

The stardust may deplete rather quickly now but as you level it will take a ton of experience to get to the next level during this time you will find that you are able to max out more pokemon.In the end do what you want and what you are happy with.

9419632,0,t1_d99xds9,Lick Snorlax? jfc. Those are good attackersprestigers... at the very least theyre lowrent Chanseys when youre jumping into gym battles something with high base stamina to soak up the damage from the existing battle if there is onePlus you dont know the Snorlax has Lick until youre facing it in the gym. If its th from the bottom and the gym isnt all Dragonites otherwise itll give a weak attacker pause. Deterrence is a far better defense right now than DPSI do think theyd have value on the trade market for people desperate to hit . Would trade a Lick Snorlax for a good IV Poliwrath with BubblePump. That said lets assume trading is not anywhere close to happening. So anything lingering in your bag ought to have an immediate use even if its candy to power up the other thing  sounds like youre in the latter camp.While Im here I know Lapras Dragon Pulse lacks STAB but doesnt it ravage Dragonites anyway? Youre not grinding for a Lapras just to kick Exeggutors out of gyms lets be real... a Lapras is meant to be a dragon slayer. If youre using one in a melee the type advantage of the move alone plus the short charge time makes it pretty efficient... and means youre popping Pokestops for potions less often. ,TheSilphRoad,d9a04tl,6,t5_3c2d7

9515935,0,t1_d9lvuha,blah in every multiplayer style game there is content that weeds out the casual players from the hardcore players.  Back when I played WOW my life kept me from doing the very big guild runs It sucked. But I didnt complain much about it. I definitely didnt tell my guildmates that they were ruining the game by doing them or tell the game developer that they needed to change the game to my preferences. I just played and enjoyed it as I could when I could. There are plenty of games where the playing field is level across player casualness. Angry Birds and Candy Crush await.Also its apparent that youre not a gym player once you get your initial  gyms its necessary to have some backups.  Its not uncommon in cities like mine with more players and less stagnation to wake up one morning and find yourself with  fewer gyms than you had when you went to bed.  One car full of the opposing team can take huge chunk pretty quickly and easily. The Friday of the Haloween Event I went from  gyms to  all in the  hours I was asleep that night.Also if you do it right and are capable you should prestige the gym to get your poke in and then prestige it another level so the next passerby can snipe a spot.  Better is to prestige the gym  levels prestige so that when the first spot is sniped the gym levels up again which opens up another spot to be sniped. Which is actually very friendly to casual players since theyre getting free spots. But thats the problem with casual players. the hard core players are much more likely to find those open spots sitting there the casual players not so much.Besides he states his are spread out over multiple states because he travels a lot for work and that he does no upkeep. Its not like hes keeping the neighborhood kids out of the gym.,TheSilphRoad,d9m1ikc,7,t5_3c2d7

9544204,0,t1_d9pca4r,Imo its not the fighting that is hard but the previous resource gathering and post resource recovery that is very expensive in time same as taking the gym down.Lets do some numbersTaking a lvl gym down might take about one hour.Assuming  item per fight assuming youre a good dodger have competitive pokmon and dont let your mons faint it was  items preupdate. Counting  items per spin and a bonus for the tenth of  items we have  items per  stops. That means at least  stops to refill the inventory regardless of item type. Since hyper and max potions are rare we could be looking at least at  times the number of spins   pokstops visited. That was a few hours just to take down one lvl  gym days even if youre not in a big city and a lot of km if youre rural or semirural.Postupdate with the same parameters it would be  items to refill. That would be  spins counting unique stops and bonuses aprox. Accounting that you want to get the same items back and their rarity using the same multiplier x pokstops. It is a significant reduction of time to invest in gathering the items both before and after taking the gym down.Imo it greatly benefits legit walking players who will no longer get overwhelmed against groups of car players since the pokstop speed reduction.,TheSilphRoad,d9pir45,2,t5_3c2d7

9544652,0,t3_5bmb1f,The real reason why I and the few other high level players I know dont mess around with gyms any more doesnt have anything to do with difficultyincentives. I would love that stardust every day.ampnbspIts because the whole process is nerveracking and  of the time ends in frustration.ampnbsp Spoofing and Botting has gotten out of control. Even if you level it up you might get sniped by a computer and go home with nothing. Your phone constantly leaks memory and keeps getting slower and hotter You get constant errors and freezes and have to continually force close and restart app You need to scroll through  Pokemon to pick the same damn team of  bc the game wont save it for you When taking opposing gym spoofers and botters are there leveling it back up while youre battling. Just makes it take way longerampnbspI mean the whole thing just sucks.

9544769,0,t3_5bmb1f,In my area i would have said the cause of stagnation is actually the power creep that comes when gyms are only ever lowered to  over a long period of time to the point that my lvl  iv fully powered gyarados sits at the bottom and is kicked out by people with  accounts. With the latest update people will cheat for the last spot more than ever and SNIPE the last spot more than ever because why ever train? I predict more dirty tactics in response to frustration. Gyms are more broken than ever.       As for solutions my suggestion would be to get a bonus for the daily amount of prestige added or removed. So remove  or build all the way to  in one day and youll receive  coins and  stardust or something.

This means that during the last few weeks you were more likely to see a high level Instinct gym in my town rather than Mystic because they are very slow at prestiging or not doing that at all so the update does little damage to them and more to us who ironically have just now started taking and holding some highish level gyms after months of blue supremacy.,TheSilphRoad,d9q0iph,1,t5_3c2d7

9550764,0,t1_d9pyuas,Thats definitely an issue with many games of the MMO variety.  Content vulturing definitely is a thing exploits are a thing.  As someone who has tested games in the past Ive seen this before many times  this is the kind of thing that requires not just a solid QA team but also a team of motivated incentivized and clever whitehats that work for the devs to ultimately stomp out.Many times a metagaming minmax type of players idea of fun is not the same as how the developer intended it to be and they need to either be planning for and developing content to mitigate how quickly people content vulture but also patching loopholes.  They couldve easily increased the  of Pidgey candy per evolve removed Dratini nests earlier or balanced the game differently.  They didnt and as were on the outside who knows what their motivation is for not doing that quickly  maybe they are hedging their bets on Gen  maybe they are leaving loopholes open so they can follow botsexploiters a common thing in trying to find MMO cheaters or maybe they dont havedont want to dedicate resources to it...who knows.,TheSilphRoad,d9qbuft,5,t5_3c2d7

For me almost all of your points doesnt bring anything good to the game. You have more interesting solutions to make gym stagnation a good thing. for example everyone from the same team receive some kind of bonus from the gym if the are just nearby not in the gym.

9583495,0,t3_5c6t3j,gteasily fix with some type of move learn systemIts probably a lot of work to figure out how that system would work and how to implement it though ampnbspFor me the worst thing right now is that I cant play in gyms like I used to. I used to work slowly to kill the level  gyms around my work I am okay that this is easier now and level up and try to build up any gyms that were my team. Theyre frequently get high level and sometimes stand for a long time. The problem now is that it takes so long to train that I cannot do it on a work break any more. Then you throw in the fact that someone can come by and crush your level  gym in less time than it would take someone to bring it to level  and it just feels pointless. I am happy that the gyms on the outskirts are pretty safe at least but I have no motivation to do anything with gyms now. Its a reverse stagnation where all your effort is pointless minus the initial  or  gyms you get into and cash in on.Basically the lack of stability of gyms makes your time with them a lot less meaningful and that time has been doubled. It just feels bad to train gyms now.Anyway other than that the biggest one is the balance between pokemon. I think Trainer Tips has made  or  videos about this and I agree entirely with all of his ideas. Itd make the game a lot more fun if I could use more different pokemon for different purposes.,TheSilphRoad,d9ud0hj,2,t5_3c2d7

9589970,0,t1_d9v18c2,You need to stop looking at competitive battling though. The balance relevant to pokemon go is only stats balance and moves to an extent and youll just get confounding variables such as abilities movesets items and meta relevance determining what is a good pokemon. Pokemon go has two issues with stats balance currently.  Theres a huge disparity between pokemon  some are vastly superior to others Many pokemon have lost their identity from the original games. Balancing to the original stats more accurately and how those stats were used would create a much more balanced system. Just changing the attack conversion formula to SqrtAtk  SpAtk would change it completely. If this were the only change it would mean that a lot more pokemon would do more damage and be useful as attackers. Without changing the defence and hp stats the CPs wouldnt change hugely some like rhydon fly up the ranks whilst others like arcanine drop but the threat to defenders would change. Balance shouldnt be everything having high CP but each pokemon should have a role or specific niche that it fills. ,TheSilphRoad,d9v5ri4,2,t5_3c2d7

I also travel a lot on weekends typically going out to the more rural parts of the state. And I have to say I cant believe all the complaining from the rural players. I go to a McDonalds parking lot and am immediately accosted by Growlithe Paras Eevee and Ekans well you cant win them all. Do you have any idea how long its been since I saw a Growlithe? Then I go to another small town and make a stop at the grocery store. Immediately surrounded by  pokemon including Abra incredibly rare in my suburb and city  Alakazam will be the last entry in my Pokedex and Vulpix very uncommon as well as the more common Pidgey and Ekans. I visit my sister in her mountain town and the same thing happens. It seems like the quantity and variety of pokemon in rural areas is significantly better than it is in my suburb and at least on par with San Francisco. It all just seems so overblown.Then I look at their gyms and theyre headed up by weak  CP Pokemon. If I had more time while visiting I could probably wreak havoc on their gyms as a Level  player.

However being competitive doesnt mean being a douche bag and I find elitist folks to be gigantic douche bags due to their smugness. I still remember  months back I was playing at the local park and met these awesome group of kids playing. Soon came another kid with his dad and I remember first thing he told us none of us even asked btw was that he was like level  or something. We were also doing gym battles so naturally the gym kept switching from blue to red to yellow. However we eventually realize we were like all Mystic so whos attacking the gym? One of the kids then asked the lvl  kid if he was attacking the gym and he wouldnt reply after being asked several times. The icing on top of the douche bag cake was when a Magmar spawned nearby and lvl  kid went out to catch it. He then came back and bragged about catching it BUT would not tell the others where he caught it. I then simply walked out for a bit and caught the Magmar.

However if they limited it to the  that appear now as a cap then something like a ... boat ticket could transfer the player to Johto or Kanto or anywhere else. I would surely be in favor of only getting a dose of the new stock to more quickly finish my dex. Also if others didnt care for the later generations well they can keep their Pikachus.It could be a pretty straight forward swap too as Spearow could become Hoothoot Venonat to Spinarak Rattata to Sentret etc.Some others have already said it but a daily time limit or even coin purchase would prevent hopping back and forth too frequently.,TheSilphRoad,daf41l0,2,t5_3c2d7

9756581,0,t1_dafnsm5,Ok.  But that can be said about ANY game.  Not everyone in WoW is at level  and so its ok to remove  dungeons out of the game.  Thats the line of reasoning you just laid out.  My point is that its the endgame objective of the game. Once youve caught all of the normal Pokemon  times each people move on to wanting to catch those rare Pokemon that help them battle in gyms. By going with your line of reasoning we should just all enjoy catching common Pokemon all day long and forget about rares??Either way you look at it EVERYONE is going to want rares at some point correct?  Whether you are level  and still leveling and figuring things out or whether youre  and still going out there and catching Pokemon eventually everyone wants rares. Its part of the progression of the game. This system has devastated everyones chances who live outside of a city.  Basically the overwhelming majority of the population.  I really think Niantic just had local glasses on. They thought he look  there are plenty of Dragonites Drainis Snorlaxs that spawn at stops in San Francisco so its all good. Additionally please state a reason for absolutely crushing the game for a large segment of the population when simply having both maps can work? Like why not implement two separate locating systems.  One is based on Pokestops and another by swiping left or right will bring up the nearby old map.  That way you could still have the ability to see a Snorlax that is  yards away from you and Pokemon that are sitting at stops half a mile away. Like why alienate players.  Especially ones that have consistently played the game since launch.  Look think about it.  Im not the only one who has this opinion.  Just look at the Facebook post by Niantic.  Look at the comments and which ones have moved up to the top.  Its not the Oh I love the new tracking map it solves all of my problems.

For the next event I will do better. I am currently saving k eggs for the next event. Ill start them early so they will all hatch shortly after the event begins. Ill also plan for acquisition of new incubators durring the event by insuring that some of the incubators burn out before others.There is a tradoff between saving coins and collecting k eggs.

To me having a ton of stops around means potions and regular balls are almost always instantly discarded together with excess berries. Usually my items will dip to low s when I burn revives and potions while battling in gyms but since the gyms are also surrounded by stops that number quickly increases again and then Im back at dropping trash. What usually happens is my item collection swings from ball heavy to potion heavy offset by catching and battling sessions.I really wish there were custom filters for each item so that any  above whatever you set gets dropped.

9808370,0,t1_dalxdjf,You need to ignore everything you know from the main series. Ice is actually good defensively right now and its a crucially important amp way too rare offensive type. First  as for defense it probably depends on your biome but here rhyhorn are rare geodude are even rarer and dratini are easily found. Plus rhydon and golem are both part ground and will take SE damage back  not to mention neither are guarenteed to even have rock moves. So that double rock weakness is not as much of a problem as you might expect. And type wise vaporeon will have about as much of an advantage as fire types have over lapras right now  which honestly doesnt mean that much with the incredibly reduced type effectiveness bonus.But more importantly articuno will probably be used offensively where you get to pick your fights. Dragonite is everywhere and Lapras is so rare that increasing the supply of decent ice attackers even a little bit could be really meaningful,TheSilphRoad,dam3bbm,8,t5_3c2d7

9825621,0,t3_5fzjj2,No.Others will know and explain this better than me but the damage you do and the damage you sustain as well as the damage you are able to sustain are separate values that contribute to the CP but not in equal measure.To take your example the snorlax has an attack value based on its base stat  its IV in attack. The damage it does per second is DPS multiplied by the total attack value divided by the defense value for the mon it is attacking.But you would also need to take into account the type of attack and the resistance or weakness of the mon to that kind of attack.Similarly the damage it sustains is calculated in the same way. And the amount of damage it can sustain is its HP so you would need to factor that in as well.So the short answer if the stats are close then type advantage will be decisive. To find out if they are close check the base stats for attack then the moveset then hmm maybe the product of defence and stamina.

9853409,0,t3_5gfts4,Trading is going to be tough to balance. Niantic certainly dont want a fresh low level player to complete the dex so easily without spending money.

He is really behind on his pokedex and I want to help him out when trading is live. I can dump all my spares to him in return for nothing pidgeys. In my view this is what trading is about helping other players.However this could be abused. Like high level players dumping strong attackers to other players or even their alt accounts with the aim to dominate local gyms. Niantic has no way to distinguish between the legit and abusive trading.I would guess Niantic would restrict trading to medium to high level players example level  or above. Traded mons should also be around he same CP like within  difference.Other restrictions may include a daily trade limit like no more than  trades a day and no more than  trades with the same person.How will they implement it?

And a special that has a short lag time before firing to be hard to dodge. Ideally also some type diversity to cut down the number of hard counters. Attackers will have fast rate of fire and high raw DPS. They will also have optimal type matching for easy countering. E.g. grass with grass moves as a water counter.

9889285,0,t3_5gzz18,I really dont understand the most common criticism of the new tracker What if I miss something nearby?.Well with the old tracker you missed things at nearby pokstops that the new scanner catches. The only difference is that youre more likely to randomly walking into things the new scanner misses thus making the issue less with the new one. The new tracker doesnt make you miss more rares than the old one you just think that you do because you actually spot some of the ones it misses which you never did with the old tracker. Those were gone forever thus you never found out they existed. What I dont like about it is that its not a tracker anymore. I loved trying to find the pokmon shown on the tracker based on when it shows up and disappears. It was a fun minigame. The other thing is that it shows duplicates. And OP youre a million times not even an exaggeration more likely to miss a Lapras because theres tons of Pidgeys in the nearby than you are missing a Lapras because theres two of them at pokstops so that argument to keep duplicates is really really bad. ,TheSilphRoad,dawlhrx,2,t5_3c2d7

Elite gyms are not owned by factions multiple factions can represent the Elite gymHence fourth teamWhen fighting an Elite gym trainers will have to face four individual gym leaders with  pokemon each and between each fight gives you the chance to use items only specifically for your  chosen pokemon. Once defeating all  pokemon in the Elite gym the elite four trainer with the lowest tier will be replaced by you and your  pokemon used to defeat the Elite Four.Once earning your position at the top as CHAMPION of an Elite gymYou will gain a permanent Champion status which will allow you to combat and join Elite gyms with out the prerequisite of being a leader of  different gyms.

Im also Lv Whether or not you choose to use the Go depends on how you play though I think. I have it strapped to my bike on my daily commute so I press the button for basically everything I wouldnt otherwise bother stopping for. I will usually stopgo back for rares and catch them manually if I have time. I also just use the Go when Im doing other things like shopping or going places with people who dont play... so overall Im having a go at a lot more pokemon than I otherwise would which nets me a lot of stardust and XP. I also use the Go mainly for notifications when I go for a dedicated Pokemon walk. Distance trackingI havent compared the Go vs app alone but the ability to have my phone asleep or using other apps while tracking distance certainly helps!Editgt It has been said that walking with the Go registers distance better. Personnaly I havent noticed it. Id say it registers distance in a different way. At time it feels like more at times it feels like less.Yes youre right.

9985581,0,t1_db9513i,Theres a lot of people who claim they are hatching the parents with new eggs I dont think Niantic would put more Pokemon in k eggs and reduce the number in k eggs without changing how incubators work. They make a lot of money off of incubators and people would buy less if my suggestion was actually implemented. Thats why changing it to distancebased and making luresincense more attractive would offset this and even potentially lead to an increase in inapp purchases.It wouldnt be too difficult to pull off either since each egg type has an unique color. They would then just display the remaining distance to hatch on the bottom which they already have coded in the game.

10063446,0,t1_dbja40u,Im expecting it to happen whenever Niantic updates spawns again. Though OSM would have to be updated too. I made some other changes in regards to marking a park and a lake that wasnt marked before. There are different layers you can look through when viewing OSM. So far those changes only show up on the Humanitarian layer. They show on the Standard layer but only when its zoomed out to a certain degree. If you zoom in the markings dissappear... But the parks and other areas that were already marked prior to my changes will be there regardless.So if things happen Im guessing it wont be  until the Standard layer updates so that my changes are always shown no matter at what zoom level. And then the spawn points will have to update. Im not sure how long it takes to update.  I read somewhere that different layers update at different intervals. ,TheSilphRoad,dbjahh8,13,t5_3c2d7

The first time was a user named BotSnorlaxBot who was an unrealistically high level I think it was  or something and this was several months ago around the time the community had first calculated that it would take  years on average for a fairly active player to reach level  and had a massively powerful Dragonite in a gym. The second time was when I saw a level  gym that had a Pokemon from a trainer named TheLordWilson and another Pokemon from a trainer named TheLordWilsn.The thing is I dont report people if I see a gym getting taken down when no one is around because in my area nearly every gym has some location that can reach it that is out of eyesight Metro train platform dark alley patch of thick brush etc. Plus if my area has any GPS spoofers or botters then theyre smart enough to not camp any gyms  and keep their trainer levels low enough to not arouse suspicion.Out of curiosity what kind of behavior would people on this subreddit consider to be guaranteed evidence of cheating?,TheSilphRoad,dbjst5s,2,t5_3c2d7

Raichu fits perfectly into that slot the same way as parasect fits it for vaporeon. Also its one of my fav pokemon so Im probably bias. Considering baring the couple weeks I had a nest a town over I might see a couple pikachu but so few it took months for the first raichu I evolved so I have at least attempted to catch until fleeing happens every pikachu that I have had spawn. When the event started I had one raichu with thunder with  ivs and now I have  raichu with thunder and three have  ivs so catching all the pikachu is going pretty well for me. ,TheSilphRoad,dbp47wo,1,t5_3c2d7

10134265,0,t1_dbrooyt,I like Ice Punch best because its  damage. Move DPS is less important defensively but damage per energy and per move is still relevant. Submission is neutral against most of the obvious poliwrath counters but NVE against psychic and flying which do SE damage to fighting type and thus are good for attacking Poliwrath.  Ice is neutral against many but SE against Flying Grass which are SE against poliwrath.  The move is oddly annoying to dodge. Timing wise when compared to bubble and not many people have seen it enough to practise. ,TheSilphRoad,dbshzp1,2,t5_3c2d7

So Gengar is currently my strongest Snorlax killer.Edit Just realized I forgot to account for types in my calculations but Gengar would still be marginally stronger which is consistent with my real world experience.

10193683,0,t3_5lyvdd,Thank you for posting this. Wartortle has alwyas been one of my favourite pretigers and I have also collected a decent number of Wigglytuff Lickitung and Dewgong. With the current event one of my goals is to catch or evolve a few Ivysaurs in the  CPrange for prestiging against water. I prefer Vine Whip and Powerwhip. Ive got Bellsprout and a few Bulbasaur up to CP. Ive got a few Tangela at CP hatched and a couple of Venusaurs at CP evolved from hatched bulbasaurs. Venusaur doesnt get Powerwhip but Petal Blizzard or Solarbeam is just fine. Ivysaur will close the  gap in my lineup. I wish had this same knowledge for other types too. It is important knowledge because pokemon with the best IV tend to consume most of my candy and they are mostly level  hatched or higher. Knowing which wild pokemon to keep and which ones to evolve at certain levels to make great prestigers will save candy and stardust too I guess if youre serious about training gyms. Is there a list of the most economic prestigers within certain CPranges for each type or defenders as youve listed?,TheSilphRoad,dbzidbp,1,t5_3c2d7

10197895,0,t3_5lz6dl,Dragonite is easiest to catch at areas of maximum density of mons and also with enhanced tracking capability of some kind. The first two major in game trackers were better imo because they would show you the dragonite that was just m away the current one doesnt and Ive experienced that specific issue with Dragonite like  or  times already.Unfortunately now your only options for rd party trackers start to get into dangerous ToS territory. But most of the people that obtain Dragonite will be using one.Its also interesting to examine the history of Dratini in the game started as a nesting pokemon how many got their first dragonites moved to a semirare pokemon seen around every so often now it seems like its very rare.,TheSilphRoad,dbzzkvt,1,t5_3c2d7

Bite outclasses Low Kick and Fire Fang outdamages it quite a bit. I live in a fireground biome though so I have a ton of Arcanines to choose from. Then again Machop and Arcanine seem to share a biome so I doubt many people would have one be significantly more available than the other. Id go with Arcanine.

10213476,0,t3_5m6rgo,As a rural player I notice there are differences in proceeding through the game. Main difference is acquiring balls quick enough to make it count. Rural areas have less stops and gyms which reduces activities related to them. In most other senses the game is the same game in rural areas you just proceed slower.Weather isnt any different in different sports. The temperature is the same in any outdoor game. The difference with this game is it gets people out who havnt apparently used to be playing out but at the warmth of their radiators or cooling air conditioning with Wii ps or similar creating more heat for the airconditioner to take out. It is definately not too cold in Netherlands at the moment we have C here and even that isnt too cold for me to plan to drive tonight to a nearby town and go walk around stops. I know I wont get cold since I dress up for it. It is easy to keep warm in cold people go out fishing on the ice and might sit there for hours for fun without getting cold. Just a matter of correct clothing.The rural aspect of the game is same collect pokedex. The game doesnt change in that sense.

Its got a fast animation so you can fit it between a lot of quick attack moves and still dodge it does respectable damage that isnt resisted by anything that you regularly see in gyms and coupled with wing attack gives you a pretty powerful general purpose attacker that especially rocks against grass and fighting types. I have a wadc charizard and for too long I ignored him until I tried him out against an exeggutor in a gym.

10229253,0,t3_5mc09f,The throwing distance scales to the speed before releasing. But if going too fast the gane cant properly track it and the throw gets really poor. I learned that within the first week. Also if you do bigger circles like an oval over a big part of the screen the throw also goes further considering the throwing speed is the same. If your circle is an oval over the whole screen you can easily aim for great hits on Golbat cant relate to Dragonite since I only evolved one myself but I read Golbat is roughly as hard to reach with throws as Dragonite.,TheSilphRoad,dc3jk36,1,t5_3c2d7

10235466,0,t1_dc28h8e,I agree. I am very certain that I caught a Ditto disguised as Krabby  weeks after Ditto was released. Well to be clear this is what Im certain of I was at home I didnt have a regular spawn right here with a little bit of GPS drift I could get  an hour. I unlocked my phone I had the app open for at least a few hours so there could have been a syncing issue. I got a Krabby spawn or at least I thought so Krabbys are a plague around here almost as common as Pidgeys Rattatas etc. I was a little bit distracted because it was just a Krabby and I just caught it for the dust. Thats why I cant remember seeing the whole transformation animation. Only the part where ditto pops out. I tried catching it for my GF but her GPS didnt drift so I couldnt catch it a second time and it didnt seem necessary due to a few earlier Ditto catches and the missing controversy on this topic.Conclusion  IMO there are two possible explanations for it. It could have been a bug  glitch maybe similar to these Halloween spawns  catch this but actually you caught another. Or maybe related to the error you get when an old spawn is shown on the map or Niantic indeed tested around a bit as what Pokmon Ditto can spawn.  However since there is no proof and it doesnt seem possible anymore I guess we can state that it only spawns as these four.  Dont call people liars just because they experienced something else than you. Think of plausible explanations first and if they really get an advantage for lying.tldr Explanation for those catches Bug  Glitch or testing by Niantic,TheSilphRoad,dc48wuv,1,t5_3c2d7

Most commonly these are Grass  biomes. Indicators for this biome are Pidgey Ratatta Spearow and occasional VenonatJiggypuff.

Saw another Snorlax somewhere in the Central Valley.  Only wild Aerodactyl I saw near Santa Barbara.  Only saw wild Dragonite by chance in L.A. area.

10271903,0,t1_dc8ao8w,i am saying the tug of war of prestiging is what is not fun. If you read the rest of my comment I point out a better way to execute a system oriented around using low CP mons to defeat high CP mons. Prestiging is tug of war where attackers always get to pull harder. Training would be a much better way to encourage using low level stuff to defeat high level stuff. They remove Tug of war from the game and make it simply node capture through depletion. Players who see a gym tend to know immediately when they attack it if they intend on bringing it down and often thats the whole point in bothering to attack it at all. So gyms themself dont need an arbitrary point system to make defendind them arbitrarily handicapped when compared to attacks. The challenge of defeating high level stuff could be provided elsewhere. I agree that it is fun beating big stuff with little stuff. I dont like it being enforce in a system where attackers get to use the biggest baddest stuff and then get the same rate of prestige.,TheSilphRoad,dc8dk7u,1,t5_3c2d7
10271932,0,t1_dc8ch2m,Yeah thats the bit where the logistics of implementing it may become challenging. One way is to fix the battle order for the enemy player at entry into a battle and letting them complete it without erroring out.Another possible way is if a Pokemon is under attack it cannot enter into a challenge. If it is in a challenge it cannot be attacked until the battle finishes. You basically enter into a queue waiting for battle.,TheSilphRoad,dc8doh9,2,t5_3c2d7
10273600,0,t1_dc8k2x4,yes they would maybe but it would fix one side of the problem by alowing a wider variety of defenders.and also closing the power gap of fast vs slow quick moves on attack a bit.which is imho too wide to justify any slow move,TheSilphRoad,dc8kh3w,1,t5_3c2d7
10274487,0,t1_dc8gova,About the current prestige level display in theory yes you can calculate how much prestige you gain but in practice you have to take into account the fact there is a chance that you are not the only player battlingprestiging the gym.

10321873,0,t1_dcdvpma,So I can tell you now a good place to start looking is Stat Ratios. People are currently coming up with figures like CP Efficiency but the answer lies in how CP is factored to begin with. Attack is over valued so spikes CP so higher defense and HP generally result in the same CP but more survivability. Since your biggest enemy is dying the opponents attack is kind of your biggest concern which justifies high defense stats to reduce damage. In the end effective damage is king of training. That is how much damage can that pokemon do before it faints. DPS is important only at the threshhold of failing to time. So take a look at things like Effective Damage and Raw Stats to CP ratio.I have wanted to set something liek this up for a while you need the pokemons level to determine the CPM. With that you determine the stats at each level based on their maximums  Their IVs. I think its interesting to note here that certain IVs may be more beneficial. Intuition tells me that having  would result in the most effective damage for a prestiger within species at a given CP.,TheSilphRoad,dce1ho0,3,t5_3c2d7

The phrase good for nothing is sometimes used as an adjective such as Hes a goodfornothing bum!A joke for youAlice Did you know that in most languages a double negative means a negative?Fred bored Oh.Alice But in proper English where allowed a double negative usually means a positive such as He doesnt have no money technically means It is incorrect that he is completely bereft of funds which means he does have some money! Fred more bored OK.Alice But the most interesting part is that you can never have a double positive mean a negative!Fred sarcastically Yeah right.  uJokeExplainBot would likely say  The phrase Yeah right is often used sarcastically to express disagreement even though each word usually has a positive connotation.

10400999,0,t3_5otg3b,If youre teleporting all over the world instantly griefing players for fun and appearing right next to Snorlaxes thats one thing.If youre scanning your area to see if theres any relevant or useful Pokemon around and therefore make a time conscious decision to go on the hunt for it thats exactly what the tracker should be doing and I dont begrudge anybody for using those tools to further enjoy the game. People talk about the spirit of the game as an argument against these tools but they dont put dozens of Snorlaxes and Dragonites and Lapras right in your hands. Your location doesnt move unless you do and youre capabilites are usually still restricted to your biome. You still have to go out and catch them and if theyre not in your immediate area you gotta run man. The excitement and the possibilities are still there and everybody gets a big rush when theyre on the tail of a potential favorite. You still get the disappointment of not making it in time and you still get averaged out on IVs and movesets making what you caught potentially useless.If I stick to what Niantic gives me when Im at home and I open the app I make a decision to go out and catch a bunch of trash that hover around Pokestops and hope for a good spawn. Venturing outside this area means youre desperate after seeing nothing but Pidgey Rattata Eevee Weedle etc. etc. on the nearby and coming across rare pokes by accident is both unlikely and unsatisfying. Youre not hunting it down you just got lucky. If anything THAT is against the spirit of the game. If they had any sort of fluid intuitive tracking system ingame there would be no need for any other tools. It would already know that I would rather see a rarer spawn off the beaten path every single time.Theres been bots in almost every huge multiplayer internet game and while Im not specifically condoning bot usage they are everpresent. In the past players have had to consider where their own personal line is in all the gray area and I feel this is very similar. I would say do what gives you the most enjoyment out of the game as long as it doesnt affect other peoples enjoyment. If Niantic wanted to be proactive about upholding their TOS they would appeal to the messages they are receiving about spoofers ruining peoples enjoyment but months go by and those players remain. ,TheSilphRoad,dcn0q8n,1,t5_3c2d7

10424599,0,t1_dcpk48t,based on damage and gym combat mechanics that are consistent with what is stated on gamepressOne major one is that defender energy generation is based purely on nonweave damage from the attacker to prevent the need for iteration.Another is the removal of rounding i.e. flooring in the damage calculations or ceiling when calculating the average number of basic attacks needed to charge a charge attack.Also nondodging is assumed i use a pretty junk phone and id say id be lucky to dodge more than  of charge attacksAnd in terms of picking a half CP pokemon vs a defender instead of using a true pokemon at a certain level I calculate a CpM that would alter stats such that you would get the desired CP.I then calculate the damage done over the time the attacker stays alive and add in a condition that its DPS  . gt defenderHP.  If the condition is not met the statistic dpsT is instead set to zero.With this spreadsheet I can seminonarbitrarily eliminate chansey as the best prestiger result by altering the condition clause.  For example I could change the condition to DPS   gt defenderHP meaning only pokemon who win the battle within  seconds will return a stat and be considered a successful prestiger.I can also alter it to instead of finding the best prestiger based on dmg in lifetime to simply who wins a fight at half CP in the shortest amount of time.One thing i do need to fix though is the max cp multiplier.  i have it set at . for lvl . but apparently the actual cap is at .,TheSilphRoad,dcpp404,1,t5_3c2d7

Whilst it might have been possible for a single event manager to arrange everything from San Francisco for every event worldwide the release of Pokemon Go makes that much more challenging. If  players turned up to an event that would challenge the capacity of any modern stadium e.g. Nou Camp Bernabu Old Trafford Wembley etc. The level of planning would probably require a new role.Just my thinking.,TheSilphRoad,dcsqyty,10,t5_3c2d7
10453158,0,t3_5pnz25,My statsHatched  eggs hatched  Porygon ..  Also caught  in the wild at the same time at the same PokeStop.  It was a stop at a country themed chain restaurant..  Egg picked up in Vienna Austria.  I did not have internet yet when I was at the airport on .  Unless there was airport wifi I forgot about..  Egg picked up at the SMP.  I guess that makes up for a disappointing experience there..  Egg picked up in San Francisco California.  That was the day I went to Pier  and the waterfront to hunt Dratini during the double candy event got my silver dragon medal that day.  So potentially this was my second Porygon egg picked up at a pier..  Egg picked up in Los Angeles California.  This was the day after I flew back home and I spent the previous few days in the Valley where the captures were not labeled as L.A.  The only L.A. PokeStops I spun were at L.A.X.  So clearly this was an egg I obtained at the airport.So of my  Porygon eggs  was obtained at an airport  at piers and  obtained at an uncertain place airport is not ruled out but very unlikely.  Thanks to the  hatches during the double candy event and the two wild captures I have  Porygon candy thus far.My main advice for finding rares is to travel around and explore new places. If I hadnt traveled to Europe or to various places in California I would have never seen wild Lapras Dragonite Aerodactyl Snorlax Charizard etc.,TheSilphRoad,dcsyuco,2,t5_3c2d7

Numeric order gather new species following the Pokdex . Start with Bulbasaur then keep catching other of that until you can either evolve or find the next form in the wild. Then switch to Charmander and repeat. May not be possible in Gen  if babies are restricted to eggs. Oneofaspecies only obtain one of each species ever. If you want to evolve or power up walk your Pokmon. Eggs are allowed but at risk of getting a duplicate and Game Over.,TheSilphRoad,dcuaubl,6,t5_3c2d7

10469728,0,t1_dcukznh,I made a comment now  am copying it here.So to summarize  the assumptions are. When the game decides to give us an egg it first rolls for the Pokemon inside and then just gives us this Pokemon in the corresponding egg package. Meaning that moving whatever Pokemon from one package to another does not influence the chance of getting it.. The vast majority of us use only blue incubators for k eggs and sometimes but far from always use also blue incubators on k eggs. This means that we should not care about the actual distancetime spent on eggs in blue incubators.Under this assumptions indeed the only effect this change had was that we now in the long run earn few less Eevee candy which I can easily live with have enough of them and less stardustXP which is worse especially the stardust part  .I would agree with both assumptions . is at least what trainers should do  if they get enough gym coins to buy incubators.,TheSilphRoad,dcuun7w,1,t5_3c2d7

Im ok with moveset being left out too its highly subjective anyway and its part of type weaknessstab too. CP doesnt need to be perfect.The problem with CP is that Attack Defence and HP arent accounted for in a balanced way attack and defence clearly has an opposite relationship in a  proportion. increasing defence by  completely counters an increase on attack of  of your opponent. Its equally good. But its not equally awarded in the CP formula attack is twice as important.Its not about comparing Rhydon and Vaporeon head to head CP should compare them against a neutral opponent. Even then vaporeon would probably be better because of better DPS on its attacks but even if they had the same attacks  on the same CP Vaporeon would be better because its stats are balanced towards the defensive which doesnt score as high on CP as Rhydon with Attack being its highest stat.,TheSilphRoad,dcxsm64,1,t5_3c2d7

10508541,0,t3_5qei86,My strategy is if its a level  gym and Im adding a defender is add a strong Pokmon that forces a challenger to waste a pick for one of their . So if a level  gym has  gyarados  snorlax and  dragonites then Im adding an eggxecutor or an arcanine so they are forced to pick a Pokmon to take it out. That way it forces people  a lot of the time to take several cracks at the gym and take them out one by one which is discouraging so at the least Ill make a challenger earn it,TheSilphRoad,dcz962f,1,t5_3c2d7

10523357,0,t1_dd0s4fn,Ive seen this several times with a specific gym or cluster being unplayable. You will have to trawl through posts here but there are several references to the presence of banned trainers in a gym stack making the whole gym unplayable. Thats not a false claim simply the summary of several opinions here in the Subred. It is also plausible that some other kind of corruption could occur in the database record which defines a specific gym. That might be the clue if you find several unplayable gyms and theres one common name in all of them it might suggest theres something erratic about that trainers account particularly if it shows as level  behind the avatar. Either way the gym is broken and only Niantic can repair it.If you want a mechanism we have to speculate. When a player is banned they get reduced to level which should not be in a gym. Im guessing now but this probably triggers some kind of exception when you try to fight the gym. That would be a bug in the software ,TheSilphRoad,dd0xptf,1,t5_3c2d7

10566648,0,t1_dd59cuf,What you are wanting exists! Here on TSR! Search for it it was a topic of discussion just a couple of weeks ago. A traveler used a battle simulator to rank the best prestigers for several of the most common defenders.I think a good search term may be CP efficiency or prestige CP efficiency.EDIT Here ya go  check near the bottom of the original post for links to prestiging matchups for other popular defenders As for your original question Hypnos stats are very well suited for prestiging. Low attack means that it will have relatively low CP even at highish levels so its attacks can potentially deal more damage than other mon with the same CP since level is a component of the damage calc. And its high defense helps it take more hits from defenders that are much stronger than it.I wouldnt bother spending all the necessary dust to power it up even to  though. At level  its around  CP. Even at level  it would barely break  CP. I cant remember the last time I attacked an enemy gym with anything under  CP. For a purepsychic attacker Alakazam is the way to go. Although to be honest Ive got a ZHPsyshock Hypno with  CP thats tagged as part of my prestige team but I dont think Ive ever used it. Psychic is great for general attacking since not much resists it. But when prestiging I prioritize optimal type matchups and generally fall back to WigglytuffRaticatePidgeot otherwise. Still though its  and it wont take much more to get it to a good prestige level. So I say try it out as a prestiger for a bit and decide from there whether you want to power it up any more.If it makes you feel better most of my  mon are either useless types or too low level to be usable. But I keep all  for collection purposes.,TheSilphRoad,dd5ukpi,2,t5_3c2d7

10580416,0,t3_5rhhn9,I think its a decent concept to say the least. As it stands we throw in the highest CP Pokmon to be the king of the gym. Levels could change some of that or at least open up the options a little bit. Because lets face it Whether its a CP Snorlax or CP Pidgeot if someone wants to take down the gym its going down.With that said Levels may only matter up to around . Most people dont want to invest the stardust and candies after that on a lot of Pokmon because it costs twice as much to move it up a level. Theres really only a half dozen or so Pokmon I have leveled up to the nines. The rest pretty much are what they are. Its just not as economical with stardust being more precious and battling feeling redundant.I do like the idea of level caps or difficulty. There isnt really any Pokmon thats too hard to take down especially if youre dodging. You could earn more XP or hell even Stardust.But something should happen to the gym meta outside of just rearranging CP on Niantics ends. They can rearrange them all they want but the way its currently set up the top  Pokmon will reign supreme. Itd drum up more interest for gyms and get us more involved and adding a stardust kickback or even candy if it came down to it would feel more rewarding.,TheSilphRoad,dd7adn8,2,t5_3c2d7

It all started with  gyms in proximity of my friends house. Wed lock them and stack them to  all the time communicate open slots over FB and the like. In time people stopped attacking those gyms for other ones. We spread out found out highlow turn over areas and worked on establishing the low turn over areas as our territory. Then we swooped down with  people over FB over and over for about two weeks and whipped the area into complete submission. Things changed when the gym system changed but every place in my town that isnt a high traffic training area is solid gold. Beyond having a FB and friends to gym with our team is the only one to post maps on gym turn over rates and territory. How do I know this?

In Clash of Clans several updates have made it easier to earn premium in game currency for free and its spent  years at the top of the highest grossing charts. They must be doing something right.

Once such a gym falls it will be switching colors for a few days sometimes weeks before getting to lvl  again. So to stay in those gyms for the whole time when they are stagnant you need to have high CP defenders everything else is irrelevant.I am fully aware that it isnt hard to take down any lvl  gym especially not in the current meta with almost only Gyarados Rhydon and Dragonite inside but people dont do it often here.,TheSilphRoad,dddk1lr,1,t5_3c2d7

10662901,0,t1_ddecqck,This fix rectified the majority of the discrepancies. Some of my really early entries arent lining up with what Im getting from your sheet... but Im thinking those might be human error cause those were all hand entered forever ago.The only discrepancy I really have left from the more recent data is the aforementioned Pidgey. As you point out  entering the Overall rating C by the way will come out with only the one solution Level  and . However without the Overall rating it cant deduce this giving  or  as options. However PAs calculator which again only uses CPHPDust and offers top Stat as an option and not Overall solves this case with only the one possible option .It might just be a random case but feel itd be remiss not to mention such a discrepancy cause it might cause unexpected inaccuracies elsewhere if there were something under the hood? With this being the only case really standing out though I feel a lot more comfortable relying moreso on your sheet since the other issue was corrected and pretty much gave me the same data I had before. Have I mentioned that I love how fast and simple of a solution it is compared to curating the data myself from online!? Again pretty much exactly what I had been searching for. Haha.Unrelated but I was curious as to the function of the numbers in columns DA DB and DC.I know its not the best idea to try and pack a load of information into one spreadsheet as itll quickly lose its simplicity and potentially its speed too. However I have pondered whether some individuals might find it useful to be able to attach moves to their entries. Different people have different systems some might use abbreviations to denote the moveset in the Remarks while you seem to have pretty strict rules as to what you hang on to in terms of movesets. Instead of having to type each move it could give a drop down with available moves based on the pokemon entered into Column A. Though... that would mean having to maintain a table with available moves for each pokemon which would surely be quite sizable and... yeah I can see the performance hit already. Haha.

10699858,0,t1_ddj7q1e,I doubt it the pokemon you see will just shift to whatever the new highest ones are and Vapes will go the way of Exeggutors and Lapras.

It makes it seem like theyre just trying to sell incubators bc thats the only way to get candy for the things that matter.At least during Halloween Gastly was a decent substitute for Rattata since it has a  candy evolution and could therefore be used for mass evolve sessions.

Its too resource intensive and the possibility of false positives. But lets go on a stretch here....even if easily implemented taking the pokes away from accounts that purchasedtraded is still better than loosing your whole account because it had been flagged for previous botting. Its still remains pretty low risk high reward. Dont get me wrong. I  understand that you point this out because breaking TOS  potential ban.

10764253,0,t3_5twguq,gt Im a kindofcasual lvl Im a kindofdedicated level player instead Anyway the basics of gym play are For attacking in your case Valor and Mystic gyms use highIV highCP toptier attackers Vaporeon Exeggutor Jolteon Alakazam Lapras or Cloyster if you have no Lapras. For prestiging in your case Instinct gyms use Pokmon with good movesets Pound Bug Bite Water Gun Vine Whip Spark Frost Breath  Hyper Beam Solar Beam Petal Blizzard Aqua Tail Hydro Pump Thunder Thunderbolt Psychic Blizzard. IVs dont matter CP should be roughly half of the last defender you plan to defeat in a session for me its the rd from bottom. For prestiging your team of  must have roughly the same CP. So unless you find  more CP good attackers you can transfer your CP Starmie. I keep five big rosters of prestigers at the following CP ranges     . Then you need to put something into the gym as a defender or better said gym holder. Here you need to power up some highIV Vaporeon and possibly SnorlaxRhydonDragoniteGyarados. A level player cannot have  as his maximum CP as a comparison my CP Vaporeon is ranked th so it doesnt show up in my first page and I have never powered up anything beyond level .

Heres the thing Niantic wants to host real time competitive events in cities. In order for them to do that teams have to have an active way to defend gyms. In the gyms present form the only real way they can do that is to allow a team member to take over the AI to defend the gym.

10794709,1,t1_ddtcmj4,Niantic has made BILLIONS of money. Yeah Im sure Im the spoiled kid here. And Niantic is the poor worker who needs more money to survive. Yeah.Its a fact that freetoplay apps generate way more money than  apps. They will have way more players gain more popularity and therefore generate more money even if just a small amount pays for stuff. Making it hard for FP players will result in Niantic earning even less money because the game will become unpopular. Many many apps have already made that mistake and Niantic is about to do the same.To your point . I know I dont have to hold on to every pokemon. Im obviously already transferring a lot. But the pokemon games are super successful because everyone can play however they want. Some people like gym battling some people like collecting. You cant tell people how to play the game. You will only make them unhappy and leave. Not everybody wants to be a gym battler who collects  coins a day and transfers everything thats not worthy for gyms. Some people WANT to keep an exemplar their Goldeen and Dragonair and their three Wigglytuffs because theyre cute. But yeah Niantic go ahead and kill the fun for them watch your player base die. Of course one has to make sacrifices and everyone is doing that already. People constantly have to release their Persians and Venomoths etc. But making sacrifices doesnt mean that you shouldnt be able to own every pokemon. Raising the storage to  or  is a very logical and humane thing to do to enable regular gameplay.. Try to argue correctly and not manipulatively. I never talked about getting ALL the content for free.As for new players by the time they reach level  everybody else will already be level  so level  probably wont be enough to prestige into gyms anymore especially since all gyms are stagnant level  gyms anyway so theres no gym to prestige at all.

10806976,0,t1_ddumwfn,Yeah Im really torn. The Pokmon like Alakazam and Machamp deserved to be attack powerhouses because they are. But there is still big value in versatile Pokmon like the ones you mentioned. For one I hate how speed nerfs or buffs attack AND defense. It should really only be able to affect attack. That would rectify the negative impact it has on Slowbros defense which is unwarranted. I think if they could tie speed into cooldown it would have been a better solution. They could have kept the stat formula that favored balanced offensedefense stats and Pokmon like Jolteon and Alakazam would still have DPS gains via better cooldowns. Of course that still screws over Pokmon like Machamp. Maybe a better solution is using a balanced formula for Defense and a MinMax formula for offense. Basically use the old formula for defense and the new formulas for attack. That feels like it has more overall balance and would remove the completely bonkers stats of Blissey and Chansey removing their ridiculous defense values. ,TheSilphRoad,ddunwcl,1,t5_3c2d7

Aside from a Snorlax and one or two other good defenders that was all I had.  They basically took away one of four or five points of pride in playing this game.  I dont get it.

Since its unordered its a much more straightforward calculation.

You need some skaner sites.. that give out coordinates to input in teleport...Than input teleport go there.. you cannot spin pokestops or catch pokemon you can just tap on pockestop to get spawns and something like that.. then click pokemon... before you trow ball you click teleport home.. pray luck and try to catch pokemon... So as game sees it you never left house and your activity on other side of world never happened...This is still work and effort to put in it is not  min catch them all...My friend spoofs on his second account... We both play leggit have each cought couple dratini since release dont own gyrados grimer arcancine lapras and onyx and many more...

I just have fun with it I dont let it consume my life. I have spent  on the game. I use no bullshit hackerstrackersTwitters or even the nest atlas I just open up the game and go out and explore. I like taking down and building up gyms if I come across them and have time but I have never had ten gyms before. I had to walk my Magikarp over km to get a gyrados and I have walked my Dratini over km with a Dragonite still in my distant future. I am only level  or  honestly Im not sure and I dont really care. I dont have the powerhouse team that a lot of people have but I can still win any gym battle. I still love playing this game and I still have a lot of Pokemon to catch. It sounds like you need to just chill out and enjoy it as it was intended. I think a lot of people got too serious about being the best and decided to cheat using bots Twitter etc. No wonder you are sick of the game already.,TheSilphRoad,de0ilbt,3,t5_3c2d7

10897213,0,t1_de3p1ce,Firstly Celandro I love your tool. But as a partial compromise in adding some randomness could you perhaps configure it to include a a couple of more stereotyped usersettable parameters to specify simulation of real world missed opportunities. The first of these would be missed dodges e.g. when I actually attempt a dodge all pro strategy in the real world in some matchups if my quick move is a bit marginal timewise for the dodge window I tend to miss maybe every th quick move dodge on average. Not usually a fatal mistake because it actually leads to faster chargeup of my charge move.  So you could implement a duty cycle parameter for successful dodges e.g. missing every rd th etc. The second parameter would be a missed quick move If I know my mon is a bit fragile I tend to be cautious even when a really slow move like Hyperbeam begins to unwind against me and perhaps only get in one or two more quick attacks before my dodge where I know I might have squeezed in a rd. So as a simplified way of implementing this you could have a missed quick move parameter again for every rd th etc where you do no damage and charge no energy for the normal cooldown period on every rd quick attack.  This might let users crudely simulate more aggressive or defensive styles within the existing strategies you set up. e.g. When I am fighting with a robust attacker who I know should have more HP to spare Im more likely to worry less about dodging every quick move and could set the missed quick move dodge parameter higher using Dodge all. etc.  ,TheSilphRoad,de3yxrg,1,t5_3c2d7

10900652,0,t3_5vqxua,I agree gyms are weird. Theyre easy to take down but take a long time to do it.

Id have more fun if gyms were really quite difficult to take down in terms of player skill dont want to block out low level players with weaker mons but it took less time to do so.

10920884,0,t3_5w0nrw,First I must ask what is your native language? Still i completely understand what you say. Same thing happens where I live. Its been a chaos. On one side theres the game itself thats really fun and what not. I love the competition against the other teams and meeting new people.But at some point along the journey I felt the battle wasnt really against Valor or Mystic but spoofers in general. And so the real battle begun. Im talking about FB discussions arguments whatsapp groups with people insulting one another. it was really sad to read this all. You couldnt even tell who was playing legit and who wasnt. The worst part are the spoofers of your own team color. I just hate it when they use alternate accounts to kick someone from a gym and then replace it with a crappy  Gyarados. This personally does not affect me because my mons are really high CP and stronk. But it bums me out for other low level playrs like I once was. Were at that point that even the very small group of instinc players here are divided between spoofers and legit players. So its really sad to see how Niantics vision is backwards and making people fight over a game. On a positive note youre not alone. Some of us still see the light at the end of the tunnel and we will press on. We bully the F out of spooofers here. MY elite team of friends that play with me are all high levels between    so we get to push those spoofers down in gyms which works perfectly for us hint that simbiotic relationship At the end of the day what matters is if youre having fun or not. I hope you are. Cheers trainer and good luck. Us instinct players have each others backs!! ,TheSilphRoad,de6evak,6,t5_3c2d7

People that repeatedly report a nest and people with detailed comments because they actually understand these things and know the area well should hold more weight than some random person that just marks it not a nest.We should also be able to mark several points in a nest and link them so that all the comments are together and changing  point changes them all. This way huge nests that people drop pins all over for would be easier to manage and if we wanted we could mark exact spawn points which would be especially helpful for smaller nests so that people would know exactly where things can spawn.,TheSilphRoad,de8yq01,13,t5_3c2d7

10962162,0,t1_dea3ht4,I hate to be a little insensitive but if youve been playing since July  and youre level  youve probably been averaging  XP a day or in other words the daily bonus plus a couple of spins and a Pokemon. Now not everyone has time to pile hours into the game every day and playing and collecting is a fun reward in and of itself. But there has to be a point where as regards gyms i.e. the competitive element of the game players who dont play for more than a few minutes a day on average wont be able to keep up with those who do. You say We need better Gym system so everyone can have a shot but everyone kind of does. You could still tear down those towers with what looks like a vaporeons and Jynxes. Itll take you a long time and youll time out a fair bit with Blissey but thats kind of the advantage which those other players have gained by pumping their time into the game.I consider myself a moderate player  Level  with a longhours job  and I do kind of feel jealous when I see level  players holding gyms for weeks.

10968927,0,t3_5wmvcd,Unfortunately ConfusionPsychic isnt the strongest defender Exeggutor any more mainly because Psychic is a single bar albeit stronger charge move so you wont get spammed as often as Seed Bomb which IMO is the best defensive moveset combined with Confusion as a quick move. I once had to train against a Confusion amp Seed Bomb Exeggutor the mad tree kept spamming Seed Bomb like crazy it wasnt even funny. I took three Pokemon to train against the Exeggutor Flareon Pidgeot and Umbreon and both my Flareon and Pidgeot died though they managed to reduce Eggys HP by about . My Umbreon finished the job.Umbreon definitely does better than gen  bugs and many gen  counters. I have a WAFT Charizard mainly for attacking enemy Exeggutors which does very good too but again there is the problem of Exeggutor dishing out a lot of damage with both his quick and charge moves which makes fighting an Exeggutor with almost every counter quite hard.A Scizor with FCXS now that is something I would like to try. With Scizors multiple resistances to all of Exeggutors attacks Im sure he would do better than Umbreon.

10974367,0,t3_5wpo6j,Are you looking for an attacker or a defender?For quick moves Water Gun is the better attacking move while Confusion is the better defending move.For charge moves you probably want Blizzard or Psychic. Fire Blast does a small amount more raw damage than either of those against a typeneutral opponent but Fire Blast takes a full extra second of animation time and is easy to dodge. If you spent that extra second attacking with Water Gun or Confusion instead youd do about the same or more total damage over that time period than if you used Fire Blast.Fire Blast would be a decent counterpick against Grass Types except for the fact that Blizzard is also supereffective against Grass and several strong Grass types are also Poison type so Psychic is supereffective against them too.So Id say as long as you get the better quick move for the role you want either Blizzard or Psychic will serve you well.

10984435,0,t3_5wtsx1,They probably realised that a map with this level of detail wasnt going to be easy to pull from the current street maps we have available and that our current GPS technology isnt this accurate. Plus all of this might be too heavy to process on mobile phones.ampnbspOne of the biggest reasons this looks better is the varying heights of building which I imagine could be more tedious for Niantic to pull data from. It also requires them to calculate an entirely new vertical axis which could come with overhead.ampnbspTheres also more subtle reasons this looks better such as the little plots of grass on the pavementsidewalk which further help break up the environment and make it seem more realistic. The pavements etc. are also correct widths and the GPS appears to be accurate enough to place your character on the pavement rather than in the middle of the road which realistically it may struggle to do.ampnbspFinally the lighting has a huge effect on the environment. I dont actually think it would be that expensive to change the colours based on the time of day but it would be expensive to run realtime calculations to create all of the nice shadowing on the buildings in the scene. ampnbspBut note on a positive If Pokmon GO survives the future for long enough it could and probably will look closer to this some day. We need more accurate GPS technology and more powerful graphics processors in phones. We will achieve both of those things.,TheSilphRoad,ded1u2m,5,t5_3c2d7

10989376,0,t1_dedish0,What Im saying though is at least as the article laid out a direct solution to the trash problem was low on the list. Having dealt with towns and cities in engineering planning in the past I have seen punishment solutions discussed before abatement or conclusive solutions. For example there was a town that had a long narrow park that was between a high school and a strip mall with lunch options. Seniors and some Juniors were allowed off campus for lunch. They would all come out the one door walk through the park and go to Taco Bell or whatever. The issue was that there wasnt a sidewalk through the middle of the grass field park just around. So the kids wore a dirt path down. The town had first resorted to having cops show up every day to yell at the kids to use sidewalks to which the kids would just say Were enjoying the park is that not allowed? So then the town wanted to put a spite fence down the middle of the park lengthwise to get force the kids to walk the long way around. It wasnt until we put together the math of cost of a fence vs.  section of sidewalk that they saw that just going with the path was a better noncombative way. ,TheSilphRoad,dedm083,1,t5_3c2d7

11001115,0,t3_5x3iw0,Hit level  in December. From Michigan. There are a lot of pokestops on campus making PoGo loops w lucky egg very effective. Played semiserious from launch to level  mid novemberaverage hday. Gained around  million exp to level  thanks to TG event. Grinded  hours a day from  to  with full time lucky egg roughly k exph and  lucky eggs. I do not scan nor spoof and have a very modest collection of pokemon. I have two fully maxed out dragonites highest is  two snorlax one almost maxed and three egg lapras one maxed. I also have  other maxed out pokemon pinsir all starter evos omastar aerodactyl. I have traveled from Michigan to Minnesota to complete my gen pokedex aerodactyl as I couldnt hatch one and my friends told me they spawned multiple times a day at Rice Park in St. Paul. It is very possible to have multiple Dragonites if you are level  but those who grinded to level  quickly likely did not have that many because we were focused on gaining exp not follow scanners and rare hunting. I caught my first wild dragonite at level  evolved my first one at level  playing without scanners and only hatching eggs in my biome.

11001891,0,t3_5x40rj,Quite frankly if they properly overhaul the gyms it will go from stick a high cp Pokemon here to something where gym defense ability actually matters its much easier to take down a  cp Dragonite than it is to take down a  cp Snorlax not to mention Blissey. Id love to tell you that I have a good answer for this but there really isnt one.To start you could definitely save up Stardust. Sure you can save candy too...but its hard to know which Pokemon will be the best...Rhydon who has a double weakness to water which is STUPID common may suddenly find itself on the outside looking in.Im mostly hoping that they bring in some way to revive Pokemon...once a day? Once a week? I dont care I currently have  fainted Pokemon and literally zero healing items. Ive been over  fainted until I took an . hour  mile walk around a Pokehub near my house with  stops...hitting them over and over. ALL of my good prestigers are dead and Im happy when I get  coins in a day. Honestly...I have no idea how you do it getting  a day...Instinct kinda gets bullied around in my area and cant hold a gym overnight even if its level  and stacked with good defenders BlisseySnorlax.You might also start saving potionsrevives? I know a few months ago I used to discard them because I had WAY too many...now? Id trade  Pokeballs and  Great Balls for enough healing items to bring my team back to life...honestly it was like this even before Gen II when they healed all of your Pokemon I had a bunch dead then too...this number is just since Gen II was released...Good luck!,TheSilphRoad,def161x,7,t5_3c2d7

Everyone talks about how amazing the CounterClose Combat and CounterDynamic Punch fighters are but I havent been able to evolve any of these. Thanks for reminding me to candy all of my Bullet Punchers though!I do like using Rhydon though I find his quick moves to be somewhat risky. Its a good thing he has bulk to take a charge move or two since hell probably have to. I have a slight preference for Rock Smash over Mud Slap since it is just slightly faster. Probably my second goto mon along with Dragonite vs. Blissey especially since I have a ton of Rhydons from living in a desert biome.I think Dragonite is really solid due to the straight damage and speed but you have to be super vigilant against Gleam which comes early and often. Golem is reasonably okay especially against Pound Blisseys due to defensive advantage but theres a real danger of timing out at higher CP deficits. I think Arcanine one of my old favorites before the CP reformulation and Vaporeon outright dont work the damage just isnt there against the bigger Blisseys.One of my favorites is actually Confusion Solar Beam Exeggutor  I always end up with a ton time left  but the Egghead rarely ever finishes the round I usually have to swap in someone else to finish the job due to Confusions inability to dodge. Not that big a deal if you arent trying to clear  defenders when prestiging and particularly strong against ZH Blisseys.I think glass cannons like Alakazam and Gengar may work as swappable openers my limited experience with Alakazam was positive.

Its a lot of work on their part but produces a lot more work on the part of the people out there trying to keep up.

11072292,0,t3_5xocrt,So tonight I tried your theory on my own Blissey in a gym where the gyn had been taken down to only  defenders my CP Blissey being at the bottom. With a  Rhydon above it so not much leeway for prestige gain. I felt duty bound to my team to prestige it up seeing as I had put her in there when it was at about level . Wow. That was hard. I ended up powering up my two Machokes with Karate Chop and Dynamic Punch to just shy of cp each. I tried at about cp and it was miserable failure. It was still very difficult to achieve and impossible if i mistimed dodging the first hyperbeam. I also relied on having a third machoke with karate chop to take out the last little bit of Blisseys HP. However it worked well once i got them sorted and i prestiged it up a couple of levels. But i am seriously reconsidering putting her in another gym if she gets kicked out of this one.Unfortunately i also managed to drain my cars battery in the process and had to get my father in law to come and help me jump start my car.

11130842,0,t3_5yxexl,Although this proposed change might make a slight difference in the pokemon we see in gyms most of the time it would amount to a slight reshuffling of the same ones we already see. If gyms are ranked purely based on how high your level is that still leaves lowerleveled players feeling like they dont have much of a chance of staying in because theyll always be stuck on the lowest levels of any gym. This change makes it impossible for a lower leveled player to rank high in a gym whereas now it is at least possible for a level  player to be ranked above a level  player if they have one pok they really pour their resources into which is still extremely rare. Meanwhile if the gym is based on level you could have a player with a level  Gyarados ranked lower than someone whos trolling the gym by dropping in a lv  Igglybuff which wont really get any defending done but the player thinks looks funny to have sitting there even if it hurts his or her teams chance of keeping said gym. TLDR This change would result in two things A slight reshuffling of the order in which the highest possible cp pokemon already appear amp Troll picks being ranked higher up in a gym lineup than picks actually made to help defend amp keep the gym amp would also hurt how prestiging works.I  understand the desire to rework gyms to allow for some more diversity being a level  casual player myself with no snorlax  dragonite  blissey to speak of as well as the frustration of how they work but I dont think this would really help solve the problem so much as introduce a new overlycomplicated way of approaching gyms. CP amp by default level since it determines maximum possible cp just means to much in the current gym formatting.I applaud you for even having suggestions I dont think Id ever be able to invent anything close to a solution for this current gym problem. Its way easier to tell someone why something might not work than it is to offer another fix.,TheSilphRoad,deto60m,1,t5_3c2d7

Also battery life is greatly improved in my case about x so its excel.lent for long play sessions when you cannot recharge. You make up the number of escaped pokmons with that extra time. My XP gain just skyrocketed after getting it.Getting a more accurate walking distance count is also nice.Of course you have to switch to manual from time to time just in case a rare pokmon is around.

I do have a question about the speed calculation used for CP though. You mention that attackdefense stats get a  increase for every  points above . Is this a linear relationship for all points i.e  or is this a hard threshold that until you pass  speed you dont get that  boost and until you pass  you dont get a  boost? Also my question was more targeted towards how you plan to show the casual players that because your Electrode is fast he attacks faster which makes him X amount stronger? I think just implementing this change at a behind the scenes level isnt enough to interest the casual player although I really like the idea itself. ,TheSilphRoad,devydtg,1,t5_3c2d7

We know another trigger was the first  day spin bonus after Gen  was launched and there is at least one more trigger that may be discovered or may be random.  The effect of all all triggers combined is to receive on average one Evolution Item roughly every  Pokestop spins.In your case if you have played evenly since July then you would already have had more than  spins when Gen  was launched so none of your Evolution Items would have been triggered by having a multiple of  spins they will have come from other triggers.Can you please carefully monitor your Backpacker Medal and report back if you receive an Evolution Item on your th spin. ,TheSilphRoad,dezgl9e,1,t5_3c2d7

A bonus drop was received as expected from stop J. After S and just before spinning the next stop the first and last page of the journal were recorded. This showed that the first spin of stop D had just dropped off the journal. None of the  succeeding stops dropped a bonus. The next unique stop T may have been over  minutes past S.    Also stop A should have been stone cold after  minutes since it was first spun. It looks like the  minute cool down theory is busted. But since I didnt succeed in getting a bonus after that something else might have broken the streak so this needs to be tested again.    Stops that have been spun must eventually time out and become unique again. There has to be a list of stops that have been spun recently. We can see that there is a list that controls the  minute cycle time of the stops and we see this list glitch occasionally when a distant stop stays open. If this list is map cell based moving far enough away might be the key to flush the list and make stops unique again.  ,TheSilphRoad,df0xnim,1,t5_3c2d7

A Blissey at the bottom however does seem to keep that gym alive longer Im pretty sure it blocks the very casual player kids that use the park. ,TheSilphRoad,df7g3wr,1,t5_3c2d7

Ive ended up checking my phone every few minutes just to be sure the app is still running. I dont actually unlock it since you can see the location and bt icons on the status bar so if theyre both on it means that Pogo is running if theyre off time to unlock and restart the app. Quite annoying and I hope Niantic fixes this ASAP or at least comes up with a warning that the GO can give in case it looses connection with the app such as when it crashes or simply disconnects.,TheSilphRoad,df7l0jq,1,t5_3c2d7

11259249,0,t1_df7s1yn,Crunch is good for defending compared to other Tyranitar movesets for the reasons you mentioned .  But it is completely different from Snorlax BS for attacking.  BS has a under  second cooldown so you can squeeze it in between almost all defender attacks executing body slams while dodging everything.  This made LBS a great attacker in gen  one of my favorites.Crunch has a much longer . second cooldown so you get hit by a quick move every time and get hit by charge moves as well when the timing is difficult to predict.

11354474,0,t1_dfip5dx,Lets say that the odds of catching a shiny magikarp are . Spawn duration being  minutes  seconds it would be easy to give random number  to each magikarp and multiplying that number by  thus giving a shiny window to each magikarp. This shiny window would last  seconds for each magikarp. People have also been reporting about a lag when encountering a magikarp which could mean that during this shiny window a packackecontaining for example the player ID has to be sent to the server. The first player ID to register in the server during this window would then get the shiny.Just a thought no idea if this approach could actually work.,TheSilphRoad,dfj0bjs,5,t5_3c2d7

11383894,0,t3_62ek7a,If Niantic keeps shinies as rare as they are in the game theres no way shinies stay as a motivating force.  Theyre too rare and catching one would require catching every single trash pokemon you see as you walk around.  It will make the game even more of a grind if youre out to find a shiny.The water fest event only worked because of the inflated water spawns that gave people WAY more Magikarp spawns.It will be the same for every event where spawns are increased for certain types or colors of pokemon  youll have an increased shot at a shiny of that species because there are no so many.But in normal every day gameplay shinies will be a pleasant surprise but nothing people go out of their way to farm for.The only caveat is if Niantic manages to implement breeding and the ability of breeding to produce a shiny.

Maybe not all the way to level . your current max but certainly to level  would be CP . I guess if you go beyond that it depends how much fun you get out of using it. The max CP is marginal for defence anyway even in the current meta and its likely going to be a a long time  before you get to max it out above ! so I wouldnt worry about the moveset being poor for defence. As an attacker Donphan has really well rounded stats good attack and solid in both defence and HP.    ,TheSilphRoad,dfta2h5,2,t5_3c2d7

11450595,0,t1_dftvxcb,And I agree with you power by itself is not useful enough which is why Im working on an overall rating. Its tough Blissey moves from  to  depending on the weight I put on each of the factors. Im guessing she ends up around .  Note the same ranking has to make sense on my new prestige tool and the pokedex page so Im spending a lot of time tweaking. Currently leaning towards  power  time  potions.  This cuts Blissey down quite a bit and seems to work well for prestiging too.  Power serves  purposes here. It gives weighting towards surviving with more than single digit hp which lets you miss a dodge or get unlucky. It also means you are less likely to swap out your pokmon which eats both time and potions. Combat time cuts Blissey down and is the biggest flaw in pure power. Potions is critical for prestige and cuts Blissey down as well. Release will be out this week. ,TheSilphRoad,dftwz5w,3,t5_3c2d7

11672205,0,t3_66j7ig,The pokemon limit idea falls through on one important thing. Vaporeon.Now I think it is  reasonable to cap most of the gym defenders snorlax blissey dragonite tyranitar even gyrarados will take the average player months to obtain and they likely will only have a few.But the fact is that when you start doing gyms you likely dont have those yet. You can easily hit level  before obtaining more then maybe  things on that list. But eevee are plentiful and it only takes a few weeks to get a vaporeon.Basically what I am saying is for me this would make gyms more fun but my lower level more casual friends who only have stuff like vaporeon to stick in would be in trouble. Id say before level  around  of pokemon I had in gyms were vaporeon. I was literally evolving  cp ones just to have more defenders. so yeah this would make gyms more fun but it would result in the same general amount of gyms held by players it would just mean more people are using exeggcutor in place of cp dragonite. ,TheSilphRoad,dgj26yq,3,t5_3c2d7

11682290,0,t3_66nif3,The optimum level for a Blissey is th from the bottom. That means attackers will be able to chop off  prestige before hitting the deterrent. It also means that  in a good gym  the attacker will need to field  different attackers to deal with those defenders and at least one if not two to defeat Blissey. This leaves very little for defeating whatever sits above Blissey assuming there is at least one defender up there. That in turn means that if the gym is at least level  it is unlikely that the attacker will be able to make it all the way through with a single team and will either give up before reaching the bonus or give up before fighting Blissey. The latter is optimal because it means in a level  gym they will need to do at least two  prestige fights before the gym will lose a level. A level  gym they will have to fight three times and if they are studiously avoiding Blissey they will then need to do many  prestige fights to clear out below Blissey. Once Blissey sinks to the bottom it becomes much easier to clear because the odds of reaching the top increase dramatically and once Blissey is gone the rest is likely to fall much quicker. I am describing the optimal strat for attacking this gym one can also attempt to attack the bottom  plus Blissey and then quit which is inefficient but perhaps fun if the attacker has a couple good Machamps to play with. That will likely take more time as well as more potions but people will do what they want even if its not mathematically efficient.On the other side Blissey in the th slot leaves many more options for prestigers who can boost a level  gym quite rapidly at  per run.Edit realized I didnt answer the question. Depending on the local meta you should place a Blissey at about  CP. Hatches start at lt and they will sit too low for prestigers to work maxing gt will sit too high and they will only engage in the defense when the gym is already weak enough that an attacker can run through the whole thing and kick the Blissey out with a minimum number of fights. What you want to do is force an attacker to face Blissey as many times as possible and decide whether to fight it over and over or run away over and over. Fighting a Blissey once or twice is not so bad fighting the same Blissey  times is agony.,TheSilphRoad,dgk7d7l,2,t5_3c2d7

I actually have a few maxed out Exeggutors including one with ConfusionSeed Bomb and another with ConfusionPsychic Psychic is especially a pain to dodge because of the short animation.  It may not have the HP of a Vape but having Confusion as quick attack can make all the difference on defense.  Glad I got a few before they became legacies.

11715265,0,t3_675urh,Abilities would certainly be good to have. Makes for a lot more diversity as otherwise similar pokemon can be good in different situations. A levitating Weezing is meaningfully different to a stench Muk with the same moves.That said they could be done differently to the regular games. If theres no status effects parasect can just be given a different ability or have it do something else  slow down enemy animations or some such. Theres also no reason that they would have to give every pokemon multiple possible abilities. Again it would be nice but if they just all have one that would be ok too.Shedinja would be an interesting case even with abilities. Theres a reason that ground moves dont do no damage on flying types in Go. That is Niantic intentionally didnt want fights where a pokemon is completely invincible with the AI unable to swap into something to respond. So lets say that instead of doing no damage to shedinja nonSE moves become NVE. That wont help as it will still be a one hit KO.Not sure what theyll do but its a decision theyll have to make. Will be interesting to see what happens. I think status effects will be necessary at some point to make it work well though.,TheSilphRoad,dgnydcd,29,t5_3c2d7

11755692,0,t3_67qtzj,Tyranitar has the highest base CP in the game.   Its base CP is hundreds of points above common gym defenders like Gyarados and Rhydon so you can sit at the top of gyms and above tough defenders like Blissey regardless of moveset.If you want to use it as an attacker then BSE is by far the best.  BC is also okay particularly if you are not big on dodging especially not dodging quick moves.  BFB is still better than the vast majority of other good attackers but the lack of STAB and useful typing for fire limits its use cases.If it were me Id power it up to level  and use it as a defender if the balance between IV and candy requirements is acceptable.  For example Id power a  one on level  but I wouldnt power up a  one because Id rather use the high candystardust requirement on one with a better potential. However Id power the same  one from level  to level  since the stardust candy requirment is minor and a  IVs  CP at level  is enough to hold a decent gym position at many gyms in my area.,TheSilphRoad,dgsjcpf,1,t5_3c2d7

In a sense the RNG horror would be creating usable diversity among the players collections rather than screwing them.They really need to start implementing staus effects criticals and special effects so that you could always find a use for the movesets you got.

I was midgrind on my  IV Lapras and getting it to level  when the rebalance hit and nerfed it down from  CP to .  I kept grinding it out anyway because it still is a good attacker against dragonites.  Nothing that was good before the changes was all of a sudden bad maybe just not as good anymore.  The only significant change I saw was that Machamp was all of a sudden pretty good with its new moves so I had to start grinding that again.  Now I have a level  Machamp with counterdynamic punch and if it gets nerfed then no big deal... it has helped me decimate enough blisseys and snorlaxs that it was worth it.The resources arent finite you can get more candies and dust.

I think the logic is that if its harder to prestige it makes it harder to reach lvl  thus it makes it less likely for their mon to be shaved. Usually this happens when whoever puts in the Wobuffet usually has a main account who had a higher cp defender higher up the gym slots. The wobuffet is there to guard their main defending pokemon. While this actually would make it easier for opposing teams to beat the gym valor and instinct in my town has been virtually non existent in the past few months.
