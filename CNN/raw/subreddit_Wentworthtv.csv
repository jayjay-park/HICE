7564771,0,t1_d322nr9,Vals Bea was generally more matured though technically Danielle began playing Bea at a slightly older age than Val did. Not matured in the age sense though matured in Beas general position and outlook  her sense of identity within the prison.

Made the pair of them closer... As for Joan not a single strategy of hers surprises me anymore after we saw what she is capable of doing to herself I think we can presume she will do absolutely whatever she has to however warped in order to regain some semblance of authority. Im worried about the Allie and Bea thing too actually. I hope it doesnt go that way but again Wentworth!Doreen is going to be more annoying than ever next week and in actual fact if Bea does manage to turn things round though I agree its getting to midseason which is traditionally when things seem to get ultra crappy for Bea I hope she lets Doreen fend for herself away from the group in future actually. Shes totally defied her now so I say that should be a permanent bye bye.I dont really have any specific thoughts on Jakes sexuality but I think hes clearly going to be a charmer before we see his nasty side with the looks of things...,Wentworthtv,d3zt0t1,3,t5_2yjom

With The Walking Dead when I still watched I also guided myself with Loris pregnancy and how old baby Judith is now time passes really slow on that show even if its been on air since  yet no more than  years and a half passed up to where I watched.With Wentworth I have no kids to guide myself or anything at all if Debbie still lived thatd be the best way to tell but she left us pretty early RIP.,Wentworthtv,d58roz8,2,t5_2yjom

8416413,0,t3_4uvggo,I hope theyll only spend a couple of eps on The Freak and that neither Allie or anyone else will have to kill her. Maybe shell be sent to psych never to be seen again...I think Frankys storyline will continue outside of prison. And that well see her and Bridget some more. Sonia gonna fuck shit up but I dont know if shell aim for top dog position. Maybe shell do Kaz a favor and have one up on her or something. I dont think Allie will go the same route as Bea. I think shell be helplessly lost for a while but maybe not back on drugs as she made a promise to Bea. I hope that she and Franky will meet at some point. Maybe Franky will help her with her case? Jake and his shit will probably continue to be a general threat to everyone around him  both prisoners and guards.  ,Wentworthtv,d5tlfdi,3,t5_2yjom

8438985,0,t1_d5vxxi4,This is true. Vals exit was partly logistical and the writers attempted to entice her back several times apparently before finally and clumsily randomly announcing that Bea had died in I think episode  literally as many episodes since shed been on the screen. Making allowances for the general feel of the original show however I still say Beas exit could have been more dramatic and interesting even if at the time the writers didnt want to write her out with death because they hoped to reconcile with Val.,Wentworthtv,d5weule,1,t5_2yjom
8439025,0,t1_d5werk0,Yes she does seem to have lost a little weight although I dont know true this is but apparently most people look bigger on screen?.

8466673,0,t3_4vlv96,Thats funny as I was just thinking about this the other day ... trying to put two and two together re Joans apparent psychic ability re Veras actions with her mother.  I wondered if her mother had told Joan  in this scene  that Vera had once stood over her with a pillow in her hands seemingly ready to smother her so she could go out on the razz with Smiles ...

8486621,0,t3_4vy7fi,Hmm. ...Franky? Well the freak is already going away to prison now all but guaranteed...and reds friends werent the violent types. It would have to be allie and she might try to get Kazs help or Franky. Or Franky and Allie. Maybe even some minor help from Jackson or bad Jake if shes a prisoner at Wentworth. Jake is not going to be pleased at owing a prisoner one... assuming she has blackmail info on him and since he killed jasper I assume she has plenty. So he might try to help get her killed if he thinks its definitely going to happen. ,Wentworthtv,d62dgw2,1,t5_2yjom

8566951,0,t1_d6cfugj,Jake is definitively not smart enough to know Sonia completely agree. It was a total plot progression that he got away with having his brains blown out on his postnightclub walk home in the finale. Divide and conquer. As Sonia is escorted from the brawler and in to the yard prison basket in hand she briefly appears extremely surprised by the presence of somebody in the yard. While the majority have a joke in regards to her expensive clothes etc Joan is decidedly quiet but briefly has her trademark underhanded smirk. Its only a hunch but watch it back. It could work for the two of them to be connected to the same shady characters somewhere along the line. ,Wentworthtv,d6cg5rf,1,t5_2yjom
8683009,0,t1_d6ql0h9,Completely agree and I am hoping it happens next season. Why would they greet Bea with gifts if they werent at least vaguely familiar with her?

Theres probably a fairly predictable clash between her and Kaz in terms of the drug flow I would imagine but I am hoping something more comes of Sonia beyond the whole getting fairly transparently quizzed by Liz thing. Im not really sure where Doreen Boomer and Maxine have left to go really unless they adopt Allie in to the pack either way it seems they might be something of a supporting act for a while... Im presuming well probably see more of the other red right hand girls which Im a little bit dubious about. Will have to see how it goes. ,Wentworthtv,d6zbw8y,1,t5_2yjom

9030003,0,t3_53lwva,The thing is as others have said Bea and Jacqs are two entirely different characters. Jacqs Holt was a mob wife who did anything and everything to protect not just her family but the family money. Jacqs was already a cold heartless woman before she entered WW as shown in a flashback she brutally beat a man with a crow bar in front of her own child to prove a point amongst other reasons of course. Bea Smith was a woman who was violently abused by her husband pushed to her absolute limit the only way she thought she could escape her husband was to kill him. Bea was a loving caring woman and it wasnt until she entered WW that she underwent major changes. I believe the changes Bea went through were situational  had she never gone to WW she would not have become the woman she was whereas Jacqs was always the woman she was when we were introduced to her. In all honesty stating the two are the same doesnt fly with me though I of course respect and understand the reasons behind this post and have enjoyed reading everyones thoughts! I suppose I look at Bea as someone who was forced adapt to her surroundings as she made abundantly clear she never actually wanted to be top dog whereas for Jacqs there was no alternative. The motivations behind Jacqs actions were always selfish for herself and no one else. And as misguided as Bea may have been at times she truly was trying to make WW a safe as possible environment. ,Wentworthtv,d7x9i9d,5,t5_2yjom
9092722,0,t1_d84sian, min man between this and the Kate J and Nicole interview they run long compared to stuff US actors can get away with ill have to put a pin in it and watch it soon.regarding Bea wanting to be evil i mean it seemed like the natural course of events. like i said prison corrupted her to a very considerable extent in not so long. Should she have stayed longer it would have been interesting to see her go from the good guy at the start to the bad guy with a new rotating cast until perhaps the last season where liz dors booms frankie and max are all gone and shes the bad guy for a new protag.

The end scene with her and Joan I just thought it was so easy for Joan to take the sharp tool off Bea. She took it out of her hand like a piece of cake  there was no struggle in it at all. Fair enough she has done fencing but they made it look like Bea didnt even stand a chance with her. She could of put up some sort of fight to me it was an easy victory for Joan in some kind of way.

I knew she was guilty but its brilliant how were finally seeing how calculating she is. She planned to kill the detective even before he asked about her husband.
