14744,0,t1_ceg3f6h,I know this is all opinion but Cutler Tannehill Russell Romo and Stafford are about on par with Bradford if not worse. People seem to be high on Kaepernick and Newton but IMO I would rather have Sam due to their lack of consistency.I would say Rodgers Manning Brady Brees  Roethlisberger Luck and maybe Foles are clearly better than Sam at this point. To address the original point I dont think its necessary or in the Rams plans to take a QB in the first round. I wouldnt be opposed to them taking a mid round pick on a developmental type though.

2003093,0,t3_2ho50v,I was newer as a fan to the franchise before they moved.My dad on the other hand has been a fan of Rams since the late s. He recalls the move with some sadness and a little anger since he found even the Rams fans would boo the Rams during home games near the end attendance was terrible as well. He just says it was a shitty situation.The conditions arent that different. Bad stadium bad attendance lackluster record. St. Louis needs to work some kind of program to get the people on board. Losing the Rams at this point might spell the end of Football in St. Louis for a long long time since both the football Cardinals AND the Rams havehad generally terrible attendance. The sports fans are obviously there but theyre too deeply rooted in baseball.Just as a side thought though there are major problems the Rams would have to overcome even if they did move. With no team in LA its unofficial Raiders  Chargers territory. Neither Spanos or Davis would be thrilled to have another franchise set up shop near by and would probably fight pretty fiercely to keep them out. The plot of land that Kroenke bought is a little small for a stadium. More land would have to be purchased and near by plots would jump in value if a stadium was inbound.One of the dark horses heh in all of this is the Chargers. Its been quiet league wide but theyre also having trouble getting a new stadium Qualcomm stadium is showing its age. As moves go a  miles up the road isnt so bad nor is it a complete market change.

Its a nice benefit to have time to let the situation play out before making a final call on Bradford. Usually guys have like March  roster bonuses that force teams to make premature decisions.

4153903,1,t3_389ops,I listened to his interview today and its made me even more certain that this stadium deal is pretty much dead. His points both in this article and in the interview are absurd to anybody whos objective and knows the situation. He sounds like hes grasping at straws.gtI dont hear Sen. Schaaf complaining about us investing in the Kansas City Chiefs practice facility in St. Joseph or Rep. Parkinson upset about the Family Arena near his district Nixon said.This is a prime example. Nixon isnt an idiot he knows that the practice facility in St. Joseph not only cost a small fraction of what this stadium will it was also part of funds everybody agrees Nixon has the power to use. In fact those same funds are part of this stadium deal and exactly zero people have complained about it. Bringing up Family Arena is somehow even more absurd. Im too lazy to look up Parkinsons district but judging by the near in his statement that arenas not even in their district and its in the St. Louis area. Just from this statement alone it should speak volumes that Parkinson was in favor of one arena while opposed to this stadium both of which are near but not in his district.In his interview he said something likegt We have the best bond experts looking at this.That is possible the single most damning statement in this whole process. He said that several times but never quite bridged the gap between looking and agree we are allowed to do this. Again hes not dumb. He didnt just forget or speak poorly. These experts must have bad news for him or at best they havent come to any conclusions yet.If hes so sure this lawsuit is a waste of time and that hes going to win for sure why waste his time doing these interviews defending himself? Surely once the court comes back with his victory thats all that needs to be said. In reality its dead and he knows it hes just putting up enough of a front to make it seem like he tried and win political points in St. Louis. He knows the representatives outside of St. Louis are going to laugh in his face if he asks for this funding and no reasonable person could really believe the terms of the bonds allow him to build the riverfront stadium without a vote.,StLouisRams,crtrb31,-2,t5_2v44q

Its the same business model thats been done before in STL and the same model underway in Atlanta Minneapolis and other NFL stadiums across the U.S. Itd be disingenuous to say the RSA is telling the Rams who they will sell tickets to without any choice as if theyre being forced upon them rather the Rams Organization is being provided consumers of their product by a partnering third party. Note that PSL Holders have first rights to buy tickets based on the seats for which they hold licenses. Should a PSL Holder not exercise their first rights of purchase the box office can sell those seats corresponding tickets to whomever they like.This also is subject to change as a framework should the Rams Organization choose to cooperatively work with the RSA should negotiations take place in the future.,StLouisRams,csvmbss,1,t5_2v44q

Its not  million its the  million that Peacock has been trying to find something to guarantee the bonds to. The  million is more like  and  million is more like . The plan is to use those amusement taxes to pay off that  million in bonds but the NFL views that as their money because their product produces the taxes. I personally think this argument is BS but thats how the NFL views it.Heres an article he wrote a while ago that mentions it. the key paragraphsgtNot only is St. Louis tapping into the naming rights deal  or team revenue  to pay part of its portion its then using team revenue in the form of gameday tax rebates to pay it back.gtWhen viewed through an NFL lens the  million should count as team money which brings the private contribution to  million.gtAs a result what St. Louis currently sees as a  million dollar private to  million dollar public split the NFL sees as a  million private to  million dollar public split.,StLouisRams,cxt3squ,5,t5_2v44q

I havent heard that Ive heard they have most of the LA committee supports them as well as old guard members but a lot of new guard owners are backing Stan. I think that the majority of the members are neutral waiting for guidance from everyone else. Also the problem with blocking Stan from moving to LA that doesnt guarantee to keep the Rams in St Louis. They cannot force Kroenke into signing that deal and there are indications that he will not. Even if he was denied LA he could up and move the Rams to another city. If Kroenke is a poor sport as some are led to believe why would he decide to spend a bunch of his money for a deal that isnt very friendly? Theres already precedence that suggest he would win that battle in court and he is apparently more than willing to go that route. Perhaps not with LA because it would be harder to win that fight if there are two teams there although Davis did with the Rams already in LA before and honestly not really worth it but another city?

Same time for their sake I hope Im not the one entrusted with throwing the life raft out in the first place. Props to Bidwell though for being proSTL NFL for the recent past. It was to a large degree STLs culpability that he relocated to AZ. The regions political leaders never took his threat that seriously and fought across political lines for a lot of it. Plus this was not a time of big franchise relocations only the Colts were precedent and they were thought a oneoff event. Only after the Cardiac Cardinals relocated did the specter of franchise relocation truly emerge. He set the trend so many others have followed Rams Raiders Oilers Browns. Today his son is the head of the franchise and hes fully supportive of STLs efforts to retain the Rams. Ill give them credit for that. But the anger and loathing Bill Bidwell fostered is not to be taken lightly and theyre the reason so many people who were around at that time have been gun shy throughout this past year.

Some Pats fans are celebrating St Louis losing their team because the two greatest players of your championship era are still propagating the myth about the filming of walkthroughs even after that fictitious story was retracted years ago. I personally dont care to see the Rams move from St Louis but what does this fanbase expect from Pats fans? Solidarity?
