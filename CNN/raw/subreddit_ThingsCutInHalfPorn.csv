Given the fact that this plane was developed in  by Kelly Johnson he probably would have taken that into account given his long and successful career in designing aircraft. If you do not believe me look at the Wikipedia article for him regarding the aircraft he helped design and build. He can be named for a list of people that have stopped WW and who helped win WW. The P alone could make him a successful designer given the fact that the  highest scoring US aces of WW flew it the Germans called it the fork tooth devil the germans hated it the Japanese called it  planes  pilot and the abilities the plane had in being a true multi role aircraft.This is the actual citation from his medal of freedom   Aeronautical engineer his genius for conceiving unique airframes and his technical management skills contribute mightily to the Nations security by creating aircraft of daring design with unmatched rapidity and effectiveness.Here is a article about him. ,ThingsCutInHalfPorn,co8t96h,2,t5_2xtgm

3217294,0,t3_2wzet3,This is my attempt at a reasonably accurate internal configuration view of Putins enigmatic spy sub.Normal submarines are essentially cylindrical. But to dive really deep making the hull spherical can be stronger. So whilst the Losharik looks like a regular cigar shaped submarine on the outside it is actually made up of multiple titanium orbs hidden within a streamlined casing. Thats how it gets its name which is from a puppet horse in Russia which is made out of beads on rope.Satellite imagery analysis reveals that there are  circular orbs inside the hull for the crew to live in. So even though the submarine isnt small the living space will be tiny. Obviously theres no real way of knowing the arrangement inside the spheres although we can make reasonable guesses as to the general arrangement. See descriptions on illustration.

Youre slowing from about ish mph to terminal velocity at a parachute altitude which I dont know off the top of my head but lets say mph over a number of minutes maybe  minutes. My guess is that it would be uncomfortable but yes. The human body has a design that best supports the weight when youre in your feet your ass or your back. But you can take some weight of you were putting your weight on your head and shoulders or on your chest. Theres a reason that astronauts are in good shape they use their muscles to aid their skeletons to bear the weight so they can keep breathing when theres a weight on their chests and compress their abdomens to help keep blood in their heads to avoid blackout. Theres no similar maneuver to help avoid redout as blood rises to their heads in negative G. The heart works harder to move blood in any increased G load too. I think theyd lose some senses vision orientation but would stay conscious. I think it would suck enough that it wouldnt catch on as a sport like that but in a survival situation Id guess without the expertise necessary to be certain that they would live but be useless to control their decent. ,ThingsCutInHalfPorn,d7j0mol,4,t5_2xtgm
