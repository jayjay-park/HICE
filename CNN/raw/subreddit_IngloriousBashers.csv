383131,0,t1_cfjj0jh,I dont like the idea of completly abandonning last season. I can see  ways of doing the drafts Randomize the MLB draft and reverse the order for the prospect draft. Reverse of last year standings for the MLB draft low to high and reverse order for the prospect draft. Last year winner choose its position in the MLB draft high to low and reverse order for the prospect draft.Id prefer the third option because it adds a layer of strategy.I like your last point it might encourage trade but at the same time if the guy is called up at the begining of the season because a player is injured and then reach  or  and get sent down at allstar break because the other guy is back in the lineup that creates a lot of stress on an owners lineup. I guess we can give it a shot for a year and see if we like it or not.,IngloriousBashers,cfkh65m,3,t5_2wayb
