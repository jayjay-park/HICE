1501189,0,t3_2be8ko,I love me some Endicott. The variaty of layouts has me throwing a lot of different shots I dont get to try on other courses. The shade is nice on hot days too.Ive only played Creve Coeur once but I did enjoy it. Plus its only like  minutes from the new Gateway store so you can restock your bag on your way there.,StLouisDiscGolf,cj4g4sc,2,t5_31lyf
