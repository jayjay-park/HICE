4216928,0,t1_cs0mtoe,gt LoS will not fail because only half their content is behind a paywall but they will not be benefitting from the growth they would have experienced doing two shows for everybody every week. How are you suggesting this growth would have come about just by releasing two shows? Why arent other podcasts releasing two shows if that leads to growth? In fact some of the podcasts you mentioned release slower than  show a week! Radiolab releases roughly every two weeks. Twice as slow. If releasing more free podcasts perweek is what leads to growth why dont they do that? Why is Radiolab releasing half as many shows?Growth in podcasts happens with exposure. Exposure is mainly due to wordofmouth. People talk to their friends tweetfacebookreddit links to the podcast. People also  give downloadshitsratings on itunes which raises their profile even more.The point of joining TACS is that it immediately gives them presumably thousands of new subscribers and gives them access to new facilities compound and upcoming studio in NYC and guests friends of TACS like Jim Norton and Gavin. All of that leads to more exposure. The traffic on the subbreddit has increased because of that.Releasing two podcasts a week for free doesnt give them that. The only way it would help their growth is if the people who were already subscribing were to say Hey I normally wouldnt recommend this podcast at oneshowperweek... but because its now twoshowsperweek Ill start recommending it. I doubt thats a common scenario. Most people who would recommend the show already have or were already going to because of how funny it is regardless of the number of shows perweek.,LegionOfSkanks,cs0ww0b,5,t5_32qkq

Jay is the funniest in my opinion and quick as fuck with quality stuff. Luis has kind of become the whipping boy which he publicly acknowledged but this is extremely important as we get so many laughs from people doing luis voice or trashing him. Dave is the opinionated politicomic type which provides a nice balance. The chemistry they have is due to them being actual friends and it shows check out a YKWD with random guests the convos dont flow well people dont know each other well enough trash each other youll see what i do. Their senses of humor are similar dark. The show just works so well for me atleast and its due to so many variables that these three bring to the table which equate to the LOS we know and love. Idk whats up with fans of OnA LOS etc that consistently trash the show and hosts but continue to listen its common on the web comments everywhere.

When I was a kid ages  I was a road carney family business and road  the small townsborder towns of  midwest state. Because its supposed to be a fun thing for the public the jerkoffs in the crowd would have their fun by doing stupid things onaround potentially dangerous equipment according to the insurance rates. We would call those people worse names than civilian. I frequent the internet and there are a lot of jerkoffs who have the nerve to question comedians for not always being funny on radiopodcasts. I dont care what X comedian thinks about Y make me laugh! Dance monkey! Im smart too! Monkey! Jerkoffs. Id be inclined to question the thinskin of fans who are offended when comedians refer to the audience as civilians. Particularly the ones who know that they simply offer their opinions about shows. The ones who dont aim personal insults at people they dont know. Its probably bad politics to refer to fans as civilians since your business is entirely dependent on having fans.

10079142,0,t1_dbladgk,I think we are very aware hes a phony and just tells lie after lie. I have no problem with nigger talk lol. But when the ghetto shit hes saying is not only dumb as fuck but doesnt make a lick of sense or cause me to crack a smile except in utter disbelief that Im listening to someone that is a so called comedian. Most everyones offended that a he sucked and wasnt funny and b he was easily the most disrespectful out of control and drunk piece of trash thats been on there. And hey Im a piece of trash too. But my stories all have punch lines and at least make my friends crack up. ,LegionOfSkanks,dblbzrv,1,t5_32qkq

11373144,0,t1_dfl3r93,Hes been a lot more... unfunny  irate about guns before on YKWD andor LOS IIRC.  He had a real anger moment over gun ownership but I dont remember exactly when or what show.  It wasnt TWS though.  I know that because I cant listen to a podcast that sounds like a persons split personality talking to itself.  Love them both apart cant listen to them together.Doesnt matter though that wasnt the point.  My point is I want to give Joe a big ol close hug and pat him on the back and make shhhhhh noises and maybe sing him a gentle song.,LegionOfSkanks,dfl4iie,4,t5_32qkq
