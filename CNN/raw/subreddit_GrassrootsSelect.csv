Donald Norcross while technically a Democrat has voted with the Republicans many times  He is also part of the biggest political machine in NJ  Along with having a pay to play system in the district  I am not doing this to throw dirt on Donald I am simply showing what EVERYONE in the district knows to be true.Alex has zero paid staffers but has well over  volunteers and is not accepting money from big money interests or help from Super Pacs. These volunteers include Republicans Muslims people from outside the district many high school kids baby boomers and people who are offering whatever help they can without exposing their support for fear of repercussions. People from all walks of life are coming together to help Alex because they know he is not just more of the same NJ politics. Q. Campaign finance reform is always at the top of the list of issues. Sustainable energy criminal justice reform single payer healthcare fight for  free public university and just as importantly lowering the interest rates on existing loans are just some of the many issues Alex is passionate about.As to Q If youll excuse me Im not sure exactly what you are asking. Can you clarify.And as to the campaign chair endorsing Donald Norcross that seems to be part of the unfortunate reality of NJ establishment politics.

The organization itself is there to help direct volunteer work in developing materials and outside stuff. Like there is an insane amount of stuff that happens. rSandersforpresident is the same they have a central structure that pushes direction.Without this organizational structure we wouldnt be able to develop the materials we will the outreach machine we will have the planning for how to best help candidates etc. This is much bigger than a subreddit.All big comments about the project on reddit have been discussed each time by our leadership team. For instance we had a post recently about the definition of grassroots. We are still discussing that and will discuss with you all too. It takes a lot of planning though and a bunch of people posting on a subreddit wont change something even rsandersforpresident has a structure.But please dont get it wrong that we dont listen and that we censor everything. We want people to join in and offer suggestions. Thats what we are about. We are a grassroots group this central team is only there to help build this and ensure everything we could do is done well and with a larger plan.Currently we are working on building a reddit team and improving our reddit so that there is more communication and awareness of what is going on. ,GrassrootsSelect,d0nwwdc,3,t5_39jv9
