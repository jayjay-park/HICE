Also there is always wasted DPS when a cube is about to be destroyed especially with the particle ball. If a cube only has hp left and you do  damage to it then  damage is just lost. Plus a multiprojectile weapon gets weaker when there are fewer enemies than projectiles.I think this offline equation still works okay.,TimeClickers,cpmld5l,1,t5_36xu0

3658084,0,t1_cq95fb7,I did try that out earlier today but due to lack of programming experience unpatience and lack of a proper tutorial I cant seem to make it work. Every tutorial is about auto log in bots og message boxes. And because of my programming inexperience Im not even sure if writing my own script would be worth all of the time I have to put into it.But thanks for the tip. ,TimeClickers,cq98wkp,1,t5_36xu0

3698712,0,t3_32r0sh,The most annoying thing about this game by far is how the weapons get significant slower every time you do a major upgrade.Its actually extremely frustrating.,TimeClickers,cqdvm4w,7,t5_36xu0

3774752,0,t3_32zwdz,The bonus is not mediocre when you look at the stats though as well in addition to what khoitrinh said every time you use dimension shift it multiplies the dps modifier by . so the first time it is . the second . to . . etc so therefore when you get increasingly long games the bonus becomes exponential making it invaluable late game which was its intent,TimeClickers,cqmjsjk,1,t5_36xu0
