8592843,0,t3_4xghv6,rbuildapc is the sub you wantYou can get spoonfed a build there but youll end up with a better build if you do your own research and learn what parts will be best for you.I know the feeling of wanting it now I certainly had that but I couldnt be happier that I waited a couple months and knew exactly what I wanted when I felt confident enough to start buying parts.  If I just posted my budget and let others pick my parts I would have ended up with a totally different PC that didnt fit my needs nearly as well as what I have built now.  I really couldnt have a more perfect PC for me personally.,BuildAPCSalesMeta,d6fp2ee,1,t5_3aukp

8818214,0,t1_d769v5c,Yeah good luck man. If the fix is as easy as swapping the PSU cable to the one designated could be more than  you have to check the PSU specs and all that information then great. Just remember PCIE ports on a PSU are for graphics cards. Yeah it works for other things but new gfx cards require  PCIE ports the  FTWs for example. Some of the s require  lol.And dont buy from cyberpower. Most prebuilt computer companies suck ass unless youre paying for absolutely the best shit like Falcon Northwest which means you also played an extra  or way more so that they dont fuck it up. Go to buildapc and ask those guys to help you pick parts for your budget etc.,BuildAPCSalesMeta,d77tv2i,1,t5_3aukp

9216008,0,t3_56hr0z,I wrote this response here Its a slightly different laptop but the situation is the same.gtSo I have some bad news.gtFor an eGPU to work you need a PCIe connector. That means Thunderbolt Express Card etc. USB is not only too slow its just plain incompatible. Its like trying to plug in your mouse into the HDMI port.But there is a way to use an eGPU with your X Yoga. Its not practical and I dont think its worth it. If you open up your laptop youll notice that the WiFi card is connected via a miniPCIe slot. There are adapters that will allow you to connect a fullsized PCIe component to a mPCIe slot. Thats your only option.gtThat said the cheapest nonproprietary eGPU dock costs . And in order for this to work properly you need to connect it to an outlet and a separate monitor you can use your laptops monitor but expect around half the performance.  is enough for an i  motherboard  memory  storage  case  PSU so you might as well just build a desktop. Its not like you can carry the eGPU dock and a monitor around with you anyway.,BuildAPCSalesMeta,d8k7406,1,t5_3aukp
