3979108,0,t1_cr9d9av,I think its important to note that this is what we WERE doing and weve decided its best to scale back the practice of giving free passes solely to those who have earned it.Up til this policy was instituted we were putting anyone whose posts were on topic who got shadowbanned in the whitelist. These were almost exclusively fashion bloggers who have their blogs on autopilot. Now were reserving the whitelist ONLY for consistent high quality news bloggers.Were talking about posts like the SS Galaxy shutting down posts like new viewer release notes SL user statistics new features coming to SL changes in LL staffing the SS Galaxy being acquired by Linden Lab announcements of applications for SLB you get the idea. Sometimes these posters do post more casual content product reviews event announcements etc but they keep producing the news posts all the time.In the best case scenario every shadowbanned poster would figure out the issue and feel terribly embarrassed get their accounts unbanned and join a bunch of subreddits and suddenly become involved redditors who somehow avoided getting shadowbanned while still being able to share their stuff with us. for the record the rule seems to be  of your posts need to come from different domain urls.Thats not really very likely to happen on any level. But most especially for the people weve whitelisted who sometimes post multiple articles per day. Imagine uInaraPey trying to come up with x more links every day to share than blog posts.This is really our best compromise solution.. Weve removed  of the people we were whitelisting and reduced that number to just  people now.Now were letting MOST shadowbanned people fall into the trash we try to notify them that they are shadowbanned and try to help them fix their account and do better next time. The people who make it onto the whitelist are the rarest of rare exceptions. I can only think of  possible people Id push for whitelisting and as far as I know Draxtor and Torley arent even on Reddit.The fashion bloggers the gacha photographers the club owners the RP sims and real estate folks etc.. If they can manage a working balance between sharing their stuff and not crossing Reddits definition of Spam then good for them. If not... its their problem. The only reason were gonna step in is if itd be an actual detriment to the community if someones posts were silenced.,secondlife,cr9unxe,3,t5_2qiaj

4305984,0,t3_3ab5tq,It really doesnt matter what viewer you use! ltputs on viewer dev hatgtMovement and physics are server side. The viewer is dumb as rocks it only knows something because the server tells it directly.You press up on the keyboard the viewer tells the region you did the region decides what happens and then tells you and everyone around the outcome.The region updates the users typically    times a second depending on the region performance and load. Busy and it will be lower.The viewer interpolates positioning updates from the server so no one is ever quite where you think they are. Rubber banding is when the viewer has guessed wrong and has to correct an avatars position.Weapons in SL tend to work by rezzing a bullet and then using physics to fling that forward and colliding it with an avatar. Again this is all done server side and is very dependant on region conditions it could easily be that your bullet gets added much later than you hope and the target avatar is no where near where you see them anyway.All viewers work this way and the code that does all this is pretty core stuff. It will be identical between all the TPV projects.Your local frame rate has nothing to do with anything in this world... do you really want to be playing a twitch based FPS game at   variable  fps and not being able to trust your own aim because no one is where you think they are and your bullets lagging even further behind?To get a better idea of what Im talking about Untick  Develop Menu any viewer gt Network gt Velocity Interpolate Objects and go for a wander on a few of your favourite sims. ,secondlife,csb0czt,3,t5_2qiaj

Needless to say I blocked him  though he succeeded in freaking me out for the rest of the night.Dont get me wrong I know people have kinks and stuff and by all means if it makes you happy have at it.

5076608,0,t3_3khp3q,Well youve chosen one of the most fun but unfortunately oversaturated vocations in SL which means you wont make to much but its still worth it and a blast once you start gaining a fanbase.Youre music library should be the first thing on your list. Make sure you have plenty of new hits old favorites and dont be afraid to throw in some of your personal picks in from time to time. Obviously you have to cater to the audience.SAM broadcaster was the software most if not all DJs were using a few years ago when I was an active DJ in SL. Download it get familiar with it even bring up a few tutorials on how to properly use it.Next step by a stream. There wasis a great vendor I cant recall the name of in which you can rent a stream for a dayweekmonth. Most clubs have their own but its always good to have your own in case of impromptu DJ opportunities or even if youre having people on a piece of land you own. I used to have a separate studio I would use for applying to new places helping new djs and interviewing.last few things I recommend. A strong fast internet connection for downloading requests on the go a microphone will help separate you from some generic DJs who dont use one at all and if possible a second monitor to manage your music and your ingame avatar.That should get you started let me know if you need anything else and also my advice might be a little dated.
