4408489,0,t1_csmbsgt,Yes especially with Ninja and Emperor coming out strong for TDK any wins to put distance between autorelegation are very important. From what Ive gathered scrims are going much better than what we see in some of the more chaotic LCS games. Im confident that theyll be able to identify any issues and smooth things out!,Team8,csmkl3l,1,t5_33al3
