17423,0,t3_1uajcu,That looks fantastic but theres just something about the flat cases with elastic strap retainers that turns me off.  I bought a beautiful cover from Oberon Designs for my Nook and while the leather is amazing and beautiful and wonderful to touch I just always felt like the nook was floating between two sheet of leather instead of actually being encased much like this design.  With my Paperwhite I bought the official Kindle cover which actually encloses the device and I just like that style much better even though the leather isnt nearly as nice.But maybe thats just me....,kindle,cegf0w3,5,t5_2qudz

Even after using smartphones Im simply not as accurate on a touchscreen keyboard compared to a physical one. Predictive text definitely helps but for me its more of a help for speed instead of accuracy since I use a fair amount of abbreviations and other things not generally in device dictionaries when taking notes.I do also find it more comfortable to hold my kindle with my thumb resting partially on the bottom corner of the screen about how I hold paper books with my thumb sticking into the page slightly and annoyingly I had some issues with this when I tried out the paperwhite at bestbuy a while back. ,kindle,cjc2vxz,1,t5_2qudz

2075933,0,t3_2ing3b,These questions are kind of related! My favorite way to get Calibre books on my Kindle is to email them to my free.kindle.com address set up in your Kindle settings on your Amazon account page. This adds the book to your cloud library where it can be downloaded to any of your other devices such as the Kindle app for smartphones and syncs your last page read as well as notes and bookmarks regardless of which device youre using at the time.And on that note MOBI is an acceptable format for free.kindle.com emailing while AZW is not. AZW is capable of more complex formatting than MOBI though so if you see a book go from beautiful too crazy when you convert it in Calibre you may need to see if it works better in AZW and transfer it to your Kindle via USB.,kindle,cl3p2s0,5,t5_2qudz

2200045,0,t3_2kakbd,Thanks this is helpful. I have a couple of suggestions though. You switched the sides they were on at one point I think because  the PW case opens to the left instead of up and I only noticed because the cases were different. You did mention R in the text but I didnt realize what that meant until after I noticed the case color reversal. Also it would be nice to see the same page on both kindles rather than the beginning of a chapter on one and a full page of text on the other. It is hard to tell what the same thing would look like on both versions given the difference in what is shown. I did not like that the first picture has one of them standing and the other laying down. It makes the screen on the one that is laying down look very dark. I did find the post informative though!

Even if its embedded using a basic img tag produces odd results hence the use of the more obscure svg tag.  Plus each device handles covers differently and some publishers cant be bothered to work out the method that works universally.Heres what works for me edit the metadata in Calibre and download a large pic so it will look good even on a PC or tabletideally x convert the book to mobi if its already a mobi convert it again and select Structure Detection Insert metadata as page at start of book. email the book to your Kindle address or sideload via USB,kindle,co7ccjx,5,t5_2qudz

4173718,0,t3_38hfk4,I have a K and a knockoff of the official amazon lighted cover that I got on ebay for like .Its amazing. I love my K those page turn buttons but without the cover I feel like its really lacking.Just do what I did. Look up the official lighted case on Amazon then go to ebay and buy the closest thing you can find for rd the price. Those official covers are amazing but theyre way overpriced IMO.For the record when I got my K it was  I think it was ages ago and the official cover was ... Not willing to pay that premium for a cover no matter how awesome it is.EDIT Just looked up the official Kindle Touch case on Amazon and its literally identical to the K case except the K case has cutouts on the sides for the pageturn buttons. Ebay is full of them. They even use the battery in your Kindle to power the LED so you dont need to buy batteries or anything and I havent noticed any appreciable hit to the battery life its literally just one tiny but bright LED.DOUBLE EDIT Here I found one for you  . w free shipping. Thats literally identical to the listing I bought mine from with one exception  mine has the word kindle embossed on the outside and again on the inside like the official cover. Heres a short video that gives you a better idea of how it workslooks.I got the brown one  it doesnt lookfeel nearly as cheap as the pics will lead you to believe. I had that concern when I ordered and was pleasantly surprised. Its obviously not real leather but also doesnt have that plastic feel some really cheap fake leather products have. Also its a lot smoother than it looks in the pics but still gives a good grip. The inside is a soft microfibre kind of material that wont scratch your kindle and feels really nice when youre holding it with the cover folded all the way back.Dont even bother looking for alternatives unless you buy the official case... I know Im just a guy on the internet but Im picky about these things and unless there are huge swings in quality issues from casetocase heh that cover is guaranteed to be awesome. If I had one minor complaint its that the light is very white not hard on the eyes in any sense. I wish it had a warmer colour temperature and was a bit yellowish but its more than good enough and thats just a personal preference.,kindle,crw0edz,2,t5_2qudz

Speaking to Amazon Kindle Support on the phone she said I would get a prorated refund then reading About Kindle Unlimited PrePaid Subscriptions it says you would not get any refund so very conflicting information..From link aboveYou can cancel a prepaid subscription at any time. However you will not receive a partial refund for any unused months and you cannot restart the prepaid subscription later..Back to calling Amazon. . FOLLOW UP .Spoke to another Amazon Kindle Support agent if you want to cancel your prepaid youre not going to get a refund. She first started off saying that I would get a credit on Amazon to use but after I pointed out the conflicting information she took a number of minutes to review something and came back agreeing that there in fact would be no refund issued. .So unless you know and love Unlimited Kindle this may not be the best option for some.

6757883,0,t1_d0i5rl4,gt edit Nah I dont think we are talking about a Paperwhite. I got this Kindle when I started my undergrad studies way back in . The deets on the device say its Kindle .. so I assume its a th gen. If youre not using a Paperwhite or Voyage then it doesnt matter  your device doesnt have any kind of light whatsoever. Even the two models that do have light are frontlit rather than back lit so its basically just a builtin book light.Since theres no light itll be no better or worse than reading a paper book before bed. If you want to be really strict about sleep hygiene you can just get an orange bulb and put it in a lamp next to where you read making it so that theres no blue light when youre reading. That would work.Another alternative which takes some getting used to but is pretty great if you can adjust is to use a headlamp with a red or orange light in it. They sell them for people who are outdoors at night and dont want to lose their nightvision so theyre not too hard to find.In terms of avoiding blue light its not particularly better or worse than an orangered bulb  just if you dont happen to already have a lamp or if the bulbs you find arent bright enough to help with the screen it might be cheaper.Failing all that orange goggles also work well if you dont have glasses.,kindle,d0ibl7y,2,t5_2qudz

9282896,0,t3_57ikjz,I asked this exact question when I had my keyboard model before its broke it. What I ended up doing was getting a cheap but nice note books at a local craft store Elmers glue an exacto knife and some plastidip. I traced the kindles shape centered on the top page after having glued the pages together with the Elmers glue. Once the glue dried enough I began hollowing the pages in the shape of my kindle cutting just inside the traced line and checking with the kind as I went for depth and to confirm it would fit snugly inside the cutout. Once it was deep enough for the book to close completely I cut access for the power and USB cord out of the bottom. With all my cuts made I then applied more Elmers glue to the inside of the pages and the access cut out. Once the glue was cured and I was happy with the hold of the pages I masked off the cover and anything else I didnt want plastidipped and sprayed the pages with about  thin layers of plastidip over the course of a few hours and left it to cure over night. Lastly I added an elastic strap to hold the cover closed when the Kindle is not in use. This produced the least expensive and best case I could possibly have asked for and make the Kindle feel more like a book which was a fantastic added bonus. I highly recommend this method as even though its time consuming it resulted in a superior product and for far less than most of the cases that even slightly peaked my interest. ,kindle,d8soafk,1,t5_2qudz

I can shut down everything else and leave that going.I wonder if I can access my Kindle Unlimited ... guess Ill find out. We need Windows Phone users to complain to Amazon. They think there are only  of us out here because they listen to the Apple lies.Maybe if we could get all Windows Phone users to cancel our Kindle Unlimited Subscriptions on the same day it would get their attention.EDIT I just tried it and it works  somewhat.Ive been having a problem with the Edge browser dropping out and it is really really bad on this site. It keeps dropping to the Start page  Edge just completely shuts down for no apparent reason.There are a few more options using this site. More margin and text size choices.On the plus side it signed me in and found my books just fine. Couldnt ask for more in that regard.The problem with the browser is not new ... it is a problem either with Edge or the phone or Windows . No idea which causes this. Very aggravating.

9540590,0,t1_d9os5me,gtVoyage is better in some ways but I was never convinced enough to justify the extra price. I would say thats accurate. I have a Voyage. Bought it the day it released In fact I was the first person to post a bragging post on this sub about having one lol. I dont regret buying it one little bit I love the thing. That being said I love it because Im a tech guy. I tend to like having the biggest best gadgets. So to me the extra price was well worth it and I still believe it is today. That probably isnt the case for most people though. Most people will probably agree that the Voyages betterextra features arent quite worth the extra cost. It totally makes sense to feel that way.In the end its up to you to decide if the extra cost is worth it. Is the Voyage a better device? Yes. Absolutely. In many ways though most are only slight differences. Is the Voyage  better? Depends on how much you want those slightly betterextra features.,kindle,d9p2r0r,3,t5_2qudz

10739533,0,t3_5tnbsr,gt Amazons guaranteeAmazon honors the Kindle warranty regardless of where you purchase it from unless you purchase it secondhand or from an unauthorized retailer. They usually warranty for one year and begin that year when the device is first registered on their servers. gt remove the special offersYou can have special offers removed from any Kindle by logging in and paying the upgrade fee if youve never had a Kindle before you should try it first A lot of noise is made about the ads but they arent as big of a deal as most people think before theyve seen how it works. ,kindle,ddnp9ve,1,t5_2qudz

10824517,0,t1_ddw6ar1,And unfortunately only about  of the KU books seem to be anything the average person would want to read. I had the KU program for a year and browsed through nearly the whole range of authors and titles in that time. Found maybe half a dozen I was interested in  and Ill read practically anything. Lots of middle volumes out of fivevolume series that kind of thing.Lots of directtoKindle amateur fiction that no commercial publisher would bother with. Much of the point of Kindle Unlimited seem to be to promote firsttime authors. A few authors Ive heard of have made their early work available  the stuff heavy readers have already seen  in order to promote their more recent efforts.I also discovered that the titles available on KU change almost week to week. Several titles I made a note of to try when I finished my current reading were no longer available when I went back to them. I finally let the sub run out and didnt renew it.Kindle Unlimited is a good idea but the implementation is terrible.,kindle,ddwh10y,7,t5_2qudz

10889108,0,t3_5vhux9,I would love a service that combines RSS feeds and PocketInstapaper. I hate having to go to my RSS reader and then again to my Pocket reader. It would be nice to have a service that combines these two lets call it RSSPocket for the sake of the argument. In this service I can subscribe to blogs just like any other RSS readers. However if Im on reddit and I come across an article and I want to read it later I should be able to save it for later and then it shows up in the same feed as all the blogs Ive subscribed to in my RSS reader. So now I have two different services combined RSS and Pocket. If anyone created this I would pay a monthly fee for it. I dont know how much Id pay for this service but I think no more than  per month would be fair.,kindle,de34u1a,2,t5_2qudz

In a bright environment the brighter light improves the contrast of the screen and removes the grayish background it has when unlit why its called a paperwhite.,kindle,debp2mz,2,t5_2qudz
