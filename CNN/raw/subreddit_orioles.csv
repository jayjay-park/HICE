68567,0,t1_cem7mwm,i am confident that when the dust settles we will sign a starting pitcher my guess is arroyo.i think that we may or may not sign a bat maybe morales or someone.  but i think that if we sign one it will end up being a bust.  ubucshowalter is right just because you spend doesnt mean that player is going to produce. our best bet is not wasting money on bringing in talent that is over valued and unwanted but just getting lucky hoping one of those left fielder options sticks when we throw the whole committee at the wall and hoping that our core of players which is excellent stays healthy and produces. if davis doesnt regress too much and machado continues to develop we will be better than last year even without making a big offensive signing.,orioles,cem8hu6,3,t5_2s9ej

99911,0,t1_cemqf17,First your explanations are well thoughtout and good. But even that out of context statement is not hyperbole closers simply arent important. They are just a reliever plain and simple. Usually the teams assigns its best reliever to the role but there is nothing special about pitching the ninth inning as opposed to the eight and all the stats back me up. Moreover advanced stats usually dictate that the coach should leave in a reliever who is currently pitching well in the game to pitch the ninth inning. So if anything being reliant on a given closer is a sign of antiquated baseball thought.Also my point wasnt that Tillman is absolutely our best pitcher though I think he definitely has the most potential utility. Chen was better for basically all of the year he wasnt dealing with an injury if I recall but for last year Tillman was the best pitcher. Im really surprised to hear about Lough. Especially since early expectations seemed to be a platoon of Reimold and Urrutia. Also Lough is noted as a fourth option for outfield in many pieces. Perhaps that has changed of late. For B I never really thought Weeks would start opening day. I figured it would be Flaherty until he hits . again. I think Schoop is the th man you referenced for B.,orioles,cept035,1,t5_2s9ej

405630,0,t1_cfmqz0l,MAkes sense about Webb and I agree that right now Hunter and Oday both have potential issues with closing.  Hunter does seem like he has teh potential to be a top closer so I hope youre right about them having a ST plan for helping him with lefties.  The only other person Id toss into the conversation is Yoon.  I think hes a total unknown commodity as far as what he can do in the majors but as far as I know he had pretty even splits in KBO so he could be an intriguing options.As for prospect development I actually dont liek the idea of long relief.  I get what youre saying about the importance of turning the lineup over but actually think regular work with a good pitching coach is potentially more important.  Long relievers get used so randomly that you can lose a lot of developmental time from a player going long stretches without pitching to live hitters.  I also just dont buy into the ideas that putting them in a situation where they dont need to turn the lineup over fucks with their potential to start.  Ultimately what most pitchers need to develop when they are first entering the bigs is the ability to pitch to big league hitters.  Perhaps if you have no pitching coach and they are solely matching up out of the pen with no guidance but the knowledge of whether they got a specific player out or not will change their approach.  However if you have a decent pitching coach who is going through each appearance with them and looking at how they faced this at bat and whether the at bat went on too long or what was being expected by the batter or so on then I think you actually accelerate the learning curve because they are able to get constant feedback rather than feedback only periodically when a starter gets knocked out of the game early.,orioles,cfmt5vd,1,t5_2s9ej

I dont mean to imply that one citymarketteam is better than the other but lets be honest  its a bias that has always existed because of visibility. Boston and NY and LA to complete the Big Three get all the coverage for the same reason that Tokyo and Osaka get all the press over here Theyre the most visible in most peoples minds.Fans of teams like the Orioles will always have kind of an uphill battle to fight because of it. Its just the way it is.But it doesnt mean that the Os will always have to be underdogs.

1344298,0,t1_ciktcun,I think Tillman already has turned the corner he has strung together  pretty good starts. Ubaldo hopefully can put together a solid nd half though I think  is kind of a stretch. You hope Crush and Manny can pick it up in the second half and Id be surprised if they didnt. Youd also expect Hardy to start hitting some homeruns. Who knows maybe at some point Lough remembers how to hit the ball.The flip side of that unfortunately is you also have to expect Cruz to come back to earth and Norris to not be able to keep up his current streak.

At the very least it would be intriguing and at best it would take us from being a team that is built to get to the postseason and turn us into a team that is built to win in the postseason.

Cleveland and Minnesota both made significant trades to rebuild for the future and gave up some of their starting talent.

Im still trying to figure it out.This cheat has helped Joseph compensate for an admittedly mediocre arm and bump his caughtstealing percentage from  percent in the Minors to an ALleading  this season  a better number than even Wieters has posted.This is the first explanation Ive seen for how Joseph went from a probably not good enough to catch for the major league team guy to one of the best defensive catchers in the majors right now.,orioles,ckg706s,5,t5_2s9ej

Now that Ive had a bit of time for it to sink in.... almost everyone on here thought that the Os had a real shot at winning it all ... without Davis Wieters and Machado.  And its not like we got blown away by KC.  Yes we got swept but we were within arms reach in every single game.  Yeah it might hurt now but Im fucking proud of how this team played all year.  Guys like Steve Pearce batting . and replacing Davis when he was asked to Delmon Young was churning out hits all season Flaherty showed up big in the playoffs Schoop had power and great defense all season Joseph played great defense all year to fill in for the irreplaceable Wieters Britton kinda came our of nowhere but was stellar all season same with Brach.... and those are just the guys that we didnt expect to contribute big time coming into this season.  Like I said before Im proud of this team and honestly Id rather lose to the Royals than say NY LA or Oakland.

Arrietas cutter was just so good he could lean on it like a crutch to get through minor league hitters.  But the majors dont work like that so they wanted Arrieta to work on his overall mechanics and had him stop throwing the cutter in the meantime.When he went to the Cubs something in his mechanics clicked and became repeatable.  So they unleashed his cutter. And now hes killing it.,orioles,cqjwixw,4,t5_2s9ej

We had and have a fine closer in Zach Britton. We traded away Jimbo precisely because we didnt want to pay  million a year for a pen arm. Why would we give Miller the deal he got in New York?The Orioles thought they had the working pieces of an outfield to rebuild around Adam Jones.

5100829,0,t3_3kvbo9,Quick backstory The player that Schoop gave the stuff to is Braden Kolmansberger who said throughout regionals and the World Series that his favorite player was Jonathan. Braden plays second and has said he models his play after Schoop.  After taking a picture Schoop brought him down into the dugout gave him a bat one of his gloves and a few sets of batting gloves. Braden is a huge Orioles fan and was eating it all up.  Gausman also came out and asked the whole team how many Orioles numbers were retired and Braden was the first one to say six awarding him another glove.  Overall the kids seems like they had a great time. Most of them are huge Os fans because Red Land is so close to Baltimore. Fun fact outfielder and rd baseman for the team Camden Walter was actually named after OPACY.,orioles,cv0u997,4,t5_2s9ej

I know that since the Moneyball era began money is no longer an excuse but its still a major handicap for teams like the Rays who have a terrible stadium situation to compete with the Sox and Yankees and now maybe even the Blue Jays with Rogers opening up their wallets. Its hard for me to hate on teams like them or the As and Twins who have historically held their own vs the Big Boys despite all their handicaps. All that said I dont mind if the Blue Jays become the third Evil Empire in the AL East like the Red Sox did in the s.

The Red Sox attempt to and it doesnt work and they act like theyre above it. Theyre fake.,orioles,d0v5lb8,2,t5_2s9ej

Of note however one of the most recent forfeitsgt   Baltimore at Toronto  AL  The Orioles were behind  in the bottom of the fifth inning when manager Earl Weaver asked umpire Marty Springstead to have a tarpaulin that was covering the Toronto bull pen area removed. The game was being played in a light rain and Weaver felt that the tarpaulin posed an injury risk to his left fielder. The umpire refused and Weaver pulled his team from the field. Springstead waited  minutes for the team to retake the field before declaring the forfeit.,orioles,d2hik4j,7,t5_2s9ej

8479767,0,t1_d61ad81,I think they might be a bit better than that.  HammelArrieta is a great  punch. Miggy and Davies are respectable.  Chen isnt a killed. Id say the starters are average maybe even a step above.  Way better than the current Os.The bullpen is decent.  Miller is Miller and StropKRod are good too.  Id put Feldman on there and him  Koji  Hunter are not going to kill you maybwe Loewen as a mop up?.Hundley and Bautista are great. Reynolds is acceptable but we know his defense.  But the middle of the infield is bad.  Until I found out Justin Turner played SS for us.  Granted it was  innings but Im gonna roll with that.  B is probably Kelly Johnson.  Certainly below average but not gonna kill you.  The outfield is ok.  Cruz is great Nick is ok and so is Parra.  DH is a trainwreck unless I missed someone.  Maybe De Aza in OF and Cruz DHStill I think this team is good.  Maybe not playoff good but theyd be in the conversation.Edit  Forgot Werth.  ParraWerthMarkakis with Cruz DH aint too bad.  Turner Reynolds Bautista and Johnson in the IF and Hundley catching is an ok offense.  The defense might be a bit lacking thoughEdit  Bud Norris would round out the rotation well.  ,orioles,d61iiic,1,t5_2s9ej

9178412,0,t1_d8favum,I still question the decision to bring in Ubaldo but I think youre right about Britton. I understand where Bucks head was in thinking wed hit a dinger and then close it down. Though he had been good lately I cant forget about Ubaldo being the worst pitcher we had on the roster for much of the season. I think Buck would have gotten less criticism if hed brought in Hunter.Also to be honest this Os team sucked a bit. I think we all knew that it was possible to win this onegamer but we would run out of pitching in any long series. I was not nearly as excited about our chances this year. Offense was great as usual but starting pitching was atrocious for a playoff team.But for one game the pitching doesnt look that badTillmanGivensHartODayBritton is a solid game.,orioles,d8ffion,0,t5_2s9ej

I feel better about  than  for sure.I think any team that is around  wins is a potential playoff team.  Right now that is what I think the Orioles are with the holes we have.  As far as an AL East division winner we need to fill those gaps with quality players.  Goes without saying Joseph Pena Bourn and Rickard are not those players.,orioles,d8h7zlr,2,t5_2s9ej
9193824,0,t1_d8hd8cq,But again youre implying Buck was throwing the game by not sending him in. Britton would have to get up throw and sit down  times over in order to be ready at a moments notice. And its not like after that first hit he could start throwing Buck could stall with a mound visit and after the second visit Britton would be good to go. Thats why Buck made the strategy visit instead. And you know what? It didnt work out. Theres no mystery and Britton is no superhero. Hell if he came in and EE sent that moonshot out anyway what would you say?Really if the Orioles hit anything worth a damn except that one home run Buck doesnt have to use a starter its an entirely different story and we are in Texas right now. The loss falls squarely on the shoulders of our exposed offense. We clearly will not agree on this. ,orioles,d8hdve1,-1,t5_2s9ej
9203196,0,t1_d8ijldt,No we werent. We could have easily pitched Britton two innings. We couldve used him to start the th and pitch the th. The fact that by the th inning we thought it was a good strategy to start a guy who was cut by the Royals earlier in the year and then replace him with Ubaldo is ridiculous. If you have    coming up in the lineup you should be playing your best pitcher against them and thats Britton. He gave up  earned run after April. Just fucking pitch him.,orioles,d8ikn20,2,t5_2s9ej

The guys at work apparently took me out drinking and I have no memory of itThe other time was at HSF at the Ravens stadium in  when a fat chick who had no business crowd surfing kicked the shit out my head.

Davis and Machado have both had multiple elite seasons.Among the starting  everyday players the Os have had a player with a  WAR or better spot every year since .  AJ was worth . WAR in  with a .

And the Jays lineup will not hit like Rey Ordonez all season but the fact remains  out of  games have been versus a team that cant hit shit no matter who they face.

Darth Caleb was a Dark Lord of the Diamond so powerful and so wise he could use pitch framing to influence the balls and strikes to create outs He had such a knowledge of the game that he could even keep the ones he played against from stealing second base. The dark side of the Bat is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was killing a rally which eventually of course he did. Unfortunately he taught Chance Sisco everything he knew then Chance was placed above him in the lineup. Ironic. He could save others from cold streaks but not himself.,orioles,dgr3ezv,24,t5_2s9ej
