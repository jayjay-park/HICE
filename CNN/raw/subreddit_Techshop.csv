10461959,0,t3_59snfv,An email went out that the closure should be back to the originally planned one week.First week of March itll go down and barring any problems would be back up within a week. Fingers crossed.From the emailgtWell here we are. Another email another change to our closure date...! gtgtWeve received more good news from our landlord at  S. nd Street. We now have a lease extension through the end of construction. This will allow us to minimize our downtime to just the time it will take us to move equipment and furniture into the new shop and pass our final inspection. gtgtTechShop San Jose will now remain open at  S. nd St. until midnight on Thursday March nd. Then we will need one week to relocate tools and furniture to get the new shop fully operational and the reopen date will be dependant on the final construction inspection for our certificate of occupancy. gtgtThank you for standing by us as we have gone through this bumpy time. In a little more than  weeks we will be completely moved into our new home and we couldnt be more excited. gtgtThank you for reading . All of us at TechShop look forward to helping you Build Your Dreams HERE! ,Techshop,dctywwx,1,t5_2sglv
