4608276,0,t1_ctaherx,Maybe but it does not say Starbucks on a sign above the building.  A quick chat is fine but  minutes is a bit much for someone who will have me look up the price on an air filter then say that cost too much and his old sock with used motor oil on it works even better.  Buy something or let me get back to the customers that are paying my paycheck.  ,TalesFromAutoRepair,ctbggey,3,t5_37met

5168531,0,t1_cv6h4wn,ah i see.  well for some reason what you just said reminds me of someone that lost their TDI due to it having a timing belt that is on the outside of the engine.  I dont remember if he was missing his timing belt covers or if they got knocked off.  His serpentine belt broke and a piece of it managed to get into the timing belt path and threw the timing belt off.  Being a TDI it trashed the valves and pistons.Interference engines really should be advertised as such and more importance givenput on change intervals to everything that keeps them in time.  I let it slide on things that arent interference but i dont screw around for ones that are.  If its a k mile change interval i change it then.  not k miles.  Some people get away with it some dont.  But then you worry that what if one of the rollers or tensioner you just put on has a defect and will fail k miles from now....   oh well.  ,TalesFromAutoRepair,cv8zy49,1,t5_37met
