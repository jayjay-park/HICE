9260920,0,t1_d8keq26,Sorry been a super hectic week finally drove the last bit of fuel out switched up the gas stations and dumped some STP injector cleaner in. The pinging has gotten a lot lighter leaps and bounds here. Before when truck was warmed up and cruising around mph the ping would show up without me having to coax it out. Now Im having to really play with the throttle I can hear a couple little pings here and there when I really  bog down the overdrive but simply switching gas stationsand maybe the bottle of injector cleaner really made a huge improvement. My plan is to yank spark plugs this weekend provided I have the time and replace them. One of my buddies with the same truck said a TSB came out recently that changed the gapping from . to . Not sure how much truth is behind all that but I will do my research beforehand. Edit Spelling formatting,Silverado,d8pvzxc,2,t5_2unux
