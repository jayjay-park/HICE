1714651,0,t1_cjuymb6,The introductory clause of the Second Amendment is mildly informative as to what the Founding Fathers were thinking at the time but it is just an introductory clause and therefore irrelevant to the declaratory part of the amendment which unambiguously instructs all future congresses the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.  All federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations are built upon the inviolability of  the federal constitution. If we can just change the way we understand the constitution because fashions have changed no law no regulation no official opinion of any kind can retain legitimacy.   If we want to grab privately owned guns the U.S. constitution generously provides a means of changing its most fundamental tenants. Until we pass an amendment displacing the Second Amendment passing any mere Initiative simply dishonors the primacy of the constitution and destabilizes our entire society.  The idea that passing another law believing that it can control the behavior of the lawless is just silly. Thinking people know that no new gun law is about controlling the law breakers they are about controlling the law abiding. One has to wonder why the law abiding need controlling and why any free thinking person would support the destruction of personal freedoms.  Read More Guns Less Crime   At the very least read the Wikipedia article   Basing law on what we wish would happen leads to self satisfaction but not to a safe society and certainly not a free society. Please dont be one of the timid citizens willing to trade your freedom for a perception of safety. You will end up with neither.,Renton,cjval7u,0,t5_2seph
