7848051,0,t3_4mk9q7,Quoting LiaraPros . Newbies fill the guild slots comparatively quickerCons . Raid planning gets difficult . Newbies are likely to leave guild quicker for more level appropriate guilds . Newbies are more likely to remain idle for days . It would be unfair for newbies themselves to join in a guild holding raids higher than their levels or falling too low on the raid contributors list in presence of higher level dominating members . Holding raids too low for newbies will make the majority members and Lers upset and we are likely to lose higher level members this way  which obviously we dont want . Holding raids good for only minority will be a waste of precious guild resourcesPlease vote by replying to this comment!  Well leave the vote open for as long as it takes to reach a consensus.,IluminaPrimu,d3y6v6f,1,t5_3eur9

7959985,0,t3_4mc647,HiId like to join this guild. Im lvl   i have six star charqcters. I keep arena low to help me in GW. I play every day. Usually get the  coins daily. I want to leave myguild because were very few players and it takes  days to complete a tier  raid. If you have space or questions let me know. Mendoza,IluminaPrimu,d4arzw9,1,t5_3eur9
8732885,0,t3_4ziyqb,beyond talking up the guild with people i know who play i havent really considered what recruiting even means. Id be glad to help any way I can. Should I just google the game and start trying to post ads where i find others? Eugi Shark your posts look great. One has a lot of info and the other is brief and to the point which is great because people are split on those preferences. Can I just copy that and post places?Eugi the post right after yours is for a guild named Too old for this Sith by a guy named ManBalz...how are we supposed to compete with that??
