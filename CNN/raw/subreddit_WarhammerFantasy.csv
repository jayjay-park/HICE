480882,0,t3_1zmcyu,Yes you can use the Transformation spell to do this.  however remember that the Dragon is not going to make you auto win fights and if your dragon ever turns back into his mage form then any wounds on the dragon are still on the mage and a lot of times this kills him out right.   I think the Signature spell is much better here as it would make your Seaguard Str and Toughness ,WarhammerFantasy,cfuxgwb,2,t5_2rv4g
481049,0,t3_1zk91r,I love my seaguard I can have bows and spears and only need one unit for my core instead of having to spread points around! yes please! Also Seaguard make an excellent bunker for shadow wizards go ahead charge my  ranks of bow shots then fight my str  spears with mindrazer of course.  my argument for reavers is always the same.  Fast cavalry is just silly with there mobility.  your opponents quickly learn to keep his mages and other character in units when reavers are on the table also small units of flack get picked to pieces. Warmachines hunting can be done quickly.  To top it all off they eat up core points to get you to your limit and into your special and rare choices. my third choose for Core is archers  and I have two trains of thought on these guys take a big block and shoot the ever living hell out of anything. or take multiple small units and skirmish with them. Spearmen I only take in super low points game mostly because they are the cheapest option. Silver helm i avoid this edition just because cavalry is such a weak thing compared to great weapon hordes. Plus you are talking about playing defensively and cavalry are not really defensive. Issue with Eagle over Reavers . Eagles are not core which means they take points from other places in my army. . they are only T and have no armor and you have to spend more points to give them ASF. . for the same points cost as  eagles you can get  reavers with a champion bows and spears.  attacks  wounds and  movement v.  attacks  wounds and  movement.. Ive found that both Reavers and Eagles work the same for flanking into units they die quickly and with little to no impact. Finally Eagles are not core yes I feel I must put this twice. if you want to get a quick min core you can do  SG with Stand and Musician and  spear and bow reavers for  points that is  points over what you need for a  point core and it gives you about  bow shots. well  if you dont move and  if you do move.,WarhammerFantasy,cfuy5jl,3,t5_2rv4g

So he could join them the same manner as a captain on horse can join knightly orders.As I said the empire literally dont have a model for the pegasus anymore and the old one is so far out of production its not even funny. My argument is that in the absence of an official model who can tell me that Im not allowed to pick the base size myself?

1375714,0,t3_29uvd5, units is not a good place to be also I think the minimum requirement of  units  general doesnt include heroeslords but it might. Also you are not showing the number of warriors in each unit.With only two units your opponent will dictate the entire battle including deployment in some cases. You cant redirect and you have no answer to redirectors you have extremely limited range and magic rolled into one. Half your army can be redirected for as little as  points then your opponent only has to deal with one unit at a time.,WarhammerFantasy,cioqdlo,2,t5_2rv4g
1924150,0,t3_2gobh3,Ive played against VC quite a bit so I know a fair bit about them. First off two of their biggest strengths are Ethereal and the ability to regrow wounds. Ethereal units can be a real pain in the ass for an army that isnt prepared to deal with them and they can be extremely devastating. Spirit hosts are very good at redirecting units away from where they want to go if they have magical attacks and if they dont the spirit host can just keep them tied up for turn after turn. Another one to think about are Hexwraiths. They would screw my game up time after time because not only are they Ethereal and so unable to be wounded very easily but they can put the hurt on back. Additionally they can cause wounds just by running through a unit and then it cant even turn around to attack them.As far as raising the dead goes the guy I would play against would take a combat lord and then two level  wizards. He would throw the lord in some skeletons and place the wizards behind his lines. That way his lord could do a bunch of wounds in combat and any wounds that I ever did could be regrown in his magic phase until I lost and he ran me down.One thing youre going to want to look out for is crumbling. Once your general goes down every unit starts to take wounds every round and if your opponent is smart theyll play off of this and do their damnedest to get into your general and polish it off as quickly as possible. Hopefully thats fairly helpful!,WarhammerFantasy,ckl1ohg,2,t5_2rv4g

2582780,0,t3_2pcc00,I am going to throw a vote towards warriors of chaos.  A. They have few models on the field. B. Their models are highly armored which means that it is easy to get they to look decent.  Just grab some metallic vallejo paints and go to town.  Also  because most of your army wears armor it is easy to pick a color scheme and roll with it for your entire army.  C. Even their big point cost large models like chimeras and skullcrushers are pretty easy to paint.  Base coat wash dry brush.  Boom.  Done.  Fun army to play fun army to paint fun army to collect skulls for the skull throne with.  My  point army has  models which is paltry when compared to everything except Ogre Kingdoms.,WarhammerFantasy,cmvpg9d,1,t5_2rv4g
2733065,0,t3_2rbr3t,Sweet. FWIW it read as boat to me pretty much off the back but I agree that some of the other suggestions would help to really push the whole Corpse Boat concept. I dont quite understand how the grit is going to turn into waves. I was seeing this more as being a boat sailing on the bloated mounds of rotting and writhing zombies but looking like it was about to beach itself on some kind of land. So I would really like to see how this is painted. To be fair making it look like its sailing on some sort of ethereal base probably would look the best but then it would be more of a Mortis Engine than a Corpse Cart... which might be a good way to go. Its much easier to convert a corpse cart into something boaty than a mortis engine kit. regardless I freaking love this project!,WarhammerFantasy,cneqknw,1,t5_2rv4g

They just move to slow to really use em for flanking. Plague Drones I think have Fly which means they can move  i believe so they are great for flanking.

It seems like I never have the strength or numbers. Ive tried to break apart my units into smaller ones to distract his firepower. That seems to work the best it preserves the most units on my rush.Believe it or not I use the Black HorrorPurple Sun with lots of success against the him. Usually because he deploys his cheap artillery in a line and usually find myself rolling  or  on the AD with a lvl Sorc. It wipes them all or a couple out in a few turns.

3865803,0,t3_34f562,Wanted to update everyone who was following this here in the comments also updating in my original post.Ended up winning  games by a large margin and losing one game but still picked up some bonus points that game.I played against a very nasty empire list first game that had a level  of light level  and bsb in a unit of  knights  demigryph units  cannons arch lector on war alter  units of  knights and a steam tank. Gateway took care of the steam tank first turn and I got behind her army with the demon prince and pair of Chimeras and wreaked havoc.Game  was quite the dud. Played against Throgg a horde of trolls some chariots and ogres. Throgg and a single chariot charged my warriors and they broke panicking  of my army off the table including a chimera and my demon prince. Only later did I realize my demon prince couldnt flee... Still managed to run my sorcerer lord around and almost killed his ogre unit with a rear charge from my horsemen. I had consolation in that he went on to win the tournament.The final game I played against a very balanced and not too cheesy dark elf list. It was a fantastic game and my continuing trend of using a hellcannon to shoot for only  turn before putting it into combat continued. It ended up holding up  warlocks a master and a unit of dark riders for  turns after its initial shot killed a handful of black gaurd and witch elves. It nearly killed a supreme sorceress in that combat and would have had I not whiffed my attacks turn . Still a great game and it came down to a flee roll for my opponent on the bottom of .Overall the list performed very well and I ended up getting Best General and nearly won the whole thing. So Id say it went pretty well!,WarhammerFantasy,cqwxoyf,1,t5_2rv4g

7759330,0,t1_d3nry2g,No thats not what Im saying. Thats actually the opposite of what Im saying. You can use AoS models and rules to play out narratives set in AoS world or in oldhammer world or your own made up world if you want. If you dont like the new fluff just ignore it and pretend the old warhammer world still exists. ,WarhammerFantasy,d3o6coh,3,t5_2rv4g
8029509,0,t1_d4iiiuy,Basically you just lose some detail. Some models its NBD some models it makes em look like butt. Depends on the primer too how thick it is. ,WarhammerFantasy,d4ilbp2,1,t5_2rv4g
8207966,0,t3_4rqh08,Im not sure that th is dead depends on your local meta. It seems to me that if it is doomed to die out that time period will be measured in years enough that you can still justify getting into.Kings of War has been my alternate system of choice. It doesnt have anywhere near the detail humor dramatic abilities setting etc. of WHFB. But if you go into it with a different set of expectations its a really fantastic game.,WarhammerFantasy,d53jtt3,1,t5_2rv4g

8494440,0,t1_d63cg95,From what I read Magnus was a general more than a warrior. Not a bad thing in the slightest just not exactly what Im looking for. And when it comes to Valten I cannot for the life of me find enough information about him and his combat prowess though he did beat up Archaon a bit. My biggest problem when it comes to Valten and Karl is that the power that they have has been linked with having a connection with Sigmar so its not really their power theyre using. I completely get what you guys are saying but every once in awhile I start cynically thinking that the power of humans is relegated in fantasy and sci fi to the willingness to die to be fanatics and to breed like rabbits. And I know we arent that simple.,WarhammerFantasy,d63cskg,2,t5_2rv4g
8563424,0,t1_d6bq6yb,Thats a really cool idea I painted my Black Knights in the different colours to represent dead Bretonnian Knights and the skeletons were the peasants ,WarhammerFantasy,d6c0842,1,t5_2rv4g

8658409,0,t3_4yek11,Unfortunately it pretty much looks like an High Elf army with a couple of Dark Elf bits and characters thrown in to justify the decision of calling it a Dark Elf army since its impossible to find Cold One riders and or corsairs in the High Elf miniatures though with some conversions this could be achieved. I am sorry but it doesnt really look like a Dark Elf army to me  there are just too many High Elven miniatures and units in there. It looks overall extremely lost in translation. The Aesthetic is all over the place and there doesnt seem to be any unity in it  you have LSG and Corsairs then flying carpet riding Sisters of Avelorn to substitute Warlocks which sit next to Dark Rider units that have been created by using the usual DE miniatures and then another Dark Rider unit using the IoB Reavers which look anything but Druchii. I feel that the army could do with a bit more conversion and rethinking imo especially on the aesthetic decisions and how the different units come together  theres just no real feel to the theme you mention it was created around.Kudos for sticking to the project though!Edit added some additional thoughts about the project.,WarhammerFantasy,d6nx01z,1,t5_2rv4g
