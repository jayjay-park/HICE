2283912,0,t1_clu06wt,Yes thats just what I thought thinking of getting the white or maybe yellow version so I dont have to swap that one it can just remain white as well green and white LEDs generally have about the same voltage requirements whereas red LEDs require less power som would be easier managed electronically as well! ,Corsair,clu0bj1,1,t5_2tqmj

4246254,0,t3_39gtb7,I bailed on link  months ago. Got sick of the constant bugs and resetting . Love the idea if it worked the way they say It would be fantastic. The final straws were my new link commander not working at all and my dominator platinum rams requiring special connectors to show up on link. The only connectors they supply are part of an ugly as balls fan system. Big dreams crappy reality. Corsair make mostly great hardware thier software is shit. Thier after sales service is also terrible. I have a d axi x g dominator platinum ram k keyboard dead leds hi in another build over  fans ie loyal customer but now thinking of other brands. ,Corsair,cs49i1e,1,t5_2tqmj

6043224,0,t3_3ya06w,Their support can be a little slow to get back in contact with you however Corsair has the best customer service of any PC product company I have yet used.  It is for this reason that I still buy Corsair whenever it is remotely possible.  In regards to things being DOA or not as pictured when refurbished this is unfortunately not that uncommon in our hobby.

8652764,0,t3_4yetyh,I have also heard some of these stories. However I have had the CXm in my build going on  years now without any problems at all. I guess is that they probably sell a lot of these and that there are a higher than average amount that fail but that they are generally ok. I have an I  GTX  and a few SSDs. I understand that these CX are the budget brand but for only paying  for mine I say it turned out pretty well. ,Corsair,d6n7jj8,1,t5_2tqmj

9244222,0,t1_d8nn2w7,It doesnt matter. Always look for the top level domain TLD like .com or .gov and whatever is in front of it as the most important part of the URL. There can be smaller parts with more dots in front of that TLD but thats just how they are organizing their websites. Yes its annoying that they would name their site that but it isnt really a problem at all because you know it is a smaller part of corsair.com which is clearly the official website.,Corsair,d8nrtgc,1,t5_2tqmj

Corsair link still doesnt support it nor Ryzen either for that matter. Corsair remains quiet on the issue and the only official response that you get is that they have no official response.
