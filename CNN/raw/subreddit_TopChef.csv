I want to try Richard Blais Juniper and Ivy but I also have my reservations because of how much work he does outside the kitchen.

3118163,0,t3_2vsmau,I dont know but maybe it was Bravos way of legitimizing their late night show Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.  Instead of having a Top Chef reunion they just get the finalists to appear with Andy and answer really stupid questions and play inane games.Did anyone catch Mei and Gregory on that show?  It was a goddamn disaster.  Mei is already just a wooden plank that someone animated with evil blood magic and Gregory looked like being left behind in Mexico with no passport wouldve been preferable to appearing on that show.  ,TopChef,col73n3,11,t5_2s8jq

6170289,0,t3_3wttdh,He said the beef he was cooking didnt have a very high fat content which isnt ideal for cooking sousvide. If you look back at Season  Michael and Bryan were cooking sousvide almost every episode and the judges consistently loved their food.To be fair I think Tom is more of a traditionalist when it comes to cooking proteins so when he sees someone screw up a nice piece of meat because of cooking it sousvide he gets annoyed.,TopChef,cyqzxrq,1,t5_2s8jq
6244886,0,t1_cyz3f5c,Shes a fake cunt Ive despised her for several seasons now. Its painfully obvious that she votes people off the show if she doesnt like them regardless of their food.Its weird because Gail used to annoy me because when the show first started she didnt have a clue about food so she would just repeat whatever Tom said but its near impossible to hate her shes just so obviously a nice and genuine person. Padma is a cold hearted bitch though.,TopChef,cyzh4xd,-9,t5_2s8jq
6551287,0,t3_45c5jv,Im irritated that Jeremy skated through because the judges didnt see how much of a clusterfuck the lunch service was behind the scenes. I bet the dinner dishes would have been better on that team if they werent an hour or more behind on prep because of lunch.That said Phillips dishes were clearly pretty terrible and his front of the house stuff wasnt good either so its not like its a travesty hes gone.

10852160,0,t3_5uyyge,its said that since day .  The producers always have control technically but Tom maintains that they dont interfere and I almost never disagree with the decision or find that they kept someone who is a better character.  Like this season I think every fan would have rather Jim continued or have Brooke reach the finale for a shot at redemption.  I dont find they tamper with it and if they did I would be turned off from the show pretty quickly.,TopChef,ddzbnjr,3,t5_2s8jq

11283093,0,t3_60xnw1,It will be great to see the contestants work their way thru Metro Denver. My guess is Bravo will use Celestial Herb Teas which is located in Boulder or somehow use Coors beer which is made in Golden CO. Perhaps the Fort Restaurant in Morrison CO as it is set in a Fort Theme or The Buckhorn Exchange in Denver as its one of the oldest and their new kitchen is perfect for filming. The Brown Palace is in Denver that would serve as a marvelous venue. The Unsinkable Molly Brown and her museum might show up. Wild Bills ties to Colorado might surface or something to do with Look Out Mtn. It is being filmed end of March thru April and into May so I would think Trail Ridge Road will not be open. Its a no brainer that Altitude cooking will come into play. Making a souffle at  ft above sea level. Hopefully the contestants will practice altitude cooking. It would be laughable if they pull up to Casa Bonitas in Lakewood and try to make the constestants cook there. Congressman Jared Polis is probably going to show up and Blue Mtn Arts Greeting cards that are made by his mother Susan Polis Shultz will somehow materialize. Blue Mtn Arts is a Boulder Company. I wonder if filming will wrap up before Mothers Day? ,TopChef,dfax71x,3,t5_2s8jq
