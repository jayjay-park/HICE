The IN campaign probably has ressources on something like a   basis to the OUT campaign.,UK_Politics,d17ha2l,1,t5_33geh

New workers may have to apply but theres not been any decisions made on that as far as Im aware. Whats to suggest we wouldnt maintain an agreement with the EU to allow people to work in the UK? A close relationship can still be maintained whilst making working in the UK more attractive to those all over the world it would even the playing field for people coming from outside the EU to the UK.Even if people renting suddenly disappeared landlords would be looking to sell their rental properties which leads to excess on the market which pushes prices lower and allows younger people to get on to the housing ladder which is what most people want. It could stimulate the market rather than contract it. More residents on the housing market keeps money in the economy rather than the dead money of rental properties going to rich landlords who in theory could be investing their profits abroad.,UK_Politics,d28nxen,2,t5_33geh

Sure Im working on it. Read my source. He originally tweeted he wanted a full ban after a significant time period he clarified he wished to ban Muslims from countries with terrorism. He deleted his first tweet. He still hasnt clarified his reasoning for wishing to place American individuals on a registry based on their religious tendencys. That does quite definitely go against your Constitution. Try reading the reactions of some of your  politicians academics and theorists opinions from the late s and early s when Germany brought in the JudenStern.,UK_Politics,dcaxxtx,1,t5_33geh
