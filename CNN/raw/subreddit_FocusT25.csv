1171584,0,t3_24f3uj,If when you substitute it I still wouldnt do that.Like SweetPeaMigee said you want a solid core going forward. This doesnt mean you get abs...most people will never see any and thats just how their body is.The ab workouts give you a break from focusing on one aspect of your weight loss and really focuses on solidify your core. When you have a solid core you can push yourself even harder in those cardio workouts. I personally hated the ab workouts when I first started them. My back was sore and didnt like the V moves and everything. But I stuck it out and my core is a rock now maybe  abs but I dont care about getting them. As a solid core that I have now I can push really hard in my workouts and certainly better than I did when I first started.If you want to substitute thats up to you its your program do what works for you. Id suggest not doing that though as it will help you later in the program in having that overall fitness and give you want you need to push harder.,FocusT25,ci1f9eh,2,t5_2wx5m
