442476,0,t3_1z55ca,SuggestionsFor ButtonImage Id format as ButtonImageb.png   means it is linked directly to the Resource folder. The same could be done for ImageName. ImageNameSteam.pngAlso for future reference you dont need !Execute when using LeftMouseDownAction. Just LeftMouseDownAction is enough. But since this is a button use ButtonCommand like soButtonCommandCProgram Files xSteamSteam.exeHelpNow here are two things I think are causing the problem.Button Images are cut into three parts Normal Hover and Clicked. Which means if you didnt format the image correctly it will only show  of the total image. Here is a link on how to set up button images LINK If you just want an image to click without the hoverover effect make it an image meter and use LeftMouseDownActionINSERT LINK HERE with a regular Steam image.I hope this solves your problem if not just ask and Ill try to help.,Rainmeter,cfqmliy,1,t5_2s0bb

Open this up and a file containing all your Rainmeter settings should be there.  This file isnt deleted when Rainmeter is uninstalled which is why the problem persisted.  It contains settings for almost any skin youve loaded so you may need to do some scrolling to find what youre looking for.  Find your Omnimo settings delete them and save the file.  Refresh Rainmeter and hopefully the problem will be fixed.,Rainmeter,cj4n7sa,4,t5_2s0bb

2410268,0,t3_2n21q9,A few days after discovering Rainmeter and having already set up a fairly basic and nice looking theme I wanted more. I decided I wanted to make a Megaman theme. I abused CircuitousTwos bars so much and also made several other copies just to for different colour differences in the icons. I also abused Honeycomb and used it for my launchers on my left screen though as you can see I still need a good  more. I also wanted to stay true to the original yet also make it slightly more modern in appearance at the same timeAny suggestions on what I could do to make it more clean or otherwise would be kindly appreciatedI lost the original of the left screens wallpaper because I edited it too much and the right wallpaper I made myself.Links to the Skins,Rainmeter,cm9m9nc,6,t5_2s0bb

It will output  AM with the spacing since i put it in the measure format. And thats where it makes it able to gather if the time is correct.If you want it to check if its over  and below  all you have to do is make the next IfCondition  AMPM Then itll change then and not change back to the one between  Minerva,Rainmeter,cpas5i4,2,t5_2s0bb

4783311,0,t1_ctx3y2q,Heres my thing Honeycomb isnt just overused. In my opinion its also just antithetical to the general spirit of what makes Rainmeter so great. Like a big reason to move to Rainmeter is to get away from icons because theyre ugly and cluttery. So you go from that to ... hexagonal more brightly colored versions of basically the same thing. You could already sort icons however you wanted. So theres no real difference. In the meantime you can use textbased or bannerbased or other unique and creative ways of creating shortcuts to programs that arent otherwise possible. So if youre going to use Honeycomb why not just use a shortcut? It probably actually saves resources by not running through a thirdparty program and either way its ugly.So the reason I went on this rant is because I look at this and while I dont see Honeycomb I still see icons that might as well just be desktop shortcuts. And I still just hate it.tldr Maybe Im the only one but to me Honeycomb is just not a very interesting use of this amazing tool and thats what I hate more than its overuse or ugliness and I dont see how using square icons that could literally use the exact same code just with a different image file is any better,Rainmeter,ctxh5xg,1,t5_2s0bb

I didnt expect such an emotional beginning at all or showing the baddest hitman of all time being portrayed as... mushy? The reason Wick had it in the fist place was really really touching.I guess it may have been lazy but it wasnt unoriginal or expected thats for sure. A typical action movie would have just had Iosef kill his wife and we wouldnt have had any time to see that buildup of grief hope and then the cruel crushing of that hope or the human side of Wick that keeps the incredible bodycount from making him into a onedimensional machine... Or perhaps the explanation as to why Wick turned into that killing machine again. Wow this is hard to talk about without spoiler code...I really liked how it meshed with the ending too how it was sort of the other way around that time.,Rainmeter,cvsv787,2,t5_2s0bb

The moon refuses to go in front of the earth at all it is always behind and the section IfTrueAction!ZPos !ZPos  VisBubbleMoonOrbitIfFalseAction!ZPos  Earth!ZPos  VisBubbleEarthdoes not refresh the earth as it is written.

7874944,0,t3_4n6jsb,Link to song in video.Took another crack at making an automatic image vizualizer tool. Just specify a few settings in a settings.txt file run the EXE and itll make a visualizer of an image of your choosing.  The previous version used SDL to generate a separate image for each band of the skin. Found out after the fact you can use imagecrop within the meter bar making this version a lot simpler.The new thing that I wanted to show off is horizontal seperation of bands while not distorting the image.  This is done by taking a user defined HORIZONTALSEPARATION   User defined OFBANDS  Getting the IMGWIDTH.  individual BANDWIDTH IMGWIDTHHZSEPxOFBANDS  OFBANDS  And then horizontal origin of each imagecrop is n x BANDWIDTHHZSEP x n. where n is the nth meter so if its the first meter n   ect..  Currently Im doing the INI generation in a external program I wrote. Ive seen a few examples of this kind of thing but I think Im the first to do it entirely with RMs builtin imagecrop using a single full image. I think with Lua itd be possible to do this with no external programs which would be really cool.,Rainmeter,d417sp9,1,t5_2s0bb

8915558,0,t3_52e3jg,You will need to do the math and calculate the topleft corner. Thats the way it is. In CG the topleft corner is the starting point for most of things. Also even though Rainmeter uses FontSize in pt there are pretty nice tables on the internet for conversion. Another way would be to use an exact widthheigth which would make the math much simpler. Because inside of a String meter of set bounds you can use center align just not on the whole Meter. ,Rainmeter,d7jipio,1,t5_2s0bb

For this setup the ratio lenghtheight of the icons is  rezised to be  pixel   pixel.For the purpose of the examples in the link I provide here you will find that the first dock is my News dock to be launch by Opera which I use the second dock is empty to launch links with Chrome the last one is my reddits subs launched by Chrome.In my rainmeter setup I have another set of rounds that trigger that ones in order to make it disapear when need be... because all those skins have to be set as infront not sure of the english name of that settting.The  skins to be loaded,Rainmeter,d7uh508,3,t5_2s0bb

10989438,0,t1_dedky9x,So youre going to want to use load order within the rainmeter settings to get the cutout on the desktop so not covering anything important but in front of the visualizer and rain etc. As you can see my position is On desktop and load order   now for everything else use On desktop too but load order  . You can also make it click through and untick draggable.,Rainmeter,dedm9bo,1,t5_2s0bb

11179954,0,t1_deyuoyi,Same. The monstercat visualizer uses the spotify plugin for displaying the song artwork and title so all we have to do is wait for the creator to update it. If only there was a way for us to be notified when the update is out.,Rainmeter,dez8h8p,2,t5_2s0bb
