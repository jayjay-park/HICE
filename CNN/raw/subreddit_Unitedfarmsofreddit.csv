3826179,0,t3_348yts,I have been playing this silly game for way longer than I care to admit and I have spent most of it playing alone.  I never used the Facebook route because I hate what a tattletale Facebook is.  Hey everyone! Superheller just reached level  on HayDay if you didnt already need a reason to hide her from your feed!Once they introduced the neighborhood part of the game I joined a random hood and was underwhelmed to say the least.Then I found this little note on the HayDay subreddit from one Starfleet farms to join her neighborhood.  I joined and was immediately overwhelmed by the amount of support and help that people were offering.  It changed the game for me.  The first thing I do when I log on to the game now is to see who needs help and to give as much help as I can.  I know that there are many members who do the same thing and that there are some people who have to dip out of the game from time to time because they have things to do in real life.  I totally get that.  I just do not have time for people who ask for help do not thank you andor never reciprocate.  I am not sure that anyone on our current list of  even falls into this category.  But I for one would like it if everyone here could try to be as good a neighbor as possible. I think everyone should at least attempt to partake in the derby.  If that means we have to keep a few low point derby tasks to keep people participating then okay.  OMG someone shut me up.  Love Christmas Elf,Unitedfarmsofreddit,cqsf0ig,2,t5_37tqq
