5018704,0,t3_3jmqy3,Here are  reviews of him from rsoccerHe played behind the striker quite a bit for us we tried to use him as a target man but he wasnt as effective as Gomis Bony.I liked him because he works very hard and has a great attitude  he was wellreceived by our club and many fans wanted him back on loan this season. Didnt really get a chance to prove himself with us but you could tell he was willing to put in a shift.  Swansea fan uswanseaaHes used to play alone up front like he did in the U world cup in  hes not a target man but he runs a lot and hes at his best for a counter attacking team Benfica fan uBSantos,nffc,cuqy0w3,2,t5_2uhk6

8508211,0,t3_4w7qed,I have a soft spot for Ward but given that we still need to be looking to keep wages down how injury prone he is and the fact we have plenty of attacking midfielderswingers who can do at least as consistent a job id be inclined to let him go.,nffc,d652yhc,2,t5_2uhk6

9233665,0,t1_d8mfjuc,Club confirmation Theres no solid evidence that I know of but the goto conclusion would be that now the Greeks have pulled out the deal PP has decided he doesnt have to put up with Fawaz bullshit and get a better job elsewhere.Check Antonis Oikomidis Twitter though he is the most reliable source weve had in years. ,nffc,d8mfnmh,2,t5_2uhk6

10129540,0,t3_5kzhlo,The sooner we get the takeover sorted the better and they need to make a very quick choice to either back Montanier for the rest of the season or replace him ASAP. What we dont need is a  games to save his job type ultimatum  the players already seem to be acting as if hes a dead man walking. So unless it becomes clear that hes going nowhere any more uncertainty is just going to prolong the agony.As for Rowett I dont hear great things about the attractiveness of his football. But resultswise it would be difficult to argue against if we do decide to go for a change.,nffc,dbrvuvp,4,t5_2uhk6

10567117,0,t3_5rb7ub,Well it was against the team by far the worst in the division but it sounds like a lot went right tonight. Writers saying Brerton and Britt worked well together and Britts back baby! a clean sheet and thats six points from nine by Gary.Just hope Fawaz doesnt do something stupid like make Brazil permanent first team manager on the back of this decent run when he has done such great things with our youth setup.Hopefully the Zach Clough move goes through Fawaz keeps very bloody quiet and we can start February with a bit of albeit muted cheer.,nffc,dd5whku,7,t5_2uhk6

10947721,0,t1_de92230,Its an insanely frustrating team. Everyone seems quite good at what they do but noones great at it. Vaughan is quite good at hustling and has a decent pass but hes not a playmaker nor a proper ball winner. Osborns quite good at passing and dribbling but not good enough to be the main playmaker. Would like to see what Zach Clough at number  can do.  Cash is quite good at covering ground but hes not going to average km a game or whatever is a few km better than average. You get my point. Carayol is the only one with pace since Ward has lost a yard but the moment anyone has any pace in this division it seems they have no brain see Ryan Mendes.The main problem is that this squad hasnt been built for purpose by one manager. Its a horrendous mixture of signings made by King Bill Psycho Dougie and PM. Some of them are on massive wages and are basically PLChampionship journeymen Fryatt Fox Hobbs Vaughan even if I like those last two some are foreign mercenaries signed because they were cheap some are the best freebies we could get with a k wage cap. Then some random loanees thrown in there for good measure why the hell did we get Texeira?? and to cap it off some youngsters thrown in because everyone else is shit. What a clusterfuck.,nffc,de96hlr,4,t5_2uhk6
11066895,0,t3_5xw4yp,I didnt like this move since his arrival. While Im glad to see hes gone purely from lack of production he is better back up than nothing wages notwithstanding. Still Blackstock was my pick to stay.,nffc,demf7eo,2,t5_2uhk6
