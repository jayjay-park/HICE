There were never any official NA play here EU play here so it was always spread around and in its prime the servers were active .  You wont experience the lag in XI like there is in XIV.  I would recommend Asura I am on Ragnarok currently but transferring to Asura in the next few days to join this linkshell.  I think there are Linkshells that are friendly to new players and returning players everywhere but I like reddit and Asura is the official Reddit server so Im going to try that LS and see.  Odin was where I first rolled in  and has the highest population now but there is a strong JP presence so I think for English speakers others like Asura and Bahamut are better choices.  ,ffxi,cf8v4gu,2,t5_2qn97

Depending on how active you are you can go through that in about  hours or so.If the worm party wont let you leech you can try to find someone doing Fell Cleave warrior AoE WS.

People who can doublebox will usually have their mule doing it to level up their main. As it makes no difference if youre doing this for yourself or a full alliance most friendly people will have no problem letting you join the party and leech xp.Popular spots are mandys in AbysseaAltepa or Atthowa frogs in AbyMisearaeux or La Theine check wiki for the conflux and ltposgt.

2193036,0,t1_cliaakt,Delve may be slightly challenging it was truly challenging back when it first came out but not anymore Incursion is even better at higher levels but youve missed my point They are all still selfserving content. Everybody gets their own rewards. There are some group rewards in Delve but none of them are unique to the treasure pool you can buy them just as easily with the plasm you earn from  runs. You can pretty much cap all your Delve drops by doing  runs from each zone then you never have to go back.Incursion is the same all selfserving. Everyone gets coffers they open for equipment that is Ex. You cant selflessly help someone in order to increase the odds they will get the drop they want. You can help them do the event but you cant say give them the drop they want if it goes to you. Instead it gets wasted.  people banding together to get  person a drop used to vastly increase that persons odds of getting a drop now it doesnt help at all.This is what is destroying the community in the game. This is why linkshells dont have scheduled events anymore. It used to be the whole games atmosphere revolved around people helping each other but the selfserving content has killed it. Thats why  of linkshells are just social shells or catchup shells for returning players.The selfserving content killed endgame linkshells completely. Theres no need for scheduled events because anything that cant be soloed you can cap your drops in  runs. Incursion is somewhat of an exception but still has individual drops. The hightier battlefields are a great bit of content because they do actually have pooled drops and are fun too! but they require a large number of merits to participate in which has limited my ability to help people in those fights.,ffxi,clil7ln,1,t5_2qn97

2661479,0,t1_cn5sudx,Generally in an MMO endgame is what you do for challenge to get better gear to make later events easier to complete. Theres dozens of endame events in FFXI. The incentive to do those events is for the items they drop to make your character more powerful. Thats also the incentive behind missions access to areas that endgame events happen in and usually items for completing the missions.So really the whole game is about upgrading your equipment.You wont get more story except from some quest chains until a new expansion is released.

2838509,0,t1_cnqa2uf,gt Look in any recent new player or daily mega thread post and youll find many of the answers youre looking for...Grow up and stop acting so childish. Defending my original post and being concise is acting childish and complaining as opposed to what youre doing right now? I never said I was a new player with no background in the game. Creating a thread about opinions on the topics I asked about isnt easy to sift through the years of responses from the community. Also how do you know that I dont utilize wonderful spreadsheets like this one Mokoshi created during my play sessions? Thanks Mokoshi!gt This is true considering youll run out of inventory space really fast leveling that many jobs even with all the storage options.From your experience about running out of inventory space so quickly did it occur to you that perhaps other people arent so bad at micromanaging inventory space?gt Maybe instead of complaining when someone gives you solid information you could actually put it to use.This solid information was not useful to me. I told him and Im telling you. I never asked for a cookiecutter standard. I asked for opinions from specific questions. Since he deviated and gave an opinion on a different play style that didnt have to do with the topic and downvoting me that rustles my jimmies. Also I have to sit here defending myself again to you because you feel as if I jumped down his throat but really I am just trying to show that this community is getting another player that is competent enough to defend his own threads and stay on topic.With that said I decided to start with melee jobs since most can use each others weapons up until level . Again microing inventory And using any additional items for instance crystals and consumables as soon as I get them. Someone showed me that I can feed crystals to protowaypoints which is great since I can free up more inventory space. This is just an example.Now I know my play style and tackling a new account this way isnt preferred by some of the reddit veterans here but rest assured you dont have to play my account.

4019257,0,t1_cref4zk,We still have the community and the grind its just not there for leveling. We have dozens of endgame events to do and Job Points are the new EXP so you grind those with a partyalliance. Getting to max level on your first job is doable within a week. Trusts are stronger than real players up until about level  and dont give an EXP penalty like real players do in a party. At max level Trusts are weaker than real players so groups of real people are more desired.They reduced the grind for levels with Abyssea because a high percentage of players were max level in all the jobs they wanted and it was getting hard to find EXP groups at certain level ranges even with Level Sync. Since  expansions were out all with endgame events they decided they had enough content for players to do and that there shouldnt be a monthslong delay before a new player could join their friends in those activities. WoW did the same thing after a few expansions making leveling soloable and fast to do.You grind for level  equipment currencyconsumables to augment those items and for the  Job Points per job that you want. Capacity Points parties are always being shouted for in town. Do one of them and you will have your community and a longrunning party.The population just isnt high enough anymore with enough unleveled jobs to sustain leveling as a grind.,ffxi,crefcbp,1,t5_2qn97

4607637,0,t3_3e4952,. Kind of impossible to answer. Its a time will tell sort of situation.. As recently as May they introduced major changes that significantly ease leveling to level cap even for a freshly starting player. Its expectedhoped that the August update will add on to this with further increases to the amount of experience points gained.. Most of the content that can be soloed is better done in groups. Skirmish for example is an event with varying levels of strength  you can solo it at a basic level or group up to challenge it at a higher level resulting in a more and better drops. This is the case for a lot of content right now.     With that said leveling is an entirely solo process. It used to be required to form a sixman party to obtain slow amounts of exp but thats no longer the case. You level so fast now and most people have the jobs they want to play already leveled.. Crafting is not really a pillar of this game. There are so many different pieces of content at  its kind of difficult to describe them all.

If this is all true which is from reports on BGffxiah not first hand experience I cant imagine a better UC trust. Yoran seems to be the best Whm but the difference between Karaha and YoranApu isnt even that much you trade a bit of mana efficiency for more damage generally.

Youre way better off farming gil to buy the WoE drops from bazaars and questing the weapon skill. Empyrean weps should be taken to i to use in current content and even then are generally outclassed by easier to get weapons.To clarify you dont HAVE to get an empy weapon to  to unlock the empyrean weapon skill on all weapons it just lowers the amount of diceresiduecoins you need for the quest which makes it a bit cheaper but still an absolutely terrible investment of time for the amount of gil you save. I cant check the wiki at work but I think it lowers the diceresidue to like ... which saves you... maybe .m? Thats seriously nothing a handful of dyna or salvage runs wont get you. Compared to MANY hours of farming pop items to pop and kill the Abby NMs you need for empyrean upgrades.I dont mean to be snotty I just want you to be informed and not end up wasting a lot of time doing something like an Empy weapon that is pretty much irrelevant.

5134870,0,t3_3lblqm,Youve got a few of options to choose from for thisThe first option is to level a different job to  That shooould be a safe range and do all of the avatar fights that way. In general avatars dont hit very hard until they use their Astral Flow abilities. I cleared all my battles on BST and stayed well away when the avatars started using their nasty BPs downed them all very quickly.Another option is to level SMN with just Carbuncle into a level range where you can solo the Primes. You can either do the level  fights and try your luck there or wait until youre high enough as SMN to safely manage each fight.A third option is to simply ask for help. While you cannot take trusts into prime battles you can still bring in party members. If youre a member of the Asura linkshell pestering people into helping you will get you your avatars pretty fast.Id recommend asking for help if youre eager to get your avatars fast without needing to level another job or leveling with carby only. ,ffxi,cv4xyxr,3,t5_2qn97
5143077,0,t1_cv5wcfc,In another thread I think he misunderstood the Sam guide on FFXI. He looked at the weapon list as a literal numbered rating for them regardless of no numbers actually being attached to them. He most definitely spent half if not more than the cost of his Relic on augmenting stones because he kept posting pictures of his armor sets and it takes a longgg time to get two sets of specific high stats. He should just count his losses and take it as a cheap life lesson. ,ffxi,cv5xlpy,1,t5_2qn97
5143674,0,t1_cv5yrzg,At low lowers youd want to do GoV pages since the level split means mule wont get much of anything from kills. Zeruhn Mines is popular since nothing agros so you can park them in the central area or have them follow without much worry.

With the length of the game as well there is a tone of content to go through now though. So if you want a polished game that is a little slow and requires you to look things up then it might be fore you but if you want tactical choices that directly impact your survival rate this may not be the best choice.

A caveat  Since you are on a newly created adventurer you may not even need to think about this gear until you can upgrade it to i or i in one go.  That means you may not want to buy this until months from now when you have completed the tons of content and items which may be bought through the login campaign as well! required to upgrade your REM to i and i. With that said Teodor is a fairly useful NPC because he will magic burst with the strongest spell available AoE such as ja and ga... they have disadvantages but are all around very strong when magic bursted.  OP has Teodor but for anyone else reading I highly recommend him.Finally I havent a clue on what to spend my login points either.

If you kill both bosses the second boss is a guaranteed linen. Sometimes youll even get a linen from the first boss too very rare. I normally solo Bhaflau II takes me about  minutes and I get a little over  alexandrite per run on average.gt i think  is the most net yeild on tokens?Yup you got it. Original Nyzul yields better tokens than NNI and the higher the floor the better they are so just start at  and go as far as you can.,ffxi,cyhhrdu,1,t5_2qn97

Dynamis drops items needed for Relic Weapons. Abyssea does it for Empyrean weapons. ToAU does it for Mythic weapons. Those events are super easy now because they are below the max player level.Storyline completion is a must if you want to farm Job Points to gain more stats than just equipping level  items. You get a  capacity point gain for each storyline you complete and tag the Records of Eminence objectives for plus some for Adoulin reives and some from Rhapsody KIs.

SAM is still desired for Capacity Points farming for example.  They were king of the hill only a year ago.  So I think you are going to see melee come back into favor at some point in the future.  The great thing about this game is that you can switch jobs at any time so play whatever you think is the most fun for now.  It is not hard to cap the jobs you want at .  Even merits are easy.

6713067,0,t3_47kbav,From the beginning of the story Aphmau the court puppeteer could control both automatons directly. This is likely because of her vivid imagination and playfulness which ventriloquists will tell you is critical just watch one of Nina Contis performances for an example. There is even a moment when Razfahd interrupts her playtime and they abruptly deactivate as she hurries behind the curtain to become Nashmeira. Later when she has Mnejing greet Lady Karababa and Mnejing refers to himself with the royal us he immediately deactivates after Aphmau realizes her mistake and she takes a moment to create a cover story. Its abundantly clear that she is in direct control of both automatons and only loses control when her roleplaying runs into a contradiction.Not only that but Ghatsad explicitly says so during her second coronation.More details on the actual mechanics of the Puppetmaster are revealed in the job quests themselves.As for Luzaf his spirit is indeed freed by the player if you complete Unwavering Resolve. I am confused by your question however because he makes no appearance in RoV except in the Penance cutscene.

You get most of your EXP at first from RoE objectives.So you find a BST just mowing through things for silt and Capacity Points and you ask to join their party for leveling. You just stand there and you get a share of the EXP they are getting which doesnt reduce their capacity points earned and they arent there for EXPlimit points. Usually they wont care about you being there so they will let you join. They can kill mobs nearly as fast as people used to do in Abyssea but you get x the EXP per mob so instead of the old khr Abyssea cleave party youre getting about  million EXP an hour plus bonuses from anything else like RoE EXP rings monster Cheers from the Mog Garden furniture etc.,ffxi,d156jmm,1,t5_2qn97

7282560,0,t1_d258doz,I would say focusing on finishing existing old content is key. I spent a good  months catching up on content before I was ready to do Reisenjima T Escha RuAun Ts. Your class doesnt really matter until you get there but by the time youre ready maybe the meta will have changed! Play your favorite class and finish all the expansions make sure you have access to all the HighTier BCNM battlefields. Pretty much by the time youre done with Zilart gt AdoulinRoV youll be ready to start ZiTahRuAun. Then when you get some pieces from those places you can skip skirmish if you can leech some gear from zitahruaunsinister reign. I think youll eventually see that the fastest way to gear your favorite class say SAM is by making a GEO or WHM and just accruing gear from running content with those classes. The reason for GEO is that its insanely easy to gear up to a very powerful and acceptable level. Get all your spells skill up handbellgeomancy skill get enough JobPoint gifts for geomancyhandbell until you approach  range make a dunna.Dont forget that FFXI has a very nonlinear gear progression path where up until recently il gear introduction many of the best gear pieces came from old content  Rajas ring from CoP Suppanomimi for dualwield classes from Zilart Epona ring from Abyssea Windbuffet Belt from Walk of Echoes or Auction House Moonshade earring from WotG The list goes on and that was just for melee applicable gear! You can fill out your sets very nicely before entering into endgame content and even those pieces are small upgrades from pieces you can achieve  of the effect from easier content.Heres an example of an endgame upgrade from an easy content gear pieceSteelflash earring set to something like these two itemsTelos Earring EarringFor accuracy set only!!

7561051,0,t1_d31lhdr,Being able to solo Ambush is a vital capability that is needed to make sure players have access to content when it stops being the flavor of the month but it does not mean in anyway that because you can do something that you should do something.  As I have said before it is a logistics issue and while I would love SE to open up enough instances to accommodate everyone I can understand that they might not because six instances is enough in the long term of the content just not the short term.  As such it is up to the community to consolidate those resources by teaming up and working together.  SE has added more incentives to help the Community work it out but soloers are still causing heavy congestion.  It is a problem on small servers and its a NIGHTMARE on large ones.  I am sure the free pass isnt going to make it any easier this month either.A full group using a resource to full capacity in no way Handicaps the community it is when one player decides to utilize that node when massive amounts of players are trying to use the content that adds to congestion.  Assuming the average soloer can clear the time matching the average clear time a group clears VD than you can say you are only hindering five other people while handicapping yourself by taking a smaller cut of the reward but if you start to factor that you have to do the content more often to achieve the same desired results...the average soloer has to be faster than the average group to still only be wasting five peoples time.  I am sure soloers are going to try to clear the hardest level they can because of wait times getting back in but that in turn leads to more people being effect as it raises wait times for others.  I would be willing to bet that the time it takes the average soloer to do his thing during congestion ten other people in an average group could have gotten credit for the same efforts.,ffxi,d31nle0,1,t5_2qn97

8181836,0,t3_4rdz52,I think one of them is going to be for the July login campaign based on their history Im thinking the Bomb mount. The other two might possibly come from the new mog garden quests they added. Im in the process of doing the first one which requires waiting in Valkurm for sandstorm weather for Sunsand to use as fertilizer on the fruit seeds my mog gave me. I fertilized the seeds and need to wait less than  hours for my first harvest to hopefully get the item to advance the quest. Since this is the first step and it takes  hours for the fruit seeds to grow Im not sure anyone has advanced the quest yet unless they use a GrowMGood first and then try to use the Valkurm Sunsand which I cannot confirm if it works or not. The other mount might come from the second quest added that comes after the first mog garden quest. This is all speculation so I apologize if my answer is incorrect. EDIT I harvested the fruit seeds. I can now confirm the Ram mount comes from this quest and the Morbol mount comes from the quest afterwards which actually requires a GrowMGood.

8575253,0,t1_d6dc1pk,I think playerparty interaction in FFXI has more to do with the fact that for a very long time FFXI inherently included a lot of downtime and you couldnt alttab so you were either silent or you struck up a conversation for something to do.The obvious case being waiting for a party but even while in a party you did plenty more waiting. Waiting for someones weakness to wear off waiting for the healers MP waiting for someone to get to the camp waiting for a tankhealer to join the party waiting for the goblin to patrol further waiting for teleport to complete casting lol. Even while in combat you were essentially idle quite often because youve got regen on the tank and nobody else is hurt or because your JAs are on CD and youve got nothing else to do but autoattack and wait for TP. Because FFXI could be played in this disengaged fashion you had the time to still talk without really negatively impacting your performance.Even back then that was something of an anomaly for a nonturn based game and its a big part of why FFXI iswas boring to a lot of people. But I think you could also make the case for One great thing about FFXIs long wait times and idlestyle combat was that it let people playing the game effectively simultaneously play and socialize.,ffxi,d6dhmq6,9,t5_2qn97
8578204,0,t1_d6dhm03,No but when the topic at hand is a comparison of two things and you critique an aspect of one the implication is that is does not apply or at the very least is less applicable to the other. I simply dont think thats the case. And I mean the critique itself is dated. I think it was valid early on before the game grew and had more content added. But I think theres certainly evidence of growth when you compare Titan to Leviathan to King Moogle to Ramuh to Ravana. More realtime reactive decision making more realtime communication more planning all comes into play.I think youre giving too much credit to FFXIs AI. I dont even think Id call what they have AI. Its always been my impression that they simply are pools of conditionally available abilitiesspells which are randomly selected. Maybe theyre dynamically weighted to simulate it but I dont think theyre intelligent at all  they mostly do the same random stuff every time regardless of how appropriate or inappropriate it is for the situation. Thats not to say XIVs enemies are smart they arent either but I think the more structured design of their encounters provides a more consistent experience relative to XIs volatile encounters where difficulty comes and goes dependent upon whether good or bad TP moves are selected. I understand why its compelling to have aspects of the encounter be different one time to another which FFXIV does also have but it can also be a frustrating variance when success and failure feel like they hinge on factors outside your control.,ffxi,d6duy3i,4,t5_2qn97

9246358,0,t1_d8nttxw,gt how anyone did endgame without  pieces of gear and swapping out  different setsSimply put Because the game was easier back then.People look on those nostalgic HNM days with entire shells taking forever to kill something and equate that to being difficult. It wasnt  it was simply tedious. Throwing bodies at Kirin was time consuming not a measure of gameplay finese.FFXI is harder now. Long fights where people who own only a single set of clothes autoattack a mob waiting for TP to WS while the mob smacks a dedicated tank have been replaced with shorter more intense fights with constant AoE spam auras almost completely unavoidable terrorparalyzestun mass charms shields and DT gimmicks and the occasional unholy amount of adds.Not to mention mob stats didnt necessitate the amount of gear mob stats do now. Back then most pieces werent really that much better than any other piece. So long as you had level appropriate clothes and the occasional jobdefining item you were about as effective as anyone else.Now you need everything you can get your hands on to come close to performing your job adequetly. You have RDMs with the very best gear in the game in all slots having difficulty landing debuffs with support. You have BLMs with literal billions of gil sunk into HQ abjurations casting the most damaging spell in the game which eats up all their MP in one go and barely putting a dent in the mob. Its not that the community has tricked themselves into thinking they need a bunch of stuff when they dont. They really do need those  pieces of gear because the stats of mobs in combination with time limits which is something else we didnt really have to contend with back then demand it. FFXI is harder than X FFXI. And as such our gear needs have to rise to meet the increased difficulty. Its just the way the game is designed now.,ffxi,d8o1kq4,1,t5_2qn97

Both are still triggered by you invoking the macro or ability.Yes gearswap allows a little bit more automation in that you can check for things like buffs on yourself or weather conditions. You could make macros for those but the limit of how many you can quickly access with keystrokes without having to cycle through more menus limits that.The big benefit is that you can reliably swap on fast abilities.That they added equipsets a couple of years ago shows that gearswap is something that is a function they want on the game.

Its so absurdly difficult to get that though no one should care. Part of the problem though is that Automatons really dont need accuracy. They are already the most accurate thing in the game and you rarely need how much you end up having unless you are doing the highest tiers of content. Unless youre in Pirates chances are pretty goddamn good you arent or youre tanking and your acc doesnt matter. The M.acc however is really nice. No fucking MAB on it continues to piss me off but AMPs and LSMCOF might make it irrelevant. If I can fit ice maker and figure out how to make bursting consistent enough to actually use BLM puppets could be a great option for PUPs who need CP. More interesting though is that this set makes the RDM puppet better.

9794204,0,t1_dak1cx8,Personally i dont think DRK has a lot to bring to table and i never heard people specifically asking for that in any content.I wont be saying that the job is bad but it works as good as any other imo. If you say if DRK work on X content I would say that it depend on how well prepared is the DRK and most likely other jobs can do as good or even better than DRK. But if you like DRK there is no reason to not to work on that afterall this game wasnt balanced so that any gimp job will do better than a more preparated job so if your DRK is above average naturally averaged geared job wont be better.About the other questions I would say the best group play jobs are based on BLM or SCH nukes for a magic burst setup or BLUs for melee oriented setup. BLU is the most wanted melee job atm because it has lots of bonuses just BLU can have like a customized setup of job traits like having acc stp triple attack traits that no job has such thing can reach pretty high accuracy even on a tp set not so heavily acc based has suportive tools like defense for strong foes haste that can cap without any other person and chant du cygne that can reach stupid values when well gearedprepared even if spamming at  tp rudra can be stronger but will require a lot more tp same with fudo.,ffxi,dakcizv,2,t5_2qn97

The knockback on the ring doesnt work if other peoplepets hit by a move do not have knockback equipment applies to most but not all moves in the game.Gorney Ring Renaye Ring Woltaris Ring etc are all pretty garbage too.

It will speed you up tremendously.  You get stuck using a non YoranApu main healer but others can handle it and Sylvie will help with cures and statuses.  I generally use Cherukikki or KaruhaBaruha.

10434567,0,t1_dcqtk9t,I think you hit the nail on the head with everything you said. Its really deteriorating to just log in and do absolutely nothing of substance in a game where there is literally an unlimited supply of content. Even more so when you think back on all the times that you literally would be excited as fuck just to log in and simply level up a job or do quests. Ive thought about your last point a lot and honestly its hard for me to even do that because I think about it and im just like ughhhhh that is so longgg and is it even worth it with most remas?? Like you spend weeksmonths doing constant griding just to get a bit of a boostsometimes a large boost just so you can be a bit more viable in end game content where its not really a deal breaker if you dont have remas unless its like the upper echleon of content.

But first you need to check if the software captures FFXI. I have tried  Fraps Dxtory and Bandicam and only Fraps works.Make sure to cap the framerate to  FPS unless youre willing to render it on  FPS. Some games you can capture on  FPS and render on  FPS and its not that bad but its bad for FFXI.Movie Studio is a paid software but very good if youre willing to spend. Just make sure to configure the Deinterlace method to None.

11529068,0,t3_64gmud,Have you looked into transferring to Asura? You will have much better luck finding people to play with on that server.  Roughly   times the population. ,ffxi,dg2tlh9,2,t5_2qn97
11531778,0,t1_dg1gw6z,So we didnt do Vinipata because people heard about this issue and didnt want to deal with it. ,ffxi,dg34nqn,1,t5_2qn97
11543288,0,t1_dg4ffoa,I my intentions werent clear there. I was merely backing up the Asura being the most popular server point. Ended up coming across as YOU SHOULDVE SEARCHED FIRST which wasnt my intention ,ffxi,dg4flz8,4,t5_2qn97
11569004,0,t1_dg6xk0m,Maybe the spells from wildskeeper reives but they arent vital. That said you will spend hours and hours farming everything you need.Mighty guard is a really important spell and is gated behind  days of abyssea quests if you arent lucky enough to learn first time from the RoV mission.,ffxi,dg7cosb,2,t5_2qn97
11569744,0,t1_dg7ejhh,Piggybacking here.  You can level all crafts to .  You are then allowed to gain up to  additional levels beyond .  You could put all  into one craft and take it to  or split it up amongst a few.  Not sure if the latter is a good choice but I havent researched it.  Also I think fishing and synergy are separate and you can cap those without it impacting your other crafts.,ffxi,dg7fpkt,1,t5_2qn97
11576752,0,t1_dg87nvq,That and a bag of chips.Been awhile since that phrase saw the light of day.No ones asking for life advise. You are off topic.,ffxi,dg88bqc,0,t5_2qn97
11587080,0,t3_65a1pc,A lot of it depends on how much you like crafting.  If I need something that is available on the AH I can either get the raw materials and craft it myself to save a little money but that costs time and time is money.  If something is not available on the AH more noticeably on low pop servers then its convenient to be able to craft it yourself.With regards to your main craft Leathercrafting there are sub crafts which might come into play on some synths and you will HAVE to have that craft leveled or you wont be able to synth it.  Clothcraft Goldsmithing Smithing look like the main sub crafts for leathercrafting in that order.For skilling up purposes there are many routes to take some more efficient or less expensive than others.  If you have to AH some of your products then you might want to consider branching off into other crafts just so you have different things to sell on the AH rather than wait for  stacks of dhalmel leather to move. ,ffxi,dg9eieg,1,t5_2qn97
11589385,0,t1_dg9msmx,Well you cant wear full phalanx  with enhancing duration gear. Not sure why enhancing duration came into it.Anyway what else is someone going to wear during the purely skill based temper? Theres no usually about it. You always wear skill  for temper and always use phalanx  for phalanx.Bar spells dont apply to phalanx and temper. Besides a RUN can get  easily with  duration pieces on and most dont have regal gauntlets. Furthermore a WHM or something generally casts the bars anyway.,ffxi,dg9nxhl,1,t5_2qn97
11639281,0,t1_dgfbhyw,Thanks DActions are activated by pressing    and the active hotbar is toggled using another key which in my European keyboard is the one next to  thats not used ingame.Actions are defined by a type a name and a target for examplema Dia II lttgt   or    ma Cure III ltmegtAnd can be added to the hotbar by either editing an XML or through a command so it basically works by using macros,ffxi,dgfbqly,2,t5_2qn97
11642551,0,t3_663quf,Yeah but theres lag in pulling up the macro bar.   Id love for this to be compatible with gamepad.   Looks top notch well done.,ffxi,dgfp3df,1,t5_2qn97

11777077,0,t1_dguyutv,Off the top of my head once conquest tally but check BG.,ffxi,dguyw8l,1,t5_2qn97
11793505,0,t1_dgwavkv,Yeah they do. I got a few base JSE weapons unaugmented from spamming it the first couple of times.Is it practical to farm if youre after one drop? No but its lucrative if youre after many drops.Just go on a job that can aoe BST BLU BLM GEO WAR RDM or SCH subbing BLM. It really helps with time on killall floors. Every job can solo NNI now but its just silly to go on MNK or RUN etc.,ffxi,dgwu0q0,1,t5_2qn97
