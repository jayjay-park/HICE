Bisexuals would just add a varying amount of men they could be attracted to the mixTo me its not a matter of rigid or flexiblity but just having more specific taste or not. Its like eating dessert some can only stomach warm applepie with whipped cream while others binge hard on banana split and waffles.

8197540,0,t3_4rluau,I understand your reservations and your selfconsciousness about them. The poly way of handling this would be to acknowledge the feelings and follow the fear to its logical conclusion. Are you afraid shell leave you for these men? Probably not. That shell catch a disease or get pregnant? Im sure youve discussed precautions. Is it possible your feelings are about trust? Seeing her go through all the motions for sleazy perverts and then going through similar motions with you different for sure but inevitably similar in some ways. Maybe even offering more effort to the sleazy perverts in some ways  makeup for them when shes too comfortable with you to bother active seduction efforts etc. Are you afraid your relationship might start to feel disingenuous? Then theres what shes getting out of it beyond money. I know you said shes not even really bi and what shes doing doesnt exactly sound pleasant but this would let her scratch that itch if shes a bit fetishy and you dont get to share that. Im just brainstorming. Im not saying fear is the ultimate source of  discomfort or that your discomfort is invalid. You say youre nonmonogamous but even the healthiest poly relationships take a lot of processing and they dont always work out and this isnt your typical sometime third situation that a lot of couples default to. I think its ok to not be ok with this. It could also be ok to let it happen even if youre never totally comfortable with it. Just dont let the resentment build up.,LesbianActually,d528uho,1,t5_3f5dt

8477867,1,t1_d60ldjw,gt TERFs tend to hate on intersectionality In my experience au contraire especially when talking about sex segregated queer spaces. GCers or TERFs as you call them point out how lesbians come under much more pressure criticism threats and exclusion for being unwilling to date transwomen or for trying to organize spaces for ciswomen than gay men do for the same behavior towards transmen. Thats the intersection of sexism misogyny and homophobia right there imho policing womens sexuality especially women whos sexuality excludes men much more so than mens.If you believe transwomen to remain biologically male i.e. Gender and sex are not congruent posttransition andor to have privileged from being perceived as male they may be the lowest rung of the male privilege ladder but they are or have been on the ladder at some point wheres Cis women never have then intersectionality is even more applicable yes transwomen may face transmisogyny but they benefited however unwillingly from male privilege which in our lovely oppressionbased heirarchy here in the western world sets them up to hold privilege over lesbian ciswomen. Does that mean every cislesbian will beat every translesbian in the oppression Olympics no but when talking intersectionality youve gotta take BOTH sex and gender into account.,LesbianActually,d619xse,3,t5_3f5dt

That kind of tolerant where you are actually just judging the person based off of this characteristic isnt okay.On the other hand my mother recently attended the wedding of two of her long time friends who are both female. I know most of these people and they would all describe themselves as tolerant or accepting of the LGBTQ community. However its coming from a place of respect. Obviously like the vast majority of people most of the wedding attendees are straight.

They had two long haired cats that they never brushed so the floor would be completely covered in cat hair and the wifes hair that she would brush as she walked through the house. Most of the house had white tile floor. The cats would vomit everywhere and instead of cleaning it up they would just cover it in white paper towel. So you never knew if you were stepping on the actual floor or a vomit surprise. It was a three bedroom house. We were given the smallest bedroom and literally no other space in the house not even cabinets. We paid half the rent despite having  the space. We didnt really have a choice at the time. The final straw was when they had a kid. They would change his diaper and leave it laying on the floor. We would walk out of our room and there would be a pile of dirty diapers in the hallway.

Most gay men have never had sex with a woman and no one bats an eyelash.Gold Star  are JUST TWO WORDS. Sure you get them in school for being great so I think Gold Star Lesbians are also great for not giving into having sex with men. Theyre not better than the other lesbians who gave in.

Let her know whats going on for you as that is the only way she can know whats going on. Tell her that those little touches ground you and let you know that its okay. Im a very confident person but due to my childhood there are certain situations that trigger me. Being able to feel someone there who just knows I need to know Im not alone is paramount. She grounds me in those spaces and keeps my mind from going all the way back to those times.Given enough time and interactions in those spaces my responses will get less and less. ,LesbianActually,d9ytp94,1,t5_3f5dt

9680522,0,t1_da619k9,Although I wouldnt recommend it as its really gross just try watching straight porn. Its just awful its entirely focused on what the man wants to see and what he wants from the woman. The woman rarely ever gets any pleasure its just switching angles and getting fucked wherever the guy wants it to be. The woman gets no attention or pleasure the biggest focus is on getting the man to finish. Whereas lesbian porn is more intimate and equal less jumping about in camera angles with more focus on pleasuring and making a woman feel good. Albeit there are horrendously fake and OTT lesbian porn for men but its pretty easy spotting the difference between whats for men and women. Also masturbation videos are pretty genuine I cant imagine how someone can fake pleasuring themselves.,LesbianActually,da6btum,17,t5_3f5dt

It is often used to sort of express surprise or satisfaction that a person who looks like me is capable of intelligent or articulate delivery because they might have been expecting otherwise.Instead people will talk about the subject matter.

Thats very misogynist but i guess the only wrong type of misogyny is the one that doesnt fit the bisexual agenda huhgtThis is disturbing. You seem to be misunderstanding sexual orientation and how it works. Many bisexual and heterosexual women arent choosing their sexuality. Nor did many women choose to be oppressed. They let it happen because they didnt stood up for themselves when they should. Women make up more than half of the worlds population men would never be able to opress anyone if those  women werent too busy being doormates instead of fighting for their rights.,LesbianActually,ddfzwce,1,t5_3f5dt

10943073,0,t3_5wa7yy,This is why I for many years explicitly identified with pansexual. I am someone who is willing to date and have sex with any gender identification and genital combinationas long as Im warned what to expect before were in bed together. As time progressed I found I had a preference for females regardless of genitalia. I choose to still identify as pansexual with a preference for women because I wanted any trans individual to know that I didnt care where in their transition they were if there was mutual interest. That being said I have now married a cisfemale lesbian who identifies as a lesbian because she has no desire to have sex with a penis or with a male. She has been called transphobic many times for not wanting to have sex with a female with a penis. She is completely willing to have sex with postop trans women she is just not sexually attracted to penises. I see nothing wrong with this. We should all be allowed to exercise our desire to have sex with any gendergenitalia combination we are comfortable with and not be pressured into sex we dont want to validate someone else. Ones womanhood is not dependent on someone elses desire to sleep with them and sexualizing womanhood that way is not something  I feel comfortable endorsing. Youre a woman no matter what genitalia you have no matter who will or wont sleep with you if you identify as a woman thats what you are. ,LesbianActually,de8p8jd,19,t5_3f5dt
