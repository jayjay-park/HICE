7007115,0,t1_d1a01fe,Ive gotten to be a cardio junkie in the last year or so but I keep getting weird as hell injuries and not being able to do anything for a while   Last week I pulled a muscle in my foot and that has been ridiculously annoying because usually Ill walk laps on breaks at work and this week Ive just had to sit instead.  Its slowly driving me insane.As for drugs...well Ive got nothing to say but please dont die lt,TheChimesAtMidnight,d1alo2d,1,t5_39u4x
