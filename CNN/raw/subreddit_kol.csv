Low Priority.Having never started an ascension that wasnt a CA or a Sneaky Pete Ive never had access to nonclass skills  so all of my new player skills were all focused on making postcore more fun. The challenge paths make obtaining karma so easy that Ive never had cause to look elsewhere and the buffbots in postcore make obtaining ode to booze nonessential.With the most recent few challenge pathsCA AoSP it seems to have a newb friendly pattern where skills are restricted and having permed skills arent helpful  which is why I think this is low priority.,kol,cg4yc1p,2,t5_2rfte

They never realize how much that stuff costs and instead go oh man what can we do now?!

Plus you can then pick any class to go to and get skills from that class.  BIG! is fun you start at level  everyone is harder and Class Act  is nice since it gives you all the class skills when you start the run so awesome for low skill characters.Look for guides based on a path there are a lot more guides for paths.  Theres a great skill and skill HC AoSP guide on the main forums might go look for a link later.Consumption always eat key lime pies for keys! speak easy drinks and special hot dogs are nice.  I usually pull drinks midtier since Im not optimal and am cheap.  This depends a lot on how long your runs are.  If you have a bunch of extra pulls towards the end then Id pull more fooddrinks.
