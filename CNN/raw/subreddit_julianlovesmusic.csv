9689149,0,t1_da69dsc,Yeah it was Pemberton Julian even slipped up and called him Johnny at one point. JP knows his shit. Ill bet he knew Theyre Red Hot is a Robert Johnson cover while the unfunny comedienne with Race Focus  didnt. Other than Jake Cornell and Bryan Cook busting Julians balls this episode sucked. Its like the worst podcast that Ill listen to every episode of.,julianlovesmusic,da7e5hn,4,t5_3cbxr
