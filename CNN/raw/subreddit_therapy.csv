2772870,0,t1_cnhywmn,That is awesome that you are willing to seek help for it. Many people choose to ignore it and hope it goes away. Feel free to post advice or your personal experiences with coping techniques that have worked. That would be good repayment. ,therapy,cnj9k22,2,t5_2r76d

When it comes to adults abusing adults that may be financially dependent but not in terms of dailyliving activities thats not something a mandated reporter would need to report but something that you could follow up with law enforcement about. edit Also proud of you for getting some therapy. Unfortunately bad shit happens to good people. I wish you the best of luck. ,therapy,cpoawwb,1,t5_2r76d

8505296,0,t3_4w7ka7,It is possible that a part of you is a bit anxious about engaging with people. Engaging with people requires revealing yourself to some extent. Do you think that this bothers you somehow? Does it seem somewhat risky to put yourself out there?,therapy,d64pt3e,1,t5_2r76d
8527727,0,t1_d63i8c1,Honestly I almost thought I was the only one struggling with this stuff.  Nice to know im not alone.,therapy,d67j2i2,1,t5_2r76d
8808589,0,t1_d76m2ja,Thanks so much for your response. I really liked what you described about feedback informed therapy. With this therapist Ive mostly gotten the vibe that shes selfrighteously correcting me rather than fully hearing me out or attempting to see where Im coming from. Shes even thrown some biblical language at me that I wasnt too keen on comparing some of my marital problems to oldtestament scenarios. ?? Not exactly how I want to model my marriage. Were currently working on a rapid eye movement desensitization exercise that was initially meant to alleviate my panic attacks. Its a long process so I want to stick it out until we finish that so I wont have to start over. In the meantime I think Ill start shopping around for someone else. ,therapy,d76o7ph,1,t5_2r76d

10646474,0,t3_5sceyx,Honestly you shouldnt worry too much about whether or not they will care about cancelling. In the end theyre a business and youre a customer! If their service isnt working for you then choose to go to another therapist. I would understand if it were mandatory for you to attend there but at the time being doing what you need to do to find help is what youre seeking. Choose the best life for yourself!,therapy,dde3ojt,3,t5_2r76d
10926002,0,t3_5uuc9y,I felt the same way... that I should see a male therapist because I had issues with my father to deal with. I had even been given that advice because it would help me to start trusting men. I asked my doctor for a referral and it was not a good experience for me. He became very flirtatious over time and eventually said he had very strong feelings for me. He gave me special attention and told me how great he felt when he got to see me. It started to feel like I was paying him to make him feel better. I left but he continued to call me to try to convince me to come back. When I told him that I was upset about the things he had done he took it very personally and stopped calling me. I was very open with him about personal things in the beginning. All I got from this was another experience of a man that I should have been able to trust but ultimately wished I wouldnt have. A lot of male therapists can be trusted Im sure but I wish I could get back all the time money and most of all trust that I put into that.,therapy,de6xvk3,2,t5_2r76d

Call an ambulance and request only female medics if you are afraid of men to enter your home. Im happy for you that you took a first step and looked for help here but you have to do just a little bit more. Call somebody! ,therapy,dgbtqs7,1,t5_2r76d
