Nothing dramatic just a reminder that its better to download at night. They used to have very heavy traffic management but they seem to have relaxed about that.Overall I wouldnt really recommend them and I mildly wish I could switch to another ISP but the problem is that my home doesnt have a telephone line and BT would charge a small fortune to install it.
