Nvidias latest generation is the gtxxx with the gtxti being the expensive top of the line latest tech.   AMD bought ATI a while back has the Fury which is pretty good but also is has the r xx line which are pretty good with the Fury nano being the best gpu for small form factor.  Depending on budget Id suggest going with a core i skylakeddr system  the gpu is really up to what games you wanna play to what brand of gpu to go with.  Just stay away from AMDs current CPU offerings  they chug power single core performance is lacking and the chipset tech is really long in the tooth. ,steambox,d198wn7,1,t5_2to01
7054955,0,t1_d1ehcnt,gt its more of a console than upgradable pc. thats the point of itYea you are right and thats why it is a complete failure.No one asked for nor wants the negatives of a console amp the negatives of a PC without the benefits of either.There is no market for A Console that is inferior in every single way to all other Consoles or A PC that is inferior in every single way to a PC. Its the worst of both amp the best of neither. Thus a failure.gtnot a failure at all. the steamos limited games thing is being fixedLOL when you have to immediately followup with a defense of an enormous flaw you seriously weaken your initial argument not a failure at all.No one is going to disagree with you that lt of users use it. Im sure some people use it every day amp some people love it. Its just that those users are lt amp as a business idea especially compared to Fanboys amp Valve wanting to try to hurt Microsofts domination of PC gaming or the Revival of Linux it is a complete failure.,steambox,d1g1e1y,1,t5_2to01
