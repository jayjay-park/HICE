7279946,0,t3_4e09v0,I used strong glasses prescribed by my opthalmologist  the same for distance and for reading. Strabismus never went off.When I went to orthoptist he prescribed me immediately to change glasses to use weaker for reading. Because too strong glasses made my eyes tired and thus provoked strabismus. Although it was not the main cause or other causes were present too. And started  vision training the same day. Proper glasses are important. While progressing in training of stereovision I changed glasses a few times.,Strabismus,d25ojc5,1,t5_2vssx
7644394,0,t1_d39kn1y,Thank you for your reply! I tend to agree with you based on my experiences with surgery consultations and vision therapy as well but the fact that the perception was accurate and could be confirmed by touch really had me puzzled. I would have expected it to be inaccurate if it were some sort of depth hallucination but who the heck knows!,Strabismus,d3b4k76,1,t5_2vssx
8733487,0,t1_d6vkb9r,gt I personally suffer from torsion and I believe convergence insufficiency. Most of what I see is blended together except the center of my vision which is slightly ofThis is my issue too.  Ive overcome almost everything else except for the torsion.  My optometrist doesnt think its possible but I know there must be a way.Most peoples eyes can slightly rotate and move vertically as their head tilts slightly in order to keep the image straight.  I think this may be the key.  At least.... if weve managed to get our eyes to converge properly we should be able to do rotation as well.Would you mind adding an option for slight vertical motion?  Im not sure if it will work or if just tilting your head slightly would do the same thing.  But worth a shot I guess?To umrencrypt Ive definitely come to the same conclusion as you regarding exercise.  I always do VT after exercise. Another guy Ive come across does handstands before VT.  I sometimes do handstands while doing VT.  I think this is beneficial because it is actively working the visual systems in the brain leading to neuroplasticity.  As that study showed when people wore prisms that flipped their vision upsidedown their brain flipped it back after only a few days IIRC.,Strabismus,d6xbys3,2,t5_2vssx
10728927,0,t1_ddml14f,I have amblyopia not strabismus. The doctor sees how Im doing and adjusts the settings. He says its at a higher difficulty now than when I started. I havent seen any real life changes yet. Im hopeful though...,Strabismus,ddmlx98,1,t5_2vssx
