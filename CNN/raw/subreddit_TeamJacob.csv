7269284,0,t1_d24gqxz,Okay fair point.  So who is going to suggest this?,TeamJacob,d24guk5,1,t5_3d72o
7281138,0,t3_4f2wek,Also does anyone have any idea who we want to kill and RB tonight? I assume dep will be KBOd probably with sunshine or BBT or someone else who cant be harmed. Seminaryharry will probably be protected by a doctor. Also I think Mathy might be lying about only having  alerts left. And I have a sneaking suspicion whitbeyondmeasure is the doctor that saved nerdy.,TeamJacob,d25tf3c,2,t5_3d72o
7293277,0,t1_d276vnr,Beg them to investigate you tonight  claim townie if you dont want to risk being caught in a lie raise suspicion on KeinWegZurueck visiting seminaryharry too suggest him for lynching instead of you. Offer help to the town  BBT should watch Fizzie whoever said CC should attack QF last night may be a wolf etc. etc. Provide personal reasons for being absent. EDIT ALSO REMIND THEM THAT THE GHOSTS ARE  RIGHT NOW  DEP IS A DOCTOR NOT A WOLF AND SALMON IS A TOWNIE NOT AN IMPRINTED. ,TeamJacob,d27736n,1,t5_3d72o
7303838,0,t3_4ffcj2,Actually ulikeitspooky ukemistreekat ulovell do you think I should tell the town theyre wrong about QF? gtIm pretty sure Quirinius Faust is either the Distractor or the Puppet Master. Has anyone been controlleddistracted the last two nights? QF cant be the youngest or alpha vampire because knon was killed last night. But QF also cant be the youngest or alpha wolf because TalkNerdy said they were attacked by wolves but healed a couple of nights ago and I assume if they had been roleblocked Nerdy wouldnt have been attacked at all. gtIm leaning towards QF being the Puppet Master because if the PM is being RBed the vampires can only attack or silence. Whereas if QF was the Distractor the wolves would still be able to attack and confuse which is more useful than distracting IMO. Either way QF is not linked to attacks so lynching him would not harm us in any way. Although I do think one of the other Superfans managed to RB the wolves last night since no one got a message like Nerdys about being healed. Although I dont know if its worth sharing this. On one hand people might trust me. On the other if Im right the vampires wont like me. As well we know QF isnt a threat dead because the PM role wont be given to another vamp but we only know that because were wolves and I cant think of any reason a townie might have that info. I assume the vamps think the PM role will be given to another vamp because why else would they want to kill QF. EDIT A townie who read the rulesroles really meticulously would know. Except for having a bullseye on my back courtesy of the vamps it might be good to share this. But Ill wait til the daytime so that the vampires dont decide to kill me lol. Also darthrobyn is probably a gravedigger. EDIT nerdy didnt specify if she was attacked by wolves or vamps. My theory wont work for the town. Although it is probably correct. ,TeamJacob,d28eb7f,1,t5_3d72o
