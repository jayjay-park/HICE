373195,0,t3_1ycbmt,We dont need to have two different leagues if we could get  teams. We could just use divisions instead and use the american system. Heavy interdivision play with some games between divisions.Also I feel we should aggressively expand for the sake of future seasons. One problem MLTP had was that there was little consistency between seasons because they had to expand so many times. I feel tagpro will continue to grow and having a main league with  teams would mean we probably wont have to increase the league size much more after that.If we do aggressively expand we should have no keeper players for next season but do the first round of the draft early so that Captains will have help in deciding the drafting the rest of the team. After that I believe we should have  keepers a year.As for eltp when we get to level where the player base is high we should use the same system the spanish leagues use. A promotion based league system where the b teams can make it up to the second highest league.I think for the we should have ELTPeltp on satsun or sunmon with ELTP first then eltp. Depending on player availability.As for Americans why not have a minutes limit instead? Also I dont think we need heavy restrictions on them. Eventually the chord players will get to a level where they are at least equal on chord ping with american players. Based on the stats none of the americans are at the highest level due of ping. Captains have to realise that american players are generally better on average but their room for growth is ultimately capped due to their ping.,ELTP,cfjg3ge,2,t5_2zarq

384147,0,t3_1ycbmt,About free agentsI think we should have a set day where the rosters are updated lets say Wednesday. All waivered players go to their teams all nonwaivered players choose what team they want to go to. You can send them a message before Wednesday but they cant make their choice yet until after Wednesday maybe some other captain wants them as well.This removes the need for the three day waiver only thing and gets rid of the first come first served for the rest of the free agents. The only con is that you cant pick up a free agent right before your eLTP match but you shouldnt be doing that anyway.,ELTP,cfkkyqu,1,t5_2zarq

We didnt make the playoffs or anything but of course we still want to be involved in the weekend of awesome. The fact that other people arent doing this for other teams doesnt mean The Rookster is doing anything wrong just that hes taking the initiative a bit more you know? If by current champions you mean this season then theyll probably be too busy playing in the final to want to do any exhibition matches. Theres nothing stopping any of the previous champions challenging S Ballern if they want to just like theres nothing in the rules stopping us from challenging S Ballern for a fun exhibition game. I dont think so and I dont think S Ballern should really have any right to dictate what S Ballern does with their time. Theres nothing in it for S Ballern if they play Ballrussia just like theres essentially nothing in it for the two teams in the ELTP final. Tagpros a game were all just trying to have fun right?

That would be even more damaging than just a bad idea. Thats why you cant scrap this now.Im mainly concerned that such a polarising and in my opinion backward concept was announced in concrete out of the blue instead of publicly discussed as a proposal first.

4194739,0,t1_crydpc4,I definitely think youre right but previously all that happened was players did it behind closed doors and potentially to a mass of captains. In an ideal world either everyone would be mature enough to have not abused the previous system or the current one or captains could be mature enough to help punish players who abused the previous system. I think the best scenario would have been the commissioners going behind closed doors and asking captains to tell them whenever they got a request to not draft a player and then make it clear publicly that players must not abuse that but not mention theyre checking with captains. This would have allowed the commissioners to catch out those who were abusing it whilst making the rule change necessary to punish those who did.This new system does seem like its going to punish captains and give an amnesty to those who abused the old system but its pretty much the only way without forcing more work onto captains. Making it official at least allows it to be monitored by the commissioners easier.,ELTP,cryebxu,2,t5_2zarq

6701993,0,t1_d0chkdn,gt since essentially theres not reason for the captain to have to name the person who hes bidding on in your system until he has won the round of bidding and has to pick the player.This is a valid point. From an auction standpoint naming the desired player before winning the bid is unnecessary bureaucracy. However it does provide more insight into the value of players after the auction completes and all unsuccessful sealed bids are revealed. Specifically willingnesstopay can be observed in addition to the eventually paid price.As an example in the first round I may bid on Some Ball  because I think he is a good offender. However I lose the first few rounds during which many good defenders are assigned to other teams. Thus I will now place a high bid on a defender otherwise Ill have scrubs on defence. Assume this bid wins. In later rounds I may not have enough money left to repeat my initial bid on Some Ball  so lets assume I get Some Ball  later on for a lower price than my initial bid. After the auction is over everybody can now see that my willingnesstopay for Some Ball  was higher than the eventually paid price.,ELTP,d0cjlit,1,t5_2zarq

We tried to restructure the vote to prevent all of the same maps being in and then asked the community what proportion of each group of map they wanted to play. We listened and based the proportion of maps on what you said yet by and large the response has been extremely negative. I would love to hear suggestions on how to restructure the vote in a way that still maintains what the community wants but these are the maps you voted for in the proportions that you voted for.Looking down the votes Scorpio is the new map with the highest proportion of votes  we will look to put it in place of one of the classic or newer maps that were voted in.Lastly I will probably continue to host semiregular competitive maps tournaments and hope in the future of manages to produce more polished maps.,ELTP,d1bpp82,8,t5_2zarq

9810264,0,t1_damb9ui,Im sure EMERALD would have won if it was added to this vote but the community also voted to have more new maps this season. Maybe people would value having new maps over their personal third favourites getting in so it might not be as clear cut as expected.Its a useful comparison because the votes were done based on the criteria that was discussed and agreed upon by the commissioners based on the aforementioned community interest in new maps.You said in another comment that you want ELTP to play maps that the players enjoy. It may be true that players would enjoy EMERALD more than Curb but players also have shown they enjoy having new maps in the ELTP rotation more than they enjoy keeping the same old maps. It was probably difficult for the commissioners to decide on a reasonable balance but this is what theyve gone with. This will almost certainly be something to discuss for next seasons commissioners.Edit Sorry I misunderstood your initial comment my bad.

11337537,0,t3_61r9yk,A few more big mistakes Id like to add. Letting the FC boostbomb at your baseIf you let the FC take a clean boost at your endzone its pretty much a guaranteed cap. Theres either going to be too many options for the defence to cover and if youre up against some MagicBerlin tier booster you can almost guarantee theyll do something youd never even have thought of covering or theyll just boost into the back of a defender and chaincap.The best example of this and the most OP boost in the game is the team boost on Bulldog and I made a handy guide for my team about it back in S  Basically  cut an offender off at a boost by approaching them from the direction theyre most likely to boost in.Similarly. Sniping backwards towards your own baseThis is kind of the reverse of the previous one basically you never want the flag travelling at high speeds towards your own endzone even if you happen to be holding the flag. If they have people in the endzone and you pull off a YOLO snipe back towards your own base then youre basically just a projectile heading towards your own endzone that they need to get in front of. . Having the wrong person tag the FCThis one is very situational and its something that I think most people overlook. In CTF it doesnt matter that much who tags the FC because the result from either of you tagging them is the same theyre dead. However obviously in NF the person who tags them is going to wind up with the flag so you need to think ahead to that. Essentially when there are two people cornering an FC and trying to tag him only one of them should actually be trying to tag them the other is just trying to reduce options for them and trying to remove any blocks.Heres a shitty diagram that should explain this a bit where one set of arrows demonstrates the player tagging them and the other set represents the direction the flag would move in as a result If the bottom red player tags the blue FC then he runs the risk of the blue player behind him getting possession after he has tagged them which would probably lead to a cap whereas if the top red player tags the blue FC then they have a much better chance of getting out of danger. The bottom red player should aim to get behind the blue player without the flag and push them allowing the top red player to try to tag them.edit a similar principle to having the wrong person tag the FC is that if  players are closing in on someone one with a TagPro and one without the player with the TagPro should try their hardest to let the other player tag them. Heres another handy diagram If the red with the TagPro makes the tag here then congratulations noob you just missed a great opportunity to set up a TagPro lead. This also applies if one of the players has a JJ  dont waste your JJs by having them off the flagwaste your TagPros by having them on the flag.edit I actually found a nice little video clip of exactly this Notice how if I had ran in and tagged Sea. I would have probably been killed by either Ploffin or Sherra which would have completely killed our attack. Instead I took the safe option and let kutrebar tag Sea giving us a pretty much guaranteed cap. Also worth mentioning is that because I had a TagPro I didnt know that Ploffin was going to be spawning there  a less experienced player might look at that situation and think theyre in the clear to make the tag but you can never be too safe.,ELTP,dfh396o,7,t5_2zarq

11381855,0,t1_dfm3n7m,Thanks for the infoCould you inform me about bidding and snake drafts.What is the currency and how do teams get it?In the snake draft is it like each captain just picks the best player out of a crowd until there is none left?What times is gamestrainings?Do you know the maps before the season but after they have been picked or is it kept secret?What type of skill level is the league would i fit in or need to be more experienced before i play?And again thanks for helping ,ELTP,dfm446k,3,t5_2zarq

11599103,0,t1_dgaqa0w,Its definitely possible you just put the first season they captained in. At least I can see it working out that way and then maybe you can look at adding more times people captained. The large gap between seasons like that will just be a longer line.,ELTP,dgarmcc,2,t5_2zarq
