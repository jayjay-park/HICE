3633408,0,t1_cq6f5xf,Ah I see what you mean now. Ive only heard of companies providing photographers with equipment in very rare circumstances and only then for cheap keyring providers here in the UK. Youre exactly right about using your own gear that youre used to.. just people like CanonNikon will try and force it on them.Ive seen a kid on Instagram get given a Canon Dx for just having a big following. Its cheap exposure for them and I can understand why they do it. In reality theres pretty much nothing between Canon and Nikon DSLRs. Theres the raging old debate about image quality and that but when it comes down to an album youre never ever ever ever going to tell which one was taken with which equipment.Im personally keeping a close eye on the mirrorless tech at the moment. The sensors are incredible. Huge dynamic range and great at high ISOs. The only thing holding them back for me is that the focusing is too slow or totally manually. Theyre ideal for video mind and a lot of my peers use a Sony AS for videos and just use lens adapters from their Canon gear. Im not video person myself so havent tried it but Ive seen and heard some great things with them.I also dont like how small they are  they look like theyd feel a bit cheap and fiddly like a point and shoot when Im used to the fullhanded grip of a DSLR.The possibilities with them once the lenses and focusing techniques are sorted is exciting though.I better get buying Facebook likes and Instagram followers ,UMF,cq6fpfl,1,t5_2sj4r
