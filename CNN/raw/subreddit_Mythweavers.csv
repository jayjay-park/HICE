4177651,0,t3_38o32d,This sub is really exciting to me. I love exactly this kind of thing.Id love to hold discussions with people about existing works of literature as well. Ive always been a huge fan of this series by A.A. Attanasio the Arthor Series it retells the Arthurian Legend with a lot of syncretic storytelling methods that mesh together the gods of the various peoples of that time in a way that isnt dismissive or disdainful of any one or the other. Been wanting to find some people to discuss the series with from a pagan perspective.,Mythweavers,crwggz6,2,t5_38d80
