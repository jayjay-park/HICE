If it remains flat it will cause greater uncertainty due to the impact it may have on companies abilities to access capital but its primarily the signal that shows markets are uncertain about the health of the economy.

292746,0,t3_1xewcs,From a quantitative view point you dont need to go into penny stocks to satisfy your appetite for risk which is measured by return standard deviation.Penny stocks have high upside and downside potential. This gives them an interesting bell curve distribution which has a higher standard deviation or more risk when compared to a stable company such as a utility.While the average annual return for small cap stocks may be higher you find that you are paying for it by taking on additional risk. To compare apples to apples we divide average annual return by a stocks standard deviation to rate them from best to worst.For example a stock that returns  average annually that has a standard deviation of  is rated .. Another stock that returns  average annually that has a standard deviation of  is rated ..In the example the second stock provides more return per unit of risk . so it is the better performer. Now if you want to get to  simply use leverage. Lets make it simple and say you borrow  of your total investment so your average annual return is roughly  after interest and your standard deviation is .    looks way better than   . If you wanted to match the  risk you would have a return of . However at  risk you may be getting a margin call you cant cover and youll have to sell at a loss and screw yourself over.So this isnt an argument against penny stocks its an argument for finding good companies in general and investing in those. However your chances of picking a good company out of penny stocks versus picking a good company out of wellcovered largecap companies that are well entrenched in the economy are extremely low. gtinto stocks to make some moneySo you want to make money. Going extremely risky is not the way to go right now. If you lose  percent of your capital you have to gain  to get back to zero. Capital preservation is extremely important in wealth creation.Because you cant borrow money to leverage your investment you will have to find other forms of leverage. Or as many people put it sweatequity.You can spend all your time researching companies to get  annual returns but at  you will only get  in a year. Make a mistake and you are far behind.Or you can invest in large wellcovered companies that return an average  utilize the widely available public research and use your extra time to get more shifts save money and go to school. You could be getting multiples on your wealth yearly from the savings and continue those gains as you go through your education and increase your salary. Eventually your salary will start to contribute less and less to your overall wealth and your investment returns will provide more and more. However this is a long time out and probably wont start to provide any noticeable impact until you are at  or more in investments. Even then depending on how much you can save your salary can contribute quite a bit to your wealth generation.They say the first  is the hardest to make and this is because its  from your sweatequity.Once you have amassed a large amount of wealth and your income has pushed you to a higher tax bracket more opportunities for leverage arise as banks will begin to take you more seriously with loans as you have more assets and you can gain more from tax leverage.,finance,cfb3weg,1,t5_2qhfj

Investments is about valuation presentation and other clienttransactioncentered duties. Youll be expected to dress sharp act sharp and want to make a lot of money without two shits about how much crap you have to wade through to get it. Youll need to know the difference between buy side and sell side before learning more.Corporate finance is like being a maintenance officer on an aircraft carrier. Theres a big beast that has to be able to keep moving smoothly so that its ready to do what the Captain and officers needs it to do. Youll be expected to have an eye for detail and a willingness to be on standby to solve problems prepare reports and consolidate data.

772003,0,t1_cgrxxbz,I think you should look into empirical default rates. Not even the top borrowers repay with . frequency. Homes are foreclosed cars repossessed etc. all the time. Student loan default rates are relatively very high. There is easily accessible data on corporate defaults and those arent uncommon either.As far as being recoverable in the legal system courts are only going to enforce a contract to the extent that they support its legality. If someone cant repay their debt no court can conjure up money on their behalf. Especially in the case of a personal loan you can walk away from virtually any debt at any time. The compensation for that risk is in the interest rate. Theres a reason some personal loans have  APR.A technical note on corporate defaults data will show that investment grade debt rarely defaults and you might be tempted to believe that holding an IG bond is therefore safe. The underlying problem with this line of thinking is that ratings change over time so in a majority of cases your IG bond will be reclassified as CCC before it defaults and the data will continue to show that IG debt doesnt default.,finance,cgs14me,1,t5_2qhfj

From buyside TRS are used mostly in sec lending for forms of levered performance that a fund may not necessarily wish to PB or cant.  There are plenty of intl securities that can only be financed on swap depending on country and not PB... same goes for if the fund wants exposure to the rate movements but might run into issues additional regulatory headaches from having too large of a ownership position.Our stockloan desk can essentially take shares that we have PBd say a client picked up a  SMV on stock x and lend their performance out to participants in the market who needs long exposure.  This way we earn a ROA via financing spreads on the asset both on the  SMV from the PB client and the incoming financing charges from whoever bought the swap from the desk.In the case of international securities countries like India can be sensitive about how security flow occurs who owns what and on what leverage.  So in these cases we have to purchase the security under our India domiciled firm place it on our balance sheet and write out swaps to the clients who want exposure.tldr  TRS allows us to increase our ROA by increasing revenue while maintaining balance sheet size and let us offer leverage on securities a client may not otherwise have access to.,finance,chn98n6,3,t5_2qhfj

1096815,0,t1_chsag0q,Yup the final cash flow was something that I overlooked. I was pretty sloppy there especially at the end. When I was calculating my wrong terminal value I put it in the cell where the final cash flow should be. Normally I have the terminal value in a separate row so I can see it better. That doesnt matter much in this caseIf you see my response above to umodelingadvice youll see that when finding the TV I mustve mixed up the perpetuity growth method and the exit multiple method. So rather than using a long term growth rate and applying it FCF I used the EBIT multiple and applied it to FCF which really doesnt make much sense now.Why I used EBIT rather than EBITDA Im not so sure. I think that I looked at the numbers I had saw I added back DampA and used EBIT rather than EBITDA. But that was all in finding FCF so that shouldnt have factored into my decision. So Ill ask you the same question I asked above If I was using the EBITDA multiple to find TV would I do EBTDA multiple x  EBITDA discounted back using WACC to find present value?Ive seen a couple people mention sensitivities analysis. So I guess I have one question regarding that should I make a separate sheet where I can present that more clearly? How should I present the analysis or show it? I can change the different values in my current model to yield different results but should I have another section showing what the effects of some changes such as revenue growth rate WACC margin as you suggest does to my final value?Thanks for youre advice though.

There is no return of capital capital gain etc... if there is not a distribution.  There would only be a distribution if there is available cashretained earnings.  gtmakes RoC heavy funds a great income tax deferral strategy for retireesIt doesnt work that way.  Return of capital is the amount of money invested in the stock.  Return of capital is captured in basis and basis for stock at least is generally acquisition cost.  Return of capital reduces the asset stock basis and distributions greater than the basis will produce ordinary dividend income.  So when you receive cash distributions some of the cash will be returned tax free as return of capital however the new adjusted basis of the asset is far lower which will mean two things if sold the stock will have capital gains of fair market value  basis and distributions greater than basis will be taxed as ordinary dividend income.  Furthermore the new basis for the stock in the hands of the inheritors would be the fair market value of the stock.  A quick read on tax basis will clear this all up.   ,finance,ci9dmx0,2,t5_2qhfj

Filosofien til Charles Biderman grunnlegger og leder av TrimTabs Investment Research er priser p Wall Street en funksjon ikke s mye av inntektene i tilbud og ettersprsel.At filosofi ville vre noe skurrende  en student av corporate finance Faktisk sier en klassisk teoremet at i fravr av reelle friksjon et selskap verken hjelper eller gjr vondt aksjonrene nr det kjper og selger aksjer lner penger eller betaler utbytte.Som for aksjer gr opp fordi de er mangelvare finans professoren kan godt be Biderman hvordan kunne det vre en knapphet p noe som kan produseres med et museklikk? Selskaper kan utstede flere aksjer nr de fler at det.De kan men de ikke. Hvis et selskap som Apple eller M kjper egne aksjer i det pne markedet Biderman sier er det mer sannsynlig at innsidere forvente gode ting fra virksomheten. TrimTabs eier begge disse bestandene.Hvis Twitter eller Alibaba selger aksjer i et offentlig tilbud som kan vre fordi smarte penger vurderer prisingen rike. Biderman nsker ikke  eie aksjer som de.Men quirky Biderman teorien ser p papir fungerer det passably i praksis. Fondet er  siden det pnet sine drer i oktober  i samme periode er S amp P s kumulative avkastningen .Hulene dypere inn i sin teori om hva gjr Wall Street kryss Biderman beskriver eiendelervarer eller aksjersom chips i et kasino.

Og vanlige investorer kan forbedre sine sjanser ved  se hva innsidere gjr.Hvis det er en bit av kynisme i Biderman kan det vre skylden p det faktum at den  r gamle startet sin karriere som journalist assistent til Alan Abelson den mangerige redaktren av Barrons.

I en verden der enhver bedrift kan rasjonelt erstatte sitt kvartalsvise utbytte med en tilbakekjpsprogram men bare noen gjr hva tilbakekjp forteller oss? Kanskje prospekter at innsidere p disse selskapene se bedre fremover. Det er ikke ulovlig for en bedrift i motsetning til ledere  kjpe tilbake aksjer p innsidehandel informasjon eller  selge p innsideinformasjon om ting blir verre Biderman sier.Du kan ikke legge for mye tro i r del reduksjoner siden corporate treasurers timing er ufullkommen. Tilbakekjp var hy i  nr aksjer var dyrt s krympet i dypet av nedgangstider nr aksjer var billig.S ser Biderman for ytterligere bevis p at andel tilbakekjp er et tegn p styrke.

2067283,0,t3_2iihho,So heres a rundown of what I know given I teach the Series  professionally...Corporate bonds exist solely for companies to raise capital just like ukidcrumb says. Think of it just as you would a credit card or a car loan. The company does not extend any form of ownership through bonds but they do legally obligate themselves to paying creditors back. If the company cannot make payment on their existing bonds creditors or bond investors can force a company to liquidate their assets to make payment or declare bankruptcy. Typically larger companies issue bonds in the millions of dollars.I want to expand a little more on another thing ukidcrumb said. Instead of borrowing millions upon millions of dollars from a bank the company borrows little pieces normally in  chunks from multiple sources. Why doesnt a company just go to a bank? Its solely because of risk. Think about it  if the bank loaned out  million not uncommon for a blue chip companys bond issuance and that company goes under the bank would likely follow. The only way the bank could mitigate these potential loses would be by raising their interest rate substantially. A bond issuance gets around this problem by spreading risk to hundreds if not thousands of sources.Corporate bonds have many types of structures. Lets talk about a few. Bonds in general are either backed by collateral or by full faith and credit which is another way of saying they promise to pay back the money. Blue Chip companies like G.E. or Johnson amp Johnson have no problem issuing bonds with no collateral as they have proven track records and businesses. Oh the flip side when a company issues a bond with collateral its usually because theyre either an unproven company or they are seeking an issuance of bonds at a lower interest rate. The safer a bond is or appears the lower the interest rate thats demanded. A common form of collateralized bonds are Mortgage Bonds. These bonds are backed by real estate owned by the company  i.e. a utilities company issues a bond with its facilities pledged as collateral. If the company couldnt pay back the bond the bondholders would have a legal right to liquidate these assets to get their money back. Another common form of this includes Equipment Trust Certificates i.e. an airline pledges its planes as collateral.Companies issue bonds just like they issue stock  through an underwriter. Most companies choose an underwriter on a negotiated basis meaning they hand picked the investment bank to be their underwriter. In contrast municipalities typically choose an underwriter through a bidding process to ensure theyre getting the best possible deal. Companies typically have an investment bank relationship and do business with the people theyre most familiar with. During the underwriting process the company works with the investment bank to determine how much capital to raise what interest rate to offer and what features the bond should have. Common features for a bond include calls the right for the company to cancel the bond prematurely and pay back principal and puts the right for the bondholder to cancel the bond prematurely and get back their principal. Bonds with call features are issued at higher interest rates while bonds with put features are issued at lower interest rates.Interest rates are the most important factor with anything bond related. The issuer the company wants to issue bonds at the lowest possible interest rate while still enticing enough investors to buy bonds in the amount of capital they are trying to raise. This is why an underwriter is needed  they provide financial guidance and are the main marketers of the bond. Once the bond is issued and sold the company gets the money from the issuance minus the spread paid to the underwriter for its services. The company is now obligated to pay interest usually semiannually until maturity. Each bond has a unique maturity which can range from just a few days to several decades. At maturity the company pays the principal back to the bondholder.Between issuance and maturity the bondholder has a few options. First they can hold the bond until maturity collecting interest along the way. Alternatively they can sell the bond at any time in the secondary market. The market price of the bond is based on several things but once again interest rates are the main driving factor. If current interest rates have gone up since the issuance of the bond the price of the bond will go down and vice versa. The rate established at the issuance of the bond is locked in forever until the bond matures. The only thing that changes is the price of the bond. The last paragraph demonstrates the toughest concept for my students in the Debt portion of the Series  test. The inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices is sometimes a tough pill to swallow. The best way to understand is simply through an exampleLets say we buy a  year Ford Motor Company bond. At issuance we buy the bond at a par value of  with a stated interest rate of . Lets also assume that  is the prevailing interest rate for corporate bonds for companies like Ford. As time progresses interest rates undoubtedly change. Lets say in  years interest rates are now at . If we want to sell our Ford  bond in the secondary market do you think we can sell it for the  we originally paid for it? No. Anyone in the bond market can simply buy a new bond from another company or sometimes the same at the prevailing market rate of . To make our bond attractive to the market we need to drop the price of our bond from . We could likely find a buyer if we offered our bond at . Remember the issuer will still pay principal back to the holder of the bond at maturity. In this example if we sold our bond at  the buyer would get a bond at a lower interest rate but would also benefit on  capital gain from our price drop. This example works exactly the same in the opposite manner. Sorry for the data dump  I hope some of this was useful.,finance,cl2likb,52,t5_2qhfj

For credit analysis capitalizing leases is appropriate if the assets underlying leases were abandoned the company wouldnt have the assets to generate its cash flow to service the debt. It would have to enter new leases or purchase the assets outright.. For benchmarking of margins or returns on capital capitalizing leases is also appropriate you can artificially boost ROIC through sale and leasebacks that inflates the capitalstructure neutral profitability just like most analysts dont use ROE for benchmarking because leverage inflates it. Further adjusting EBITEBITDA important to add back embedded interest cost in the lease expense.. For equity valuation I find lease capitalizing  adding back to FCFF and blending into WACC has minimal impact on value as long as you adjust discount rate appropriately... e.g. for a retailer leasing its real estate equity discount rate should be a lot higher to reflect increased operating leverage and volatility in earnings.,finance,cmyock2,3,t5_2qhfj

But it is an absolutely fantastic course it starts off with basic concepts and with a bit of pace goes through a ton of concepts. For instance it even introduces you to the basics limits derivatives and integrals which for most part is just refreshing of memory and then moves to second order partial derivatives Lagrange and so on meanwhile showing also application in finance by introducing Black and Scholes how the Greeks are derived and so onAnd one more that starts in  days  is more focused on Econometrics than maths Last time around I did not have time to go the whole way through but the first half was perfect for me  it gradually moved from more basic matrix calculus to time series and beyond meanwhile introducing to R from the very scratch.

3376955,0,t1_cpd6iwz,inventory turns is multiplied by days to get DSI so yeah Ive looked at that metric without utilizing the days.  I do realize that my post actually is INVERTED and Im worried about turns decreasing which is not good for a growth company growing its inventories and is the biggest red flag when you see it growing faster than revenue.  Look at revenue growth on a LTM basis to see the issue and when compared with their competitors turns are far out from the mean in the bad way.  You need to check annual since the levels vary greatly per quarter and the . days you are quoting is far below what the industry standard is and the lowest since they were public and had initiated the turnaround efforts.Considering Q ended RIGHT at the end of January it sounds like their shipments would have DEFINITELY slowed leading to a decreased inventory level if they were importing goods in January for the new season.  It got worse into feb which is good news and is a  decline in shipments really that bad?  IDK but it could definitely be enough to fuck up my theory on inventory levels rising though they only met revenue numbers and if internally their projections were off they could be looking at a glut on the bs regardless.Thanks this was the number that I needed for Jan  a shame were kinda speculating here.  Im pretty much thinking Im screwed on inventories but I think that revenue numbers arent going to grow as fast as expected and a x PE stock is gonna get hit.,finance,cpd74ws,1,t5_2qhfj

3580484,0,t3_31cs59,Based on your description of budgeting forecasting variance analysis etc. Im assuming that you will be working in the FPampA department.  This is corporate finance which is not really the focus of this subreddit.  That said its a decent career path.  Ive been in this line of work for close to  years nowBasically your job will be to work with accounting to look at financial results on a monthly and quarterly basis.  Then youll take those results and make forecasts of where the company should expect to be over the next quarteryear.  Annually there will be a big process of putting together the budget for the following year which is essentially a full year forecast.  As an analyst youll mostly be running the numbers and putting together reports on this activity.  Youll most likely report to a finance manager who is more closely reviewing the numbers and meeting with people outside of the finance department to discuss.Its an interesting job as you will work pretty closely with people from other parts of the business to get an idea of how things will turn out financially for the company.  It does get boring at times but any office job will.  Long term youd eventually get a bump to sr analyst.  Then a ways down the road get that manager level job where the budget is YOUR responsibility and you have an analyst working under you.  After that you could be a sr manager or director of FPampA where you are more looking at the full companies financials instead of just one area.  It goes up from there to VP and possibly CFO after that if you can get some accounting experience as well.  As you move up youll get paid quite a bit more but you arent going to get rich fast in this job.  Expect minimal raises and lt bonuses.  The real way to get raises here is to jump companies.  The downside to moving up is that you have to deal with more BS as you go.  There is always a disconnect between where the top management want the financials to be vs where the business actually is.  You are the guy in the middle who has to make it work somehow.  Usually this means being the bad guy and telling people to not spend money.  It can also mean making decisions around layoffs and other messy things.  Youll work fairly closely with HR as a lot of companies biggest expense is headcount related.  Overall I like it.  Its challenging but not too long of hours.  Im making double what I started at and regularly interact with the CFO and VP level people.  That said this is a corporate finance job.  If thats not what you are looking for you may want to avoid.  Its very easy to get stuck in a career in corp finance.  But if you want a good work life balance and a decent paycheck FPA is great.,finance,cq0eje9,13,t5_2qhfj

The reality however is most investors are in the red  in fact it is likely no money has been made during this equity boom whatsoever. The reason is because peak inflows occurred just before the recent selloff money lost by latecomers is greater than gains made by earlier investors.So I can see the point that retail investors are the ones who are getting crushed and there are many more of them than there are larger investment outfits but at least if you include the money gained by IPOs so long as the market is still up over last year how could what this guy says be true?,finance,csrwq5k,2,t5_2qhfj

From some companies I saw for example they didnt follow in the style as layed out in most of the texts Ive read. I had chosen to do this company partially out of the fact that most of the existing CF sheet is pretty easy to follow yet there are still a few accounts I had trouble with. Usually I try to search for the line item in question within the document and go from there but at times theres really nothing. Could you take a look at balancing the balance sheet please? How Im going about it is that Ive listed all the changes in all projected years from the balance sheet excluding totals and zeros. Ive checked over all of these against CF statement lines and found that all of them match. I then looked for sign error problems I didnt see anything there still. So so far Im stumped by the mystery assets seemly appearing out of nowhere. ,finance,ctgpvnt,2,t5_2qhfj

Its not so much the news itself but what the news is that drives uncertainty. Both on the upside and the downside.And important note just because an index is falling doesnt mean that theres an immediate opportunity to arb out any disconnect in pricing because its heavily dependent on the relationship between selling volume in the market rather than  or two etfs. Look at it this way the arb opportunity arises on a fund by fund basis. So if there is heavier selling volume in an etf relative to the selling volume of its benchmark the etf manager is indifferent to what prices hes getting in open market operation so theres a lag between what the index is doing and what the fund is doing.As market makers widen out the bidask spread there may be momentary disconnects between the price of the basket and the underlying securities.,finance,cxo6rug,9,t5_2qhfj

6073109,0,t3_3ynjie,Interestingly I work in nonagency MBS which trades this product.  Its essentially structured as a sort of synthetic CMO that looks a lot like the sub pieces of any other nonagency structure.  The main difference is that losses are based on a set recovery rate based on the total losses on the collateral rather than based on actual recovery rates although some new deals have started coming out that change this.  As others have mentioned these have been out for a couple years now but they are an extremely interesting product in my opinion.  The nonagency space has struggled a lot since the crisis so this is a great way for investors to start getting their feet wet with MBS credit while still keeping the GSE brand name.  ,finance,cyfo6q5,1,t5_2qhfj

The asset value is the PV of future rents. The speculative price may of course diverge widely. But if purchased at intrinsic value and all rentinterest assumptions hold the homebuyer buys at the PV of rents lives in it and consumes the rents he would have received had he rented it out then sells at the PV of future rents  which is his original price increased at the rate of rent inflation.,finance,cyfrg27,0,t5_2qhfj

6265541,0,t1_cz1sf3u,Again need to explain cash outflows with actual evidence which I provided loads of in the links. gtBy this point the bubble was so huge and disconnected from reality it was running purely on confidence. Ugh I hate discussions on bubbles. Bubbles are poorly defined but lets go with market price above some unobservable fundamental value. Nobody actually knows what each assets fundamental value is. Its not observable. So you cant ever know for sure whether or not an assets price is in bubble territory. Even then a bubble in what? A housing bubble? Theres no strong and established causal evidence between changes in housing prices which doesnt mean the assets were in bubble territory and defaults on loans. Theres a correlation between them but there has to be a reason why housing prices decreased in the first place of which no good reason is given by proponents of this explanation e.g. Bob Shiller. A reduction in the credit supply can cause housing prices to decrease as credit is necessary for purchases. The credit supply can be reduced because home owners were defaulting  banks less willing to lend and less able to lend as fewer funds are available in the money markets to allow others to purchase securitized bonds from SPVs. But then this would mean that housing prices didnt cause homeowners to default rather defaulting homeowners caused a reduction in the supply of credit which caused prices to decrease.Still theres no strong evidence one way or the other that changes in housing prices caused defaults.gtThe credit crunch didnt just affect the big banks either many business depend on the money markets for funding if that locks up the entire economy grinds to halt.The run largely affected nonbank financial institutions lots of dealers which are not banks as they dont make commercial loans and accept deposits even though they can own a banking subsidiary or be owned by a company that does were affected. Lehman which owned a dinky banking subsidiary and Bear Stearns were dealers.And I know there are direct and indirect ways e.g. banks are less able to create creditmoney as they cant easily securitize loans that the run in the money markets which I discussed further in my post affect the real economy.,finance,cz1tlz3,1,t5_2qhfj

6289414,0,t3_41r9f9,In general cheap oil is good for economies.  Obviously excluding the exploration and production firms.  In this case there is an issue because in the US the shale oil and fracking boom increased US production.  A lot of businesses were started in these fields and a lot of capital was deployed based on the assumption that oil would stay in the barrel range.  These companies levered up due to cheap debt and when the price collapsed all of these firms were fucked.  Now we have yield spikes on junk bonds because of companies that levered up which are now distressed that is spreading to the broader credit markets.For refining its actually been a boon.  US refiners import crude and so theyve been getting very attractive margins on refined gas.  However because of this theyve been running at capacity and deferring maintenance to push through as much product as possible.

Before you even begin the exam write down as much as you can remember on the scrap paper.  Spend the first  minutes writing down as much as you can remember. Important dates the options spread graphs etc.  It will help with the angst.  Also definitely take a week long prep class.  The class not only teaches you the material but also how to take the test.  How to identify what the test makers are asking for.Take as many sample exams as you can.  Theres no such thing as too many sample exams.  With that being said dont be alarmed when the actual test questions seem wildly different than the sample tests.  Its not because the material is different its because the question writers are different people and the variance in question verbiage can be initially jarring.Also keep in mind you are only trying to pass not get an A.

Make no mistake your  ETFs cost you money too they have to pay administration and storage charges somehow. I think the general method is that your shares represent slightly less gold as time goes by. Terms and conditions vary by fund. Physical also has cost transaction costs including the spread tend to be high and you need to accommodate storage. Q How gold is falling  Thats kinda relative. Since end April yes its down on rates expectations. Since late last year its up on rates expectations. Over the past five years its down because hyperinflation hasnt emerged as a result of QE as some had expected. Over the past  years its up spectacularly mainly due to the invention of ETFs and the end of producer hedging. Let me know if you need me to unpack that a bit more. ,finance,d3tismh,1,t5_2qhfj
7815754,0,t3_4md6af,Ok heres a summary from my wife bankruptcy paralegal. I am not an attorney and neither is my wife but you should talk to an attorney in your state if you are really concerned since state laws are all different. First of all there are too many unanswered questions here. Did person two file chapter   or  bankruptcy? When did they file? If youre worried about person  being able to absolve themselves from responsibility on the contract you dont necessarily have to worry about that if they filed chapter . As soon as someone files chapter  bankruptcy with the court and the trustee everything PRIOR to the filing date is affected by the bankruptcy. If person  goes out and signs a contract or gets a loan five minutes after filing it is NOT protected by the bankruptcy. Once again though it depends on a whole lot of other variables. As far as I am aware if it is after filing theres nothing that should prevent someone from legally being a guarantor. Theres no legal restrictions on bankruptcy clients. The bankruptcy attorneys and the courts and trustees main goal is to make sure those filing for bankruptcy arent hiding assets and committing fraud. Other than that bankruptcy is a relatively simple process. ,finance,d3ujzwu,2,t5_2qhfj

Easy to set up.Disadvantages of Acorns You can set up automatic transfers from a bank account and achieve the same set it and forget it. Costs.  Youre paying year which isnt a lot  but thats a  convenience fee that you can avoid if you just did it on your own. Limited investment choices NO RETIREMENT ACCOUNTSThe biggest issue with Acorns is simply that while its a good start you wont get very far with it.  A few cents here and there is a good start but its not going to help you retire.  Experts usually recommend that at least  of your income go to retirement.  You wont get that with Acorns.Most people Ive heard end up saving a couple hundred bucks a year with Acorns.  Thats better than  certainly but thats a tiny drop in the bucket retirement wise.  Acorns is not going to let you retire.Also one of the biggest issues with Acorns is that it offers no retirement account options which means you could be missing out on thousands in tax savings.  Much better to fund an IRA than to bother with Acorns.Overall its useful but it doesnt hold a candle to setting up automated retirement investments on your own.More info here ,finance,d3wiok3,2,t5_2qhfj

But heres my understanding.Shorting or selling short as it relates to stocks means that you borrow stocks that you dont own with the promise to pay them back in stock at a later date. You sell these borrowed stocks immediately and will buy that stock back later on to cover your position aka return the shares that you borrowed. This way you are betting that the stock price will go down and you can pocket the difference. Its a little more risky than just buying a stock and holding it betting that the price will go up called a long position because in a long position the worst case scenario is that the stock price goes to . If you are short the stock price increasing means you could theoretically lose an unlimited amount of money and if people panic buy to cover their short positions the stock price will continue to increase due to scarcity known as a short squeeze.I am not aware of the specific details of the actual trade made in The Big Short but Im fairly confident it wasnt as simple as normal short selling of stock but the basic principles still apply.,finance,d5mzrkm,1,t5_2qhfj

But suppose he invests the money instead of lends it to you. He will want more than  because if your business fails he gets nothing back. So in a year when you have a booming business and it is worth . times the original investment your dad can sell and make . You never need to pay a dividend.

9867249,0,t1_dat7b6r,Hello!  The biggest assumption to remember in these theories is that taxes do not exist there are no costs to bankruptcy and no transaction costs.  When you say expected value I believe you mean the expected value of the cash flows associated with the firm. That is accurate to say because the use of cash associated with taking on debt should be used in ways that would further increase internal cash flow.The catch to this method of thinking is that there are certain tax benefits to taking on debt within a company. Thats not to say that you can just max your leverage and have an abundance of tax savings there is an optimal level in regards to debt for capital structure where the tax savings are equal to the marginal increasing cost of debt more debt gt more risk gt higher cost of capitalEdit This is where the offset you are talking about can come from  when taking on debt above the optimal level your WACC should go up. Investors will typically use this WACC to discount the free cash flows associated with the firm. The drivers look like this  Taking on excess debt gt WACC goes higher gt future cash flows expected value goes down. I hope this answers your questions dont hesitate to ask for more detaisl if youd like!,finance,datq4eo,4,t5_2qhfj
9896487,0,t1_davbtre,Ill address the con sectionWhile the WACC does rely on a couple variables it is your job as a financial professional to determine what is a reasonable assumption in calculating your cost of equity portion of the WACC. Its not so much guess work as much as it is State your choices and defend why you did them.You are correct when you have to recalculate your WACC for incremental debt. Beta Kdebt Risk Free rate  Beta is recalculated using the Hamadas Equation.The trade offs to consider are things such as managements targeted debt level shareholder response to increased debt increased lending costs financial distress Lookup Altmans ZScoreWhen issuing equity to increase capital it is often very expensive and complicated. Our buddies at the SEC have to look over equity issuances unless it falls under some specific Reg D. rules. Brokers make good money through transaction fees when bringing equity to market.To find the lowest WACC is to simply hit minimize in Excel and let the computers do the walking.  I hope Ive answered your questions!,finance,daxjb19,2,t5_2qhfj

10007255,0,t3_5iyff4,. Usually its done by someone who has direct access to the corporate accounts. Either an expense account that they have funds transferred into or full control over the main account. Then you write a check  for something youre buying for yourself. IE Buy a boat have the company pay for it via a check . Its not like the boatselling company cares where the check comes from.. Because your finance department still has to sum total everything at the end of the day. If you balance your companys checkbook and find a discrepancy it can mean youre just forgetting about money. So you have a separate book that says here is how much I embezzled and then you can put it into the public tally as paid for  of office toner or something innocent. So the amount of money in your real account matches how much your internal tracking of that money says you have. If your internal company books says your company has X dollars and your companys bank says you have Y dollars thats a huge problem.. Ok so youre a manager at a company and you also want to steal money. Just become head of finance right? How are you going to do that? Walk up to the CEO and say Fire my boss and put me in charge because... uh... reasons. Try it and let me know how well that goes because youre clearly a straight shooter with upper management written all over you. sAll that said its a really terrible idea to embezzle money.

Im supposed to write about the different ways you can achieve that. The only way Ive found is through an earnout.

11196577,0,t1_df11mvg,If there was a finite backing aka the gold standard then the expected date of inflation would be very low as the money supply would not change much year on year. As has been found over time this is not best for the economy as prices remain sticky and so modest inflation is best so that resources allocate efficiently over time. Couple this with central bank policies and you arrive at an expected postive inflation. Overall negative inflation or deflation is bad because it encourages people to hoard cash and not spend. It also discourages investment and production. ,finance,df149zl,1,t5_2qhfj

11208312,0,t1_df2f44t,Not necessarily as I said it depends on what the context is. What the risk free rate is for your specific needs depends on what youre doing.I like duration matching where you calculate the duration of your expected cash flows and match to a riskfree bond with the closest possible duration. This ensures you are comparing your project to a riskfree security with the closest possible cash flow structure.If I wanted to know what the rates on  year treasuries were I would just ask you what they are. Risk free rate needs a context to have meaning.Theres also lots of other corrupting factors involved in calculating riskfree rates. Coupon Bonds have reinvestment risk longer maturity bonds have higher risk premiums as a result of lower liquidity etc all environmental factors that make bonds no longer risk free which all have to be weighed on a casebycase basis by the investor depending on their needs. Of course this is all probably way beyond the scope of OPs question however stating that riskfree rate universally means rate on a year treasury bond is not accurate. What the risk free rate is will vary depending on the circumstances of the investor.,finance,df2g6xp,1,t5_2qhfj

11621772,0,t3_65u2pt,Imagine you employee  own K shares worth  each and that is the full company so the company valuation is K. Someone approaches the company and says that it will inject K into the business of it issues shares worth  of the postmoney injection total. If the company issues K shares then the total number of shares is K and the valuation is K given someone bought  for K. The result is that there are K shares now where  the original K is owned by you and  the new K is owned by the investor. The value of each share rises from  each to  each. You as the sole owner decided to approve the company issuing shares because you knew that the dilution of you shares was out weighted by the value adjustment of the price of the shares.Note that the company cant just issue shares to increase its value. Someone must be willing to buy at that valuation. If now the company just issued another K shares to a total of K there wouldnt be anything to do with them as they are just sitting there. As the  owner of the company you just wouldnt approve being diluted to  if nothing was actually happening. The decision to approve your own ownership dilution happens primarily because the value of your remaining ownership increases I say primarily because in some cases you want to dilute yourself to acquire strategic investors and whatnot. ,finance,dgdc7gw,1,t5_2qhfj
