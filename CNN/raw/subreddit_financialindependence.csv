52600,0,t1_cejs68s,The  bonus offers come and go.  I got one a few years ago with the Chase British Airways card for  points.  The best I have seen lately is  points  and although I havent looked I think thats what available through my site.  You might be right that you can search around and find slightly more rewarding card offers and I would encourage anyone to search around and apply for the most rewarding cards possible! I know I have seen tips to go to x website then clear your cookies then go into incognito mode then click through this advertisement then go here then apply for the card and then hope your points post. For the TLDR crowd I figured that was a bit much.  But yes your point stands it may be worth it to eek out another  worth of points or miles by searching the net for valid legitimate offers that arent available if you just go to a regular travel hackers blog or the credit card issuers site directly.  Im not exactly a pro travel hacker but I try my best to maximize points without going through too many hoops.  I know there are special targeted offers too that readers might want to look out for.  I get mailers for different credit card offers and recently I received one for Capital Ones Quicksilver card that Im thinking of applying for due to the . cash back cash!.  My offer had a higher sign up bonus  compared to the regular  bonus available through Cap Ones site or through my credit cards page.  Obviously apply for the better off IF you are lucky to receive one.Edit to add and as for how much I make from credit cards I might get  sign ups per month and make  which I then have to pay tax on.  And those sign ups are probably from my friends who I told about the cards via word of mouth.    Granted I can get pretty far on  plus the free miles I get from CCs but its not why I write about travel hacking.  Pretty crappy return on investment IMHO.  ,financialindependence,cekf30l,1,t5_2t34z
91288,0,t3_1v4pqy,A lot of us here have different perspectives on how to invest what type of lifestyle to live and many other things.  What we all agree on Save as much as you can.  Your savings rate is vitally important.  At your age if you save  of what you earn you will be able to retire in under  years.  Dont try to keep up with your peers... they will almost all be living above their means.  Beware of lifestyle inflation and wasting money on useless things or things youll be throwing away in a year. Grow your salary.  This is the second lever and IMO every bit as  important as .  Get a good job preferably one that you enjoy.  IT and medicine are probably the two easiest big ticket industries right now.  Work hard work SMART and be nice to people.  Networking and recognitionrespect from your superiors are honestly more important to your success than just about anything else this doesnt mean you can be a shitty performer but being a good performer is not enough to get you rapid advancement.  Wish I had known that earlier in my career not that I can complain too much. Invest your money well.  If you dont want to spend the time and effort to learn active investment strategies dollarcostaverage into vanguard mutual funds.  Its what  of the people here recommend and it is the most utterly deadsimple strategy you can follow.  Dont buy into gurus or getrichquick schemes.  Note that I am not saying you cant consistently beat the above strategy in terms of returns with a lot of work and education but anyone promising you an easy way to beat the market is full of it. Hope that helps... IMO that is FI in a nutshell.,financialindependence,ceotm14,6,t5_2t34z

143772,0,t1_ceuh8pi,gt as long as the fees are identicalThey are not identical though. To avoid index funds you can either buy individual stocks yourself or pay someone else to do it for you. In the first case you are highly unlikely to beat the market since as you said it is a zerosum game and professionals who know a lot and cheat better will soak up many of those winning dollars. In the second case the professional you are paying is unlikely to do enough better to make it worth more than index investing. gt but it disproves the premise of this articleThe article which is a poor write up of a fantastic book says that you probably cant beat the market. Saying that it is possible to beat the market does not disprove this. Anyway you are making a classic strawman argument. The book does not assert that the market is perfectly efficient only that it is efficient enough that most investors will not be able to beat it. Saying anyone who believes it is  is delusional is beside the point and does not tell us anything. Malkiel uses a lot of hard data to show that not only in theory is it true that you probably wont beat the market but in actuality it has been true since index funds became available. It is a good read even if you prefer to invest in individual stocks. I highly recommend it. ,financialindependence,ceut1kj,4,t5_2t34z
161248,0,t3_1vw5fn,Off the top of my head in property in stocks in bondsI dont know if this would be enough to retire on though without some kind of supplementary income. Maybe instead of bonds purchase a house that is suitable to the FI lifestyle and buy it outright. With no mortgage I wouldnt need nearly as much every month.Using the whole lot to start a business could be risky. You could lose it all or you could make millions. It really depends on the type of business you would be interested in purchasing. I know a lot of people  in the UK anyway  make good money buy buying into a franchise Subway etc and hiring minimum wage slaves to do the work.Or you could sink a chunk of it into something fun like your own paintball place. My theory is that paintball places must make FORTUNES. After the initial costs of buying the land and tarting it up a bit theres tons of room for profit entry fee snacks paintballs amp accessories at hugely jacked up prices.

Even if you cant get it removed Im pretty sure you can still make a comment in your file showing it was paid in full.If you get an employer match to a k contribute to the full amount of the match.The working tax credit should take priority over the Roth since it will probably yield a higher return.If you are able to get both the tax credit and Roth you can also consider using a Roth IRA to double as your temporary emergency fund since in the worst case scenario you can pull back your contributions without penalty. That way you at least have more principle in the pot to put to work over your lifetime. If you are treating it as an emergency fund put the money to work in some kind of liquid investment that wont be volatile in the short term. You dont want your emergency fund to be in equities and have to sell in a down market.After you max your contribution then build up a real emergency account and swap your IRA to work in an index fund.Finally work on paying off the car.You are in great shape and can likely make all your contributions and knock out all your debt in a year if you are disciplined.From there maximize your savings rate and dont succumb to lifestyle inflation.

If so thats another way for tax deferred savings. See this articleOtherwise if early retirement is you goal keep a healthy amount if money available as an emergency fund and invest the rest through a taxable account at vanguard.gt What the hell do I do with my IRAs?

1448285,0,t1_cixqk0u,Theres two ways of thinking about it. The first is to assume you wont be paying off any mortgage or rent and use your number plus your mortgage as your FI number. The second is to just use your number and make extra payments which dont count as savings so that when you retire youll have your home paid off. I personally do a twist on the second option I only use my number and make extra payments to have my mortgage payed off by my FI date. But instead of sending the checks to my loan provider I stick them into a brokerage account. That way I get the benefit of the mortgage interest and only have to match the mortgage interest to break even. As an added benefit if my returns are higher then I could pay off my mortgage sooner but I also run the risk of losing the money in the market. Actually I dont even have to meet my mortgage interest amount because my marginal tax rate is  and long term capital gains tax is . So lets say my mortgage interest is . Since I save  by NOT paying off my mortgage through taxes the true cost is  minus . x  equals .. If stuck that money in the market and received a  return and sold the stock with a  long term capital gains tax rate my return would be  minus  x .  .So WHAT return would I need to receive the same benefit as paying down my mortgage? Well its x  x.  . or x  . return in the market. Since my mortgage is . I would only need to create a return of . to break even.My basic rule of thumb is keep a mortgage if you have a high paying job or the job your using to become FI. Lose the mortgage when you become FI. This does not mathematically make sense to lose the mortgage but it helps smooth out volatility against wild market swings by having less liquidity in the market and more in your house. It also makes you feel more secure knowing that all you need to come up with to live rent free for a year is the property taxes and all you need to live rent free and comfortable is the property taxes plus the utility bills.,financialindependence,cixth1i,1,t5_2t34z

1718928,0,t1_cjvsu5a,I agree that there are many situations in which Alimony doesnt make sense. Sure there are marriages with no kids where one spouse chooses not to work because the other spouse earns enough income to support both and the nonworking spouse sits around doing mostly nothing. But lets assume that both partners together decide that one should stay home to raise the kidsor something else worthwhile. The spouse that stays home loses earning potential while doing what both partners see as more important than working outside the home. If the working spouse in this situation sees himherself as subsidizing the nonworking spouses lifestyle rather than taking part in a combined partnership where each has responsibilities then they probably shouldnt be married in the first place.If you consider a functional married couple as a single unit then its the nonworking spouse that comes out behind when the divorce occurs. Not because they are lazy but because the role that they fulfilled within that unit happened to result in significantly less earning potential when they reentered the job market. If it was truly a joint decision that resulted in this reduction of earning potential then it makes sense to have the working exspouse continue to provide some support. Maybe not for life but  years I would see as completely reasonable.,financialindependence,cjvu121,4,t5_2t34z

2010882,0,t3_2hs7p5,This is an interesting question because I was JUST debating that in my mind.I think the key is prioritizing and deciding what you can really sacrifice in the day to day. For example going out to eat is by no means frugal but it is almost my hobby and something that I get a lot of joy out of.Some things I pay more for like real leather shoes or a few well constructed things instead of a closet of mediocre clothes that will be replaced and replaced. I also always go to craigslist the thrift store or some other second hand source for furniture etc instead of buying from box stores. A little effort to clean such items up can go a long way.However I dont have cable I have a basic phone plan. I almost always bring my breakfastlunch to work and I own an old car that I will not replace until I absolutely need to because it becomes impractical.These are small examples but I think a lot of it is just assessing where you can really cut back and adjust and what things to not feel bad about spending a little more just to enjoy yourself occasionally. Even those little things add up.,financialindependence,ckvib0a,17,t5_2t34z

2685470,0,t1_cm5k6o4,Im for investing more too! I own a house and if I would have to do it again I would keep the cheap apartment I had before and stacked tons of money in my brokerage account to reach early retirement faster. Maintenance and repairs cost a lot. Mortgage penalties and fees to sell your house are crazy if you have a five years fixed rate and you want to break it. I felt like a rat in a cage for mostly  years when my gf and I broke up and I was then alone to pay the mortgage. It had put a lot of financial pressure on me for  years and I had urgent repairs to do that I couldnt afford... there are often surprises with houses and condos bad surprises. Now  years down the road my house is worth more I have a new partner in life I could renegotiate my mortgage rate to breathe better and the  I have paid in mortgage interests and capital over the course of  years is now covered by equity if I were to sell my house. So in the end I lived there for the price of taxes and regular cost of maintenance  per month  but was the stress I had to go through really worth it?  Would I have been able to get a better return from the investments I would have made instead of paying a mortgage and k in maintenance and taxes  k in repairs? Id say most probably yes. And I dont even take into account that I absolutely need a car to go to work... thats another  spent on nothing every month that I wouldnt spend if I had kept my apartment.And no one knows where the mortgage rates will be a couple of years down the road.Its a financial risk Im not willing to deal with so Ill try to bring my mortgage down to zero within  years while the rates are still low.Youll see that your  per month will probably be spent on maintenance or on higher interest rates very fast.. so you wont be able to save.For me a single family house or apartment is not an investment its a luxury. There are better options like renting a cheap apartment living in a mobile home or theres also a new trend with tiny homes if your goal is to reach early retirement. ,financialindependence,cn9407n,1,t5_2t34z

2952134,0,t3_2txvgx,I went from contractor to salaried at my current job.  You get a contract in the same way you get any other job you apply for it.  Let me start by saying that the rate you pay you get billed for a contractor the rate the contractor gets and the rate the contractor keeps are very different.  For instance I was probably being billed at hr and getting paid hr on a W.  After selfemployment tax of  it was hr.  After a year I renegotiated and cut some fingers out of the pie and got kyr on a W for which my employer billed hr.Obviously the best strategy for your pocketbook is to try to find the contract directly with the company ask for hr and keep it all yourself.  The problem is that a lot of those contracts are to fill in work that needs to be done under a contract that a vendor has won.  Theyll win a contract to implement some system and theyll hire contractors on to do the actual work.  Other companies use it to try the workers before they buy them but theyll usually go to a third party to find the talent.  Usually those groups will get some percentage of your pay plus a bonus if you last a certain amount of time.When you sign a contract the major things to look out for are noncompete clauses.  If you are working with a headhunter the ultimate goal is to cut them out as soon as possible.  If the company is paying them hr you can offer to work for hr and get rid of the headhunter.  Obviously the headhunter or contracting agency needs to make some money but the termination of the contract should lead to the termination of the noncompete.  Ive always read my contracts marked them up to change anything I didnt like initialed by the changes and then sent them back signed.  The other side typically doesnt know what to do with this but so long as the sale is close theyll probably have dollar bills in their eyeballs and just agree if you are willing to walk away.Basics Try to find the contract directly make sure you add  for the taxes youll need to pay dont sign overbearing noncompete clauses.,financialindependence,co3o6la,2,t5_2t34z

3002471,0,t1_co8wbd6,Actually Im pretty sure that Im right. When there is a negative correlation VTSAX and VBTLX is . for the past  years you can actually get equal or higher returns by adding it to the portfolio. You might be thinking of the expected returns equation in which the expected return is the sum product of the weight  the expected return of the asset. However this doesnt factor in rebalancing  and thats what allows for equal or higher absolute return with less risk. When the bond fund is down it makes up a smaller percentage of the portfolio thus instructing you to move money into the cheaply valued asset to bring it up to the previous  of the portfolio.Empirically this translates into a few percentage points allocation of the low return negatively correlated asset when I modeled this empirically it was somewhere around . For ETFs transaction costs would quickly erode any potential benefits for for account which are getting continuous reinvestments and the transaction costs can be considered sunk you can actually achieve equal or higher returns than a  equity portfolio.As for the Vanguard link you sent it doesnt account for rebalancing  thats a static portfolio. As for the graph you sent the SML will probably land around the  split dot. But we can actually maximize absolute returns rather than risk adjusted returns and pick the portfolio that yields . which is heavier on the international side.Theoretically this isnt optimal because you should be able to achieve your desired higher returns using the maximized return per unit of risk and levering up moving up the SML but given the transaction costs and other headaches associated with this in practice some may choose the unlevered portfolio with maximized returns.Edit This link does a better job explaining what Im talking about. The negative correlation is what produces the hump looking graph correlated assets look more like a boomerang pointing to the left. So negatively correlated assets have the tangencyportfolio on the SML max return per unit of risk and an absolute max return portfolio at the apex of the hump.By the way you dont have to be sorry if Im wrong.

Well say you have month coming in above your monthly expenses.  So what percentage of that do you need to meet your minimum loan payments and what percentage of that do you need to max out your tax advantaged accounts over the year?  What percentage do you have left over if anything?Personally on a monthly basis I would make sure youve got enough for loan minimums first then enough for tax advantaged contributions.

You can actually increase your total income outside of a W job with cash flow properties and those same properties can increase your W take home pay with tax advantages.My strategy for FI is to replace my current salary with semipassive income from rental houses. That way I wont need to cut back on any standard of living in retirement. I use my W income to purchase houses and the houses then give me more deductions from depreciation which lower my AGI and help to purchase more houses. However to your second point I also had to invest in myself. I had to learn how to find quality properties to purchase. I am still learning how to manage tenants and costs. I have found it very helpful to write down your plans and goals.

Then maybe buy another property with a mortgage some time in the near future say a year or so down the road when the cash flow on the first two properties has accumulated to enough for a down payment. Repeat in years   and . That may not quite get him there but if the house he already owns is paid off by that time that probably goes up to about  a month cash flow. The first two houses bought outright will still be  each. Then four more with mortgages. If we go with your conservative estimate that theyll be cash flowing at  each per month thats month so the total comes to about month cash flow. But it is a lot less leveragedexposed maybe K in mortgages vs. over a million. And it only requires buying  houses in  years vs.  which seems a lot more realistic for a fairly new investor.

Even if the conversion costs are on point  and its paid for with the sale of your original vehicle  its not like you can recoup the money spent turning a van into a hobovan so you immediately lose whatever equity you had in the vehicle that you converted making the expenses a permanent loss.

But thats the greenfield situation in the US. The facts remain no matter how poor a financial choice it might be that many people go to college and have or had student loan debt in amounts of . gtYoure using median household income. Most people arent married right out of uni nor should they be.Youre right I am the reason being as Im trying to be as generous as possible to saving so median household income is a higher number and thus makes it easier to have mo that could be used although I still think its hard as noted below. gt is ridiculously easy to save per month even on a low income like k a year.I dont know how you figure that.

Likewise while buying a house isnt great generally for FI many people do for other reasons. Like their kids school system. So what happens if the job youre at goes under? Or just starts giving you CoL raises? Should you still limit your search to  miles or less? gtNo reason to buy a house. Get your mortgage after youre already FI.Buying a house generally delays FI although sometimes it speeds it up. But I generally agree that a house is not the right choice. I would likely go back and tell myself not to buy a house if I could. gtBad planning and too high expectations on how they think theyre supposed to live.I dont know about you but I didnt come out of the womb knowing what I know now. Did you? People are at least partially products of what they were raised in and around. One of my good friends was raised in a family with horrible financial decision making. She also got married to a guy with horrible financial skills. She didnt learnknow better until the past  years or so. She is also an accountant. My point is that people have to learn these things. They dont know it from day . You seem to suggest that everybody should know from day  or at  when they are starting to make decisions like postHS life how to do this stuff. And I think that is a deeply flawed argument as people make mistakes people need to learn things and many times they just look around at their peers going into more and more debt and buy into thats what youre supposed to do. It isnt always easy to resist the urge to go and buy a massive house or nice car because you got a big raisepromotion since your peers do when they get one. And American society puts forward that as what you should do. It can be hard to step away from that. ,financialindependence,cp5pbzp,1,t5_2t34z

3344178,0,t3_2ygbg5,Its tough to talk about the Permanent Portfolio because its got rather enthusiastic fans.  Im going to do my best to give it a fair shake but you should understand what you are investing in.You should understand right off the bat theres  chance that even a conservative traditional stockbond portfolio is going to outperform the permanent portfolio.  The permanent portfolio may not tank in the worst of times but in conditions other than the absolute worst on record you can expect it to return less than a traditional portfolio.  For you personally you are almost guaranteed that you will need to work additional years as a result.From a common sense perspective you should realize that  of this portfolio is pretty much just sitting idle waiting for a depression and another  is sitting in cash not earning much at all.  Its hard to compete with a portfolio that has  of its assets put to work.  Any portfolio that is working  will soon grow so much larger than the permanent portfolio that even after a crash it will still be larger.The permanent portfolio is shunned by economists and serious investors.  I dont want to rag on the people that use it but most are amateur investors that are overly concerned about economic disasters.The good news is that you dont have to take my word for it.  You can back test these portfolios and see how they performed historically using   and My opinion is that youd be much better suited with a traditional stockbond portfolio.  If you dont want to see the portfolio take huge dips then you can accomplish that by holding a higher percentage of bonds perhaps  stocksbonds or if you really are loss averse .    If you want the fastest time to retirement on average then youll probably want an  stockbond portfolio.Edit I just wanted to add what you gain is that you get a portfolio with a value that doesnt bounce around much.  If you run it through a backtest youll see that the variation from year to year isnt much.  For some investors that hate hate hate to lose money it might be a good choice.,financialindependence,cp9gly6,7,t5_2t34z

Ive noticed a lot of posts in this sub leave out a lot of implied details.  Even the FAQ breaks out inflationWhat about inflation?The Trinity Study took inflation into account but it bears repeating  now is not the same as   or  years from now. Inflation will eat away at your returns at an average rate of about  per year. That is why FIers tend to invest heavily in stocks instead of loweryielding financial instruments the average gains of the stock market rapidly outpace inflation. Think of it this way the average annual increase in the value of the U.S. stock market is . If you assume that about  of those gains are lost to inflation that leaves  for you to withdraw while maintaining your principal. ,financialindependence,cp9ng7f,1,t5_2t34z

Spending on yourself right now is a hedge against getting hit by a bus tomorrow and never getting to enjoy all that money you saved but if you badly want to be FI which is distinct from ER then you would be more frugal now to get there more quickly.But lets run your numbers to have k from passive income indefinitely youll need somewhere between k at  withdrawal rate to k at  withdrawal rate. The question is then how quickly you want to get here. Of the k per month you have after expenses you can get to FI k in about  years if you invest it all and get an average of  gains each year. If you invest only k annually instead itll take about  years k.So k per month to spend versus  years. Note that youll have unexpected expenses to pay or your car might finally need to be replaced.

3721334,0,t3_32yvps,I havent paid enough attention to those posts. Is there a common enough wording that an Auto Moderator stuff could police a bit? Or is too hard to separate those posts from preferred ones?I was going to suggest making some pretty overt changes to the submit a new text post screen but that red banner is pretty big though I dont think I could see it with RES on. The actual submit page is more subtle perhaps too subtle but Im not sure how much is open to change. Is it possible to add some placeholder text to the textarea field that the user types their post into? Maybe something like gtBeginnersnewbies please read the XYZ before posting ABC questions.Or similar text could be added to the top banner thing that appears when hovering over the submit a new text post button. I think the main issue is that the sidebar is kind of huge so people arent going to read everything on it and check out all of the links before posting. The sidebar could probably have a couple of sections for different topics like Beginner Basics or Investing stuff in addition to the sections divided by the medium of the content BlogsForumsResourcesetc. Thatd give people something to focus on depending on what they want to know rather than seeing a list of blogsforumsresources that are less targeted to their inquiry. Itd also give people a better way to respond to such questions  look at the X section of the sidebar.I also notice that there isnt an FAQ for this subreddit which might be worth having if this is really an issue.

Just be aware that if you loseswitch jobs youll usually depending of your k plan have to pay for the loan after tax which could be a big tax hit.

The problem with market cap weighting is that to the extent over priced stocks exist youre buying too much of them because the price exaggerates the market cap and to the extent there are cheap stocks youre not buying enough because the low price diminishes the cap. With equal weighting you just effectively randomize stock selection and that improves your return a bit. Fundamental weighting does a little bit better than that even though its not perfect because the fundamental weighted indexes work off of unadjusted reported accounting numbers so they get fooled by fraud.   ,financialindependence,cr1acz7,-1,t5_2t34z

In  more years  years from today the house is now worth .MM and your stocks starting with k plus  per month all remaining income invested are worth .MM.Case  Buy k house today  Put k down take out k mortgage invest the other k. Say  on  year loan.  Monthly mortgage payment is . Assume still have  month salary so we can compare apples to apples.  In  years you still have k left on the mortgage. You started with k in the market and invested the extra  per month in the market again at  which is k.  You sell the house for k  appreciation minus k so you get k cash from the sale so your net worth is k.  If you want to buy a MM house now appreciated to .MM you put  down or k leaving you with k and take out a k loan say  for  years.  Mortgage payment is  so you have  remaining salary to invest monthly.  In  years  years total from now youve paid off the mortgage completely the house is worth .MM and your stocks starting with k plus  per month are worth .MM.So we dont know exactly what your salary is so those numbers stocks worth .MM vs .MM could vary quite a lot. However you can say that as long as you have a stable salary and contribute all that you can you will given the other assumptions are true mortgage rates market rate housing appreciation be roughly .MM better off in  years if you buy the k house now and trade up  years from now instead. e.g. if your monthly remaining income after all expenses but housing is  not  then those stock values after  years would be .MM vs .MM which is still .MM better off in case .,financialindependence,cs92iot,2,t5_2t34z

4407438,0,t1_csmfu24,He addresses it here about Stoicism and Voluntary Discomfort.Here Moving from the mental to the physical Stoics actually enjoy experimenting with Voluntary Discomfort. As a contemporary Stoic you might make a point of seeing how long you can leave the air conditioning off on a summer day or try hiking in bare feet instead of shoes occasionally to feel the land and force your feet to adapt to tougher conditions than a moisturewicking merino wool hiking sock.  It sounds absurd by modern standards until you realize that by doing this you are actually broadening your comfort zone even while you eliminate your fear of discomfort. Thanks to the practice above you are now able to enjoy yourself in a much broader range of temperatures and appreciate the comfort of shoes when you do have them. Meanwhile a person with the extreme opposite philosophy might become irritated if he ever has to travel in less than a firstclass airplane seat or stay in less than a five star hotel or drink subperbottle wine. By experimenting with voluntary discomfort we  learn to appreciate far more of our life and can be content with a much simpler and more wholesome one.The more pleasures a man captures the more masters he will have to serveNature Itself told the Stoics what conditions they should learn to appreciate as humans  since they realized we are all in fact an integral part of Nature.

I found my enjoyment of my job was higher when my wife worked in the same company as well. It helps you feel more attached in my opinion to the corporate social life when you can participate with your family.If you werent already eating at the office take advantage of it now. We would sometimes eat our lunches together sometimes not you need time apart of course and it probably cut down on my restaurants a bit.When youre carpooling see what you two can do together as an activity since youre stuck in the same place for a period of time. Audiobooks work great for example. We also spent time planning vacations as the nondriving spouse would search for things on their phone amp read off the results. Regardless its a good time to bond.

I work during the day and he works at night it works out for the most part but we always feel squeezed for time. We both work in the suburbs and the total daily commute is about  miles. He can find another job but Im not at that point yet as I just started mine less than a year ago.

If you have a place you end up coming back to every so often because of family friends etc. you could buy and rent it out whenever you leave for a year or more. Houses can be a good investment depending on where they are. Its all about location IMO. If youre in a really expensive place like San Francisco or NYC you might as well rent unless youll be there long term. If you are in the midwest or South buying is cheap and taxes are low for the most part...except in certain towns like where I live Chapel Hill NC  taxes are ridiculous here. The up side of a town like this though is a huge pool of renters and high rents due to the presence of UNC. If I want to go away for a year or two I can rent out my house easily which covers the mortgage plus some while Im gone. Meanwhile the property goes up in value.

4681140,0,t1_ctkdrlo,This will be an unorthodox view in this sub so I may get downvoted but what the hell. Ever since I crossed the minimum FI threshold a few months ago Ive been selling high in bits and pieces so that my exposure to the market continues to equal exactly x my living expenses. Im holding everything else in cash. Ive done this for a few reasons It makes my portfolio more resilient in a crash. In fact if a crash comes Ill have a huge slug of cash available to put to work in the market. I know this will be a challenge behaviorally e.g. easier to say than do but based on how I handled the  crash I think its reasonable. It gives me capital to put to work elsewhere  in a rental property a private investment starting a business etc.  without having to sell stocks at an inopportune potentially time. I believe personal finance is about matching your own personal goals with your own risk tolerance. My own goal is to have x my living expenses invested. But Im also more risk averse than I used to be because Im stepping back from the working world for a bit. So I feel that incremental exposure to the stock market  particularly at all time highs  is not worth the incremental risk. At the same time I remain a firm believer that in general its impossible to time the market. Thats why I insist that my main FI nest egg remain fully invested. Yes theres some cognitive dissonance at work here but Im doing my best to satisfy my rational brain with my emotions which are very afraid of a crash.

Ironically it also makes it more likely that less fortunate  disenfranchised people could actually get jobs in the first place. For example poor black folks were arguably the worst off due to minimum wage laws in the past which is partly why they were popular amongst white unions who didnt want to get outbid by blacks for work. Given the choice at the same price the majority of people would rather hire white folks so taking away the option of pricing their labor lower took away job opportunities for blacks.

4834181,0,t1_cu3uw4t,I have been working in this industry for the past  years so I have some insight into both these companies. IMO the new real estate crowdfunding companies are tech companies acting as real estate companies. Private money lenders or Hard Money Lenders have been doing this for decades. They aggregate funds from multiple investors and fund a loan with it. These new companies are doing the exact same thing just with a different label and platform.I invest  of my solok in real estate deals as a lender and if I were an outsider looking to get involved I would look for a company with a very good reputation who has been around for at least  years. If a lender made it through the last recession that tells me they knew what they were doing. If they made it through two recessions even better. I wouldnt invest with FundRise or Realty Shares until they were around for at least a decade and had gone through a bad down turn. As far as investing through an taxadvantaged account you need to set up a selfdirected IRS or k. Companies like Polycomp EnTrust and the First Trust Company of Onaga can act as custodians and have more information. All of these custodians have fees much much higher than a company like Vanguard so the idea might turn people off. I can justify the costs because of the yields I receive. ,financialindependence,cu3vykt,4,t5_2t34z

4855755,0,t1_cu6iphf,You get a paper loss for tax purposes by being able to deduct a specific amount for depreciation. The logic is that most physical assets other than land go down in value over time. A rental building goes down in value over time as well if you dont put in the proper upkeep. In reality you will invest in the necessary repairs for the building to hold its value and youll factor this into the market rent you charge and you will deduct your repairs for tax purposes. In doing so your property should in fact hold or appreciate in value over time thus causing it to have an unrealized economic gain. During this time however you will be recording a paper loss for tax purposes based on the difference between theory physical property other than land goes down in value vs reality my property has appreciated in value. Couple this with the powerful ability to defer tax on the disposition of that property by reinvesting in another property  exchange in the U.S. not possible in Canada cant speak to other jurisdictions or even on death subject to estate tax in the U.S. which most middle class would not be inscope not possible to defer on death in Canada beyond last spouse to die cant speak to other jurisdictions.

4866875,0,t1_cu7p5jf,I had a totally different experience with FSBO went great even as a firsttime home buyer. Seller had moved out in the fall but waited to list until the spring and spruced up the house in the meantime new water heater fresh paint inside shampooed carpets kept up the yard etc. Made a verbal offer after inperson tour followed up with a written contract the next day. Sellers were flexible on closing dates to help align with our desired moving date. Seller came along for the home inspection and addressed even minor issues without question no major ones came up. Home also included fridge and frontload washerdryer. Neither of us used an attorney just used standard home sale documents for the contract they are fillintheblank with most blanks having default answers super easy. All finalizingclosing paperwork was handled by the title company.His only pickycheap thing which worked to our advantage is that he refused to pay buyers agents commission. He listed on the MLS through a flatfee service and wasnt obviously an FSBO on the listing. He had many buyers come through with agents and a couple offers before us but he would counter the offers  higher to effectively make the buyer pay their own agents fee. Fortunately we drove by first and figured out it was FSBO so went in without an agent. Had my parents help they have bought dozens of houses so we were comfortable with FSBO even as firsttime buyers. Every situation is different but just because a seller doesnt want to piss away equity to realtors commissions doesnt mean they are trying to screw you too.,financialindependence,cu8096a,3,t5_2t34z

However I would also expect a way better return than lt for a  Target Date Fund over the last  years so it could be that the one offered within your k is a bad one with bad investment choices and high fees. Good target date funds have been very succesfull in the past leading to positive publicity leading to all kinds of companies creating their own target date fund in hopes of luring people to it and getting their money. Your personal return is different from the growth percentages for  reasons. The fees you pay. The fact that you are buying a bit more every month. The growth percentages are for buying this product exactly   or  years ago and holding until today would mean average growth per year of x.x. Your personal return is After buying x.x shares on Mar for xx x.x shares on Apr for xx x.x shares on May for xx and paying z in fees given the value of a share today average annual return so far is y.y. Over the long run and if the shares arent too volatile you are expecting your return to get closer to the reported growth minus the fees that you pay. ,financialindependence,cu91ynn,1,t5_2t34z

You sell the option and collect a premium maybe like  per share and then you are obligated no matter what happens to purchase the stock for  at the expiration if your counterparty buyer of the option you sold exercises the option. They will only exercise the option if the price is below . So your breakeven price at expiration is  the strike price of  less the  you collected in premium. If at expiration the price is above  nothing happens. You keep the  you collected and the option expires. Rinse and repeat. The only requirements are that you A. have enough in your account to actually buy the stock at the strike price and B. would otherwise have the stock in your portfolio if you werent doing this strategy.The covered call is when you own the stock then you sell calls against it.

Anecdotally Ive noticed that peers in prestigious careers e.g. Law banking amp politics tend to struggle if they leave the industry or retire. I think its because so much of their identity gets tied up in what they do and because they are particularly hard industries to succeed in with a casual  hours a week and thats it attitude.Another trend Ive noticed amp intrigued to know whether you think this fits your mother or not.. Power gt labour. By that I mean Ive noticed a few people that have retired from  grind but now work either in executive advisory  board type roles seem just as fulfilled working  hours a year quarterly meetings vs those doing some sort of full time postcareer volunteering or similar.I think a lot of FI types see jobs as a tool to generate money which is a tool to generate independence. The whole identitypowerprestige dealio seems less of a factor Ive never seen an Fi thread with a user saying I did X because even though Ill make k less its more prestigious for people chasing FIRE as work is more of a temporary thing but I guess for accidental FIRE types its probably an additional factor that a lot of people wouldnt consider...

4930216,0,t3_3iefew,You can handle some risk given your life  having a job not having dependents at the moment. However that doesnt say you are a person who is happy to take a lot of risks. I guess it could be very smart to find a feeonly financial planner who has your best interest at heart. The FAQ of rpersonalfinance has some advice on what to look for. Personally Im a risk averse person. My own investments are as follows  in certificates of deposit I got lucky so far and I have yeardeposits that give me an average of  annual interest  in bond funds good quality bonds of states and stable companies not junk bonds  in index funds investing in diversified worldwide stocksOn average this should give me something like a  return per year. My savings accounts will never lose value. Even if the bonds would lose  of their value and the stocks losing  of their value at the same time even then my total net worth wouldnt drop by more than . To me that feels safe enough to just do it and still enjoy some returns in the stock market.  Im showing my setup to show you that you do not have to go all out in the stock market. People here will probably advise that and in the long run if you would be able to hold on during the wild ride you would probably profit the most  make the most money. But you dont have to do it if it means youre scared and nervous and experiencing sleep problems half of your life because the stock market is going down. Create an asset allocation that feels good to you. And this is also where a good financial adviser could help getting to know how much risk you want to take and can take and creating an investment portfolio that matches with who you are and with your current situation.,financialindependence,cufzrdo,3,t5_2t34z

4934283,0,t1_cug8e8t,I think a lot of people have covered this but when I felt that way about my current job I analyzed it a bit to see what was the actual cause and what was viable to do to make it better. I decided that since I have a pretty flexible schedule and stuff doesnt get too crazy most of the time I should work on other nonprofessional development related activities that might help me for either a future parttime career especially in FI and after I retire from sw development help me build towards achieving FI or just some fun stuff that I can do to while FIER. That helped me move out of my slump. If I feel that Im in a slump at work I work on something else. If I feel overwhelmed from the other stuff I take a break from those and shift my focus back to work because its become the least stressful activity or if work becomes crazy as it occasionally does I reshift my focus back to work. I think shaking things up a bit helps a lot. That being said its possible that Ill take a new job when I feel that my career is stalling I have over a decade left to FI though. ,financialindependence,cugi7pw,2,t5_2t34z

Where I am being a PT is the new  in thing there are countless forprofit educational institutions and the work just isnt there. The number of people willing to pay xx an hour for someone to tell them to lift shitmotivate them is very low if you can consistently get an hour or two before work hours amp an hour or two after work hours youre doing pretty well for yourself.The guys I know who are doing okay still not close to a livable wage in that space are either selling scammy pyramid scheme type supplements herbalife or isagenix seem to be the big  around here.. As I said scammy. Running group classes. Finding a person to pay you  at am on a tuesday for a  PT session seems to be a hellluva lot harder than finding  people to pay you  for a yoga class at am.If I was in your position I would Come up with a business plan Gyms probably arent going to let you entertain clientele there unless you work for them  they take a huge cut of your billables so youll need to look at renting a studio or park type classes working out the cheapest way to get qualified  making sure youve got the right skill set Training a few friends ltlt.

You have access to opportunities with k in assets that you would never qualify for with just k in assets regardless of the debt.To make the comparison more clear consider having k in assets and no debt or k in assets and k in debt. The k can be transformed into capital liquidated in pieces to respond to emergencies or invested to take advantage of interest rate arbitrage. To some extent this is an emotional decision youre right. But I do generally feel that people are too debtaverse on this sub and subs like it.

Plus I have a pretty sweet arrangement with my rent right now because I rent from my parents who have multiple properties and I figure by keeping the payments in the family I will ultimately benefit further down the line from inheritance. After reading some of these comments Im starting to reevaluate my strategies. First off I have zero debt an emergency fund of K a K with  match through my employer and about K in savings and checking that Ive kept liquid simply because Im really undecided as to what the wisest way to invest it will be. Originally my plan was to kind of build on that until I had enough money to buy a home outright. I had also tossed around the idea of buying a nice liveaboard catamaran and paying docking fees rather than property taxes for the next  years. Basically I saw these as my only two options to not give money to the banks.  So heres my question Is there any world where this is the right strategy to take? And if Im being a complete idiot can someone point me to a place where I can read more strategiesadvice?

I think the moral hazard goes both ways.  I dont think laziness is the biggest issue its more about fairness in the system in my mind.  If you grow up in a shit neighborhood with a drug beat single mom go to a crappy school and live in a society where no ones gives two shits about you...thats harsh enough. That victim can certainly rise above it...but the odds are definitely stacked against them.  However there are people just like me with all the same benefits and head starts you could ever ask for...and they choose the new boat over the IRA.  They choose the vacation to Belize instead of the k match.  For those people? fuck them.  But for the people that had life stacked against them and a society that continues to get harder and harder for them...well maybe its a moral hazard to forget about them.  Maybe they need a little more in retirement to just live a minimum standard of life.  Were not sending them on vacations its just a roof over their head and food on the table you know?  So in the year  when we have robots doing all the menial jobs and the super rich and well educated people are making  times what they do now while the uneducated are wishing that Skynet never invented that robot that cleans schools at a rd of the cost as a human because they now cant get a job...maybe its fair that theyll get  of the benefit they paid in and Ill get .

Is a spouse taking care of multiple children not doing any effort at all?I agree no one should feel pressured to be married but also that no one should be discouraged from getting married. Many people are quite happy to be working as a unit. If youre not then yes marriage may not be the best idea.As a thought experiment try to think though some of the issues if this wasnt the case.  Lower earners that might have invested in raising the children could be discarded poor at the higher earners desire.  Lower earners might not be able to leave potentially bad relationships.

Starting FI early is great but you can compromise a bit.  Start off slow and see which areas shes willing to give up more on.  Maybe switch from designer makeup to something cheaper and limit the amount she buys until she runs out.  In regards to hair products have her try going a month without it and see if it really makes any difference.  Im betting it wont matter and shell give that up eventually.  Another thing that helped me was having my wife read up on FI and get on the same page as me.  We still go out to eat every now and then but not nearly as often as we used to.

Seems like just as much work as YNAB or Mint but a slightly different user interface.Gist is rather than estimate his expenses for the month he just estimates how much hell make each day and look to spend less than that.  Solidflat bills rent Netflix domain name are split out to a daily cost and everything else is just tracked as it is spent.  Basically spend money fill out the appform so it is tracked.  Have a running total of how redgreen you are for the day.My issues are there is no accounting for adjustable bills like electric and water.  Nor is there any accounting for future costs like car maintenance.  To me it looks like it will just be a single purchase style that completely knocks that day into the red rather than prorating that bill out over the entire monthyear.The main issue from the author seemed to be with estimating so it appears he completely gave up on estimating so he could have most of his month green and a few days of really really red.Seems like a good start and appears great for tracking those stupid small purchases but personally I would add in some estimated costs for things you know you will spend on.,financialindependence,cx3d0b8,8,t5_2t34z

But between the matching dollars and investment returns youll have about K in your retirement accounts.After  years youll have reduced your take home pay by K but your holdings will be worth .M.

This alone will make me about  by the end of the loan.We purchase other real estate with cash fix it up rent it then mortgage it out and take the money to buy new real estate.  This has allowed us exponential and leveraged real estate growth which has averaged over  in the last five years.None of this would have been possible without debt.

6016445,0,t3_3xvdte,Theres a few different ways I look at this and each time the answer comes out to no but the answer doesnt come out to me being selfless as opposed to selfish. It comes out to neutral.Firstly at my current job I dont help anyone directly. I may be helping people indirectly I am helping the economy and if I give money to charity I am being charitable. However Im not helping myself as much as I could be anyway. I dont think helping yourself makes you selfish but everyone needs a minimum level of self care and it varies from amongst individuals. For one thing I am stressed out and thats not good for my health.Looking at it from that approach the answer is neutral  I am neither selfish nor selfless since they cancel each other out.Another way that I look at this is if Im retired I have the time to not just work on hobbies but also to volunteer especially if theres a natural disaster in another part of the world and that area needs volunteers immediately. I no longer have to worry about getting permission at work about having a job when I come backnot having money etc. I can make a greater impact by going to a place of my choosing so long as the charity allows me to do so. An additional benefit in my mind is that Im not just throwing money at the problem. I am extremely hesitant about giving money to charities because I dont know how much of it actually goes to helping the cause vs. administrative costs or whatever.From that perspective I am being more selfless being ER. ,financialindependence,cy8a68n,1,t5_2t34z

6016837,0,t3_3xvdte,Heres my take on it.Selfishness can manifest itself in many different ways but I think that people generally agree being selfish to the point of avarice is bad. It tends to leave people unfulfilled and depressed.But its also selfish to want to be personally fulfilled by giving money away to others. Youre not doing it for the benefit of others youre just doing it to make yourself feel better others just happen to get something out of it. Even worse is if you use it as a cudgel to beat others about the head with how charitable you are. It is also selfish to want to assuage your own personal guilt for being rich and successful by trying to improve the lives of others you consider beneath you. In that case its about you dealing with your own problems primarily. As long as you feel good mission successful!Its entirely possible your quest for absolution could hurt the very people youre trying to help. Ever heard the phrase the road to hell is paved with good intentions? European colonists and missionaries went out over the globe practicing the theory of White Mans Burden by colonizing and converting people who never asked for it. Imagine giving away money and taking away any incentive for people to provide for themselves so now your money becomes a crutch. This happens all the time.So no matter what action you take it will be selfish. My advice is to be selfish in a way that makes you feel the best.,financialindependence,cy8c0mz,2,t5_2t34z

Ive heard a lot of the laterinlife midlife crisis but in my experience men in particularincluding myselfsometime within a year or two of age  stop and start asking is this it? I thought it would be different. I deserve better. What should I do now? Edit And invariably make a poor decision or three. No matter what their situation. At  I was making pretty decent money for the time but thought I was hot stuff who could command more money easily. I quit the company I was with for  years and joined a startup with dreams of stock options being worth lots. Oops. That was early  right before the IT job market imploded.But aside from my unfortunate timing I learned humility because it turns out I wasnt as hot as I thought and people wouldnt pay me what I thought I deserve just because I thought I deserved it.And thats the key here. This country doesnt reward you based on what you think you deserve. And sadly neither for what you need.The trick is to make other people happy enough to hand money to you. The easiest way to do that is to work for a company that treats is employees slightly better than average and make them happy enough to promote you. You can do it on your own but then you have to work even harder to find people who might want a service you can provide then provide it to them then manage the taxes accounting collecting and so fort which is a lot of work you probably arent interested in and finding other people to do it for you is expensive. And then theres always insurance lawsuits nonpaying customers partners that mess you up.... Its doable but dont think its easy.TLDR The most important point is that your ability to work with other people and have them like you is key to promotions with a W employer and in succeeding with your own business. Your view of the world and yourself is irrelevant to making money.Edit  And I guarantee you you dont know how to make others happy in the context of this posts topic otherwise you wouldnt be asking what you asked. What makes others happy isnt what you think it is and youll need to put some effort into that.,financialindependence,cya6ej8,10,t5_2t34z

6061545,0,t3_3yjeeh,I was in a similar situation with the same income to debt ratio. The hard part is preventing lifestyle creep. When you pay off those loans you want to buy the things you never could I spent  years paying mine off but if FI is your main goal its best to just set up an auto transfer to your investment accounts and act like its a bill that needs to be paid to yourself.That being said lifestyle creep got me a little bit but I try to limit it to hobbies vs unnecessary luxuries like house and cars etc.There will be a lot of pressure among your peers for you to spend like them. Try not to fall into that trap especially if FI is your goal. Its so easy to think we deserve these luxuries or we make more than they do we should have those audis and vacations too.I know I still have moments where I think those things but FI is my priority then I know I can have those things if I keep working without delaying my FI. And Im hoping I wont want those things anyway. Chances are you will want to focus on spending time with your children as well. You can use them as an excuse as well as the student loan balance even if they are paid off. Between that and the  kids you should be able to usethem  as an excuse to stay frural because you will probably be saving for their future as well.I hope that advice helps!,financialindependence,cye5uzl,3,t5_2t34z

You can do it.  It will be at a slower rate.  I think I still would have reached FI early although I think I would have had to go with a fairly limited lifestyle in order to actually retire more than  years early.In the last several years my income has gone up substantially.  I can certainly build wealth much more easily now than I did in the past.  Plus from my past experience I tend toward frugality so lifestyle inflation was held in check completely for the first few years of earning more.Think of it with the analogy of digging a hole.  You can certainly dig a hole with a gardening trowel and after a lot of time and effort youll probably end up with a decentsized hole.

If you live somewhere like Hawaii with high energy prices and large subsidies it makes sense to put in solar.  If you live somewhere where energy is cheaper it probably doesnt.  Figure out how much youll really save per year and compare that number to the allin cost for solar installation.  If it will take more than five years for it to pay off wait.

6131194,0,t1_cymiuls,My opinion is that of someone who has successfully invested in real estate for over  years. During the bubble many people leveraged themselves to the hilt putting zero down and seriously increasing their financing costs creating negative cashflow. They justified this with the notion that the property would increase in value enabling them to come out ahead when they sold.I have never subscribed to this view. Sure in the long run real estate will increase in value but its a business first and an investment second. That means it needs to turn a profit from day one and as long as the business is turning a profit youre not going to be under any pressure to sell. Interestingly enough during the housing crash rents actually went up as people lost their homes and demand for rental accommodation increased.So yes it is your opinion but from where Im sitting your opinion is not well informed and you do everyone a disservice in sharing it.,financialindependence,cymjwxi,2,t5_2t34z

6217866,0,t1_cyvrvzq,So imagine theres this company that is not part of the focus of index investors. Thus its value is low. However there are some people who see it has a great opportunity for growth. They invest in this company and indeed it produces attractive products and grows. The company rewards the stock holders by giving them dividend. If the stock price stays lowish because no index investors are investing in this particular company soon active investors get a very nice dividend on this particular stock so much so that more active investors flock to it. And its price and size keeps growing until it gets into the scope of index investors.Or alternatively imagine that  of the companies within an index are doing great  are doing poorly but their stock prices are still high because index investors invest in them and  is on the brink of bankruptcy. The small percentage of active investors will try to identify the companies that are doing great and will invest more in them being rewarded with higher returns dividends etc and less bankruptcies. By the way active investors have been terrible at identifying winners and losers since the beginning of the stock market but if the situation that you describe arises it might become easier to do better than an index investor. Given those nicer returns than index investors more people become active investors until the advantage that they have disappears again it becomes harder to beat index investors. ,financialindependence,cywekso,2,t5_2t34z

6278426,0,t3_41kns1,What career? lol.. Computer programmer then product marketing manager then corporatemarketing communications writer then real estate investorproperty manager now creative writer.. The careers that actually made me money? I tried to tie up my identity in them but it was always an awkward fit. Im not really the kind of person who can consider a job just a jobI put a lot of myself into whatever I do which probably explains why I burned out of so many lucrative careers. I was a real estate investor longest but thats largely because I had so much money tied up in it and so many loans that it wasnt something I could quit until I finished up what I meant to do. Technically Im still in it but its pretty minimal effort. Creative writer however has always been a strong part of my identity. My life simply does not work unless I have some creative time in it.. Writing is personally very meaningful and important to me but whether or not its meaningful and important to anyone else is highly debatableprobably there are more people who see me as frittering away time on a silly hobby than not but to be any kind of a creative artist you have to ignore those people. Its an amazing thing to write something that touches someone deeply but its not a predictable thing.... I write what I write and put it out there and hope someone responds. But I make peanuts doing itdoing art for the money is a fools game. For every bestselling author making bank from their work there are thousands of talented people making next to nothing. Talent helps but its no guarantee of financial success. As for all of my other shortlived careers I think I kept trying to ascribe a purpose to something that made money but ultimately that never really worked.... it wasnt a meaningful purpose and Im not built to just do something for the money without an authentic sense of meaning behind the work.But as for respectability I think at each stage I have made less money salarywise and went lower in respectability. ,financialindependence,cz3abm4,2,t5_2t34z

Some simple advice I can give tough is that if you guys are getting by with the income you have now it shouldnt be an issue at all to literally save every dime your wife makes when she does work. If youre wife can get back to work this year make k a year and put every bit of it into the IRA at  interest a year with K yearly deposits youre looking at K when around age  with assumed  interest per year. If you can also seek for more income or grow your business whatever you can max out your roth and contribute to your k too.My biggest advice though is when your wife does start to work dont just assume that as extra spending money let that totally be for savings.

The only thing thats relevant is whether a mutual fund can consistently perform better over a long period of time the alternative is knowing which active fund will outperform the index in a particular year aka market timing and if that was easy active funds would outperform in bull markets too.,financialindependence,czefma1,3,t5_2t34z

6705479,1,t3_47f1st,Well there are papers on this exact topic.One thing to keep in mind it is not in any way up to you how your grandchildren and great grandchildren spend their money. You cannot decide to be in that  they have to.A good way is to set up a trust. Allow all of your descendants to borrow from that trust for business purposes only but it must he paid back with no interest of course.Have family properties owned by that trust. A few and big ones. Any of your direct descendants may live there. That gives them all a chance to take risks without worrying about being put out on their ass. Those properties are not to be sold must be purchased in goodrural areas.The most important thing raise your kids right. Not as good people but as smart people. They must be ruthlessly selective of their mates that they have kids with that they will be good parents loyal to them in particular and for women particularly their partners should be at least as well off as them this is a must I dont care if it is sexist. Raise them to also be very loyal to their partners of course only after they have vetted them well. Divorce is not an option for your daughters make sure they know that clearly before they start vetting men. They should get less than sons because it pressures them to select a man that is as strong and ambitious as you. Raise them to want to start their own trust for their descendants and to only use your trust to kick their own off. Whether they get a formal education or not they should be well versed in finances and in managing people well. Try to encourage them to get a formal education and demand that they do it in something that actually requires intelligence and is financially rewarding. Do not tell them to be this way guide them there regardless of your feelings.If you have businesses require them to be competent demand it and then give them positions of power in those businesses.All of your money and assets shouldnt go in this trust but most of it should. Millions at least. The rest give it to them as you see fit.And be a little heartless with giving your kids your wealth. One of them is a fuck up? He gets enough to get him through  years living a decent but modest life. One shows promise? Give him or her moremaybe a small one million dollar loan. Love your kids but they dont all get an equal share of the pie. Some of your kids will show more promise will be more ambitious will be smarter. Some of them will be stupid. Love them all but be very clear in your observations. Everything about them is a reflection of you know that. But that doesnt mean you owe them something if they are fuck ups.Hire a lawyerfirm and financial advisors design a will do not have a family member administer the trust but only your direct descendants can be beneficiaries. Your fortune will have a constitution that all beneficiaries will be bound to. Their upbringing will make them strong smart shrewd people. Andy lazy idiot spawn will not have access to squander what you built. And the smart ones will have the room to make great things happen for themselves.The things that cause family fortunes to dry up are dividing it up every generation people living off of it instead of building it more getting married and losing it in divorce and liquidation of family owned assets because they dont build wealth but they expend it. How are you going to prevent people after you are dead from doing these things? Raise them into people that build wealth that are determined to leave theirs with more than you left them take pride in family and see their upbringing as tradition pride in the businesses and that dont marry people that they wind up divorcing. This may require some thinking much separated from our modern popular touchy feely version of whats right you will have to raise your kids to be a little mean.,financialindependence,d0cwkle,0,t5_2t34z

Every day now we have LOTS of posts from people who didnt even read the faq or are still in college and seem to think this is some get rich quick sub. A lot more acceptance or even promotion for people to spend more on their way to FI than there used to be. Youre right about the people that are  or less even to FI spreading around their hate on FIers like they would do it differently and maybe they will. I think having the new flair can help with who you want to listen to in some posts but I also think non FIERS can provide some interesting perspectives in some situations. But yeah I feel like what youre saying is this sub is becoming more like pf with less FI members and more people who may never become FI and cant really contribute to your higher level discussions which instead  get pushed aside for all the hey Im  how can I be FI posts.

6835700,0,t1_d0qt8g8,He may have been poorly articulating a different life lesson. If you have something of value to give back to the community charging for it IS giving back to the community. Just because you are earning money doing it does not mean you are not giving back. In a healthy economic scenario both the provider of the service AND the customer win. It is a net win for the good of the community. You are selling yourself short just providing services for no return even if you enjoy it.But your desire to give to people who cannot afford your services is also admirable. Pure charity is good fulfilling and a tax write off.Perhaps a better optimally altruistic plan is this Teach classes and charge a fee. Offer to subsidize these classes to people who are demonstrably underprivileged unemployed homeless low income whatever your criteria is either let them attend for free or on a sliding scale. Maybe use the profits from the paying customers pay for any class materials needed by the non paying ones. Take a tax write off for your charitable work to the non paying customers as you have even established precisely what your class is worth what the paying customers are willing to pay. Now you have a self sustaining system for the good of the community the wealthier members of the community engage in a winwin economic trade and are not discriminated against ie. they can get the training also even if they wouldnt qualify for your charity and you still are helping the underprivileged. Now since this actually has profit motive you can clone yourself with other people doing the same who are not in the same privileged situation you are and actually need to earn some money.So to put your mothers words more clearly she may have meant Dont be silly youd have to charge some people to make it worthwhile otherwise youd be wasting your time missing out an opportunity to have a much larger impact.,financialindependence,d0r4mwg,11,t5_2t34z

6941868,0,t1_d134rcd,gt If handouts encouraged entrepreneurism wed have seen a disproportionate amount of it amongst the millions of people already on welfare.I think youre making  mistakes here. Youre only looking at subset of the population not the population as a whole. Thats cheery picking. Having a decent welfare doesnt just affect the recipients. It reduces risk to all members of the population. This is why in developed countries you see higher rates of entrepreneurship in countries with a welfare system than developed countries like the US that have little to no welfare system. . Having a decent welfare system disproportionately helps children. The bulk of a decent welfare system goes towards caring for protecting and educating the populations children. Without welfare there is little to no opportunity for children to develop the tools to escape poverty let alone escape poverty. Your original reply seems to agree with this. You stated that people from wealthy backgrounds have more access to education and guidance from their families and this is definitely true. It scales down in the other direction. Again the US is the classic example here little in the way of welfare and nearly the lowest social mobility in the developed world. Having a decent welfare system is closely correlated to having good social mobility. You dont want to be born to the poor or middle classes in the US because you will effectively be stuck in them. . You are right that having family money is better than welfare but you are wrong to claim that its earned money. It might be for the parents but its for the kids. Its just another form of guaranteed income. Like all money be it from your parents or as part of a welfare system reduces risk. This reduction in risk is the real value because it gives opportunity to experiment.Lastly people are not naturally lazy. The whole of human history is a perfect counter example. Dont confuse people feeling hopeless about being able to change their situation with being lazy. Edit In the US at least entrepreneurs actually take more welfare i.e. any government hand out than nonentrepreneurs. And increasing welfare does increase entrepreneurship rates. ,financialindependence,d136urv,2,t5_2t34z

The reason is that office jobs have their salaries adjusted upwards when you live in a high COL area. But its also easy to be more frugal in high COL for someone with a FI mindset. Sure a parking space in NYC might be mo whereas its free in Omaha and your salary moving from Omaha to NYC would probably be adjusted up to cover that cost but you dont actually need a car in NYC!However high COL does pretty much preclude you from doing the kind of highvolume outright ownership real estate that youre doing.,financialindependence,d17riey,5,t5_2t34z

After awhile I got more comfortable and my commentary became more naturalfun. Thats when the subscriber number took off.As I said Im very specialized. Think of the car mechanic vids that get millions of millions of millions of views just in a more technical field and without that many views.That said lets plays are great for a quick cash boom.

Its good to have driving experience when sharing the road with drivers and if you like to travel driving can be the best way to get around dont have to learn the local transportation system which especially helps when visiting many areas quickly.I personally only drive one a week or so. I bike to work and most of my errands but occasionally my wife and I take my son somewhere that is impractical to walk or take a bus to like my grandparents house a park outside of town or something else.Driving isnt something that you should just pick up and it takes time to build up reflexes and awareness since the human mind wasnt exactly designed for traveling at high speed at a resting heart rate.For reference the city I live in has mediocre public transit the nearest bus station is  mile away so Im not exactly accustomed to living in a well served area though I do take the bus occasionally when the weather doesnt cooperate.,financialindependence,d1wz70n,2,t5_2t34z

I started by putting these on Ebay starting at a penny and they each pulled a profitable amount. I made a few other different props after that. I then focused on getting the right people to do most of the machining and equipmentheavy work for me but I still do all the design and business stuff myself.

7258031,0,t3_4eta0b,I think the trick is finding the right balance between frugality and extravagance. You dont want to cut things to the bone and miss major life opportunities because you were too cheap. You also dont want to live eyeballdeep in debt like most Americans.But there is a middle ground. Our most valuable resource is not money its time. You can always make more money but time once spent is forever gone.For that reason I think its important to find ways to enjoy life  vacations a gap year pursuing passions and hobbies or whatever it is you need to be doing in your life  quite apart from FI or ER goals. Of course this may slow down your FI progress but thats a risk Im willing to take. And frankly I know many people with serous health issues even in middle age. Its important to make the most of the time we have.Neither extreme hedonism or total asceticism will do. Its the middle path that leads to happiness.,financialindependence,d236q4f,61,t5_2t34z

Im sick of people telling me I cant live off of x when Im already living off less than x. Its all excuses. Accidentally got pregnant. Accident this and that.Being mad all the time is bad for your health.  The whole stress lack of good friendships and whatever else is rather detrimental and will make your retirement less than optimal.gtYou know when I decided to be FI? I realized I was causing my own problems and made the choice to cut spending. There was no mystery about it. We are where were are financially becuase of choices we made. Not the least of which was buying a house  of what we were approved to buy. Its also why we own it outright.Silly me thinking that it makes more financial sense to have a mortgage and get the higher return from investments.

People screw things up for themselves. Its like people chose not to be successful.I believe you making this post is you advertising it.gtIn one of my psychology courses I learned you know what you do if you cant sell something?

My first anvil was an old stump with a sledgehammer head pounded into it. I cooked my own charcoal in an old  gallon drum using wood from handsplit fir logs. My quench medium was a gallon bucket of rancid vegetable oil mixed with bacon grease. My tempering oven was a shitty old electric toaster.Of course the equipment I use today is a farcry from the primitive methods I started with. Over the years Ive managed to turn a fun hobby into a tremendous financial asset all while scrounging around for the best deals on used but quality equipment at yard sales and blacksmith meetups. Granted my income from this endeavor is very active but there have been times where I was making upwards of hour pure profit due to large custom knife orders  usually around Christmas.I cant tell you how many hundreds of knives Ive made or how many thousands of dollars Ive earned at the anvil but I will say that I funded every dollar of a  home repair last year simply from selling my work. Its tough work though and I always make sure that I spend at least an hour every day of the week in the shop. Usually I spend much more time there  but even when I dont want to get off my ass I still force myself to get in there and at least do something for an hour even if its just sweeping the floor.Its not difficult to get into blacksmithing really  anyone can do it for a minimal investment of around  and the willingness to learn.

7514777,0,t3_4i9loz,My SO just unexpectedly got offered the job of her dreams  shes been doing freelance makeup for weddings etc on the side for a couple years very successfully and worked retail in makeup outlets for years but now a highend spa has approached her and offered to let her run her makeup business out of their premises. Its a busy place that currently does hair nails spa treatments everything but makeup and the owner has decided theyve turned down too much business in the past because thats the one area where they dont have any expertise in.Theyre setting my SO up with a little studio in the corner of one floor on their building. Shell be paying them rent mo for use of the studio but in charge of setting her own prices offering whatever services she likes and marketing herself though the spa is advertising her too and giving her a marketing budget. Its a bit of an odd setup but seems like the perfect combination of working for yourself without the risk of fronting an entire business on her own. Between my income and our savings and our low living expenses were in a good position where she can try this out and see if this can be a practical fulltime gig. While Im excited for her getting to try out her dream job Im also kinda looking forward to helping her out with the finance side of her business. Ive been using YNAB for a couple months and Im very nerdily excited to help her track her businesses income and expenses and all that jazz.Neither one of us have ever had to manage finances or a small business like this before so itll be an interesting learning experience.

7516242,0,t1_d2w9sey,Bitcoin is a currency. Its utility is debatable but politics aside the great accomplishment was building a software currency that is peer to peer and trustless without intermediaries. I can send you money via PayPal because you and I each trust PayPal. I could mail you a check if I trusted you. With Bitcoin I can transfer value to you easily without trusting you or vice versa and there is a public record called the blockchain that proves that I made the transfer.Ethereum is a programming language that allows me to execute code on a blockchain. I can write a program for instance that says if uTimmaC does something upload a file solve a math problem or something else provable then send him some payment. The program I wrote pays the Ethereum network a small fee to execute my instructions. The payment could be in Ether Bitcoin etc. Other software can do this already of course. Thats not the big deal.The really greatest thing the big deal is that Ethereum is also a trustless network like Bitcoins network. That means that my program can operate without any intermediary... Theres no PayPal taking . Theres no government that can eavesdrop or manipulate it and the results are provable at any time. The nature of the network allows for socalled smart contracts. These contracts once theyre in the Ethereum network are immutable provable without needing to trust a third party and can automatically disburse value.Theres a lot of promise with technology like that so thats why I made the long shot investment.

I did the  travel corporate gig and it just wasnt for me because it didnt give me any time to have a social life and I was traveling to a bunch of shitty cities where it was difficult to meet people. If I was traveling to bigger cities it would have made a world of difference but as it was I was getting sick all the time from travel and the lifestyle just wasnt for me. My spouse on the other hand was made to travel and could definitely handle that lifestyle better than I could. The job itself was also highly stressful because you had to constantly prove your worth to corporate which is not something you really ever have to think about in gov.  Aside from worklifestress balance the other factor is how much sooner youll reach FI. With the gov gig you potentially will get a pension after  years which is difficult to get nowadays. But with the new gig youll get to travel and get to FI potentially years earlier? Also lets say the new gig doesnt work out  is it a recognized company that would potentially open up doors for you if you needed to look elsewhere?

7744818,0,t1_d3mg8aq,I think you misunderstand something. I think you are conflating dividends with capital gains.Gains from sale of stocks mutual funds houses etc. are taxed at your marginal income tax rate if they are held for a short time. They are taxed at your marginal capital gains rate if they are considered a long time holding.A similar thing is at play for dividends but is not based on holding period. Qualified dividends are taxed at your marginal cap gains rate. Unqualified dividends are taxed at your marginal income tax rate.So if you buy a stock which gives you qualified dividends they will be taxed at your marginal cap gains rate even if you have owned the stock for less than a year.DRIP plans or opting for dividend reinvestment with a brokerage simply receive the dividend and purchase shares even fractional shares with that money. The newly purchased shares are deemed short term holding until a year has passed. At the end of the quarter you will be liable for withholding obligations on the dividend income if they apply to you. At the end of the year tax will be due on the dividends.There is also the NIIT tax a . tax on marginal unearned income above AGI of  but thats a different animal. ,financialindependence,d3mj2lg,2,t5_2t34z

Power engineers can also be process operators where we keep the plant running and producing whatever product that particular process provides.  As for the employment status power engineers can be employees or contractors depending the companys requirements.  Contractors typically make more than employees but they also have to cover their own costs which in the end could be roughly equal.

7861426,0,t1_d3zmk1z,Why would salaries increase? Sure youd have fewer very desperate people wholl work for peanuts because theres no alternative but in a UBI situation the current welfare incentives against work disappear you dont suddenly lose your UBI if you make too much money and humans in general are happier if they do things. Id expect more available labor because of that or at the very least no significant drop and the presently mandated minimum wage is already artificially high compared to the huge availability of minwageskilled workers so even if UBI caused way fewer people to choose to do lowskill service work I dont think itd be enough fewer to push their wages above what they are now. And highskill jobs are paid enough already that UBI wouldnt be nearly enough to motivate people to quit so I dont think theres any reason thatd be a problem either. ,financialindependence,d3zp1ft,2,t5_2t34z

7949740,0,t1_d49gkvj,gtBut the reality is anyone can achieve wealth no matter their background if they are intelligent enough and hard working enough. Quit making excuses for people.Intelligence is luck and history as well. If your family is welleducated and prioritizes learning or even has the wealth to ignore the fact that you are free labor long enough to give you a thirst for knowledge then you are much more likely to be intelligent. hours a week assuming you work  days per week and work at places where the average commute is  minutes each way means that you have around . hours that you arent working on work or sleeping. House work added to that probably totals around  hours per week if you stay very clean and another  hours per week for eating dinner. You have around  hours per week to spend on things that are not mandatory. I would go insane but more power to you.As for you didnt build that. Hell I agree with the man. He says you are relying on the hard work and ingenuity of a thousand other people every time you make a sale. Which is true. Hes also not making any kind of significant point though. You also cant purchase anything or spend money without the help of all those ancestors before you. Appreciating those that came before you is basically irrelevant to your moving up in social and economic class. Agreed.At its core the argument that luck and history matter more than your hard work and intelligence is the argument that you are small. You are insignificant against the world you live in. Human nature rallies against that and desires to feel big and important. So we remember our wins and our losses and sure the losses are because the world is imperfect and unfair but the wins oh the wins are because we did it we made those wins happen not the world. We didnt get lucky we got smart or we worked hard or we deserved it.So let me be clear you are small you are unimportant nothing you do or will ever do will be because you are innately awesome. It will be because you were lucky or you had resources that no one else did. You may be special but you do not deserve it. Actors do not deserve their fame billionaires do not deserve their fortunes and thirdworld countries do not deserve their suffering.You dont have to believe me now. Soon enough your jobs your business and your existence at least economically will become irrelevant. You literally wont be able to pay people to let you do a job.Until then good luck getting your business off the ground.

Theres a lot of opportunities there.  But I dont know what sort of work will make you happy long term.  Instead lets talk about skills that transcend your particular occupation.   Do several of the things below and youll find that you do just fine financially Learn to sell.  If you can sell youll always have a job.  Yes the most direct application is a job as a salesperson or sales engineer and you may not find that interesting few developers do.  But sales skills come into play all over the place.  Whether its interviewing pitching your company to potential recruits convincing your management that youve earned a promotion or whatever if you can sell it helps.  As you move up in your career this becomes more important.  If you start a consultancy as youve suggested this will be the biggest part of your job. Learn to speak.  Develop your communication and presentation skills so that you are the one presenting ideas to senior management or giving talks to industry groups.  This skill helps if youre just in a meeting it helps if youre running for president and it helps just about everywhere in between.  The person who can speak articulately compellingly and will find a lot of advantages in life. Learn to team.  No matter how good you are technically the odds are extremely high that you will work in a team setting.  Learn how to deal with people how to do conflict well how to help others how to be healthily assertive how to listen and how to be a good teammate all around and it will help you.  A friend of mine is a gifted musician  hes played on grammy nominated  records and been very much in demand as a bandmate and session player in his time.  He describes it this way its not just if you can play but if youre the person they want in the van driving between gigs all day every day.  Thats as true for programmers as it is for bass players.  Be the guy everybody wants on the team not just because youre outstanding technically but also because people like to work with you. Learn to lead.  People who can effectively organize inspire and direct others to achieve a goal are valuable.  If you can be the person that others look to to lead them out of a tough spot or to lead them towards a new great thing you will not hurt for work pretty much ever.  ,financialindependence,d4dd2lx,4,t5_2t34z

Many Burning Man attendees share some of the counterculture positions you said you have. The week long event is FULL of learnings from sculptures carpenters painters musicians engineers welders fire juggling yoga sword swallowing costume making  jewelry making spirituality architecture bumper cars...the list goes on.  Its a  person community so sure there are all extremesof people from weirdos to class acts but the strong majority of people are there collaborating and exchanging ideas for the sole purpose of sharing and having fun. Theres are hundreds of classes DAILY  to explore any number of interests. Its pricey to get a ticket for entry but once there all of  the sharing and comunity and events are all free. There is no buying or selling of anything at the event. People bring what they need to eat and live comfortably for a week. Everything at the end gets burned to the ground. Im recommending Burning Man solely on the merit of the exposure to hobbies and interests it has to offer. I havent even touched the subject of some of the nontangible life changing experiences that can come from attending such an event where selfless human interaction is encouraged and practiced.

Pick one that has a year closest to your planned retirement date.This will autorebalance for you and adjust its allocation from stocks to bonds as you get closet to retirement. It also has a cheap minimum investment of  vs  for most other funds. By watching and understanding the target date fund youll learn what a standard diversified portfolio allocation for your age looks like and also learn how the rebalancing occurs. Once youre more confident with it you can exchange the target date fund and build out your own portfolio if you feel confident with it.Also I wouldnt worry about tax loss harvesting right now. It really only helps if youre selling investments through the year or wanna lower your income for the year.

The one that stuck out to me was that you can use the funds at a select number of universities around the world. In theory this means you could sign up to study in say the UK or Australia or somewhere youd like to go and use it as a taxsheltered way to visit a country of your choosing.  So youd retire move to Australia for study spend  weeks of the year studying assuming two twelve week semesters then spend the rest of your time surfing or whatever. The  plan allows you to cover reasonable living expenses if I remember rightly so all youd need is a bit of spending money for the stuff thats not covered.Note Im Australian and while I was quite enamoured with this idea I do t know enough about it to say whether or not this is possible for everyone.Edit What Im getting at is that it could be a very efficient means of saving if you want to travel the world and dont mind the commitment of full time study.,financialindependence,d52syvv,2,t5_2t34z

If that is possible anything you add into your k is giving you a bonus of being pretax.

Do you have a  or whatever chance of success if you follow the rote suggestions that could be given by almost any new member of rPF or rFI? Yeah probably.

Some people do have the emotional fortitude to watch the numbers come crashing down on the screen and think perfect time to buy. Do I have to have lived through the Great Depression to look back at all the data and say based on past performance this will correct?

So I implicitly assume historic average  volatility  however do not assume the same pattern. This is likely why a few of my possible futures are more extreme in a given simulation because the sequence of returns is a bit worse than what we have seen before.

But this means that those billions invest like a business and have businesslike interests. Generally charity and normal economic activity are at odds with each other otherwise there would be no need for charity.Disney lobbies to gut the public domain at great social expense because it makes them money. They then take some of their exorbitant profit and give a bunch of free trips to Disney World to cancer kids.The Koch brothers run a massive energy consortium built in large part on coal. This gives them a vested interest in opposing solar. But they also give a TON of money to education art and public works projects.If my goal is charity should I invest in Disney or industrial concerns? These corporations for all of their charity and my desire to spend my returns charitably create a lot of need for charity through their environmental legal and social pollution.The point of charity is to take money and make it do only good. Giving money away completely is one method. Ethical investment is another. There are plenty of funds based on the latter principle. Elon Musk put a huge amount of personal wealth toward advancing the electric vehicle concept for a more entrepreneurial example.So should Rowling buy a bunch of SampP stock and dole out the dividends slowly?

We plan to exchange these funds for a four fund portfolio containing VTSMX VGTSX VBMFX and VTIBX.  Well convert to admiral shares when possible.  From our research it looks like VGTSX gt VTSMX gt VBMFX  VTIBX when it comes to tax efficiency.  Does this sound right?Those are our questions.  I think we have a pretty good handle on things and were just looking for clarification on a couple of points.  Thanks!,financialindependence,d6qnqty,6,t5_2t34z

If you dont keep track of your money there is a very slim chance you will be able to save as much as you need. Use Mint Personal Capital YNAB or an excel sheet and figure out where your money is going.Once you have a budget and can stick to it religiously make sure you are getting as much employer match from your k that you can. If your employer matches the first  you put in you need to be putting in at least . Next take extra money you have and fund an IRA. You and your wife can both do this. After than go back to your k and up your withholding rate to as high as you can while still working with your budget. If you can withhold  after your budget and IRA then do .

So its not surprising that it casts early retirement as unattainable.  To me its incredibly obvious that early retirement is attainable for some significant portion of American society.  Dude  gets by just fine making  and spending  a  savings rate.  Dude  lives a perfectly content life rich with material comforts friends family and overall comfort.Along comes Dude  earning  who is just as happy spending  as is the guy earning  its a sweet life after all.

To answer your irrelevant question...certainly you have more left when you take out  vs. .  But thats not the point or in any way related to what myself and everyone else is saying about home values inclusion in Net Worth and in FIRE.The point which another poster raised is that your equity in a home is meaningless as it relates to an asset calculation for SWR unless youre willing to liquidate the home.  If you have K in a home but have  in non living expenses that K is meaningless.  To that  expense tt doesnt matter if that K asset reduced your costs from  to  you still have a  expense and no assets to pay for it.So when it comes to FIRE there are  components  projected expenses and projected assets and an assumed safe withdrawal rate or other means of cash flow.  Your assertion is to include the home as an asset.  Myself and basically everyone else are suggesting unless your plans are to liquidate you address the home on the expense side of the equation.  ,financialindependence,d70sytb,3,t5_2t34z

I would be able to decide what to research how to do it etc. It would only make k more with a PhD and that number decreases when I consider how much comparable industry experience would boost my salary.However the main reason I dont get my PhD isnt so much the money but what I would do after. Im a software developer and I can do this job basically anywhere. With a PhD my geographical location is suddenly very limited.

Its called The Earth AwaitsHow does it differ from a site like Nomadlist or Teleport? It takes your inputs about family size lifestyle housing needs and a number of other requirements and builds the budgets for you dynamically. Then it filters out the cities that dont match your needs.  You can filter on pollution crime rate quality of life or include and exclude countries and cities with text filters. You can browse the cities in a beautiful interface edit the budgets line item by line item if you dont like the way they were calculated and even download them as as a CSV for editing in the comfort of your own home.  You can share the cities on social media  and your friends including the budget choices you made.Each city also has a lot of useful information about language currency weather personal freedoms and other stuff I felt like the FIRE community and other communities would want.

Completely out of the blue it seems and didnt let on to other people much before pulling the plug.I was overhearing coworkers who also have said pension which is not available to newer employees wonder aloud how she did it. Shes  and has the max years of service but faces a penalty if she starts drawing funds before . Coworkers were like wow she must have taken the hit for early withdrawal penalty! and spent a couple minutes discussing that before one of them said wait I guess you could just retire now and defer taking the withdrawals for  years?I found it interesting that their mind immediately jumped to she has to have an income stream coming in from the pension THE DAY SHE RETIRES and then the lightbulb finally going off ohhhhhhhhhh righhhhhtt savings. ,financialindependence,d7pb1kp,29,t5_2t34z

My employers have historically been willing to pay for talent but that doesnt mean that I got top of the scale pay.I should have an update on these within the next couple of weeks as I also asked for higher eq. gt Asking for a raise is tough as startups usually are cash poor. The time to ask is right after the company has closed a financing round. If theyre in the middle of fundraising theyre focused on burn rate and rightly so. Asking for a raise then sounds pretty out of touch to a management team thats constantly asking how many months worth of cash do we have?Closing one in about a month actually. Fingers crossed.gt The other way you get paid at a startup is by having the chance to have much greater breadth and depth to your work. The downside to this is you work an awful lot. The upside is that you can get five years worth of experience at a normal company in two years at a startup. I grew more as a professional in the first three years of my first startup than I did in the previous seven at more normal jobs. This can pay off even if the startup doesnt ultimately succeed.Definitely learning a bunch. Both about the industry the world and myself.gt Most of the time I felt like I couldnt possibly keep it up. In fact I feel that way about my current job right now. Almost always I could. It helps if you see the company gaining traction.Very rollercoasterygt All that to say that if you see your company gaining business momentum and becoming more relevant its probably worth sticking it out.

The expected way the market should work is that you can Identify good companies that will grow  give good returns Invest money in them Earn good returnsBut the above is something even the Professionals have trouble doing in the longrun. Indexes beat them Random Algos beat them Monkeys can beat themSee also posted elsewhere here by me the NYTs article discussing the study where essentially  mutual funds beat the market over the longterm.Back to this gaming the system phrase you are stuck on. It is me basically saying you found something outside of the expected way picking good companies to get a guaranteed return of the market benchmark because you are following the market benchmark.Additionally someone also had to look at the US market see that it always averages up feel like this will continue into the future and then just buy a little of everything.We could look at other markets in the world and see indexing would work by following the market but wouldnt give you good returns or consistent growth because their market hasnt performed that way.

Most of the papers and articles that we like to quote around here the Trinity Study MMMs shockingly simple math MadFIentists posts etc. have actual data to support their claims. They run simulations they have charts they explain the caveats. What is the success rate of a portfolio with international equities? Why should I care if its a different asset class from the type I am investing in strawman question I know the answer to this one but you need to say this to make it convincing. gt Using much riskier corporate bonds and holding no international equities where returns have historically been lower than the US was just a way for them to jack up their success rate.The Trinity Study was intended to show people that their expectation of  WR was not safe. They had no motivation to jack up their success rate.gt In the process they created a portfolio that is not representative of the average investor let alone the average retiree.Of course.

8982588,0,t3_52ldw2,I have had a similar experience with two sabbaticals that I have taken on my journey to FI. The first was before I had a complete vision and plan for FI in place at this stage I was just a decent saver and doing well career wise. My job had been stressing me out after a couple of years of unrealistic worklife expectations. I was overseas and was considering moving back home to pickup my career there. On a whim I gave notice and decided to travel Asia for  months which was time well spent and a good life experience. However once I got home it was post GFC and finding a job was near impossible. I ended moving back in with my parents while I looked for a job. The next  months I spent highly stressed unable to find work and not doing much. I had significant savings running out of money was not a concern however it was hard to enjoy my freedom while in limbo and without a plan. I did not want to spend my savings not knowing when my income would pickup. I eventually got really depressed and spend most of my time sitting around at home. Luckily during the last  months of unemployment I said screw it and bought a mountain bike. My last days of freedom were spent on my towns extensive trails again a real privilege I look back on fondly. Lessons Learned  Dont take a good income for granted. No matter how much you hate your job consider the alternatives. I think taking a break can be a good idea however anticipate you will not get a job right away. After  months I had to do a bit of jobhopping to finally get back on track. In hindsight I would probably not have quit at all and maybe asked for some unpaid leave as an alternative.  If you do get to FI or take a miniFI have a plan on what you want to do and achieve. Going from a stressful job to sitting at home is not an improvement. So you need to have a plan on what you will do everyday have goals you will work towards and most importantly be willing to spend money.  A budget is key and you should plan a longer break just in case. Also you need to come to terms that you will draw down on your stash there is no way around this. My second break came much later after I was married. This time we had a very solid FI plan and were tracking very well. Again unhappy I quit my job coincidentally from the same employer yes I ended up back there again. This time I was out about  months and with some savings from my wife and our investment income our net worth actually went up just not at the same rate had I been working. However I was ok with that. I also did a ton of trips to new countries and focused on getting in shape. Eventually I landed a great job however had no urgency to get back to work. This was a better experience however I still probably did not utilize my time fully.  Im now  to  year from FI. So no more sabbaticals for me it is head down and full steam ahead until I can do it for real.  ,financialindependence,d7rkic0,1,t5_2t34z

Its pretty easy to live on a  safe withdrawal rate when your bonds and throwing off that kind of interest. But today we are seeing some of the lowest interest rates in decades. The  yr treasury bond is around  so youre basically just breaking even with inflation. Retirees do like fixed income because they have to draw regularly each year.

9146028,0,t3_55iqbi,the military pension is very very good and helps you a lot.  In other ways you dont seem to be on target for a  year retirement. You say you would need k a year in addition to the pension ifwhen your house is paid off.   You also say that youd pay  extramonth for  years and that would pay off your mortgage balance.  At a  rate if thats accurate that means you have  years left on your mortgage  is that accurate?   If so that means you are spending about month on principal and interest now or about k in addition to the military pension now  is that accurate?  Where is the rest going?  Youve told us you are maxing out roths for both of you but there should be another k or so  where is that going?   You could max your k and change those Roths to traditional IRAs and the tax savings would mean you are still able to spend k.But if you try to put k total into house  Roths  taxable you will have to live on less than you say you want to to do it.Also this amount with your current assets if you include all but k of your cash as retirement assets as well and invest it may be enough to retire in  years but  would be very optimistic and  is probably more realistic.Also Im assuming the military pension has a good COLA  if not you need more.If you arent paying for health insurance now spec out what youd be paying under the ACA after retirement  that might increase your expenses if you dont get family coverage from the military.Also  you can get to money in Roths.  Roth in fact if youve had a Roth IRA for  years open one NOW with a minimum if you only have moey in Rothk but not in a Roth IRA you can withdraw contributions and earnings tax free except for a year waiting period on conversions.  This also gives a way to get to money in regular k or IRAs  convert to Roth then withdraw in  years  as long as you have  years of expenses in your Roth this is enough.   Then you also have the option of substantially equal payments.  This allows you to take a percentage between  and  or so depending on your age and calculation of the money in your regular IRA or k every year without a penalty.In short  dont worry too much about getting to regular IRAkTSP money as long as you have a decent chunk saved outside of those which you already are most of the way there with k in Roths.Personally I wouldnt pay off the house unless the interest rate is high gt but if you are very conservative thats an alternative to more bonds and if it will bring you a lot of joy beyond the pure financial benefit to have that debt down thats not unreasonable.   It does mean that you cant take full advantage of the tax deferral benefit of your k though so its decidedly suboptimal unless your k is pretty bad.,financialindependence,d8bbpf2,1,t5_2t34z

9357880,0,t3_58mn34,My old supervisor who was brimming with technical knowledge left a few months ago. Ive learned and improved my technical skills a lot under his tutelage and I was sad to learn from his departure. My company has since hired his replacement but the new hire has a different skill set and isnt as technical as my previous supervisor. Funnily enough Ive since became the most technical person in my company even though Im probably only at half of my supervisors level.When I was working with my previous supervisor I was kept pretty busy as we would often discuss projects and tasks I could take on which he would then set a deadline. Now with lack of oversight over what Im doing Im finding myself... bored. I previously read with amusement how there were some employees who ended up getting paid while doing relatively nothing and now that I found myself in this position Im not satisfied at all.As my new supervisor has little to no technical understanding of our companys platform I ended up having to plan my own projects just to have something to do. Previously there would be some level of urgency at completing them so that kept me busy but now  theres no real urgency so Im just doing it at my own sweet pace.I also realized how easy it is to fool people into thinking youve done a lot of work if the rest doesnt have as much technical knowledge as I do. Case in point Before yesterdays meeting I was asked to talk a little about the miniassignment that we chose for ourselves during the meeting. I only did one of two parts of the assignment and quickly halfassed it and was almost certain people could see my BS but strangely colleagues nodded appreciatively.And during todays meeting where I was helping another department with their report I was hailed as a hero for saving them a weeks worth of time  the resolution was really simple as I played around a few things on the spot but it was perceived to be quite technical. I have this weird permeating feeling that Im a fraud and dont quite know how to shake this feeling away.Id like to improve my technical knowledge further so Im pursuing a technical certification on the side with blessings from both my new supervisor and my company and then depending on whether they offer a pay raise I might find other opportunities elsewhere.Just thought Id vent a little here during a spell of afternoon food coma  boredom.,financialindependence,d926g64,12,t5_2t34z

If you say  returns doubles every  years then putting each generation  years apart should account for it.Then there is inflation if you figure at   then every  years the real value is halved. The comes divorce  which could deplete  or more of a branch.Then comes the risk of Mismanagement which could mean less returns than expected bad investments missing insurance coverage leaving money susceptible to lawsuits etc.The biggest factor is lifestyle inflation. I knew a couple that paid a firm to figure out how long their money would last. The results came back if they liquidated everything they owned and invested it moderately after accounting for inflation the next  generations could live like the parents do.When the kids grew up they had the same study done after inflation the next  generation could live like the children do.

9732443,0,t1_dace3m6,It will create a big problem in that capital will no longer be allocated optimally.  The market needs a mechanism to determine which companies and management teams are best at managing capital.  This is where traditional active management has played a role.When that goes away and everyone is indexing the indexers will be the determiners of capital allocation by market cap or price generally.  The big get bigger.  Very few opportunities for new companies to crack the index.  Less incentive for competition amongst firms.  More incentive for less boat rocking and more coordination amongst competitors.The end game is potentially scarier than paying  and  for active management.I work in the endowment and foundation space and we suggest a mix.  Active where you can find a manager with a true repeatable edge who you can pay a reasonable performancebased fee.  Process not people.  Warren Buffett didnt win because he had a crazy good mind for investing.  He won with discipline and process.  Use passive when there is no manager with measurable edge.I hope when the pendulum swings that the good active managers will have an even bigger edge as there is less competition for those trades.,financialindependence,dacqi85,1,t5_2t34z

Mathematically tax deferred and tax free upon withdrawal returns are identical assuming the same tax rate.  Your tax rate may be lower upon retirement if you plan to have a lower income though.The main reason pensions make more sense in the UK is that you can withdraw a lump sum of up to  of your pension pot tax free on the day you retire.,financialindependence,db433nm,1,t5_2t34z

It really is just some random musings by some stranger on the Internet.Youre married presumably youd like to stay married.  That should be your biggest priority.  Your wife simply isnt as committed to this FIRE idea as you are.  Marriage is about compromise and heres a place where youll need to compromise.  Some facts your wife is sufficiently on board for FIRE just not as quickly as you.  The both of you already have a  savings rate.  You and her can already retire mids and youre asking her to do it early s instead.The bad news the error bars around FIRE are enormous there is no guarantee that your plan will deliver on even mids.  Anything can and something will happen.  The likelihood that even if you increase your savings rate to  youll be able to FIRE at age  on the dot is very low.  So relax a little compromise a little accept that youre still getting your way FIRE! just a few years after youd really like to.  Enjoy the ride more.

Plus I want to spend a lot of time skiing during the winters. Busy season sure messes that up. Part of me just wants to jump ship right after I get my CPA and find a job with less hours and give myself more time to develop those side incomes.

There isnt even a realfull  grocery store down town yet just a couple convenience stores . If youre looking for that carless lifestyle RDU isnt for you. RDU has terrible public transportation. However  if youre looking for suburban living maybe to raise a family  in a low crime and growing area then RDU is a great choice. Cheaper real estate than other major suburban areas great schools very safe etc. Fairly close to the beach.  Decent weather all year round its F right now and I was eating lunch on the beach in short sleeves  days ago when it was F. In cleveland its highs in the s. Also top universities in the area as well No NFL NBA or MLB team but there is an NHL team and Charlotte nearby has NBA and NFL if you are into that. Google fiber available in some areas as well.They are definitely  different areas so one person should have a strong preference toward one or the other. Edit as fsr as hospitals Obviously cleveland clinic and Pitt are top hospitals but Duke unc rex etc are all very good hospitals.

10097752,0,t1_dbncwv0,I think there are a few factors. One is that many people including me are interested in FI and not necessarily RE. The other is that there is a disconnect between those who want to get out of work ASAP and those who want to live a certain lifestyle when RE. Those interested in a more lavish lifestyle are starting to post in FatFIRE because there is a lot of judging here for spending choices. MMM and many of the bloggers on this topic are or at least espouse minimalism. Thats not for everyone. There are also a lot of young people finding this sub and concept and freaking out about how to stop working before they even start. Older people are trying to stop them from forgetting to live while trying to get to retirement. I dont think the live a little comments are about spending a lot but about making sure people dont forget to enjoy the journey because they dont know how long or even if they will get to enjoy the destination. The other issue is we have had a number of people talking about being depressed after achieving FIRE. I think that has scared people into realizing that if they are miserable now achieving FIRE isnt going to fix that. ,financialindependence,dbnr2d7,7,t5_2t34z

10159299,0,t1_dbo0gte,RE investor here.  This type of investments is usually a bad idea.  These are generally lowend properties with associated turnover and nonpayment problems and not being local to your properties makes it impossible to keep an eye on it yourself.  The property manager is interested in generating fees for himself not protecting your investment.  If you are interested in RE investing it would be a much better idea to buy a midrange property in your area where you can get a stable of maintenance personnel to take care of the issues and supervise them properly.  To find tenants get a realator and put the property on MLS this will get you a much better class of tenant than craigslist or other ads.As far as numbers you can probably get about a  cap rate which will get you around    after accounting for repairs and turnover.    ,financialindependence,dbvm2wp,0,t5_2t34z

I must confess Im partially attracted to our audit group because it offers a lot of international travel opportunities and if you cant tell by my username I LOVE to travel. I do enjoy my reporting role though and probably see myself moving back into something similar after gaining more exposure.For me size was important and I much preferred the larger companies particularly for the degree of exposure they provided and the development opportunities. I work for a MNC and I like working with our foreign offices on complex international issues you dont have that opportunity in a smaller company. I also have expat opportunities down the road which is something Im definitely interested in. I also like the security of having a brand name on my resume it will pay dividends ifwhen I decide to pivot my career.In industry its easier to start big and go small rather than the other way around if you want to keep your options open. If youre struggling on where to start and have a specific location in mind Id look at the major employers where youre looking to move and go out from there. It might be better to move to your preferred location with your accounting firm first if youre looking to change though .

10193453,0,t3_5lvxlo,There is already a lot of good advice on avoiding burnout in this thread and others.  The other approach that has helped me is to investigate different aspects of how to reduce expenses and increase income.  So instead of obsessing on firecalc and cfiresim and reading boards like this every day Ill get into a variety of side pursuits that support the Fi goal.  I spent a few weeks researching cord cutting to save money on that.  Ive spent close to a year learning to cook inexpensive meals from a variety of different cultures because I used to love to eat out and its really helped my spending.  You can spend a few days or a week obsessing on credit card churning  offers and figuring out if thats a tool you can use.  I havent really explored it but you could spend a lot of time learning about real estate since that helps people FIRE.So I totally understand where youre coming from with the obsession angle I have a similar personality. What I have found is that there are enough different aspects of this that you can constantly be exploring something different to prevent burnout while still supporting the ultimate goal of achieving independence,financialindependence,dbzhflb,5,t5_2t34z

10213723,0,t3_5m3xof,I would recommend writing a letter to your senator as well as Ron Wyden. If you read the finance committes website on this linked in previous post their reasoning is that there are  to  RIRAs with more than  million in assets and that they want to close the loophole to prevent investors from seeding the accounts with lowvalued assets that then explode in valueI ask that you tell your senators that while this kind of behavior is not what we want Roth IRAs to be used for we need to do it in a different way.. The rule is unfair in that it depends on your employers specific plan. We should make the rule available to everyone regardless of employer.. Personal limits on RIRA contribution should be effectively increased for the majority of americans and closing this socalled loophole takes away an opportunity that some middleclass earners have to save aggressively for retirement.. seeding with lowvalue assets that then explode in value is known as speculation and is a highrisk endeavor. So in order to reign in a lucky few this law punishes diligent middleclass savers that have access to this type of IRA conversion. Different rules could be considered to limit using retirement accounts as speculative investment vehicles such as applying capital gains taxes above a certain threshold say if your account earns more than x of some Index and the gains above that get taxed.. We can consider closing this loophole only after adequate increased retirement account contribution limits have been added to the law and decoupled from employers and not before.these are my specific objections. Self serving? yes. Anyone want to offer feedback on getting these into a form that might have some sway with a senator?,financialindependence,dc1s7l1,1,t5_2t34z

Its hard to see a long term situation where prices rise indefinitely. But obviously do what is right for you. If wealth does continue to concentrate its certainly possible for more and more investors to compete over properties driving up prices.

10293145,0,t1_dc9a3aq,Psychologically speaking there are two forms of happiness pleasure and fulfillment.  For many people spending money on things does give them a sense of pleasure.  The problem is that pleasure is shortlived and if thats the only form of happiness that a person has theyll constantly be chasing it.  There are areas of our brains and specific neurochemicals that govern over our feelings of pleasure and those neurochemicals tend to compel us to seek more pleasure.  Dopamine is a hell of a drug. Fulfillment provides a longterm form of happiness.  Fulfillment isnt really pleasurable and sometimes it takes a lot of hard work or even strife to achieve.  But in the end happiness through fulfillment is much more satisfying than happiness achieved through pleasure.  The thing that folks in this sub have working for them is that neuroplasticity in our brains allows us to gamify and redefine what we derive pleasure from.  Just as one person might get a little dopamine hit when they buy a new pair of shoes it is possible to train our brain through reasonable goal setting to get the same little high when we contribute to savings.,financialindependence,dcas83m,10,t5_2t34z

Basically you contribute to a traditional IRA though your income is too high to get a tax deduction for it then you convert the traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Since the traditional IRA was funded with aftertax money you dont have to pay any extra taxes on it. Its a goofy loophole but a legitimate one.One potential concern is if you already have a traditional IRA  theres a prorata rule around conversions that gets awfully complex and generally makes it not worth doing at all if your existing traditional IRA has a significant amount of money in it. ,financialindependence,dcfh783,4,t5_2t34z

10355062,0,t3_5o9bb9,Id more likely help with someone that is more reasonable than not yet youre less likely to need to help them.Youngest sibling is working a minimum wage job a skilled job though which doesnt really bring any prospect of wage increase but some job security. Out of my family she is likely to do the best though not great she needs to move closer to work as she is living with my parents if she did this though the costs would ruin the future for her private rent  taxes would be   of income whereas currently her travel costs are eating into her outgoings.I am in a position I will be helping her if I get this new larger house we want we will have  spare rooms that will rent to her as a lodger for a slightly better rate than locally but is under the understanding it will be under a proper contract if things go wrong she will move back in with my parents and any costs she saved by doing this will go into savings for a down payment for a small place. Id actually love for her to live with us the kids would too and the extra income for me would benefit me too by clearing the mortgage much faster  I could of course rent the room out to a stranger for a higher price but I dont want a stranger in the house.My other sibling  I would not do this for her fuck that. Has no sense at all her and her partner for years combined were earning more than I was paying less tax too and I bought a house earning less do. They are currently in private rental accommodation complaining they wont get social housing... even though they earn enough. The problem is they do not share their income and they split bills electric gas tax for one rent for another so they have no group decision of what is left so they spend it on what they want living a month behind paying what they owe at the end of the month. I have lent sold without upfront payment small items to them usually  and sometimes do not get it back for months  I do give them some odd things for nothing but cant do that always and when I do ask for money I expect it. I do not feel I should let them off with  here  there when that is what they spend each on a night out which is often and takeaways. They might feel im tight but why should I do so when I only have a take away once a month yet they probably do  times a week funding their lifestyle at  a week is something everyone should stop doing. They had plenty of time with joint income no kids in a smaller  bed rental to do something yet they are now  kids in and one wants another the other didnt want a nd yet anyway.Even my parents who arent doing that great can see they would be sitting pretty if they would just rein it in. With mortgage tax free bonus on saving schemes  up to k bonus each they only need to save  each a month and  years theyd have k down on somewhere and pay less mortgagebasic upkeep than they do now. I can SEE them wasting  a month its more likely theyre wasting that per week.My parents were doing okay whilst they were working they lost a house back in the day due to work injuries for my dad before any kind of protection and went into social housing. Multiple injuries barely slowed my dad down back then before any kind of compensation and where everyone did their bodies in labouring. My mum did some work on and off but ended up stopping because she would be working retail jobs for less than hour over what benefits would provide. Eventually my dad had an accident and it was covered by some compensation half cutting a hand off... and only got k for it and receives some industrial injury benefits and part disability. Sadly this got burnt away a bit  they didnt buy a small place because the house they are in social so subsidised rent was pretty big in a good area and if they owned a place they would just have to pay to look after it and would lose certain benefits. Also having a cash sum they would have lost certain benefits anyway said they would just have to live on the cash until it ran out before going on benefits so burnt through it pretty fast not on complete luxuries since none of them were working though just annoying things like redecorating every few years and putting down expensive patio in a rental? yet they think they will never leave there... so good? no idea She did go and work for a while but stopped as benefit wise she was working for .hr. The whole thing is a mess and I really do not get what is going on. I do owe my dad a lot though my first house which needed a massive renovation I got a lot of physical help from him doing odd jobs I did as well very hands on and I got around k from them over a year so we could get the house done fast to move in  Ive almost paid this back  years and they do not expect anything extra but I plan to give them an extra k or so to make upas thanksloss of interest which they barely would have made   the way I think of it was it was controlled I did pay this back into an account under my name to try and have it as a savings for them but they constantly needed it and well it was their money and I couldnt say much.

We intended the parents to live with us so we were prepared for that. While sister in law moved in when we bought the house a few years ago. She wasnt working then so she didnt help with rent the first year or so.

Parents wont do the tough love and cut her off to the point that our parents and SIL are moving out. BGet this because the parent feels responsible for damaging our marriage.

That  extra per month will grow over time as rent increases generally about year.  However if you are absolutely bent on not owning income producing rental properties hold it as long as you can to capture property appreciation and additional debt pay down from your renter up until you give up long term capital gains.  If you have lived in the property three of the last  years you can take any gains as longterm gains selling after that you will pay shortterm on any gains on the sale.  ,financialindependence,dck08ls,1,t5_2t34z

10508636,0,t3_5qefsb,I should preface this by saying my travel is kind of nonFIRE in that I am only interested in luxury travel and would rather never take another vacation again in my life than endure flying economy and would never step foot near a hostel.I dont fully delve into churning but I do take advantage of credit card miles which I combine with a modest amount of work travel and a handful of personal domestic paid flights.  All those put together add up to enough for a longhaul premium cabin award flight roughly once a year.I maintain two buckets of point currency so that I have some flexibility.  I used to be hardcore into putting everything into AAdvantage with flying I live in a AA hub city CC spend and transferring hotel SPG points in.  I think that now however all US airline programs have devalued to the point that loyalty is no longer so worthwhile.   My second point currency is AMEX Membership Rewards which have a lot of flexibility to transfer to multiple airlines so that I can make a Star Alliance or Skyteam booking as needed.Mileagecopay upgrades can also be a good option so long as the upgrade inventory can be secured at booking when the economy price is especially low.  Ive found deals in the past for sub South America flights on AA that I upgraded to business for    miles.I no longer do enough hotel stays to have meaningful status.  Ive moved to AMEX FHR to get a reasonable set of benefits and upgrades.  Hotels I just pay for so they are the bulk of any vacation expense.  FHR has a pretty high ceiling of price points that I consider out of my budget and I keep it to the lowerend of their selection when in the US or Western Europe.  The true luxury brands can be quite affordable in Asia though and I like to take advantage.I also look for places that have distinct lowseason pricing.  For example I dont ski but like the outdoor beauty of mountain areas.  The lovely St. Regis and WaldorfAstoria in Park City UT can be had for like night in some summer weekends.Another example was going to Australia in their winter.  It was great for me because I was escaping a very hot summer here found award space on Qantas in First and had quite low rates for lodging.  An airbnb for a sizable house with a gorgeous view in the Blue Mountains was around night the Four Seasons in Sydney was under  Westin in Melbourne had wide open availability for  SPG points.,financialindependence,dcz9k18,1,t5_2t34z

Combined with the Earned Income Credit . state match and federal and state tax rates . every dollar I put in retirement essentially yields an instant  return by reducing my taxes or loan payment. Plus the Retirement Savers and Child credits wipe out the tax liability anyway.I think of the loan forgiveness as converting a loan to a grant which few are arguing are immoral or should be cut and all these creditsprograms as designed to encourage saving for retirement which is a good thing.All that said while I am benefitting from this arrangement and deeply appreciate it I also recognize that I could afford to pay taxes and repay my student loan at the expense of some portion of my retirement savings. I support changes to the IDR and EIC that would include voluntary retirement deferrals in the income calculation and have contacted my congressman to voice that support.

Personally I would never invest in a platform where people could legally be profiting off me since they may know more and legally be doing so.

At least if I invest in the stock market I can confidently know that no other market participants are acting on nonpublic information thus equalizing the market and creating a fairer playing field. Theres many sources of immorality to be found in capitalist systems and I would say this is on the milder side relatively.Edit The fiduciary part of my original comment wasnt the important part so I dont know why youd point out those particular words.

10594849,0,t3_5rni28,Thank you for your post and for the simulations. I never thought it made much sense to be more than  bonds while in the accumulation phase especially if you are being aggressive with your savings rate.I am  stocks as well and I am in the accumulation phase currently. Taking advantage of buying stocks during small dips in prices seems to be a better strategy than rebalancing between bonds to stocks onceyear. I am dollar cost averaging into the  stock market  times per year compared to maybe  timesyear rebalancing. Additionally if your investments grow way more than you need due to using the  stock strategy then you are less at risk for a down market when it comes time to withdraw. For example if I need X to retire but you gain X due to  stocks. If the market crashes  when you retire then you are still at X nothing lost except you got to enjoy a bit of volatility in your portfolio....but if you went  stocks and bonds then you might be at X...this is just rough view and how I came to think about it...and how I determined volatility and risk are not the same thing. Of course you might be at X with  stock but that is less likely as shown by your simulations. With this in mind I plan on putting twice as much into the market and as fast as possible. So if my investments end up being  of what they could be it is still exactly I need. I am about  months away reaching the number that I want in the market...and then I wait  years...if the market crashes within a few years of reaching my number I will continue to invest. That is a one downside...maintaining my high savings rate for a few extra years past a market downturn. So the next  years are critical for me...but not so much after.As everyones situation is different I will also have a pension and my investments are optional for me so why not try to maximize them? If the market is down when I retire I will just do a roth conversion and wait to do a withdrawal rather than rely on bonds to prop my investments up. Roth conversion while the market is down would be one way to make lemonade out of lemons.. ,financialindependence,dd8rz49,4,t5_2t34z

Once youre practicing youll come up with your next financial goal for retirement or FU money. The policy will protect you until you get there. Your spouse may feel differently about you if you develop MS or a TBI because you fell off a ladder and may not want to visit you so often in the assisted living facility or sacrifice her own financial future to do so. I actually got to see this scene play out and its not pretty. If you want to save some money on your policy you can ask for a  year waiting period instead of the usual  months thats offered. The policy will be cheaper and you will still have catastrophic coverage. Another thing to think about If you buy this policy with aftertax money your benefit is tax free. Consider that you wont have to pay income taxes on the benefit when you decide if  how much insurance to buy.,financialindependence,ddbldw7,4,t5_2t34z

My wife and I walked away from something like K of bonus we had already earned worked until July and another K in restricted stock that had not yet vested. Working just  more months would have earned us K but we had enough money plus a decent contingency fund.There is nothing wrong with one more year if you have a purpose for the additional money. In my case we worked probably  years beyond FIREing on  WR but the reason was that we saw lots of potential expensive contingencies in our future and we wanted to be able to handle some increase in expenses if bad things happened.,financialindependence,ddeq8t5,1,t5_2t34z

10659855,0,t3_5sitgr,thanks peeps! some answers to your questionsi started planning for FI when I was  when it was clear the rat race wasnt for me and it sucked seeing my newborn son only at nights and weekends. aggressively paid off all debt. maxed out k buying cool sounding fund names and expensive ones  didnt correct this until  years later. maxed out company stock made k but do not recommend buying company stock anymore than i recommend gambling in vegas. bought a condo in a cheap neighborhood. lived there for  yrs paid it off now i rent it makes up roughly  of my income today. bought a fixerupperfloodprone house in my dream neighborhood. fixed it up and flood proofed it and paid it off. read bernsteins investors manifesto and got smart with investments the efficient frontier is my compass and im forever grateful that the personal capital website makes it so easy to calibrate accordingly. all lowcost broad index funds or ETFs no individual stocks. roughly  equities  bonds and  alternativesREITscash. was introduced to the  SWR actually he recommends . from Clyatts book Work Less Live More. blew my mind. then found Mr.Money Mustache MadFI and GoCurryCrackers blogs. double blew my mind. realized FI is  current income  investment smarts and  how i spend right now. kept my smellymoldy Honda civic for  years. this accelerated my FI horizon by  years. when  happened i fretted a lot but didnt sell anything. a loss is only realized when you sell. so dont sell. treated  as a sale instead saved up a bunch and threw more money in the market in . continued to max out my k IRA even though I get no deduction and HSA  filling these buckets up at the beginning of the year rather than evenly contributing over the entire year.the minimum needed to meet my expenses using Clyatts . SWR is k. Ive got about k above that. I do not include Sosh Security in my figures. it its still around when im eligible it will be a nice surprise. ill use the  rule when not if the market tanks over the years. unrelated to FI i attribute the books Getting Things Done  habits of highly effective people and The Way of the Superior Man along with a task management tool called WorkFlowy to focus my passion for FIRE.there has been a downside to all this. very few friends get my push for FI and its a big lifestyle change. so not many friends. my newborn son is grown up in college and in a parentsarentcool stage wish I had FIed when he was still interested in hanging out. i lost my wife over this last year she has no interest in FIing or making even a single payment on her  yearold student loan or cutting down on expenses.thats it so far. ,financialindependence,ddfhe5p,571,t5_2t34z

Its not inflation adjusted.  I cant pass it on to my estate.  I dont want to be locked in with golden handcuffs and be pressured to work longer than planned.

Any simple set up will provide the same opportunity in that instance.gtYou also need to look at what tax bracket you are in because if you are in a low tax bracket one that can get  for LongTerm capital gains then it may be in your benefits to harvest capital gains instead.Of course but that didnt seem within the scope of the comment I was replying to.gt I dont think you need to do much work to TLH.

The great swimmers werent good teachers so he found a triathlete who had to learn to swim to compete in those races and it was much better.His whole thing is accelerated learning and becoming proficient at something as quickly as possible at least enough to find of fake your way through it. If youre looking to become a gourmet chef you dont want the Tim Ferriss version of how to cook. But if you just want some quick wins to see if youd be interested in learning more and going deeper down the rabbit hole than maybe it isnt so bad.When were young were continuously put in the position to try new things with other people at our same  skill level with little or no risk or fallout from failure or not liking it. It wasnt until recently that I realized the idea was that youd really enjoy one of those things and then latch onto it and seek out more detail and training on your own to dive deep into that area. I missed the boat on that and there arent a lot of opportunities to do those things as an adult. Ferriss seems to keep that same mindset or trying new things all the time and then diving deeper into the things he finds most interesting. That aspect I like and I wouldnt mind if someone built some kind of adult education school around this idea that was actually done well.,financialindependence,ddrgs0r,10,t5_2t34z

So when that dumb money or a hedge fund or an endowment that needs to liquidate goes to sell there are far fewer people buying or vice versa which leads to a greater impact on bidask. Think of it as decreasing the number of shares available to trade so magnifying price moves. Additionally price discovery depends on a heavy amount of active strategy activity. The more passive investing slips into the majority the less accurate price discovery becomes particularly for assets heavily held in passive funds. IMO we are not currently at a point where the effect is concerning but if current trends continue then we will be before much longer the impact increases exponentially as passiveactive ratio exceeds . ,financialindependence,ddz8c8a,9,t5_2t34z

Now is not a good time to take additional risk end of long bull pe ratios higher than normal when company earnings are declining.If you pay off the mortgage at less than  in a rising interest environment. You may never get money for that cheap again. The  year mortgage rate is up this month and we are likely to see another rate rise by July unless SHTF.

And out of curiosity did you factor in your insurancetaxesmortgage interest over that  years? I know most people dont for some reason those are expenses that we claim on our taxes but dont count when it comes time to brag about our profits. Personally Ive been keeping track of those expenses across my properties and depending on your location they can be absolutely massive. My primary residence is in a VLCOL area that I fully renovated. Ive got insurance taxes and mortgage interest down to a combined  a year. So how I look at it is Purchase Price   Renovations   Current Market Value   Potential Return   Y of TaxesInsuranceInterest   Y of Utilities Adjusted Return I can never quite decide if I should drill down into utilities. One on hand its largely a lifestyle expense. On the other hand most of it goes to the maintenance of the home heating and cooling and if you didnt own it you wouldnt have that expense. In any case my expenses in those lines are quite low. And yet counting them reduces my real return by  or right around . Again Im not trying to argue or pick rights  this is just something I personally take into consideration. Hell Ive known people who dont even take into account renovations. Hell I know one couple who inherited a house free and clear borrowed  against it to prop up a losing business and eventually sold it for . Didnt even cover the loan they had to pay the balance.

But what happens when year yields are up . while year yields are only up .?  When you dont have a single yield to plug into duration it doesnt work.  Still duration is a great simplification and does help.  But its more geared to yields rising evenly across all bonds in the fund.  So I would say it happens fairly close to what you mention maybe closer to this order  . yields move up making new bonds look better than old bonds.  . old bonds lose value until they match yields of new bonds.  . bond funds recalculate the value of their holdings showing a loss.  So I would say yields rise which drives a loss in the value of bonds.,financialindependence,denq83r,3,t5_2t34z

Even with the annual fee that was quite an offer so good that they dropped it to only k points now.The last one I did from Chase an earlier Sapphire card version had a k point sign up bonus at least  cash payout with no initial annual fee and a similar min. spend to qualify. So Chase paid me  to move k of my spending onto the card. Free money in my book.I completed a bank signup recently from Capital One moved k of my cash sitting around to their Money Market account for a  bonus was supposed to credit right away but they took a few months. Thats an extra  return on a chunk of my cash I had sitting around. And Capital One now has me in their books as a customer to try to entice with more deals.,financialindependence,df9zkjf,6,t5_2t34z

11284200,0,t1_dfa0zhf,Thanks for the thoughtful response! Yes isolating the loan from a long term financial situation it is risk free to pay off a loan more quickly. I understand that part is theoretically risk free but I suppose I see it from a larger picture standpoint. The equity that sits in an asset that is not completely paid off and even if it is is at risk of loss due to foreclosure or seizure due to back taxes. Also properties may not be as volatile as stocks but prices can certainly shift quickly as many people saw in  housing crisis and currently is going the opposite direction in popular locations like Denver or San Fran.Yes it was a forced example but it could happen this is the point. As for the argument that they just sell the house and recover maybe that works for that particular scenario but if its a single owner who will rent to someone that doesnt have a job or income? Maybe the owner is forced to stay in it as long as possible. What about someone that has paid down  of the loan and then the value drops below  of the original loan value? Even if they are allowed to sell poof all that equity is gone. Can you really say that the whole situation is risk free? The point wasnt the exact situation the point was the potential of risk large equity but still holding a mortgage can face.No the risk I see is not greater than the risk of the stock market especially at higher interest rates.  Its very minimal risk in my eyes. The only intention of my point is for people to be aware of all risks associated with decisions  no matter how small. Nothing is truly risk free in my opinion. ,financialindependence,dfb1pr0,0,t5_2t34z

11290728,0,t1_dfbiduq, Make your bosss life easier not harder. If youre doing that youre likely also doing your job really well. Look for measurable gains to add. Dont be the guy who is transparently just looking for anything to stick his name to but find actual real value to create that is as measurable as possible. If you can go into a salary review saying I saved us .M this year by initiating X thats gonna go over well. Once a week suggest Friday afternoons write down your biggest accomplishments for that week or things you feel you did really well. Just a bullet point or two. Then you can review them before your annual review. The obvious job hop. Its a virtual certainty that youll make more by taking a substantial raise at every single opportunity you get. Even if you dont feel like youre ready for the role fake it till you make it. Studies show that being liked is equally important to ability when it comes to raisespromotions. Get along with your coworkers. Spend time at company happy hours or even just social happy hours with coworkers.  When you ask for a raise focus on what your employer needswants. Best  here is how I will add value in the coming year. Okay  here is how I added value last year. Worst  here is why I needwant more money. Related to the above if you never have read How to Win Friends and Influence People. Its a short read but its so good. I try to read it once a year as a reminder.Edit  One more err on the side of being too aggressive in what youre asking for dont be a pain in the ass though. Ask for big raises even if you dont think youll get them. If they offer you a  raise say youd be really happy if they could do . If theres a promotion or internal role you want say so and if they dont think youre ready ask them what you need to do to put yourself in position for it next time.,financialindependence,dfbsd7b,16,t5_2t34z

You can estimate this one pretty well by looking at the costs of daycares around you but a reasonable HCOL ballpark is mo until age  then mo for afterschool care until age  or so.Housing  You are likely to want an extra bedroom per child.  Its not necessary but it is the societal norm and you are likely to want it especially when they get older.  Unless you already live in a large house this will likely mean moving into somewhere significantly more expensive.  This will vary enormously by location by x or more! so your best bet is to estimate by looking at house prices online and assuming theyll go up faster than inflation.  Remember to keep an eye on school ratings when doing this research.School  K will almost certainly be public schools so this cost is hidden in the higher cost of housing in good school districts.  You can probably ballpark university at kyr in inflationadjusted dollars meaning youll want k saved up per child by the time they start.  If you intend to FIRE before having children k has a similar net present value i.e. you can reasonably expect it to grow to k by the time they go to university.Everything Else  In comparison to the big three expenses everything else is fairly modest at least in my experience.  Its also where most of the kids can be cheap! advice is targetted so its important to take that advice with a grain of salt its true that handmedown clothes are perfectly fine for little kids but saving yr on clothes will not offset the yr of daycare yr of saving for university or yr of paying for more housing space.,financialindependence,dfs10i9,6,t5_2t34z

11452269,0,t3_63cwfd, How long have you been FI?About a year. What is your typical daily agenda? Are you still working  job? If so what is reasoning behind that decision?I would like to work part time but those types of role dont really exist in my line of work. Instead I shifted to a seasonal work pattern took six months off over the summer then hole up in an office for  or  months during the winter. Are there any factors either positive or negative that you did not considered before reaching FI and that become very relevant after reaching FI?If youve got kids in school or a spouse who continues working then much of the FI dream talk endless globe trotting sleeping in late etc isnt really an option.Also achieving FI and more so early retirement is a bit like attending Fight Club. Nonmembers often wont understand it will be suspicious of it and will likely be jealous or judgemental slacker unemployed bum etc. Develop an acceptable deflective answer or cover story for the what do you do? question it makes life a whole lot easier. How different is your life overall? Better worse or similar level of stress just from different source?Money isnt really a factor when making decisions any longer it is nice not having to worry about it. There were some reentry issues returning to work. Putting up with some of the daily grind bullshit like commuting or mindless status update meetings proved surprisingly challenging. If you can give an advice for someone almost reaching FI what advice it would be?Most of the stuff youve been hanging out for postFI you could be doing right now. In fact much of it you could have already been doing for years already. FI provides you with the freedom to choose how you spend your time but no more than that.

If you opened an HSA put  in it never reimbursed yourself but also never closed it you can save receipts for the entire time the HSA is open. When you contribute more to an HSA account you can reimburse yourself for those receipts that you saved.And yes you can roll HSA balances between accounts. Many people have a workprovided HSA with bad investment options so they contribute via payroll deduction to reduce FICA and get any match their employer provides.

11478341,0,t1_dfx0iw9,I agree adoption is necessary especially for Bitcoin as it is deflationary in its design but I believe Ive already addressed most of the mechanisms that make adoption possible but Ill cover a few other things I hadnt mentioned earlier. Another factor I omitted is that Bitcoin as it grows from its nascent stage becomes exponentially more useful as more people join in. Much like a phone system if only two people are able to talk to each other on the network it isnt very useful but when  are your opportunities to use the phone greatly expands and this in turn encourages increased usage as its more useful more money circulates as a result money velocity increases and creates a fake inflationary effect where people perceive a greater supply than there already is and so helps regulates demand without necessitating an increase in coins to stop the price spiralling out of control. In Bitcoins case not only do people find more opportunities to spend coins as more people become involved but the revenue from transaction fees help pay to keep the network secure. As I say theres a lot of unique mechanisms in Bitcoin that are impossible to replicate in conventional digital payment systems and it does a good job of keeping Bitcoin stable and sustainable in the long term.As far as claiming that you dont think adoption is possible. Id be interested to see your evidence. China is a very large player in recent years it dominates mining many use it due to restrictions on currency spending. They have a population of . billion and they are nuts about bitcoin. The Yuan is not failing but Chinese still see Bitcoin as useful. You dont have to believe me you can search on the internet how many people in China are not only using it to make their lives easier but also mining it and Bitcoin benefits from that increased security.The bottom line is Bitcoin has qualities that normal fiat currency digital or otherwise does not have and its being used as a medium for transferring value whether it be buying things or for other purposes not as a purely speculative asset.,financialindependence,dfx2e67,2,t5_2t34z

11523507,0,t1_dg1edc4,In my state  contributions dont qualify for a tax deduction so I dont even bother. All in all I think theyre pretty restrictive given the narrow acceptable uses and they dont offer much of an escape hatch if you dont have kids or they dont want to go to a secondary institution or if you overfund it and then the money is just stuck there. A possibly good compromise if your state offers good tax treatment for s is to fund one but modestly. With at least  years of growth if you had a child today even a modest amount will appreciate to a nice number by then. It might not cover all the costs of a year secondary education but it could be a nice supplement.Edit to reflect further remember there is lots of aid out there. My own student debt was a fraction of the sticker price. So even if you only were to save say  of the total year sticker price and with  years of market growth that wouldnt take much money today you could still be doing your future kid a world of good. If my parents had given me about that much money all I got was free rides to and from campus which I still appreciated!

11536325,0,t1_dg2iugm,Now that my daughter is in preschool  days per week he actually works part time. So things are a bit different now. Prior to that though we probably divided chores about  me him. He did most of the cooking the vast majority of the laundry on weekends though we would usually fold together while hanging out in the living room. He also did almost all the grocery shopping most of the vacuuming and on weekdays the day to day picking up after a little kid. We also have a dozen chickens a large veggie garden and a small orchard. Most of the day to day stuff with that falls on him partially because hes home more partially because its his project but I help out quite a bit during busy times of year like planting now and when we have bigger projects to do with that. I would also do most of the dishes and wipe down the counter tops give kiddo her baths and on Saturday morning let him sleep in while I watched the her. Bigger projects like yard work and deep cleaning the kitchen we usually did together on the weekends you cant really do those things alone while still watching the kid anyway. I think the most important thing as the working spouse is to not contribute to the mess. I know so many husbands with stay at home or even working wives who act like spoiled teenagers and leave their plates out crumbs on counters wrappers everywhere and throw their dirty socks wherever. A stay at home spouse is your partner not your overly indulgent mother. Act like an adult dont make an extra messes like a child. And when youre home youre also a parent and should be putting  towards that. We do have a prearranged schedule for breaks though he gets to sleep in Saturday I get to sleep in Sunday. He goes for a run every other day in the evenings while I get kiddo ready for bed. I go to yoga after work twice a week. So we do both get a bit of time to ourselves to decompress a bit.

However I believe that in the latter case the money invested has to come from actual proceeds of the rental business and I definitely dont have anything close to K per year in real estate cash flow.I wonder what the tax implications are of sending gross rental income not profits straight to a Solo k  youd end up with a huge amount of passive loss which cant be deducted against regular income and you could not have to do any depreciation.

Its totally possible to have low housing costs without exorbitant income but you have to be willing to sacrifice some comfortspacesense of safety. Having roommates also definitely helps. My SO and I share a room in a college apartment that we never moved from in order to save more money towards FI and travel. Not taking into account the extra money we get from renting out our living room to a broke friend of mine we spend  each annually  a month on rent. That amounts to . of our gross annual income we both make  a year and   .. Admittedly we both make high software developer salaries for recent college grads in a moderate COL city but even if we made half of our current salaries our housing costs would still be under  gross income. Of course this requires the willingness to not live in extreme luxury and sharing a room. I wouldnt say we live in a shithole either.

Median salary in Kasas city is k so youre at  there just being median on expenses.I think the down votes are coming from people who live in HCOL but dont have high paying jobs.
