Ive read that nutrition plays the most important role in maximizing what height your genetics could provide you with.  I know I was stunted for a time not seeing growth when you normally see it but I also didnt eat consistently or well and was very skinny.  My parents helped fund a couple that were starting a gym and the husband Eric took me on to get me into shape by working me our and having me eat a lot.  I put on weight and got in great shape then shot up  inches in the span of  months from  to .  My growth potential was waiting for sufficient mass I suppose.  On of my little brothers got into steroid use eating and lifting to try and bulk up in his twenties were he had stopped growing at around .  He shot up another  inches after he put on the muscle.  My youngest brother picked up about to  when he was working out and eating right but he went back to his sedintary lifestyle combined with drinking and smoking and stunted out.  My oldest brother started drinking and smoking very early I think  and I have no idea how well he ate but he stunted out at  even though he looks exactly like the rest of us.  After joining the military and getting in stellar shape he still retained that same height.  Its a small anecdotal sample set but I did read an article on here recently that pointed to nutrition as a big factor into why height average is going up.,flexibility,chd1su5,-1,t5_2t7mg

1135843,0,t3_272qc7,Hi Physio here one that does work with hypermobility. There are actually two types of snapping hip internal and external with both being due to a tightness in a specific muscle group. External snapping hip is the most common and is the one on the outside of the hip that is a twang of the ITB over the greater trochanter of the femur. Google itThe best treatment is to learn how to gently stretch your ITB it will take weeks to slowly increase its length and patience is important. In my many years of experience Ive never heard it as dancers hip though it is common in dancers and flexible ones in that. Do not purposely twang it as you will irritate the bursa around it and it will become inflamed and sore. Also ensure you have good strength around your hip too bridges clams and side scissors will help these. TLDR have good ITB flexibility and strong glut med hip stabilisers. ,flexibility,chxe51o,6,t5_2t7mg

I discovered today that if I bend forward with my feet fairly spread fairly wide but not so wide that it stretches the groin muscles that I feel the stretch in my hamstrings and calves without the pain behind the knee cap. After a little research it seems that the cause could be very tight calves a short nerve or maybe even tight ligamentstendons from a lack of exercise.

Were they talking about burning stretching pain or tingly shooting one? Was this pain  concentrated on a thin strip or spread around in the general area?Not all pains are the same and while some might indicate that you stretch a nerve or a ligament not all of them mean that you should stop right away and avoid at all costs. Some stretches might even feel nervy and tingly but within reason this is okay too. We are expanding our range of motion after all which could be physically limited.

3722049,0,t3_31tqsa,Try working on your over splits. On the floor or against the wall you can use force to push past your natural range of motion. If you start working on your over splits youll gain a greater range of motion and need less physical strength to lift and hold your leg up. Try using yoga blocks under your front or back foot to start. Also make sure you work your splits in parallel and turned out positions.For strength try doing your standing splits against the wall and lift your top leg up and away from the wall and hold.

Point the toes of your bottom foot about  degrees toward the wall and keep your other foot parallel to the ground like you would in your kick. Keep your leg locked and swing it as high as you can.Rant about static stretching Just about everything you read will tell you to avoid bouncing while stretching. That bit of information is based on the fact that sports can cause injury. You shouldnt be any more worried about it than you would kicking that high in the first place.The problem with static stretching is that the stretch reflex that tightens your muscles to keep you from kicking too high are speed sensitive as well as position sensitive. You might be able to do the splits but add the element of speed to the position and your nervous system starts freaking out again. Further most static stretching relies on an outside force to keep your leg in position which means your muscles might simply not be strong enough in those extreme ranges to get your leg where you want it. Doing the stretch ballistically strengthens the muscles you need to get to that range in the first place in addition to conditioning your nervous system to relax the opposing muscles when youre kicking.For the record I have been a martial artist for over  years have never been injured by stretching like this and have kicked myself in the head more than once.,flexibility,cs3e8g4,1,t5_2t7mg

5528043,0,t1_cwi7w1v,gt I am trying to force posterior tilt because I have this idea that many movements are safer if done while in posterior tilt. Like lunge walks gluteham raises running particularly sprinting? pushups handstands bridge planks etc.Where did you get this idea. To be blunt I think that theory is incorrect. Excessive posterior tilt is an postural issue that should be corrected. Its associated with swayback and kyphosis. Excessive APT is obviously an issue too but I PPT isnt the answer a neutral pelvis is.In certain exercises like planks over head presses. Youre hear people suggesting to engage your pelvis in an PPT direction. This is more a cue to counter APT thus ending up with a strong neutral pelvic position  rather than actual PPT being optimal.gtSo anyway are you saying that at maximum posterior tilt its mechanically impossible to have  degrees or more between torso and thighs?At maximum pelvic tilt yes I believe so. We are capable of very little hip extension but our pelvis has quite a large range of tilt. The picture you posted is nowhere near max pelvic tilt imo. It can tilt further right into lumbar flexion  at which point your legs are even less vertical.,flexibility,cwi98m7,3,t5_2t7mg

5846098,0,t3_3vaiv3,To protect your lower back if you have an object like a yoga block place that between your thighs just about your knee. Keep your feet hip width distance apart too. Press through the big toe ball mounds of your feet and engage your legs as if you were trying to get your knees to touch a wall in front of your feet so knees working away from body. Unclench the butt. The more you squeeze into the block and internally rotate your femurs the easier it will be to unclench the butt. Once youre using your thigh and abdominal muscles to lift you up rather than your butt and a slack abdomen and straindanger to your lower back will be much diminished.I would do all this work in lower bridge where your upper back is still on the floor and arms by your side. Another way to build awareness in the lower back region is to lay in prep for bridge with knees bent towards the ceiling lift your hips off the ground just an inch or two. Then keeping everything else the same swivel your pelvis up and down so tailbone moves closerfarther away from heels. Notice which muscles are engaged when tailbone is closer to the heels vs further from heels. Its possible to go too far in both directions too.,flexibility,cxly9bw,1,t5_2t7mg

In regards to the x thing... you could regulate the INTENSITY of the stretching you do by stretching most intensely deeply x a week and still have more progress.

If you want to do standing pikes I would do them at the end of the session when every component has been independently and thoroughly stretched leading up to it and then do it properly like this.

Im aware the femur can also rotate to reduces on the knee it doesnt remove it entirely especially in a less mobile person.gtFor some people this is safe Yeah sure if they know what they are doing. But suggesting in inflexible try that would be awful.gt The rotation doesnt just stop at the knees UNLESS above the knees doesnt want to carry rotation.If the knees or any joint can take it its fine. The girls knee in the OP pic didnt explode. The difference is she has probably sat like that a long time. Thus unlocking the ability to safely sit like that but also unlocking a whole host of structural problems. Example the video posted above. Setting that position as a goal when there are better positions and when the OP is unlike to have the rotation required is a bad idea.Simply question Do you think its a good idea for the OP to turn his feet out while trying to get his ass past his heels baring in mind his current flexibility? Or would heels straight aka hero pose be a better position to achieve his goal getting ass below ankles?.gt On a side note knees normally do have a little rotation. There is an excellent picture of a person showing this in the book light on yoga.Yup. Knees have WAY more rotation that people realize. Over  degrees normally. People find that number hard to believe as they think its a hinge joint. Reason being rotation is reduced to almost zero when the knee it locked.

Its easier to grab and flip your shoulder when your foot is flexed. Once you flip your shoulder have your other arm crawl down the arm thats holding your foot until you can reach the ankle. Repeat until you get used to the movement. however this will be hard if you dont have good hip flexibility because your pigeon pose will be unstable because your back thigh may not be able to reach the ground  in that case lean against a sofa or a wall to help you balance ,flexibility,czoazo5,9,t5_2t7mg

9109352,0,t1_d86luea,Well you still need to be on the edge or border of the stretch so I dont recommend you cheat yourself out of it but since you said torso forward you could do this variation fold your torso forward and put your hands down and then try to push the front of the hip of the back leg forward and down.,flexibility,d86sp9d,1,t5_2t7mg

9340336,0,t3_5890ct,Small bit of advice dont hang out in your stretches at first. Do more types of stretches and hold between  seconds in each position. Youre body gets flexible as a whole unit not by sitting in straddle and pigeon forever but not stretching anything else. Look up all kinds of stretches and go through a bunch safely and quickly. Do that and then build up to  seconds then eventually  min if you really feel comfortable in the stretch. Flexibility comes easier as youre entire body loosensNOT just parts of your body. ,flexibility,d8zyeh1,1,t5_2t7mg

10640597,0,t1_dddfjis,By performing stretching like this you are actively engaging the nervous system and utilizing proper breathing mechanics to ensure positionining specifically the ribs over the pelvis like you see in the picture. If you are anteriorly tilted you should  stretch your hips flexors quads but that doesnt mean you should forget about your hamstrings. If you properly exhale fully you will achieve a neutral position like the picture on the left. ,flexibility,dddhvcq,1,t5_2t7mg

Now that i am  not so much.How long did you set your timer for? Did you walk or warm up your muscles before hand somehow?When you lay in this position do you use your heels to keep your legs from sliding up? Did you find this method of improving your middle split better than the regular one where one is sitting on the floor? ,flexibility,deh2lan,6,t5_2t7mg
