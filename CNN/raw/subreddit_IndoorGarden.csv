877132,0,t3_23pfnt,This is the type of lights I use.  I am using two  watt equivalent CFL bulbs.  One is a cool spectrum one is a warm spectrum.  The lights cost about . each the dryer vent is about  and the bulb splitter is about .  I had my own wire nuts and thriftily used cords cut from junk appliances to hook them up.  You can buy lamp cords at DIY stores for about  each.  The chain to hang the fixtures is a couple dollars and can usually be bought by the foot.  This setup will grow MONSTER sage cilantro basil mint and chives.It depends on how nice you want this to look but for the containers you could use kitty litter totes or rubbermaid containers or go with decorative planer pots.If you want multiple sources on constructing these lights Google DIY CFL grow light.  Some of the results will go to places where they grow plants that may be illegal in your area.

Last winter I noticed that the peace lily shed had for about  years was suspiciously missing.  When I asked her what had happened to it for it was a handsome large plant she responded by showing me the new smaller ceramic pot she had ordered from a catalog.  She had decided that the peace lily needed to be repotted and it was too big for her to do so not that she couldnt do it physically but the giant room it was in wouldnt look as nice with a larger planter in it...while a larger planter is literally right next to it already with nothing in it...just sitting there for decoration...  She had ripped the poor plant out of the old planter and tossed it in a garbage bag.  Instead of dumping it in the leaf pile which is usually what she does with plant debris she had put the bag in the trash can for collection.  By the time I saw it about  days had passed.

I only remove them for inventory viability testing and planting for about two months every year.You dont need a fridge any lowertempstable place works fine basement water meter cubby basement floor under a larger box not near a heat register or return. You want to minimize high heat allows microbial growth freezing for annuals some species like milkweed require stratification to germinate temperature variation forces water in and out of seeds more out than in and light oxidation.And all of this is really just to increase seed viability over time you can expect decent but quickly diminishing germination of commercial seed for a couple years just storing it on the kitchen counter.edit Cool temp storage also decreases seeds metabolism which increases longevity and viability rates. Annual seeds that freeze become nonviable due to ice crystal damage. Many perennial seeds require freezing to break the endocarp.edit If you store them in active refrigeration fridgefreezer they need to be airtight to avoid dehydration.,IndoorGarden,cz43mo7,1,t5_2vyus

I dont think ours reached  but it was definitely very very spicy!I really recommend the Fire Flames though both plant and fruit wise. They grow into short bushy plants compared to the Scotch Bonnets which pretty much grow straight up until they fall over and then grow more at the sides and the peppers are spicy but still not so spicy that most people cant handle it. We put ours into a batch of Letscho which is basically tomatoes bell peppers and onions roasted in a pot with tomato paste as a side dish for meat and the taste was really really nice and it gave the dish a slight but pleasant spicyness. The kind of spicyness also matters. Fire Flames burn while Scotch Bonnets sting more if that makes sense. The heat is more tolerable with chillies that feel like a slow building up burn than with chillies that sting like needles.Both turned out great this year but for beginners or people who want a chilli plant in general I would really recommend the Fire Flame ones.,IndoorGarden,d4x5pcv,3,t5_2vyus
