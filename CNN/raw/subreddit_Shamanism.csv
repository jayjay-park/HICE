2258091,0,t3_2l1gve,I found mine without astral projection or rituals. I simply looked around. Since I was born my family had owned at least one dog. I now have three dogs which I would even give my life for. Stray dogs that run from the others come to me wagging their tails even if they havent seen me before. I also help stray dogs as much as I can. Sometimes the answer is right in front of you.,Shamanism,clqtknv,3,t5_2qieq
2439439,0,t3_2ndti7,Heres my main altar.My aim with my altars is to make a space where the veil between the worlds is thin enough for me to easily pass through. I do this by filling the space with things that evoke the right mood for journeying. Some of the things are ritual tools that I actually use some of the things are metaphoric and spiritually meaningful and some of the things are aesthetic. I find that geometric patterns certain materials metalcrystalfeathersbonefur and certain smells incenseherbs help me to induce trance so well that I begin to feel my mind kick into that mode when just looking at my altar. So my aim has been to figure out what facilitates that the most and maximize those things.I intend to redecorate pretty soon here for when my practice kicks into its next phase on the solstice. Its going to be a new moon longest night of the year in total darkness  truly a new beginning and Saturn begins its Sagittarius transit just two days later which is particularly meaningful for me as well because it marks the beginning of my first Saturn return. Anyway Ill probably be constructing a symbolic model of my inner places andor the gateway I use in order to better help me to journey there.,Shamanism,cmd7xqw,13,t5_2qieq

3040102,0,t1_coczamq,Ekhart Tolle is an excellent writer I have loved his teachings and I think they blend beautifully with a Shamanic Path.  Carlos Castaneda wrote influencial books but in later life was exposed as someone who did not tell the truth there is an excellent article about him here.  And that site realitysandwich has many interesting articles that are very in line with a Shamanic path I recommend it.  As for a very long course of study I would say yes they typical shaman studies for years and years.  But you dont have to give up your life to do that.  It is important to learn from another Shaman and not just books or websites. A weekend or even day long introduction to Shamanism would be a good start  also some good journey ideas on this site. ,Shamanism,cod3shx,2,t5_2qieq
3941456,0,t3_35dw38,Its an easy read with interesting graphics.  I think it is a bit too specific on experiences.  There are some popular experiences but not everyone experiences the same thing.  For example the lowermiddleupper world is not experienced in that way by everyone.  Also the mindfulness exercise at the end is new to me as a path to initiate into shamanism.  Im unaware of that being used for such a purpose.,Shamanism,cr5k5p0,1,t5_2qieq
4313246,0,t1_csbtag2,Youre married but if it came up you wouldnt be against having sex with your familiars. But you said you choose monogamy partly out of loyalty to your wife.

4336042,0,t3_37y0jh,Okay. I am going to weigh in here.Birds are all messengers of the Spirit world.Crows specifically signify law and magic.A murder of crows is likely in my experience bearing a strong message that you are ignoring or not seeing.If I had to suggest a book on this I would go with Animal Speak,Shamanism,cseegrv,1,t5_2qieq

6651423,0,t1_d077aaj,Pleasure and thanks for replying back. I think its always important to keep with a trusted doctor as well as a spiritual advisor. Modern medicine certainly has its drawbacks and limitations but the world was also not such a great place before antiobiotics.  Shamanism is a great path and has hugely influenced my life and sense of wellbeing. Im actually a Shamans apprentice but believe me when I say if there was something i needed medically I would completely do it!! Lots of love.!,Shamanism,d07bc3o,2,t5_2qieq

8614133,0,t3_4wkygb,Found this on his website this kind of instruction really seems appealing.gtNo matter what happens no matter what you feel do not try to make the pain go away. Instead just for the session try to see how much you can Fall In Love With Your Pain gtHealing is paradoxical. The more you want the pain to go away the more it stays. The moment you fully accept the pain thats when it starts to go away... gtRemember While you are loving and feeling your pain as deeply as possible open up to receiving any messages from the pain as to Why it is there and Why it came there in the first place.Very interesting what are peoples thoughts on this? Is there something real going on here or is it just the ultimate con job?,Shamanism,d6id4ak,1,t5_2qieq
9138456,0,t3_54uhfh,I asked this question because I was journeying and suddenly I got this image of a little white animal standing in my garden and watching at me with big yellow shiny eyes. At first glance I thought it was a dog but then I realized it was actually a fox. I couldnt ask him anything because the image went away quickly ,Shamanism,d8ad6c6,1,t5_2qieq
9234265,0,t3_55nn8g,I tune with friends and journeying circles if I know they are happening.   I have a medicine woman who calls out to me and vice versa.  I will think of her and she will text me did you want to tune in?  Benevolent energies are availableSo yes psychic powers work.  But you should have already journeyed with them and they should also be searching for you.  I tried to join a healing circle the other day but found i was locked out by the sacred space.   Probably for the best  as I was feeling dark.,Shamanism,d8mie87,1,t5_2qieq

10275398,0,t1_dc83kid,On the shamanic spectrum we encounter what generates an emotional response for us. The same is true of possession. Regarding the blob things can exist distinctly and still be part of each other.,Shamanism,dc8rstb,2,t5_2qieq
10369619,0,t3_5ogg4e,I think the negative nature of your spirits is due to your alienation from your psyche. Mental illness is characterized by alienation from the self with the ego feeling threatened by the psyche which is seen as malevolent. Ive just finished reading The Soul Of Shamanism by Daniel C. Noel which offers some interesting insights on how to heal the sick mind. You need to embrace the psyche without giving in to delusions. This can be done by allowing the reenchantment of the world allowing fictions i.e. delusions to ensoul the world i.e. give the world a heightened significance while not taking it too literally. It is a tricky matter of being enchanted without being delusional being spiritual without being irrational. You want to get to a place where the ego is not feeling threatened and the spirit is not feeling ignored and disregarded. The key seems to be to allow the imagination to play on a profound level without posing any threat to the ego which has to deal with the real world.,Shamanism,dcjgib8,2,t5_2qieq
10546157,0,t1_dd3i17q,Well said! I fully agree that there is no separation. That is what ego or rather what conditioned personality does.Personality mind is within ego and ego is within Soul because Soul is the orchestrator of what ego and personality ultimately achieve.I guess what you said is what I was trying to convey! Nevertheless thanks for clarifying what I was trying to understand! Maybe it had to happen this way. ,Shamanism,dd3iwdx,1,t5_2qieq
