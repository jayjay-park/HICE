9151167,0,t3_55kuaj,Jada doesnt really have the cuteness factor that Funko does and thats a big selling point for kids and first time buyers of pops. Jada has nowhere near the amount of licenses that Funko does which limits their appeal to collectors who arent fans of their current licenses. The other thing that has to be considered is that the Metals design wont translate well to a lot of licenses. Harry Potter would look quite freaky for example because normal people dont have the Metals physique. This is yet another limiting factor in which licenses they can pull off successfully and thus which collectors they will appeal to. Funko is huge at the moment and I dont think anyone can beat them unless they drop in popularity.,EverythingJadaToys,d8bz6bi,1,t5_3eeq3
