643781,0,t1_cgddjoc,Ive checked the website yesterday and the stream wasnt quiet in  format. Hope that could be fixed for the live stream. Also it doesnt work on iPad which isnt really a problem as I also have computer connected to TV but Id still prefer if I could airplay it to my apple tv Here is to a great GP weekend!,redditstreams,cgdg5fs,3,t5_311km
