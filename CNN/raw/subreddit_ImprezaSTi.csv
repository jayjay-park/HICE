8188979,0,t1_d50cjl0,Fuel is within  AFR in open loop and during openloop my maps are based on specs from part manufacturers. I avoid OL as much as possible until tuned by a professional. Still Im avidly paranoid about it and checked my plugs two days later and then two weeks after tuning it to look for signs of lean ratio. About to change the plugs this week so Ill have one final look. I have an appointment scheduled with Mach V Motorsports in August for my real tune before I sell it. Id love to keep it but Ive gotta get rid of the car payment until I figure out finances.,ImprezaSTi,d5169xg,1,t5_2zuaw
