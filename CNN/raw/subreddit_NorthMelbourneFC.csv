3902260,0,t3_34m7oe,Blast kicking and not backing each other up.   Attacking the captain is a strategy Swallow was manhandled and nothing came of it from the North side. We need someone to take a stand Firrito gave it a go but so many of our guys are undersized or not terribly aggressive even when the most consistent player on the team Goldstein was laid out.    Ever match from now on someone will lay into those two.   In an odd way thats where Majak Daw could be handy. He might be getting pushed off the footy a bit but I cant see to many people getting very physical if he tells them to back the fuck off Swallow.,NorthMelbourneFC,cr13bq0,1,t5_2w9xk

8484780,0,t3_4vw39i,NORTH Melbournes premiership window is in danger of slamming shut.The Kangaroos face a series of tough decisions on nine yearolds which threatens to leave them short in the key forward stakes next season if Drew Petrie and Jarrad Waite both retire.The veterans departures would leave a huge reliance on Ben Brown with a strappedup knee and project big man Majak Daw to spearhead their transition into a new era.At cm Mason Wood is an emerging star but hes more of a third banana in attack.But one man can save the Kangas and its probably not who you are thinking.Its Richmonds Tyrone Vickery.It seems almost certain that the dreadlocked forward will seek a fresh start elsewhere next season after a poor season gathering more than  possessions in only three of his  games this year.Yes hes had no impact at Tigerland but hes not exactly on his own at Punt Rd.In the player movement market you have got to see upside and cm forwards who can ruck are indemand. Especially ones like Vickery who is in the prime of their career aged .Even better for North the Tigers whipping boy will cost the Roos nothing in trade terms.He is a free agent and can walk to Arden St for free except for a salary perhaps in the vicinity of  plus incentives. We know they have the salary cap space.But can he play you ask? Lets go to the tape.At his best Vickery has shown he can get hot inside m booting  goals and two behinds as part of a fivegame purple patch late last season.At the time there was talk of Richmond trading him for a firstround draft pick to a club like Brisbane but his contract is up this year.Against Collingwood in Round  Vickery was best on ground with six goals  marks and  possessions. Thats big.The set shot sharpshooter had the second best kickrating in front of goal behind only Western Bulldog Tory Dickson and the secondbest hitouttoadvantage of any ruckman with more than  hitouts last season.Clearly the No. draft  pick has ability.But does he love football?And can he keep out of the umpires bad books?What has frustrated Richmond fans and rival recruiters who have watched him closely for years is that there is huge chasm between his best and worst.And his worst has been on show this season.But as the experts say buy low.North need him because if only one of Petrie and Waite go on next season they would have to be nursed towards the finals Brad Ottensstyle anyway.Maybe  games plus finals next season max.It is unclear if Daw is reliable key forward material and if Brown went down injured next season Brad Scotts men could fall in a heap.Todd Goldstein  cant continue to do all the rucking on his own as his sore knees this season would strongly suggest. He needs more help from someone like Vickery.Cameron Joyce has proven to be one of the most shrewd list managers in the AFL in recent years nabbing free agents Shaun Higgins Waite Nick Dal Santo as well as bargain draft buys Brown and Sam Gibson.Against the odds theyve opened up a genuine premiership window with consecutive preliminary finals.Yet Joyce gets zero fanfare. He courageously let go of hardnut Levi Greenwood after finishing third in their best and fairest in  but has it cost them?Not by the way Trent Dumont shut down Jack Steven on Saturday night.His next project might be the most polarising one with Vickery.But the rewards would be significant if the AFLs most maligned man kept the Kangas in the flag race.,NorthMelbourneFC,d6256au,4,t5_2w9xk

8753392,0,t3_4zrlve,Doesnt matter about trying to get Swallow or OMeara this year because well settle for Mayne in the trade period hell do fuck all every week but still get a game just like Anderson and nothing will change at North while we scrap it out with Brisbane and Freo for bottom  next year. However if I were to do this trade I would throw up next years st round pick next years nd round pick Mullett Hansen and Turner for Swallow OMeara and a rd round pick,NorthMelbourneFC,d6ztxsw,1,t5_2w9xk
