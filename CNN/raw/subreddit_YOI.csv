9496342,0,t3_5as4cz,Pro storywise im glad that its progressing at a comfortable pace...as in not too fast or too slow. Yuri was being weird around Minami who happened to look up to him and yet encouraging him in the end... i thought that was a nice way to highlight Yuris growing selfconfidence. At first it was like he couldnt believe that someone would look up to him because of the way he sees himself but im glad he got over that Cons I love MAPPA. I think their animations based on BDs i have of some of their other works are superb but the animation for the stream was not the best. Its understandable though what with the stress of weekly releases. Im expecting the animation to be very good on the BD. About Yuris confession...as much as I would love to jump the bandwagon and say theyre canon all homo...Yuri did say its not romantic love. But then there were a lot of cameras on him you wouldnt just blurt the actual truth. So yeah im having some internal dilemma lol thisanimeisruiningmylife,YOI,d9jmk8y,6,t5_3gv95

9815341,0,t3_5ft59f,gt I dont care at all about stories about wanting a lover or wanting to get married and since boygirl romance stories are a dime a dozen who cares whether or not I write one? I simply want to write a story about a healthy deeply meaningful relationshipso I dont feel compelled to have to write about a manwoman pair in that case. Though I suppose you can tell that from looking so thats all Im going to say on the subject.Translation Credit,YOI,damygd1,26,t5_3gv95

10224593,0,t3_5mcqex,The show only finished a few weeks ago and it was kind of a sleeper hit. Who expected a figure skating sports anime with a gay love story to blow up like it did? I can see a lot of the big reviewers either having a lengthy backlog of other content before they get to it or just wanting to take their time and cover it adequately. ,YOI,dc30jon,11,t5_3gv95

10421126,0,t3_5owlh3,One topic I really enjoyed was Yurios relationship with Yuri and Viktor and how its incredibly rare to have a fully grown adult as the protaganist with a young teenager as his main antagonist. Especially as its not a traditional good guybad guy motif but actually a really supportive for Yurio in his own way and positive competition where Yuuri resists the urge to douche out over it.Looking it over its actually a strange dynamic. In a traditional coming of age story the hotshot teenager would be trying to take down the most successful character out there Viktor as his big plot. If anything itd be Yuri as the protaganist Viktor as the antagonist and Yuuri would be his secondary sidekick at best who barely registers on anyone.Theyve inverted all of it to make a much stronger and even happy plotline for everyone.,YOI,dcpaxvu,2,t5_3gv95

11156005,0,t1_dewguer,gtThats why I dont think ABO is indicative of misogyny especially because most ABO fanfics I like arent about breeding but are essentially about a feminist movement.But its ultimately a reproductive system. It might be used recreationally but its the last tether to needing women biologically in ABO universe. Women are already shunted to one side for the most part in fanfic and ABO is the final nail in that coffin of relegating women to shrewish enemy or besty friend depending on who is for or against the main relationship. Fanfic is already inherently biased against women if only on metrics and this takes it to logical conclusion. I love ABO. I love that it provides a safe space for people to write about delicate topics even if theyre not up for it without the cultural baggage of a real group but it does have its own builtin problems on how women get treated and written about in them.gtI once read that women fetishize gay sex because it means that theyre not competing with the girl on the page and can choose whom they identify more with. There are a few more reasons than a simple fetish and they run the gamut. Personally I think its probably more than one thing and its become so prevalent that its become selfperpetuating at this point.gtAlthough I dont know Dolley quite as well. I find lots of historical people have interesting or even so outlandish it has to be real lives when you look closer.Shes most famous for the White House burning and DC but her life was so much more than that. Maybe the most humbling aspect was when Paul Jennings her former slave started bringing her food and supplies because she was quite destitute. Even more that she sold him previously because her fortunes were quite poor but Daniel Webster bought him personally just so he could grant him his freedom.She also single handedly carved out the only career in politics a woman could have for the first  years of American politics First Lady. She first worked under Jeffersons administration then Madisons and she was probably way more popular than James ever was.gtIt was seen as a lot more of a family unit thing back then and lots of great women before feminism expressed their power in the shadows like Cixi Empress Dowager of China or Roxelana Ottoman Empress. Otherwise famous women before feminism were often people who disregarded societys rules completely like pirates or took on male roles sometimes even pretending to be male like Frances Clayton.Cixi is very unique in that she was a dime a dozen concubine from a poor family she literally took over the familys finances and made them a fortune and only become dowager as she had the emperors only son. Then she manipulated the entire governmental system with the emperors widow to take over the entire thing and then kill all of her rivals. Then a few more rivals. Then she created an ad hoc and brutal economic trading partner with Queen Victoria although Im not sure either thought of it as such in those terms. She was way more cunning and ruthless than someone who just married into the position. Also i can easily see femme slash stories between her and the widow.Also its a bit unfair to say well she just married in. Plenty of queens married a king but few had any real independent power beyond wife and mother outside of internal court politics. The marriage was the first step but the rest was all their own.This also isnt including women like Mary Wollstonecraft who helped create the foundational texts for the future first wave feminism.,YOI,dewis44,1,t5_3gv95
