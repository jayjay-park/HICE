1483671,0,t1_cj28vrr,Thankfully there have been very few instances where Ive worried about other members of the community but I agree with you. Also I dont think theres such a thing as that guy in this comment section at this point haha. srs bsns up in here srs bsns that needs to get talked about at some point may as well be now.I trust most Tubers to keep their shit under control though. For example Flab drinks more than anyone I know and Soviet is close second but I find them to be completely fine. They have standards.Just have to remind people that such standards are commendable or pretty much required IMO.,BerryTubeLounge,cj29573,2,t5_2vbxz

6228214,0,t1_cyxk3jr,Does powerhour necessarily need its own channel? Usually people join the PH channel even if theyre not participating anyway since during PH the bar is empty. Then at some point they move back.Why not make the channel where the power hour happens the new drunk channel keep the bar as the default and encourage people to move to the power hour channel for drunk yelling and sometimes unacceptable singing? Then change the rules of the bar to be more quiet and less drunk especially during earlymid games.Making the Masteraburium the default only solves the problem of regulars who just want to move off onto their own channels after connecting without passing though the bar. It doesnt solve the problem of new people since theyd get there get confused then move over to the channel with the most people in it anyway likely the bar.If the issue is that we scare off new people at the bar the only solution is to make a channel thats somewhere in between quite conversation and the current bar and have that be the default. That way regulars dont have to pass though a very drunk channel and new peoples first impression would be more of a quieter conversation.,BerryTubeLounge,cyxkwne,1,t5_2vbxz
