Because it had all the features from standalone and it would make the mod better than standalone in many ways.

3860209,0,t1_cqvu7c7,Food isnt that rare. I would rather have it so food like cans were more rare but that they can last longer. Hunting would be the better option. But I think its pretty weird as it is now. I was playing more afterterwards and eventually I found I can of beans. My food meter was blinking and it just started draining blood. I ate it but my food meter was still blinking and shortly after it was draining blood again. I wouldnt say you were starving just after you ate a whole can of beans. You should be able to last a little bit on that. At least more than some minutes. Realistically it would make sense to make consumption rate half of what it is now and rather make it so canned food is harder to find.

When thats done you are transported back. Its done so you dont get killed while these actions are happening since you are visible to other players.Anyway sometimes if you die and logout or maybe your position gets messed up in the dB your position may get set to that spot. Should fix when you relog. Or it could be a hacker. Happens sometimes but usually  would be everyone on the server.,DayZmod,dbscplt,3,t5_2u47q
