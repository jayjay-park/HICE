375805,0,t3_1ybcci,First of all just went and paid for one. Didnt get as good of deal as you did but got it for a few hundred less than other gun stores in my area. Second I plan on using mine for duty and home defenseccw. So thanks for this thread now I dont hae to ask the same questions. Keep me posted when you get it and if any problems arise. Forums online sound like their is a few extractor issues out there.,SigSauer,cfjpua8,1,t5_2u4ss
425623,0,t3_1yqsym,I have a P Extreme also.  I have about one FTF every  rounds.  It happens to me with both the  and  round mags I have.  The weird thing is that the  round mag will occasionally pop out also when shooting.  I thought that it was because I am left handed originally and that my hand might be hitting the mag release.  I put a drop of oil on the release and shot a couple mags without it transfering to my hand so Im comfident that is not my issue.I also started with a little more drama with mine though.  I had a problem with the extractor so I would get  FTE per mag.  I sent it back and they replaced the extractor polished the feed ramp ...I put a couple hundred rounds through it after that and then tried switching to JHP.  I couldnt find any that would feed properly and after a couple expensive days at the range I went back to FMJ and they were not feeding also  FTF per mag.  Sent it back to Sig and they polished the feed ramp again and that got me to where I am today.,SigSauer,cfovq28,2,t5_2u4ss

3663036,0,t3_32c4xw,In a comment in another post ubackeru asked if Sig Pro mags were the same as MA mags since the stamped metal looked similar.I actually happen to have an MA and a SP so I thought Id help by taking a few photos of the guns with their mags and showing off the differences.The gist of the matter is the stamped metal is the same but the base plates are different. The MA uses PA mags which have a flat base plate. The Sig Pro uses a taller angled base plate that provides a rest for your pinky while shooting. The M Mag does lock in the Sig Pro however it doesnt line up because of the base plate differences and there is a little wobble. Im thinking that this is corrected with the right base plate. The Sig Pro mag does fit in the M but will not lock because the base plate does not fit in the grip.The other obvious difference is the cost for some reason the Sig Pro mags are usually  or more where you can get the PA mags for about  less retail. ,SigSauer,cq9t7jj,2,t5_2u4ss

6825669,0,t3_49919u,Most common cause especially on Sigs is you are holding the slide release button so it cant engage. You should grip the gun pretty tightly. But you need to adjust so that you are not riding the slide catch. I usually keep my strong hand right thumb to the outside of my left. And this keeps it away from the catch. Recently in trying to get up higher on the grip I found my left palm was actually holding down the catch and preventing  slide lock. ,SigSauer,d0pzm08,6,t5_2u4ss

One of the great things about the Sigs are how tight the tolerances are.  This results in  things Id imagine. Great accuracy. Keep out larger grain particle. Not as tolerant to smaller grit particleI also think this is the result of a full rail frame.  If particles get in there Id imagine the action would suffer badly from wedging.  Again a double edged sword for the full frame vs. partial frame rail design.  Just a theory.  ,SigSauer,d8g7nr1,3,t5_2u4ss

10922349,0,t3_5w1h91,Yes full size frame will fit on compact slide but it will overhang the barrel. You can however just get the carry frame. It has the same frame length as the compact but the grip length of the full size.   Edit see here  for size comparisons,SigSauer,de6kblu,6,t5_2u4ss
10963488,0,t3_5whxuz,I have a  as well and would love to have a have a holster just like this. Cant seem to find it on the website though?,SigSauer,deat1oe,1,t5_2u4ss
11050908,0,t1_dekl94n,SIG already makes flat triggers for some SAO models but they fo not for DASA.....hence the above project.,SigSauer,deklnqf,1,t5_2u4ss

11263673,0,t1_df84ued,I can shed some light on the Legion. It has the short reset trigger in with a grey guns adjustable trigger. This allows for a short crisp reset. The action overall is more smooth. The grips front strap checkering and the undercut on the trigger guard make for positive retention of the pistol. Solid steel guide rod again grey guns front slide serrations and a reduced beaver tail. The Xray sights. They are three dot night sights with a bright green fiber front. In normal lighting the rear sights all but disappear and that fiber front is like a laser sight. Trigger pull is slightly lighter due to reduced spring weight. It has the smaller controls from the p that helps prevent riding the slide release when you run dry. The legion is just meant to be shot. It had a lot of hype but its an amazing pistol. Ive had my p for about  years and decided to make it a project to upgrade it to as close to Legion specs as possible. The upgrades ended up costing me around . Its just more economical to get the Legion too. ,SigSauer,df8pypx,3,t5_2u4ss
11290029,0,t1_dfbjak2,Nice my ps trigger is nothing awesome like a decent glock but not a lot better. Time to buy some new gun guts!,SigSauer,dfbpil0,1,t5_2u4ss

11437893,0,t1_dfseu8f,I dont mind being corrected I just dont like being stalked through out the thread like you are doing. I didnt create any misinfo as I merely stated that I have never seen glock mags lower than  dollars.  round shitty P mags dont count.,SigSauer,dfsh2yo,1,t5_2u4ss
11438459,0,t1_dfsifvk,gt Its a single offshoot of the thread and youre responding to my posts dumbass. Hardly any stalking going on. If you dont like being corrected quit posting bullshit.I am talking about the one you started where I wasnt responding to you.gt You said that you could NOT get mags for the  for Magpuls dont count they arent steel reinforced and have had reliability issues.gtAs for what you think counts or doesnt nobody cares what you think.Smart people do.gtThey are available for  and are every bit as reliable as Glock mags.Wrong,SigSauer,dfsje8i,1,t5_2u4ss
11650350,0,t3_667lwt,My department armorer told me about Lucas oil. He asked what I used to oil my gun and I said hoppes. Hes like get rid of that shit and get some Lucas gun oil. Ive also been looking at using grease for my AR bolt. Could probably use it on my duty gun too. ,SigSauer,dggkxmb,1,t5_2u4ss
11651769,0,t1_dgg7igf,I got mine for the same reasons SIG reputation price amp concealment but after  range trips realized I wasnt interested in spending the time to improve my DA pull and was waaayyyyy better at time from draw to st round on target with a strikerfire so I traded the  for my  and havent looked back. When I need a smaller gun I usually take my wifes .,SigSauer,dggqqez,3,t5_2u4ss
