8752302,0,t3_4zx0hs,You heard Spread Love? Also a pretty good track thatll be on the album.Im fairly confident the album will be stellar with Mick showing artistic growth in both of the singles especially Drowning. As for the overall sound of the album I dont know. I feel like itll be uplifting though help your fellow man type thing.,mick_jenkins,d6zp0vu,2,t5_3ela3
