233413,0,t1_cf404cz,One other question for you.Im trying to adjust this script to be a toggle for the button Q where pressing Q again to turn it off will revert those sensitivity crosshair and FOV settings back to normal     alias equip slotdotxhairtypedotxhaircolorrdrawviewmodel sensitivity viewmodelfov      alias equip dotxhaircolordotxhairtypesensitivity rdrawviewmodel vmoff     bind q equip  rebind to likingWhat I would like to happen when hitting Q is toggledOn Sensitivity to  and FOV to  Crosshair type and color changedOff Sensitivity to  and FOV to  Crosshair settings and color reverted?  StabbyStabby put some crazy crosshair changing scripts in for the spy. Im not sure how they work or what they exactly changing for each equipment slot.Dont want the pistol to be equipped with Q just these settings to be toggled when I need them. I figure removing slot from the line will stop the pistol from being equipped.,tf2scripthelp,cf4xxws,1,t5_2w3fm

4735745,0,t3_3fscpc,Your quotes arent recognizable by TF looks like maybe smart quotes from Mac? Replace all of the quotes with quotes like  and you should be good.Your binds for the mousewheel dont need to be aliased and for mwheeldown you should definitely just directly bind to attack.,tf2scripthelp,ctrhf3o,2,t5_2w3fm

5517156,0,t1_cwgu4ya,Anything immediately following the word alias is a name for an alias. So basically I created some preset aliases ending in n for normal and m for modified. They hold the commands for the normal use of the slot and the use of the slot while the modifier is held.However for this sort of logic to work in the first place we need the key set to an alias and to modify that alias so we create the k aliases which are what get modified.The extra layer is the nm itself. I could have just directly put in the loadout alias something like this    loadoutmod alias onek loaditempreset  alias twok loaditempreset  ... For all the keys in one very long line. The n and m are just for readability and ease of use so you have the nice little section at the top for addingremoving commands.TLDRI used n and m to just hold options settings and used k as what the key is set to and used loadoutmod to change the setting of k.,tf2scripthelp,cwgv7ec,2,t5_2w3fm
6016253,0,t1_cy7iy7z,Since it requires the wait command I think I should try something else. Is there a way that pressing the minus key would toggle whether my script does friendly or foe?,tf2scripthelp,cy899sm,1,t5_2w3fm
6019556,0,t1_cy7y9x6,I also only record in pubs. You can set it to not automatically start in tournament games and you can bind a key to start recording regardless of pub or tournament.    precmode     precnotify     bind KEY precrecord    bind KEY precmarkI use a modifier key to start recording and the same key without a modifier to bookmark.,tf2scripthelp,cy8ossx,1,t5_2w3fm
