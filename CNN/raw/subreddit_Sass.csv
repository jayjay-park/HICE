6476469,0,t3_3ttomq,Nice video.Ive started using sass this week for first time and it excites me.Can I ask why you put the div.tutorial in the mixin? Did you need the div before the .tutorial? Ive been building deeply nested mixins for a project and Ive not had to use that leading div element in the sass.Cheers.,Sass,czp7pes,1,t5_2ruxc
