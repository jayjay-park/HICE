1001266,0,t1_chi3dhu,The original rule was something along those lines. Like each month there was a monthly grace period where players could be addeddropped. Me and rookie then decided that it was too much work keeping up with  teams misinterpreting this rule so we did away with it and just replaced it with any roster change is permitted at any time. It is still pretty much that now but we didnt think it would get abused the way it has. So the  hour waiting period should help solve this.,USContenders,chi3oc5,1,t5_30ark

1813519,0,t1_ck7pd34,Were there ever timeout rules? I could have sworn I read about em.Also can I have a say in hotsubbing? Its very easy to perform hotsubs in lets say mLTP. You have an abundance of players who you could let sub in. But in a league such as Contenders theres always the inevitable only four ppl could show up today. Thus there being no unfair reason to not allow timeouts whilst being a valid reason if for say like today unexpected first time serious lag just happened and calling a timeout would help the player have time to reset himself and ensure a proper connection andor deal with it to have timeouts especially if a team does not have a sub.,USContenders,ck7pj2k,1,t5_30ark

3335099,0,t1_cp8epbc,Lets look at every challenge since I became captain  months ago.  We challenged Tag Team who forfeited. We challenged Pup Pals I think this is when like half our team quit so we decided just to let it be voided because it was a difficult time for us. We were challenged by Life of Pi found a time that would work despite half our team having left during this time and despite them rescheduling at the last minute and lost.  We challenged Tagcorn and it was voided because we generally arent available until  PT and thats about when they were no longer available as an east coast team.  We...didnt actually challenge No Experience Required I have no idea who the fuck this is.  Snipes on a Plane challenged us and I was on vacation for  weeks I think we had a time scheduled but never played it no clue why. I was out of town. So lets not pretend like this is somehow unfair to the teams around us when weve had one challenge against us voided in  months its not like were refusing to play games. seriously though I have no clue who that is who challenged No Experience Required. ,USContenders,cp8fdu0,0,t5_30ark

Ive never done racing but my understanding is that the point is to race around predefined tracks as fast as possible. Thats clearly not the same thing.Penalties is designed as a tiebreaker map and only makes sense v where one person is trying to cap and the other is trying to defend. Mechanically it makes no sense v. The portals are not compatible in regular game mode for one.I think this conversation has quickly got pretty silly.
