1971444,0,t1_ckqqslw,No the voting system is there to help good skins get noticed by Valve but Valve ultimately decides what goes in the game. Copyright material is prohibited and theyve had problems in the past with this See the MA Howl skin yet the top  is littered with artwork ripped straight from Google images this doesnt mean those skins will make it into the game.,csworkshop,ckqrcqt,1,t5_2yuqk

8657602,0,t1_d6ns87a,Much more visible now nice. Overall with future designs i would try to give it more of a focus on the theme youre trying to portray  for example to me the Musical notes dont feel like they relate to the rest of the design as they are the only musical motifs on the gun.,csworkshop,d6ntd8m,1,t5_2yuqk

10510170,0,t3_5q729r,I am going to temporarily ban you from posting on rcsworkshop due to posting the same weapon skin without replying to my initial comment here I therefore think you are working with copyrighted artwork. You can send a message to our mod mail to appeal your ban.,csworkshop,dczftu0,1,t5_2yuqk
10962388,0,t3_5wi21i,I also believe presentation is vital for the succes of a submission. I usually do a so called beauty render in Cinema D and then make ingame like literally ingame screenshots of a FN version and a BS version. Little wear GIF at the end t voila. Always keep the font the same through all my submissions and try to write a nice and explanatory description. I personally try not to edit my ingame screenshots though because it can be deceiving from the real product.I usually also record a demo of the gun in action in a deathmatch environment but that is usually not needed. ,csworkshop,deaoyhx,1,t5_2yuqk
