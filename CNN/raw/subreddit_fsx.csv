5105950,0,t1_cv1ener,I dont recall the specifics off hand.  Built it a few years ago.  Basically when designing it I just focused on the features that would actually boost sim performance.   Extra unused drive space wouldnt do that better graphics would.  Basically I had my budget and allocated it as best I could for a specific goal. I could have bought a TB drive and the latest version of windows which at the time I believe was vista but that would have meant less money for graphics and RAM,fsx,cv1ghhy,1,t5_2s456
