194278,0,t3_1waspa,Sometimes it can actually be more difficult to find convincing replicas for stuff than it can be to just exhibit the originals! Take for instance things like fragile textiles and clothes or shoes made using techniques that arent practised nowadays or are made using materials that arent in production any more. For example the museum I work with exhibits Peranakan beaded shoes and Sarong Kebayas the exact sort of glass beads used in shoes made in the past are extremely difficult to find and commissioning exact replicas is pretty close to impossible. Also while some of the textiles used in kebayas may be extremely fragile the same thing applies its actually much harder to find or make replicas of such items than it is to just exhibit some from the giant store we have. Keeping them in good condition and safe is what the amazing people behind the scenes do! They put a ton of work into it which you hardly see but is really impressive nonetheless. I guess what I mean to say is sometimes you simply cant find or make replicas of certain types of objects. The originals can be displayed while keeping them preserved and safe as long as adequate precautions are taken. And when youre working in a museum where a lot of the stuff on display is also in the living memory of people who visit trust me when I say that they will notice and wont like it if youre using replicas or get any minor details wrong. ,MuseumPros,cf0khxj,2,t5_2xp5z
469774,0,t1_cftkxdt,Theres an episode of Bobs Burgers that I found hilarious for these reasons the director met the group of school children the director took that group of children on a tour and the staff were on strike for improved benefits. NONE of those things would ever happen where I work. I cant remember I think they got their  raise in the end. But why is the thought of unionizing so ridiculous? I know that some individual museums have unions but a call to action for a national union is past due. We deserve a living wage and benefits that support a decent quality of life. Weve been trained to say I didnt get into this for the money what little we raise has to go right back into the exhibits... But thats not really true is it? Is there any excuse for paying someone with a PhD or a MFA minimum wage to be the backbone of your museum? I have friends who are curators  this prestigious position that you work for your whole life put your all into spend years studying for  who moonlight as waitresses barbacks and babysitters to make ends meet. Same goes for the educators the registrars the preparators the security guards etc. Still work is scarce and you take what you can get for whatever it pays. Its not ideal and its not fair. Its a hard question that we as a professional community need to seriously address. ,MuseumPros,cftny9z,13,t5_2xp5z

1309102,0,t3_2815yg,I use TMS at work and I recently found that PastPerfect has a free evaluation program you can download. IMO PastPerfect feels like a scaled down version of TMS. You might consider getting that and playing around with it. Just pick something you want to catalog your book collection family photographs...anything really and learn how the program works. I have also found that experience with MS Access is useful if you are looking to work at a smaller museum. EDIT Link to PastPerfect Evaluation Copy,MuseumPros,cigw2es,2,t5_2xp5z

3439786,0,t3_2zl89f,Someone asked me recently why humans should care whether or not the quickly expanding human population is causing habitat loss and species extinctions especially since it seems like the extinction of some things has zero impact on our ability to grow and thrive. Fundamentally thats a humancentric way to view the world but its comforting because it allows individuals to excuse themselves from responsibility of their actions. Its uncomfortable to think the pursuit of happy and convenient lives will be at the expense of the health of the place we call home. No individual wants to carry the burden of that guilt so they absolve themselves from the problem and we become complacent in the idea our individuals lives have no lasting impact. What we owe future generations is a fighting chance. We have an obligation to try our best to leave our planet and collective histories in a better state than how we inherited them  to expand on existing ideas and fill in the blanks and to preserve what we were given so it may last another generation. To what end? I dont know but I do know itll be a shame when my children or grandchildren will never know what an elephant or rhinoceros or salamander looked like because the majority of people flippantly shirk ownership of anything outside their daily todos. What a shame it would be for the billions of years it took for all life to evolve to end in the next blink of an eye because we were too apathetic to repair our own damages. ,MuseumPros,cpkd0pu,3,t5_2xp5z

As works of art are reproduced on screens and available outside of a museum traditionalists fear that people will not visit a museums physical location to see the real works of art. Yet there is no research to prove that this is true quite to the contrary research in the United Kingdom has proven that digital media increases the number of attendees.

7081971,0,t1_czns2qi,When the first familesthree generations of Turners and Susanna Ingersoll lived in the home the rooms were used as chambers. Chambers were traditionally bedrooms or ladies entertaining spaces but never public spaces in the home. When the Upton family purchased the property in the late c. they used the room to teach ballroom dancing and music lessons. When Caroline Emmerton our organizations founder bought the property she used the rooms for administrative office and resident space for workers in her settlement house. For the past ish years the rooms have been used to house some collections but structural issues have limited both human and collections use. ,MuseumPros,d1j3ut0,2,t5_2xp5z

11084063,0,t1_deoc88o,Actually Im going to jump in here and answer this one.  We try not to have exhibitions that glorify a single person or perspective.  Even when the exhibitions are about a single person there is usually some  possibly small  section that talks about lessawesome actions of that person to add some perspective because not all visitors have the same point of view.  Now regarding Trump or any president those exhibitions are usually in their presidential library which is built shortly after their presidency ends in a location of their choosing.  For example Bushs library is in Texas and has been exhibiting his recent paintings along with an exhibition about  and decision making they offer pro and cons of various actions he took so its glorifying on one level but offers multiple perspectives on another.  Obamas library which will be in Chicago is currently being built.  Trumps would presumably be in his home state as well but NY doesnt seem to be much of a fan of his.  But back to this AMA we are fielding questions about inclusive exhibits and how to create exhibitions that welcome all and I hope that Mr. Trumps forthcoming library welcomes people of all genders races and perspectives.  ,MuseumPros,deodab0,3,t5_2xp5z
