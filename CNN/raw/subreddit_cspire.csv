4628126,0,t3_3e5x7r,I think cspire Has been building money up the last  years for this auction I see them buying x in Alabama Tennessee panhandle of Florida. and x in Georgia the rest of Florida Louisiana Missouri Arkansas and Texas. I believe Cspire is setting up to barrow money and use current money to expand and buy more spectrum to expand. I think US cellular is doing the same. I think both Us cellular and Cspire are in the wireless market for the long run.edit the reason they buy so much spectrum they need to expand. I think dish ends up sell their spectrum and cspire us cellular tmobile and the small guys get a big part of a good deal from dish when they sell their spectrum. I also think Lightsquared lives up to their deal with cspire and the small carriers around the usa. ,cspire,ctdy3bs,1,t5_2uykr
