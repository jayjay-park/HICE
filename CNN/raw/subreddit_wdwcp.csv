299770,0,t1_cfbhegr,Hey! Just finished my phone interview like  mins ago and I asked the interviewer who was super sweet about arrival dates since my school is on the quarter system and I dont get out until June. She told me that there are arrival dates for Fall Advantage in mid June and it shouldnt be a problem! Hope this helps ,wdwcp,cfbu51z,2,t5_2szgk

These applications are done on such a large scale that her emailing has absolutely no impact other than perhaps annoying the person receiving her email. At this stage of the process the wait usually tops out at only a couple days unless she is made pending. If you all get to the end of the interview process you will likely have a long wait though. ,wdwcp,d6kcbv6,3,t5_2szgk
