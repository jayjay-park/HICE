1654048,0,t3_2dahxt,Sorry if this is not tagged properly!! Im not really used to tagging posts anywhere so this is kind of a trial run for me.This is my best friend and he and I have this kind of lovestrongly dislike relationship mostly because I expect too much of him. But its really really adorable how fascinated he is by nail art. Like... Hes not normally one to bounce off the walls or anything but he totally hones in on my hands when I show him stuff. The first nail art anything I showed him were my new dotting tools that I got like four months ago and he said these look like medieval murder weapons they dont but hes weird. He then mentioned that he was thinking of using something like those to put acrylic paint on his golf clubs and asked if I could show him how they worked. He gets really excited over small things and hes never seen anything like those before so they completely blew him away. He asked me to show him more stuff and every time I do hes fucking amazed. It makes me feel really happy and special. It also makes me want to figure out new techniques to show him and makes me want to get better at the ones I already know! Anyway. Sorry for gushing. Im just really excited right now. Hopefully Ill have a good water marble mani to post later!!Xoxo,RandomActsOfPolish,cjnnmsl,2,t5_2ukje

Also its a compliment because someone clearly needs more social attention and cant think for themselves and something of mine is deemed worthy of the positive strokes. Still super lame.I love lots of things and see this shizzle all the time the tattoos sub has peeps discussing colors and lines and designs and lots of support and sharing studios and artwork and it will become an outlet for a poopypants driveby.

3334898,0,t3_2ybhge,. Store just at room temp! basically avoid direct sunlight or any other extreme environments like the bathroom where it gets really humid. I believe the fridge makes the polishes turn thick. . Marbling is a tricky thing but basically its best to choose really opaque colors typically one coaters. I have used both Sally Hansen and Sinful Colors brands for both stamping and marbling because of the cheaper price that way you arent losing as much money by using so much product! Thats just me personally though.. If the stamper is not picking up you might need to wipe it off with some alcohol and see if that helps that worked for me! acetone or other nail polish remover on the stamper can wear it out fast and since its usually so thin alcohol seems to do the job just as well! ,RandomActsOfPolish,cp8ek79,2,t5_2ukje

3420760,0,t1_cphwcur,In my experience the ones that work well are specific to one job either base or top.  Sticky base coats tend to get good reviews like Orlys Bonder which is described as a rubberized base coat and CND Stickey which is another product with the same purpose to create a bond between your color and your nail bed without damaging your healthy nails.  Top coats are different typically designed to help drycure your polish and to protect it so it lasts a few days.  Some are megashiny too.  A few I like are INMs Out The Door fastdry topcoat and Poshe fast dry topcoat.  Youll see a lot of love on this sub for Seche Vite another fastdry topcoat.  Many people love it it doesnt work amazingly for me.  ,RandomActsOfPolish,cpi6wm4,1,t5_2ukje

4025971,0,t1_crehloz,He is indeed still kicking. He was yelling at me yesterday for telling him to come inside haha. He still has his pretty bad days but the good days outnumber them and Im getting more tail wags and kisses out of him. His hips and back legs are starting to fail though  he needs help to get up from a laying position most of the time so thats given me a couple of panic attacks.Ive actually owned two aggressive dogs and lived near quite a few others. Jake was a huge pain in the ass when he was a puppyadolescent... he was a shelter rescue and the lady who had him before me kept him kenneled for  hours a day. I got him at  months old shed put an ad on craigslist and I responded. Got him home he was doing great with my older dog my disabled brother biggest test and my cats. I then get a call from the local animal shelter asking if I had him quarantined. I was baffled. However it turns out that he had bit one of the next door neighbors kids after theyd been taunting him throwing rocks and sticks etc on one of the rare occasions he was outside.  It wasnt a bad bite and in all honesty I think the kid deserved it I know Im a horrible person but hopefully he learned a lesson about respect. Buuut that meant Jakey was labled a potentially dangerous dog. Im not sure what exactly happened before the lady got him but hes really wary of men and trespassers so he would bark like a psycho and try to be super alpha to new people. I did catch one of our neighbor kids shitty neighborhood.. shooting him with a BB gun one day so that probably didnt help. Sigh. Anyway we did a dog training class and also had some  lessons with the teacher that helped a bit and when it came to walking or whenever hed have a psycho barkout Id make him sit until he calmed down talking to him in a soothing voice saying like Good boy quiet while petting him. If all else failed and he got too into his moment to pay attention to me Id whip out a squirt gun. It was always enough to jolt him back into paying attention to me rather than his intended target and then wed start the sit and calming process. As for dealing with aggressive dogs they always ended up loving me in the end. I carry dog treats on me at all time a force of habit from when we were walking Jake so thats always a good diversion. Ive only been bit once and that was because I went into the middle of a dog fight without thinking. I have a pretty good alpha voice so thats usually a good diversion and then once I have their attention I offer a cookie and make them sit lol. Holy cow that was a narrative hahaha. I totally love your plant party idea and Im gonna do it. We usually have weekly barbeques that are BYOB so Im totally just gonna get a couple of growlers to supply the beer and make it BYOP!,RandomActsOfPolish,crf6v4a,1,t5_2ukje

4750204,0,t3_3fyooo,Had yet another crappy day. My apartment complex is painting the outside of our buildings. Well I live in a style thats very similar to a small house. Just one story a garage blah blah. Well the guys were power washing the place and fucked up the waterline somehow but didnt notice. The bathroom in my apartment flooded and some of the carpet got completely soaked. Worst part? It took them over four hours and  phone calls to get any help. So now I have giant loud ass fans running for the next  hours to dry my carpet. Grr. My place is super lazy and bad at maintenance.On my birthday my Patriots play the Colts in Indy and Jeremy might take me if money plays out okay. My first NFL game and Im soooo excited even if its an away game for my team. If this happens you guys will probably get an annoying ass countdown from me. lolIf you are participating in my contest I made another edit.

I get a phone call from my bros gf shes panicked saying Landon and shelbys schools are on lock down there across the street from each other there were  people shot at landons school WHAT from news updates and rumors going around I was damn scared. Found out kids and staff were all safe but still scared there were swat teams around the schools streets blocked off I could hear helicopters over head and I was helpless there was nothing I could do. I was able to text shelby she said they were hiding in there class and building was locked there classrooms where locked up and thing pushed in front of doors. I foolishly turned the scanner on and started listening to what was going on  teens were shot after tying to brake into a house near landos school couple of the kids were hiding in the woods by the school in total  kids were arrested ages  to  wtf kids why are you being so damn stupid. I had to pick landon up no kids could leave unless a parent was there or they were getting on a bus I was so worried landon was scared hes like I thought it was a drill this went on for over  hours yesterday. Im so grateful everyone is ok and how great the school staff handled it all and Landon he keep calm witch is not easy for him. so no sleep for me all day my fear level was to high and once I got my son in my hands I took him home and snuggled the living shit outta that poor kid so that was my day and major fuck you to it.Edit adding pics of where it happend to where my son was  so glad everyone even the dumb ass kids who thought braking into someones house was  a good idea are ok,RandomActsOfPolish,cwqk1af,1,t5_2ukje
