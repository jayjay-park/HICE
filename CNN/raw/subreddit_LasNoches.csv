157986,0,t1_cevprrh,So it was James... Well that certainly was a welcome surprise to say the least. They never had found the body nor sensed him in Astra Cealum so Alvaro had always held out some bit of hope. Funnily enough hed entered back in the exact way he would hope a fraccion of his would returning from a hunting trip with a bounty fit for a feast. The thought of it even brought a smile to his face as he waited for James to get within vocal range. Well I had hoped for a second he replied in obvious jest breaking out into a small chuckle as he walked over to the pile of meat. Alvaro firmly patted one of his more experienced fraccion on the shoulder a couple of times as a silent complement of his haul one to even rival what the Espada could bring back after  good months hunt. Good to have you back James. Although Im afraid to say you missed most of the conflict as you may already know... Still it seems your recent bountys been keeping you busy regardless.Alvaro knew all too well how much his fiery fraccion loved the thrill of the fight so perhaps mentioning the Seraphim wasnt the best course of action if he didnt already know of their defeat and their new predicament. Whilst trying to think of a way to sway the topic of conversation he slid his hand off Jamess shoulder and returned it to the worn pocket where it normally rested. However in doing so yet more less pleasing topics came to mind. Such as the state of the Hollow Humans and their realm where James apparently hailed from. ,LasNoches,cewfdhv,1,t5_2w82d

Next Tirantco wondered exactly just how much he should tell Aries characterWell I mean theres not a whole lot. Was sick of being a Hollow. So I broke off my mask then wandered on this place. Im a very untrusting person but not a rude one.

635405,0,t1_cgch3vu,Alberto watches Jackies transformation and is amazed by it. He expected His resurrection to be impressive but this was just plain amazing. He grins a wild toothy grin this is going to be a fun fight. No matter who wins this they will deserve the position of Segunda.Very impressive but youre not going to get me that easily!As the beast of a man hurls himself towards Alberto he digs his feet into the ground to ensure he has a firm stance for the impact. He then swings his hammer timing it so that Jackie was arriving at the spot where the hammer will reach its most momentum. He puts all his power behind the hammer strike trying to hit Jackie away like a baseball player hitting a home run.After the strike Alberto is pushed back a few feet from the force of the impact. After recovering his footing he begins to charge a cero in his hand. The cero grows in size until it becomes massive. Alberto points the hand with the charging cero at Jackie. When it reaches full power Alberto fires it at Jackie. The whole time the smile never leaves Albertos face it has been far too long since Alberto had gotten to fight like this.,LasNoches,cgchv4b,1,t5_2w82d

Whatever language that is called is what I spoke. And I can see that here my kind of place. But uhh leaning closer with a grin I dont think smothering him with your tits is gonna do any good.He steps back with a wide grin on his face and a loud chuckle.

1039946,0,t1_chmh8bd, Kylar Uses Master Ball. Wins RP.Hmm? Alvaro hummed in response to his son. He hadnt heard from Felix in months but knew that his son was always with him in some way or another. He was quite content just to live under the assumption that Felix was within his shadow whenever he went out but the word did catch him by surprise a little bit. Hey Felix did you want to talk about something? He asked in response quite oblivious to how his own inner termoil might have been effecting his closest fraccion. Although a part of him did assume he wanted to talk about the recent appearance of Gwen and Rhys and the place theyd taken in their pack. Poor Felix never did seem to take well to the newer fraccion Alvaro took in. Hed even fought with Chatan for the longest time after their meeting. Simpler times... Thinking of them couldnt help but bring a smile to Alvaros face. Even if thy were under threat from the Seraphim at least they were happy. Or perhaps it was him promoting Sadako and Cade to Espada before he. That move really had just been a selfish move on Alvaros part to keep Felix closer to himself. Hed not thought theyd grown apart at all and still didnt really. The two could go months without speaking a word on hunting trips yet they still normally knew what the other was thinking. Although oddly enough he wasnt quite sure on what Felix was thinking at the moment... Just made mention of Flower and Isas new OCs that theyll be introing in a different thread soon. Chronologically it would have taken place before this just PM me if you want Felix to touch on it and I can fill you in. ,LasNoches,chmhvjx,1,t5_2w82d

1631369,0,t1_cjk4rzs,LaxusAfter having his little fun outside Laxus decided to come back in to see what was happening inside the lab and such. With Tomoko being on his property Laxus felt like if he was living with some officer that was tasked with supervising everything he did. In other words he didnt like it...not...one...bit.He was even more annoyed to see that Tomoko had taken one of his rooms and turned it into her own Little Mokotown it was hideous...she even rearranged some of his stuff the nerve! But it did have its perks as long as Tomoko didnt open her accursed mouth then Laxus was happy. Although there was one detail that Laxus couldnt deal with one detail that made his brain hurt and made him want to vomit just at the thought of it. It was the fact that Tomoko was definitely pleasing to the eyes if you know what I mean it was as if she was a perfectly sculpted statue with the personality of a hagraven It was an atrocity! Why did God waste such a beautiful figure on a witch like her?! As he walks down the hallways of his lab Laxus stops abruptly to visibly shudder and let out a terrified groan of displeasure. It was even worse that she was one of those holier than thou Quincies. She needs to get out of here... Laxus mutters to himself shaking his head as he walks up to the door of her room and knocks a few times before stepping in.Ciao Miss Moko what are you tinkering with in here? he says casually as he steps into the room looking around to see all of chemicals and flasks stationed around the room. Laxus didnt really fancy chemistry he found it boring and cliche. Good thing he had Casey for that not to mention that Lluvia was rather good at it too. Grabbing a nearby swivel chair Laxus sits in it reverse style and rolls over to Tomoko to see if what she was working on was actually interesting.,LasNoches,cjkss2k,1,t5_2w82d

1660365,0,t1_cjoel2r,Though his movement was slowed in his intoxication Jackies eye sure as hell wasnt and easily spotted the slash with just enough time to pull his hips back to avoid it all together. He had thought though briefly on reaching out and stopping his arm but if he missed game over. Instead he just smirked as Laxus had apparently left him all alone in that big ridiculous tower seemingly free to do whatever the hell he wanted but all he wanted was a fucking nap. So he just zipped up his pants and walked calmly out the front door. Well it was more of a stagger than a walk but you get the point.He had no idea why the hell Laxus had taken off so quickly Jackie had almost expected him to be a little more upset. Perhaps it was history and the fear of it repeating itself. All he knew was Laxus had told him that he had gotten some sort of tracking bullshit swimming around his body. What a cheap move. Hot.You might wanna lay a towel down or somethinHe mumbled as he shoved the door open and began his trek back home. Ooooonly problem I have with that house raid thing cus I really dgaf about breaking and entering is that the gecko is NOT deepsixed cus  hes much smaller and probably advanced enough to be hidden unless you know about it and  he doesnt know about it. Also theres some pretty scary RancorVastos roaming around his desert on top of the constant Air Wing training conducted soooo...... he might not really have much time before Jackie gets there and shows Laxus his spleen....,LasNoches,cjog9l9,1,t5_2w82d
1663479,0,t1_cjoi4fg,As soon as the sound of both River and Cades zanpakuto hit the ground River knew it was time to turn around and grab the weapon of choice. River quickly turned around and scanned for the weapon he knew he was going to choose. After moments of scanning he found it. A harpoon with a trigger that allowed the blade of the harpoon to shoot outwards. The blade was attached to the pole of the harpoon by a long rope. River grabbed the harpoon and pointed it at Cade. As he pointed the harpoon at Cade and began to squeeze the trigger River felt a sharp pain in his right shoulder. When he felt the sharp pain his finger slipped on the trigger and sent the blade of the harpoon spiralling forward towards Cade. River looked down at his right shoulder. He had a sharp chakram stuck deep inside of him. River put his left hand inside the chakram and pulled it out. Blood dripped down onto the sand. River now had the chakram in his left hand and the pole of the harpoon in his right hand. He quickly threw back the chakram at Cade. As he threw the chakram he felt a sharp pain in his right shoulder and fell down to a knee. ,LasNoches,cjoudls,1,t5_2w82d

1806108,0,t1_ck4nzil,Tsukira swishes his tail with some excitement as Master Laxus approaches him eager to tell him everything about all the new techniques he was developing and the exciting implications a happy if selfcentered smile crossing his face. He trots over to the Espada pushing his two balls together so that they merge as the liquid sloshes inside them.Good evening Master Laxus! Havent seen you since shinitarget practice! Ive been working on fixing my ball technique so that I get a grasp of the full parameters of its capabilities. You see the way it works is I draft a sort of thin membrane thats held together by cold and surface tension. Its very fragile which is entirely the point because it lasts just long enough for me to relocate it to a convenient position before blowing. The liquid inside is as cold as my cero is but it reacts endothermically with oxygen and changes into a gaseous compound which basically means that not only does it explode on contact with breathable air but it also chills the opponent quite a bit and lets off steam. Ive been using it mostly as a smoke grenade sort of thing so far but I think that if I make the liquid cooler I might be able to get it to persist for a little bit before it gets enough thermal energy to react in the first place. Itd be cold enough to cause between frostbite and freezeburn although one shinitarget I tested it on actually got so cold that his hand shattered like glass when I smacked it with my sword. What do you think Master Laxus?,LasNoches,ck6szfr,1,t5_2w82d

2057747,0,t1_cl1ddmm,This is just for an audience.Vals head jerked in the direction of the Sextas domain as the clash of two reiatsus vwooshed across Las Noches. Lluvia and a strange one. He had been outside Laxus tower training. Despite being sweaty and worn the feeling of two powerful beings clash made him feel renewed. He quickly flicked his wrist to change the sword back into its flute form as he quickly sonidod to the source. It was Lluvia and Emilio. He had been filled in on the other Espada not long ago so the mysterious reiatsu mustve belonged to the Sexta. He walked with a brisk pace to just inside the hall of the huge castle where he could see the two had already begun. This is interesting... If Lluvia is Septma and Emilio is the Sexta this must be a match for the number. Ill have to stay for this.,LasNoches,cl1duwt,1,t5_2w82d
2061822,0,t1_cl1v9oe,To see his attack do so little was an ultimately depressing sight. Respiro was aware of the difference in power between the two but never did he think it would be quite that high. Respiro out of breath and tired beyond belief just watched as the Espada began to charge another cero. This one looked slightly different from before but that didnt concern Respiro too much. It was all happening again. He was too tired to continue and too weak to fight. Just as when he met Lluvia. Its funny how things like this happen. But it was too late to dwell on such things. Respiro prepared himself for what would possibly be the end. But one thing bothered him. That look in Lluvias eyes. A glare full of pain or was it anger? Either way Respiro knew that somehow it wasnt the look of a killer. Lluvia released the cero blinding Respiro with an awe inspiring purple glow. This was followed by a kick to the right side of Respiros torso. The blunt force of the kick sent Respiro flying yet again.As soon as Respiro could attempt to regain his senses he could instantly feel numerous broken ribs. His best option would be to remain on the ground and keep still to prevent further injury. Respiro glanced at his blade still gripped tightly in his hands. Its a miracle he didnt impale himself with it during his flying lesson. Upon closer inspection Respiro noticed the pendant wrapped around the hilt of his blade. Such a strange item. He never knew where exactly it came from but it had always been with him for as long as he remembered. Respiro pulled the jewellery away from his blade and simply examined it. It was such a curious little trinket.It was composed of two main features a silver quarter moon and then attached to the inner curve of the moon was a small picture of what seemed to be a few galaxies in a circular cut out.Gazing at this small piece of jewellery was at this particular moment Respiros only distraction from the pain.  soundtrack? why not. ,LasNoches,cl1wi7j,1,t5_2w82d

Then she remembered that document scrap she picked up from the lab F...father... she says to herself again as her eyes widen giving her an insane expression. Now that she had remembered one of her goals she leans down over Val and places both of her arms around his neck...effortlessly lifting him up high in the air.
