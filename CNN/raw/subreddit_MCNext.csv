That being said yea im used to decent customer service. I dont think its entitlement to want a single update after waiting for over  hours for anything to happen. The fact that people are upset is because you made a great product and if you want to help your game and charity grow then maybe its time to take on FREE volunteers. If all that needed to be done was to reset the servers... it just sucks because the only time I can play is night time and obviously seems most of you guys are sleeping  that time. Just saying I was surprised to wake up to a post that was bashing your player core for actually caring if your product is offline. Asking for updates after  or  hours and just wondering whats going on isnt entitlement last time I checked...

The next pvp event should be accesable to AHC players as well although I cant promise all will be accesable to everyone.AHC gives a crazy multiplyer when people say AHC is not worth it its important o realize youll be leveling so much faster then normal players and so much faster then hc players to put things in perspective a ratebomb event for an AHC with a ultrahigh rate accuracy for one rate could potentially give you .million points for just one vote.,MCNext,cgowpq8,1,t5_2zn7f

This is something though that I did not check with and I have reversed the action completely gave him his levels back and blocks to build his home.So do not use that action as any justification of how bad the server is that was a call made cause I wasnt there. I will be more clear in the future that noone can take any action without me being there as I know this can easily spiral.Any type of griefing or whatever I see it as my own failure and its my job to make it so it gets avoide din the future. I would go as far as thankinjg griefers for what they do as they are improving everyones else experience as Im hunting down every grief possible. Even when it comes to flaming I can mute people and make sure they cannot do any harm. On Mcnext everyone is a potential lifesaver and I hope people see things that way as well.What I might do in the future is take action on threads like this if you think there are better non grief servers you are free to go there but I literally have better things to do then being in the middle of a drama theatre cause people feel entitled to an experience that is already unique. This is what harms the community more then those griefers in my opinion and so far the facts are on my side. So its not like im being blind to see what happends people love the server but there is a few loud people complaining about literally nothing and its starting to take up my patience resulting in banns on reddit because this place is supposed to be contructive free of drama and build on the comminty.

886741,0,t3_249xvz,Well a thouth about the bottleneck which you call it lets say only  people are pvping would be easier to collect them all in the middle at the bridge than to make them run around trying to find people to kill the bridge is basicly a collection point the size of the bridge could be enlarged dynamically based on how many people are pvping in the arena so it wont be one clusterfuck all the time D and if someone would be standing on the bridge when it becomes smaller you could simply teleport them  blocks against their base so they wont fall in lava. To the several arenas my opinion is that collecting the pvp in one big area instead of several tiny ones makes the pvp more... everything? I just dont like how it is now with every faction being spread around randomly in netherrack. Ofc for them who likes this they can still have factions outside of the arena as they please the arena is just an alternative.,MCNext,ch52qg0,1,t5_2zn7f

I also would like to have a chance when using mobspawner to get wither spawner of some other rare spawner really low chance obviously.

Unfortunately this may even be related to lag issues inherent to Minecraft that are currently a bit of a mystery to Mojang themselves so its very hard for us to really pin them down. In that regard though Minecraft .. might fix all of it cause itll have some pretty huge renderer rewrites and optimizations.

2070619,0,t1_cl2z5u3,Hi Jack! Thanks for voicing your concerns as well! I will try and go through the issues you raised in the same order you raised them. for starter if you really dont want any chances of scamming at all you can go to the singleplayer mode and open a creative server and havemakebuild any item or structure that you want and there will be no chance for anyone else to disturb you and you would have a safe game. now why do people want to play on servers with other people? because of the interaction and that also has certain risks that singleplayer worlds dont have. Yes you can store items in your home and yes no one can steal them there. however no one other than me can steal from your vault and i guarantee that i will not steal anything and you trust me then we have the same situation as you having your items in your home right? i will elaborate on this a little later...and again you are correct minecraft is not RL i dont understand why thats important hereloans are one of three options i put forward and i stated that loans will have to be worked on a fitting concept thought out but the other two are perfectly possible so please consider those as well!im also not sure about how well you understand economics quite frankly what Ithe bank would be aiming at here is still relatively simple though but there is a basic problem of Supply and Demand. Now there are ways to optimize trade or basically create a equilibrium for a certain set of prices at a given moment in time and a bankfinancial intermediary do just that. Currently we have more of a half barter half money system where ebdb are the currency and that is not as optimal as one would like it to be. check out the evolution of money gt  quite an interesting read actually maybe it will make more sense but if it doesnt im happy to explain it to you some time later.the idea is strange yes but its not unnecessary. i know dont like the RL examples but my guess would be that you do have money in a RL bank what is stopping you that they dont scam you taking money from yoru account? nothing. you trust them because they are big respected public institutions. now it isnt impossible to make something like that  on a much smaller scale with and for the community not just me alone  and i repeat if we manage to pull something like this off we might even get athene interested... what do you think?the trade option has the big problem that you can only trade stacks at a time i think.... meaning expensive spawners for example would need more than one trade making it hard to not be scammed. additionally no one can test whether or not the spawner is real. if you go back into the reddit history a bit you will see that multiple people have been scammed for falsefake spawners. so yeah trade is not an MCNext players wet dream xD. Needless to say a neutral middleman can bridge both those problems. im open to more questions and doubts so dont  hesitate to engage in conversation! if you like we can even skype about it since it prevents me writing essays each time in response ... hehe.One last thing we dont really have a community project running. by that i mean an ingame project  so maybe this could be something! the streaming project is fantastic but i was not able to follow that last big date since i had no time ill definately check out the next!,MCNext,cl30rtw,1,t5_2zn7f

2973632,0,t3_2u843s,I dont think you have the authority to say this. You jumped to a conclusion here. Reese said that they would save copies of the world and let players download them so they could keep their houses and such. The fact that it says coming soon tells you that they are working on it. Maybe the admins were hoping to get a little more done on it before telling us what their final plan is. Next time dont make rage posts without all the facts.,MCNext,co648lm,1,t5_2zn7f
2974841,0,t1_co68p52,Yes I think so too Mees It will probably all be back to basic and low maintenance.

4958331,0,t3_3heo5n,Im sceptic to this the ammount of work to make the original mcnext working was immence and it never really worked . Im happy someone is atleast trying to rebirth the server but you gotta take a few steps back and mabye youll find out the past server was way too complicated to copy and that you might wanna make this one simpler.I hope this isint just a lie to gain a few users on your own server but right now theres a chance it is.To disprove that theory mabye you or someone else can update us with how far you come with the server and what needs to be done right now theres  confirmation other than your own word about rebirth of mcnext.,MCNext,cujjd3a,0,t5_2zn7f
