5604636,0,t1_cwpz0wv,Its funny I think we become a bit numb to the Victorian London aesthetic over here in the UK cause depending on where you live its still quite prominent. Im from Edinburgh where you can literally walk the same streets that Burke and Hare walked cobbled and everything and go to the graves they robbed and then go to the underground vaults where they hid the bodies. Its all pretty miraculous that I guess you take it for granted. I shall slap myself on the wrist. Sweeneys story isnt as prominent a part of history as the other stories I think because of a certain popularisation it has encountered. Its funny how The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is still quite rife despite David Hasselhoffs best efforts...,musicalmash,cwrt51t,2,t5_3ansr
8176455,0,t3_4qxss2,Or actually here is the reaIt was actually Natasha who asked to see Pierre. He visited the Rostovs in the evening after his meeting with Andrey to talk to Marya and Natasha sent for him. Natasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room emaciated with a pale set face but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected to find her. When he appeared at the door she grew flurried evidently undecided whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up.Pierre hastened to her. He thought she would give him her hand as usual but she stepping up to him stopped breathing heavily her arms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing but with quite a different expression of face.l reason straight from the genius annotations.,musicalmash,d4zlupq,1,t5_3ansr

How does he know what Im thinking? How does he know what Im fighting in life? How does he know It?And he just does.From the documentary Shoot Me,musicalmash,d88zeu7,1,t5_3ansr
9421969,0,t1_d9a7xhr,Yeah I would have agreed with Ramin if I saw him do it. I feel like at this point Wicked producers can afford a consistent alternate and not just the standby. But at the beginning probably not. Im guessing Elphaba is the hardest in the West End as well. Christine would be a hard sing if the hard parts werent recorded...And yes it was carbonated. And it came with a tiny straw attached to the can. And it was named after Sofia Coppola Francis Ford Coppola has a winery... so I toasted to her Godfather  death scene which was a performance that deserved wine in a can.,musicalmash,d9aaskh,1,t5_3ansr
9916219,0,t3_5heskn,hi I just wanted to tell you that Im in college I had kind of a rough semester and this podcast is part of my happy place!Also I understood the part of the cast recording you were arguing about with nowt but thats probably because my dad is from Ireland and I read a lot of books from the UK when I was younger.Would you mind if I ask you a serious question? I know Tommy is a teacher. What kind of a teacher are you and do you have any advice for this education majorwho wants to teach high school English and maybe a theater class someday?,musicalmash,db03vtv,1,t5_3ansr
