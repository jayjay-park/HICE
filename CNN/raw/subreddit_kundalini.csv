47213,0,t1_ceirh91,The basic approach is pretty simple persistence. Dont stop meditating.Progress does not occur at a constant rate but I can look back and see that Ive come a long way since I started  clearing out emotionally painful emotionally crippling blocks overcoming certain psychological issues evolving certain emotional qualities and personality strengths. Developing healthier emotional reflexes and ingrained stress management reflexes. One learns to combat loneliness or feelings of isolation. One really really actually can tap the love the pervades the universe and banish loneliness  with a  success rate Id say.I have learned how to manage my emotional life for the most part. Anger depression fear anxiety  I did kind of get a handle on those things and if they rear their heads I can sort them out without incident.Human beings being what we are certain chakras tend to dominate  the st nd rd and th  the will to live sexuality greedacquisitivenessassertiveness refinement of the emotions  all the familiar topics. I remember a lengthy period when every time I sat down to meditate part way in I could feel my crown chakra expanding.  That went on for the longest time. Not so much these days. I couldnt tell you why.Then there were those months when I had visions of the Buddhas  in gold. One very nice thing is being able to clear up issues in advance energetically through meditation. Its just something that happens in meditation. If one meditates events go easier at work issues are resolved by themselves jerks dont get their way etc. Theres a lot more positive synchronicity and very lucky coincidences. You somehow always manage to avoid making really dumb decisions. You learn to follow your hunches more successfully.Ive had my fair share of flashy experiences. Sometimes they recur. Some of the flashy experiences evolve into abilities or meditation skills  things you can rely upon. They sometimes seem to develop into the ability to tap into certain beautiful healing higher energies more or less at will. Some turn out to be distractions.My experience has been that kundalini develops naturally and plays an increasingly active and noticeable role as the years pass. I would really be careful about forcing kundalini. Really careful.Waxing metaphysical here your evolution through meditation is under the guidance of your Higher Self. Your Higher Self knows when youre ready for that big step  the blast of energy that knocks your socks off. And it knows when that energy would do more harm than good.  It knows when a block is ready to go and when its best to let sleeping dogs lie. Even when something is right and ready and supposed to happen dealing with it can be a real challenge. For example it can take a while to cleanse certain blocks and release certain energetic knots and even though you know something good is happening it can get kind of rough. You can feel that craziness banging around trying to take over your mind and your behavior while you slowly get a handle on it or it slowly evaporates.So I let my higher self navigate and control the throttle.If you take it upon yourself to force something in meditation you really are taking your chances.But I go back to my original idea. Persistence is they key and even after decades of meditation you have to exercise discipline and will power to keep at it.Its nice to have companions on the journey but in the end its all you or um All You. ,kundalini,cejt0ia,5,t5_2rezq
345479,0,t3_1xzhrd,Thanks for your indepth edit uMenciusAxe.Its good that you ruled out a medical issue.  gtI havent experienced any of the from what Ive read typical kundalini feelings in my spine. The sensations I feel are located mostly in my abdomen solar plexus chest and head.  Thats fine! Im not sure you know that Qi Gong and Kundalini basically use the same energy in a different manner. Due to differing belief structures the energy flows can be or ARE different. They sortof follow the believed pattern if that makes sense. What you describe sounds more like a Qi Gong form of flow Qi Gong has probably even more diversity than Kundalini has. which is why I dont use more decisive language than may. I am not at all deeply connected to Qi Gong. Just familar enough.  gtReading a book by Thich Nhat Hanh I experienced a breakthrough which has allowed me to become much more proactive in my situation and I feel much more in control and confident now. I physically felt things dissolve within me and the removal of a giant pressure from my shoulders.  Nice. An antitrauma.    These dissolving of tensions can free you to move forward in new ways and release a lot of energy. Dropping the fear aspects is usually a big help no matter the tradition. If another anxietyattacklike event happens again and fear arises acknowledge it say something like Hiya Pal and keep your breathing and focus as youve learned. Perhaps go straight into some grounding Taiji movements.  If you do this note that the sensations of the experience could grow. Welcome it without fear.  Has Qi Gong informed you at all on the morals or ethics on the use of the energy practice? Remember that some moral structures exist within the Chinese culture which are hidden and automatic to them. You and I from other lands can have different structures. If you are curious have a look through Google and Wikipedia on the Yamas and Niyams for equivalents pertinent to Kundalini. Those should also be transferable IMHO to your practices.  I like what uJCashish has suggested about improving the translation quality with your teacher. It holds the teacher accountable as well. If an improved translation fails it may become important or perhaps useful to respectfully request a teacher more familiar with English. Still give it some time and patience. I see no reason for worry nor hurry here.   gt Later I noticed that TV computer and phone screens made me feel sick and natural settings or spending time with friendsfamily made me feel well.  Hypersensitivity is a common factor. Light and sounds may remain hightened a bit but your sensitivity to screans may ease up though youll probably come to dislike violence.  Lastly I would suggest you seek your teachers wisdom about finding a smoother balance between the up and down days.  Thanks for your questions and sharing your story. If things get weird please make yourself welcome to return. Dont hesitate to fill us in on how youre doing. Theres plenty of bad news to fill newspapers. Good news... need more of it.

2444381,0,t1_cmdsavu,Thanks for the reply  I often try to transform it into creative energy but that isnt always possible when Im in situation like watching a movie with others having a family dinner or something like that. hmm... the thing is I feel compassionate to others almost all the time its not that this feeling is missing compassion but it also has this sexual flavor that goes along with it. I dont have a problem when I feel this way towards women. Its probably since were more used to being emotionally intimate with our mothers sisters friends... But when I sense this kind of subtle intimate connection with men I feel like Im doing something wrong... And its not just like im sexually attracted in a way that I want to have sex with someone kind of way its more like a feeling of intimacy. And its definitely always with people who are more spiritually mature... if that makes sense...,kundalini,cmdtvz9,2,t5_2rezq
2773470,0,t1_cnj49k6,gtFirst of all sorry I answer now Ive been really busy and also didnt feel ready to answer.  No need for apologies. Ive been busy too. You reply when you do. Some get busy and come back a month or more later. Some disappear. It is what it is. Not ready is not ready.  Ahlsoe noe neeed to worrry about uddaire languages. I am halfFrench.  gtI think it was because of the selflove it channelled towards me. To accept my mistakes to feel safe to know I am fine.  Waves of selflove rock our boats and shed light on all those places we dont yet love or accept ourselves. Remember something fun about mistakes We learn from them. In fact to a degree you will learn more from making or having made mistakes than in having kept safe and avoided all mistakes. Richard Bach in his book Illusions used the phrase We seek problems because we need their gifts. With Kundalini a certain selfdiscipline selfknowledge and a deep respect for others is needed to avoid making big mistakes with energy as that results in freight trains of karma. Making your mistakes beforehand is a great preparation towards Kundalini.  gtAlso the fact that you could speak to me with so much love but it didnt get cheesy  I never cared for the fluffy or cheezy form of spirituality. Its not very compatible with Kundalini and my training included lessons about it.  gtI felt the same edge in a few sentences that I felt while I was meditating. A cheeky twist that makes the numb feelings more real. Im not sure if it makes sense to you.  I think so especially the edge. Your numbness is there for a reason and that reason will not be there forever. You will grow past the need for numbness. Can you imagine how you might be without it vulnerable yet safe.  gtI could think of two things. Both of them is about balance and somehow blending and taking that energy from the throat chakra. One of my ideas is to try to enhance energy to all chakras. Bingo  you got it on the first try.  gtThe other one is to change the direction of the exercies that I did so Id inhale through throat and exhale through the solar chakra.  You can try that so long as only Prana is flowing downwards. With Kundalini you want an upward flow. Period.  gtInterestingly my first thought was to exhale through the crown chakra. I felt it would give me some balance then yesterday I realized because I live like a hermit and exeggarated my spiritual needs I didnt care about my body or my root at all. For years now Ive been feeling myself as I am in a dream not connected to the earth at all. Id see strengthening root chakra as a possible solution as well. Although these are only speculations of mine.  Im about ready Next few days to post another method of grounding which for people like you who sense and flow energy at will is really easy and almost always supereffective and quick.  Your idea about strengthening root chakra is a good one though its my feeling that youll have greater success through physicallyoriented methods like Hatha Yoga dance or walking in the woods than just using mindmethods. Try it and see.  gtI felt it so intense only at that time but I could feel it again a few times when I laid down and concentrated. What I feel though everyday and I dont meditate when this happens is like a massive bubbling ball of energy that gives me something similar to an adrenalin shot but it doesnt really help me concentrate if you know what I mean.  Yes hence the need for better grounding skills. Also when you stop overcharging your throat cakra some of that might calm down. Try and see.  gtAlthough I begin to feel it helps me to concentrate on what I find important. What I cant be one with cant let close to me just goes away more easily. Also until this time when I was so involved into spirituality and occult I felt really sick physically and mentally. Now I dont it feels like a normal everyday thing in my life like it builded in. I also discovered nowdays that that my biggest fear involving what career should I choose is pointless because all of the ways I was thinking of are the same and will lead me to the same point.  Super. Yes for some careers will be important. For others its wont be. They know they are not their careers not their salary and will adapt to the possibly smaller salaries that their nonambition results in. Enlightened or not you still need to eat need a roof over your head and heat in my part of the world and in our world that means contribuing by working.   gtThe only thing important is to be calm and keep my light. Maybe it exaggerates me and my motives. Im not even sure it is so weird. These are all just my feelings I know this experience doesnt seem to be consistent at all. Maybe it doesnt have to be.  Theres a lot of wisdom in not knowing and also in knowing that you dont know. gtI think Ive read about it so it wasnt a memory but who knows. Ive always been interested in spiritualism but we didnt have internet until I was  so I only read books I found in the library about the paranormal. After that I found numerology and meditation this is how it all began.  We all have our curiosities our beginnings. One isnt better than another. Some are indeed more conducive more compatible with Kundalini as yours is.  gtIm reading that page now and I had a few questions in mind but I dont want to do it in this comment because it is not the place. Anyway Im really interested in how this guy gets his information what is behind his perspective. Maybe Ill find my answers because I really havent read that much yet.  You can ask about it in another thread or in PM. I prefer people ask in the sub so that ideas can be shared. gtThere is a caution to believing in an evolutionary process as it comes with the obvious pitfalls. English is my second language and Im not sure what did you ask here so can you help me?  Yes. Its important to not think that being an old soul is better nor superior to being a baby soul. Some one in the nd grade is not inferior to someone in their last year of University. They are not comparable nor inferiorsuperior. They are at a different step in ther own development. Got it?gtWhat now? Great question.  Im cruel that way  I like to make you think!!  gtYou see in an article I read about methods to keep this energy down and in balance like eating meet sitting in the nature etc. While I want to keep this thing in its place I dont want to eat meat this is subjective I know You respect your own beliefs and wishes and adapt accordingly then. No one will force you to eat meat. There are many other ways. Also the idea is grounding and balance not numbing right?  gt...or numb myself again. This whole experience made me way too sensitive about the things I did before  Consider the added sensitivity as an enhanced way to sense what is good or not good for you compatible and not compatible with who you are and wo you wish to be. The sensitivity is a tool and not intended as a curse as some people conclude.  gtand also showed me my hidden principles.  My Principals sat in this big office at the center of the school. Oh WAIT!!  gtWhat I know is I dont want to turn back now but I also dont want to make this a matter of my ego or prestige or burn out because I have to know my boundaries.  Then learning to be aware of your energy levels going up and down and adapting to those with more or less rest more or less activity will be important. A proiority really. Its one of those Know Thyself foundation items. Learn how to say NO or this is more than I canwant to handle right now.  gtWhat I am mostly afraid of is a weird feeling that I wont be able to keep up with all of this Im going to go insane  Of all the people who have come here in the past year you are not insanityprone. gtand this whole change is going to consume me.  Poeticallyspeaking it may consume you but something still emerges like a Pheonix. gtI want to be patient and not fly away but improve at the same time. Balance as youve written.  Patience is good. Flying away temporarilly is fine to rest or recouperate. Permanently is always an option if you need it. Its your life. People who do Kundalini grow. People who dont do Kundalini grow. Its a question of rateofchange. Speed. With decent balance that change occurs reasonably smoothly.   gtBecause I also want to help others to improve but without finding my place and my balance between Earth and Air it wont be possible I think.  Youll find that balance. Its just a matter of time a little effort a little noneffort some unlearning living. Youll do it. You have what it takes. Also you can explore the idea of finding a teacher of your own choosing. That makes a huge difference. In time youll be ready to help others.    gtMy sankalpas usually involved letting go things and also being clean emotionally mostly and safe.  Good. I was wondering if they may have destabilised you based on what you were seeking. This looks fine and is not a cause of your complaints unless you are clinging as you try to let go. Being clean emotionally implies a cleaning out of past negativity and past emotions. That will rock you a bit but less I feel than your focus on the throat Chakra.  gtThank you again for your comment time and energy! Im really grateful for everything you gave to me. I actually began to feel bad that I talk so much about myself my experience my my. I know that was the point but still I hope I can give you something new or helpful by any of my words.  Youre welcome again. If we want to help YOU it does us no good to talk about someone else. We can call you Fred if it makes you feel any better.

2840663,0,t3_2slklm,Part  An example that proves to me and to those observing  some abilities arent imagined or invalid. Imagine a textonly conversation in a public cyberspace answering peoples questions psychically. This one involves only one person but the space is public and one or two dozen other people can see the text.      Marc Hi Joanneinau youre next.    Joanneinau Hi Marc. No audio. Please text.    Marc Hi Joanne. Ok. Whats your real first name?     Joanneinau Mary    Marc Hi Mary. You live in the NorthWest corner of     Australia in a small town pop of  to  depending    on the season about    kms or miles from the coast.     Your boss is your boyfriend whom you live with and the     relationship is dying. You are losing him your job and     living space. Is this your situation?    Joanneinau Yes.    Marc And you want to know what comes next?    Joanneinau Yes please.    Marc Two or three towns to the South with roads leading     in  main directions youll find similiar work for a man     named Tom. A living space will be available. You can     find a boyfriend after. Im not worried about that.    Joanneinau I know a Tom in a town to the South.    Marc You know more than one Tom. Its not the one you     think it is nor the second but this Tom lives South of the     first one you thought of and already knows your work     reputation. Hell offer you a job without a resume. You    only have to show up. Hope that helps.      Joanneinau Yes thank you. Almost word for word a reading I did  or so years ago online. Ive done thousands like it. The basis of telling her where she lives and under what circumstances is a test that Im connecting to the right Australian female named Mary. Id already sensed that Joanne wasnt her name. Ive changed the names.  Its the internet  it could actually have been someone named Fred so I had to ask!. If I get the details correct about her past and present likely what I connect to regarding her future will also be correct. Its a simple and reliable test. That doesnt mean its perfect. She could make other choices  just that those are most likely. If the test fails I tell her Im not connecting to her try again or pass her on to someone else.  When you can connect psychically well and reliably several thousand times you drop the doubts and face the basic fact that people can connect to others and help them relax their doubts and fears. It becomes easy. It isnt at first. My first several distant readings felt like cramming a three hour math exam and a three hour physics exam into a few minutes laserlike. Blazing concentration and enough energy to affect the weather.  I was psychic as a young kid. Lots of high quality training and practice and perhaps a helping hand from Kundalini have made it a reliable tool. This is a human ability though. We all do it to some degree or another the Latin and Asian cultures having it as more dominant parts of their social fabric. Many Westerners pretend they dont have any ability. They discount the times they do KNOW as luck or coincidence when it was neither.   So heres the odd conclusion unthinking people come to That psychics must therefore know everything about everyone. Im not sure if these people have ever counted past their ten fingers and ten toes but  person takes a significant focus and effort to connect to reliably.  billion people is way beyond reason and those making such conclusions are being daft.  People have a right to their belief systems including that Siddhis are not real that connecting to people is unreal that Kundalini is a figment of peoples imagination etc. They are welcome to discuss such things in other subs. I wont interfere.   To people experiencing such things though their beliefs will need to adapt to the reality they are living or psychosis occurs and they risk losing their marbles. The good thing about marbles is they can always be refound.  I hope that helps you understand a little or a lot.  Disclosure My teacher was once rated th most accurate predictor in the world.

I just recently started becoming more interested in spiritual things and I thought  hey why not AP? I mean it seems easy and I can practice it EVERY night... but besides that I wanted to connect with a higher being of myself or maybe even a spiritual guide?Also consider learning some more formal meditation methods and laying off the drugs.  what are some formal meditation methods you would recommend ? and all drugs even alchohol? what about DMT cause I hear dmt is a drug where you can connect with your inner self.Whats wrong Im wondering with wanting to be friends with friendly extraterrestrials or aliens? There is nothing wrong with that I would very much like that to happen I was just so foolish with wanting to meet extraterrestrial life.PS. Kundalini informs me that I was too soft on you. Yikes.

4845516,0,t3_3h87sn,There are very few people who refer to anything like Kundalini as a meditation. One of those who teach it in that format or vocabulary spammed reddit in a really bad way and got banned by reddits spam bots unfortunately.  Kundalini is an allknowing intelligent energy whose main role is our evolution on all levels. Working with it harmoniously requires a simple or complex if you prefer system to work with it well. One could refer to that system as a meditation but it isnt that really at least not in my experience. Thats not to say that it cant be. People like to adapt and adjust things.  Osho had a Dynamic meditation on CD involving Kundalini. It was in actuality just a format of dynamic movement meditation good for releasing tensions in the body  something thats always good for Kundalini. The method itself doesnt affect Kundalini in a significant way unless you are in a group working with energy and are being affected by others.  YouTube is full of Kundalini Meditations. Not many of them are legit in any real nor effective way but as is especially true in spirituality YMMV. The K topic is popular right now and the word draws clicks. For some clicks equals cash. My RGO on the legit versus non legit ones using the terminology of Kundalini Meditation is barely  and I think I may be being generous. The roblem with that is it confuses distracts. If people have legit interests in Kundalini this slows their progress which is an obstacle and a test to overcome.     Here in the sub we encourage people to explore with an open yet questioning mind. You would never successfully advance in Kundalini practices without an open mind. That becomes a prerequisite. You would not benefit from being so open as to swallow everything. Only garbage cans take in all that they are offered.  A few people out there teaching Kundalini Meditations are indeed legit. The key is to use your common sense and discernment to figure out which ones are which and why. Discernment is something you have to learn for yourself usually the hard way by being fooled a couple of times.  Kundalini Yoga itself doesnt mean just one thing. There are a bunch of spiritual cultures that I like to refer as systems because they are methods or perspectives to work effectively with Kundalini. The form of Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan is one. There are various Tantric systems of Kundalini Yoga. There is the Kriya yoga system. There is the Sahaja system. There are Shaivite or Shivite systems. Advanced Yoga Practices deals with Kundalini but it isnt their main focus  overall development of the person is  a good wisdom there.  There are another dozen main and perhaps two dozen lessor known methods that come mostly out of India and the Himalayas. But India and the Himalayas dont own Kundalini. It belongs to all beings.  Some Native and Indigenous peoples all over the word had systems for working with Kundalini without using that name of course. It was not and is not a universal practice. Only a few tribes worked with it significantly. Some of the esoteric or mystical elements of major religions teach their own systems which tend to be far les spopular and routinely frowned upon by the mainstream. Example the Sufis. Some Hindu systems work with Kundalini. Most do not.  It is important here to recognise the word YOGA together with Kundalini as not referring only to Hatha yoga of doing postures which is the common usage of the word Yoga in the Americas and maybe Europe. It is of using the word yoga to mean Union union with Creation Creator allthatis etc. Any and all methods that accomplish or advance that union are considered Yogas in the languages of where the word Yoga comes from. I forget if it was originally a Sanskrit word or Hindi. Wikipedia will have the answer if you are curious.    I hope within the various explanations that you grasp what you need and also see that the two uses meditation versus yoga are quite different. Ultimately among those which are legit the various methods reach towards the same ends.  Good question thanks for asking it.    ,kundalini,cu5basx,6,t5_2rezq

5390645,0,t3_3olw1d,HiIn the same vein as you what with my meditation practice actually having my grades suffer this past month because of dark night like periods. I love Kundalini Yoga and whats great about it is you can do short kriyas at home without going to an instructor that are very effective. Especially if you do a Sadhana which is a committed daily practice people do with the goal usually being forty days. Im actually about to start day one today of  Tapa Yog Karam Kriya which is to stop procrastination. Food for thought for you if procrastinating is one of your struggles. ,kundalini,cw0prmm,1,t5_2rezq

They appear to me to be addressing the unique characteristic needs of the contemporary American demographic or if we are talking about health care practitioners to their particular client base.I know that some spiritual groups like to think of their teachings as universal applying to all people in all times and places. I dont think they are correct to be making such claims.I guess basically Im saying that what is going on here is probably not exactly what the Zen Buddhists are talking about.

I went through it at  with no knowledge of anything kundalini it came out of nowhere and it was hell for a loooooong time because I was so young and ignorant to it. If you want to continue please find a guide or teacher first or something.

7254940,0,t1_d22f2cq,Good that resolves one possible which ends up pointing more clearly to spirits.  Spirits cannot hurt you.  They can annoy you. If you are afraid of them then they can use that fear against you  but thats always true in life.  If your cat does its alerting thing tell the spirits to leave. Do it with conviction and authority. Its your space not theirs.  Theres no reason that it needs to be disturbing. It can be considered weird or unusual yes. Thats less scary than disturbing.  Ping pong balls is about an accurate size for a little spirit ball. They do not usually present with a human form as that takes too much energy or skill to do.  Their presence disturbs the cat which disturbs you. Tell them where to go and I suggest not being nice about it. Be a bit forceful. As a stepping stone experience for you its much better that you be mad at them and express that anger than to shrivel in fear. Later having succeeded you can drop the fear of this as it is unneeded and serves you no constructive purpose. Keep those fears that are constructive  that help you avoid body damage mainly.  The white light protection is particular good at keeping them out especially out of your immediate space. Give it a try. You will be absolutely safe doing it. Its design to protect or isolate not harm  so you can have peace and calm within your bodymindspirit when you are sensitive to outside influences. It keeps others negativity from affecting you so much and keeps your negativity from affecting others. Simple.      Onto our other conversation.   ,kundalini,d22u2es,1,t5_2rezq
7368957,0,t3_4g93qp,Hi uWiz welcome to rKundalini.  What follows is pretty much completely separate from Kundalini with the exception that strong pressure can provoke or move Kundalini in beginners or prebeginners. Your post history and OP dont reveal anything Krelated.   gtIs refraining from ejaculation the the best way to be comfortable throughout the kundalini awakening process?  No not usually. For you possibly. This is not common and thats why many answers are not universal.  For most people ejaculation will dump Prana. They end up with less Prana temporarily until they eat sleep or reaccumulate some.  A lack of energy makes the body nervous. For most people in that situation adding energy to the Hara center Belly will calm the body and mind easily.  Usually what happens in our oversexualised world is that people get too much energy flowing around with pressure. Dropping the Pranic excess and pressure becomes their method of backing away from the progress the pressure pushes against from being too energised. An alternative is for them to become better at grounding at staying calm. Meditation in formal ways and grounding methods work well for most. Check the subs WIKI for methods and ideas.  gtHowever whenever I ejaculate I feel ungrounded and feel discomfort for a couple of days with feelings of fear and anxiety followed by some bliss right after. More energy seems to move around my body and I feel some disconnect from reality.  In your case you are likely dropping energy levels too low where the body gets worried it wont have enough to keep functioning properly. Worry fear and agitation are the natural and normal result.  I often speak about seeking the middle in balance. This is yet another example of whats involved in balance.  Many other possibilities could additionally be going on re your discomfort including things like sexual shame selfjudgments regarding sexual tastes or gender orientation reaching out energetically or psychically too strongly to another person Which can involve a psychic rape with its associated karma relationship frustrations etc. We have no clear idea on your specific age and many things get outgrown as we become adults. Sometimes the outgrowing is quick sometimes slow.     In our modern society there are many valid reasons to find a balance between enough masturbation yet not too much. Porn addiction to sensual pleasure and running away from growth are separate yet related things.    gtIf I stay celibate then I feel pretty grounded and balanced just some discomfort when the energy is trying to clear my chakras.  Lovers will usually be sharing energy with each other with a common imbalance towards the woman. Some of that is part of the dynamic to gift some energy to the intended baby but babies are not always intended. This is where couples can spend time learning to share of their energies with each other in a balanced way. Not all couples will succeed.   Relationships can urge us forward and poke fun at our falsebeliefs even mock them! Giving up those false beliefs and incomplete perceptions involves some choice and willingness. Most people fear this letting go based on yet another false belief that theyll not be who they are if they change their belief set. Ridiculous. Are these people implying that they have the same beliefs they did when they were leaning two plus two? At what age or point did evolving become something to avoid?     Many further potential aspects of what you are dealing with lie on the fringes of what you have and have not said such as the word celibate.  Being celibate in moderation is fine yet how are you IN relationship. When you are sexual are you respectful and is the connection meaningful or are you treating the other as a mere tool to ejaculate? Sometimes even just a cheap meaningless connection plays a role of discovery in ones life but if thats ALL you ever do then there are other issues to work on and they have little to do with Prana nor Kundalini. Im not implying anything here. Many may read this and have similar problems that go beyond the obvious.  As Richard Bach once said in a book of his We seek Problems because we need their gifts.Note that I said celibacy in moderation is fine. If everyone were celibate how long do you think the human race would last?  Remember one very important thing Others will reflect back to us aspects of ourselves where we dont yet like or accept ourselves or find sizeable imperfections that weve not yet found the gumption to do something about it. That itself can provoke plenty of discomfort.  The other thing thats possible is that you are working with energy in yourself in completely wrong or nonconstructive ways and that life itself brings to the surface those imbalances as discomfort.  So you can now see that your question isnt a simple one with one handy universal answer.    As someone pointed out a couplefew months back there is a LOT of poor quality information on Chakras out there and most of them will not be very useful nor compatible with the serious demands of Kundalini. There are so many examples of the blind copying the blind leading the blind. Not a great way forward!    I hope this helps you better understand your situation.  I am intuiting an urge to offer a suggestion to drop other habits. Understand?  Good journey.  Oh! And youre welcome.  EDIT By the way its not Kundalini symptoms unless youre doing things wrong and suffering through it rather than growing and evolving in an harmonious way. It should be Kundalini Signs. !!!! Education. Basics in word choices can be so important.  Youve made no mention of a teacher. Please do consider it especially after saying symptoms that imply some suffering and imbalances.   ,kundalini,d2fssdt,5,t5_2rezq

Or rather how spiritually aware  responsible do you have to be to attend classes? I was going to attend a Kundalini yoga class today just because the studio i go to offers it and it was a convenient time for me but I googled it before the class and read about how one should be prepared for kundalini  etc and decided not to attend it. My studio  offers many different forms of yoga and they make it sound like any other style of yoga saying it helps with weight control insomnia creativity etc and they welcome beginners... but if one has to be more responsible when practicing kundalini and because it is so sacred then i feel like theyre advertising it for the wrong reasons! ,kundalini,d65219n,1,t5_2rezq

10787653,0,t1_ddsm5vh,Personally I practice the techniques taught by SelfRealization Fellowship. I can attest that they are very effective and come from a very reputable lineage. However if you want to start with something simple doing symmetrical breathing is a wonderful start. Basically the idea is to breath in hold and breath out all for the same slow duration. You can start with a low count and go longer as your breath calms more. The important part is to keep all  parts of breath the same comfortable duration. Practice this for as long as you like  min or longer and then just sit quietly feeling the effects on your body and mind. It  should quiet your breath as your blood is filled with oxygen which will also start to quiet your mind and thoughts. With continued practice in calming body and mind you will start to become more in tune with your energy and learn how to interact with it.Edit and as far as doing something too intense goes listen to your feelings. Your body will tell you if something isnt right. I learned the hard way that its important to listen to the feedback your bodymindintuition is giving you and not try to just push harder because you think its the right thing to do. If you are listening to your body and respect the signals it gives you you will be able to know if something isnt right for you. ,kundalini,ddso350,1,t5_2rezq
