6178113,0,t3_3syzrm,Awesome!  Ive been looking for a community like yours to share our videos. We genuinely want to share them with people that are looking for videos that little ones will like with a bit of humor for the parents too. Our  year old loves watching other videos but there are some out there that are a bit inappropriate for little kids. How do I get approved to share our channel on this community? Here are a couple of links to our videos so you can get a sample of what we do.  Thanks for your consideration. ,KidSafeVideos,cyrvy8p,1,t5_2sbls
