3468973,0,t1_cpnlidv,Mmm yeah. I think I overlooked that detail in the manga but its definitely true. Even with just garlic sauteing and browning the garlic first gives it a slightly bitter spicier flavor than adding the garlic while already simmering which makes it sweeter milder and more tender in comparison.

So while Soma did tell Erina that in the beginning I think shes more of a goal to reach in cooking whereas Megumi is the one whos helping Soma to learn more and who he wants to help learn.

Would be interesting if Soma was challenged to a sous vide Shokugeki because even though its a theoretically cool technique when demonstrated is pretty much putting food in bags and bags in water would want to see twists given in the manga.,ShokugekiNoSoma,ctlqacu,2,t5_322v3

5029190,0,t3_3jsj0c,Everyone here is saying that Azami is gonna clash with Soma but I think its too soon to tell. After all Azami was bashing the people in Erinas restaurant because they thought that just because a dish uses expensive ingredients means it is gourmet. His philosophy is to serve those who can truly appreciate a dish not the masses who only have a superficial understanding. He may very likely agree with Somas style of using ordinary ingredients to make amazing dishes. Furthermore if you remember the end of chapter  Soma says they meet a chef who will change his life. He seems to hold Azami in high regard.That being said I can see where Azami will butt heads with Soma. Soma cooks for the masses which Azami frowns upon. Also Azamis definition of gourmet can be left to interpretation. Somas cooking may very well be fodder. Well have to see what Azami thinks. Lastly with the way that everyone sees him along with what Hisako was told it seems that Azami did something very very bad. I cant help but think that his expulsion from the Nakiri family and the removal of his name from the Tootsuki records has something to do with Jouichiro leaving the academy.,ShokugekiNoSoma,cus7jhp,12,t5_322v3

Actually it was Joichiro who made Senzaimon consider taking in Souma to get him laid with Erina. If Joichiro comes to the academy even Asano will be afraid of going against him.

Thats why I believe that nothing romance related will happen in the near future aside for some feelings developping on the Nakiriside. I dont know wheter there has been any information on this yet but I have no idea how long this manga is supposed to last.

And so Soma travels around the world etc only to be challenged at one point by this first year like maybe a couple of years later. Sorta a next generation kind of thing .

Its true that each of them will get at least one vote and Ryu will win as per plot after suspense and drama. According to me Kusunokis strength is low temperature cooking which retains the fresh mellow texture of Salmon and Ryus strength is the flavor of the dish. Personally I would prefer flavor over texture. Most probably this is the fundamental difference the old judge was talking about.Apart from that I like this chapter because both of them have got similar kind of flexible attitude.,ShokugekiNoSoma,d0nrk3e,1,t5_322v3
6833119,0,t1_d0nke95,the thing is its not raw salmon. It just looks closer to raw than when using conventional methods because it wasnt subject to excessive heating. Atleast thats how i understood it. The flesh however is fully tenderized as it reaches the same internal temperature as if its cooked at higher temperatures. It just takes longer. The only real downside to it would be that you dont get anything similar to a brown crust which is solved by salamanderbacon and the flesh doesnt emit alot of fat and juices if you want to make gravy.If you want some real pictures i recommend using google.,ShokugekiNoSoma,d0qu2kp,1,t5_322v3

7250197,0,t1_d21ucbz,I prefer Totsuki the way it was introduced in the beginning. I understand your issues with it but for the sake of story telling it is basically the perfect setting for a Chef. Its not supposed to be and never has been a school for normal people. As Senzaemon said it is a place for the  to polish the . Whether you call that a flaw in the system doesnt really matter because thats all Totsuki Academy is. Azami is changing the purity of what Totsuki stands for fundamentally. He is creating another school entirely. It would be like going to University to be a Doctor but at the end they hand you a bachelors degree.Another thing Id like to touch on is the creativity bit. I can see what you mean about reproducing a set of existing dishes. But there has to be a beginning to that process. If you blatantly claim you graduated from Totsuki people will be expecting a certain degree of originality. You are expected to be a standalone Chef who is capable of creating excellent dishes. Totsuki was built to prepare the students for anything they might encounter in the real world. We see this in the many trials the students are put through such as gathering ingredients from the surrounding area to producing a catering type buffet in the exams. If they cant stand along side their peers they will simply be stepping stones for the talented. That doesnt mean they cant be Chefs it just means they cant be Totsuki certified Chefs.TLDRIn the end whether or not Azamis changes are intended to benefit the students or himself doesnt really matter to me. I personally think that any changes in the way the students are managed at this point is to the detriment of the students. Because they knew what they were getting into when they applied. It muddies the water and changes the very foundations to the school itself. Azami is basically creating a new school.Thanks for reading my personal thoughts on the matter.

Hopefully we arent being blinded by shipping goggles and that this would be the SnS teams way of proving to Shounen Jump executives that yes you can have romance in a primarily shounen action series.

Also their personalities dont seem to be that far away from each other.Also this is more something for the crack side probably but I noticed something about Nene. There are about  rather important characters in SnS that wear glasses if I remember correctly maybe I am also forgetting someone that would be Jun Shinomiya Nene Eizan and Marui and Hisako if you count her in But out of all of these Nene and Marui are actually the only ones with those round Harry Potter Glasses while the others have rather squared glasses. But aside form that Nene surely seems to be a bit like Hisako. Also Dark!Megumi seems to make more and more sense to me.

11193136,0,t1_dezot82,Okay this is the last reply. I dont want to continue pointless jabber. If you didnt mean me personally why did you bother replying to my post in the first place? You could have made a post on your own in this thread since your reply was a majority of your own opinions.I actually enjoyed Erinas development sorry to break it to you. You may think you have an understanding of me but you probably dont. I hardly share my opinions on reddit except my love for Megumi.I think you should stop comparing another persons character development to other characters. What you should be looking at is how they were from the first day to how much theyve grown to their current self. Quality Seriously what was the point of this reply? If you agree with me just say it. I dont need the entire manga written down for me. ,ShokugekiNoSoma,df0q8v5,2,t5_322v3

11343991,0,t3_61we8p,Hi there. Remember me? Some of you may and some of you may not. Im mostly known as the author of Nisegami a story thats currently dozing in its slumber. I was sort of well known at least I think so about half a year ago for my weeklybiweekly updates on said sleepy story. This post has nothing to do with Nisegami. The writing bug just got me again and so I decided to spit out a little add on to another story Id previously posted here What do you Want. My little add on became a monstrously long chapter that s deeply explores Somas feelings for Erina along with a fairly long backstory that showcases just how our chaste redhead got to the point we see him at in chapter .Hope you guys enjoy! ,ShokugekiNoSoma,dfhtl2y,11,t5_322v3

11526817,0,t1_dg2g3ec,Theres a big difference between this school is hard to graduate and the administration gave us significantly inferior ingredients for the exam. If Central could truly do whatever they wanted they would have just expelled the rebels on the spot without any explanation. They go through the trouble of giving them an unfair test because they cant just do that. And Im not so sure about Central only targeting restaurants. Azami looked down on the curry sisters.
