5411438,0,t3_3ofhva,So I have looked all around different threads this post and numerous videos and I still cant figure out how to use the match settings option in any of these different tables. For use address behind the arrow the address just says Pgt and the address never changes no matter which match I play because I have completed some games already and tried over and over. I am still in my rookie year do I need to wait til after that season is over? I know it must be frustrating trying to answer everyone else and everyone else perhaps not getting their answers that they need but if anyone can elaborate or if there is anyone having this issue help me out. Please PM me if you have a solution. Thanks...,gamecheats,cw3dcv4,1,t5_2updy
