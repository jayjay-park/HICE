988149,0,t3_25csjn,The problem with these tests are that they are boring as all hell. I am already RETYPING my entire resume after uploading the original document in almost every case. Then theres the  question psych test they always give THEN they make me play some stupid testing game with mandatory video and audio? I cant help but feel like these tests wont really weed anyone out except the people who get bored of the tests and just click through to get done faster.They may have big data backing them up but that doesnt mean they will matter when slapped on people who already loathe the entire process they are in. I miss the days when you could just walk in and hand your resume to somebody and have an interview. Now you have to get past a battery of tests and bullshit just to get a job paying . an hour. I swear its a wonder anybody wants to be employed at all they make getting jobs harder than performing at the job in almost every case and they still end up hiring fuckups half the time.,BusinessHub,chglyz4,2,t5_2xriv
