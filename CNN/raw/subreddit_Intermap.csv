6151077,0,t1_cyoqhi6,Exactly so far on all fronts.. I was going to write a response incorporating all of these issues.. Vertex has sat at . for a long period of time now and a large portion of that time at . was when the price was ..share.. that was their chance to get a nice discount on a takeover bid if they so wished. If they sought or seek dilution from here by law since they have a max toe hold this would likely have to be done through a SPO since they cant do a bought deal. Any offer to buy from here would need to be offered to every holder in the equity class. In this case just to entertain the idea they would need to find a control block of over  at least  other shareholders who are willing to sell their shares privately... but I have a very hard time believing that could be done at these prices. And really Vertex is a  holder which means theyd need to sway  to sell privately to them. I might be a little out of my depth here but I can easily see this getting very ugly for everyone involved including the deal itself.Anyways lets get back to your example. Intermap would end up with M shares out of a total M outstanding. M would be issued to them .share for  of the company. Now ask yourself what the markets reaction to this would be? We know this is not possible thanks to the threshold and consequent rules but I for one would be rightly pissed. I think every other shareholder would be as well. And maybe that leads to the board having to step in. What happens to management in all of this? Can Vertex run Intermap on their own? No. What happens to the current contract if the company is taken private or there is a change on the board? I bet it gets stalled if not delayed... I highly doubt the prime contractor would be pleased. So then what? Vertex loses everything. Regardless Id say any dilution will cripple the share price of new shares as well will cripple future share price afterwards contract value split over much larger pool of shares and cause more undo pressure on management. I dont see any reward.As Nokona said theyve taken their pound of flesh again if they attempt to take any more here then they are killing the baby by killing the mother if such a metaphor works.EDIT By the way I am unaware of a time constraint on the  didnt know there was one can someone verify?,Intermap,cyotagz,1,t5_3bn6w
