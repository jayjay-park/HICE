1593336,0,t3_2cj6jt,It does ensure diversity of fighters but typically how fighting tournaments go is you can pick anyone you want.  Most players have a limited set of characters they play with to counteract their weaknesses against certain other players whom they know prefer character X like DanBirdieRose in Street Fighter Alpha a decent mix of shotokan grappling and poke play respectively.If anything I would propose a double style tournament where the players could vote at sign up which they prefer and then go with the winning selection.,Battlecon,cjg0dpd,1,t5_2xnnq

5076262,0,t3_3jmxd3,I really dont know much about Hikaru.How does he fair against other Flight  characters from War  Devastation  Fate? Does he do ok against everyone down there?It seems like he doesnt have much range making me wonder if I could play a little keep away with Karin.He has a little extra stun guard on Focused and soak on Earth making me wonder how he deals with Shekhtur. Maybe ok? Also he has a corner cross which is important for facing Shekhtur. He is one of a few characters who can actually play priority games Water and Sweeping with her too.,Battlecon,cuxvq46,1,t5_2xnnq

7181270,0,t1_d1uartw,Yeah you get the idea.  The push back and life loss is Camila landing on you and discharging a small explosive on you.  Shes not simply trying to push you back she is literally shoving explosives on you which explode and push you back.,Battlecon,d1ug3td,1,t5_2xnnq

7523041,0,t1_d2xb4c4,I did make the character select tuckboxes. And in my K card cardboard storage box the moment I add  more fighters there just wont be space for the Arenas and Armory and stuff  they fit now precisely in the space where the ten additional fighters of Fate would go. Maybe if I remove the row separators I could gain enough horizontal space to put the arenas box there. As for ordering it... the problem is basically the shipping. Im sure you understand that Im somewhat reluctant to pay  dollars of shipping for a  dollar game and Level s shop actually gives me a surprisingly low shipping estimate for an US page. CoolStuffIncs estumation starts at  and goes from there. I could just go out and buy Argent The Consortium which Im seriously considering for the money Id need to pay for the shipping!,Battlecon,d2xbzjo,2,t5_2xnnq
7563212,0,t3_4i8zdq,I resent that after Ive bought this giant selfcontained game new tournament standards are being implemented that drastically change the way the game is played.  The worst part is theres no way to play with the updated rules without purchasing another game.,Battlecon,d31wfow,1,t5_2xnnq
8237003,0,t1_d52pqzt,The main reason I dont include Kehrolyn whom I personally like is because newbies often fail to take advantage of her passive UA meaning they either forget and feel like they missed an opportunity or the more experienced player points it out before resolving the attack and they just kind of say oh... okay I do that and feel like they arent in control of their game.,Battlecon,d576izt,1,t5_2xnnq
9206137,0,t1_d8iq8ct,She can hold her own against them pretty well.  Aria is slightly favored against her probably Tanis too but hard to tell for sure.  Quickening is a major problem for Aria though.,Battlecon,d8iy3g9,2,t5_2xnnq
