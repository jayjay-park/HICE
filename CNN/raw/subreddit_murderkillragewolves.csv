Or maybe we just dont get any indication that its been used in our results?Just an FYI in case you didnt see it earlier you may want to think about what youre going to claim. People may be after you today.,murderkillragewolves,cgwa2qc,1,t5_315rc
811297,0,t1_cgwhezz,probably hes waiting to catch people with a fake character claim that doesnt match what he saw when he visited. Given that our character claims have to look town but at the same time match our actual character enough that he wont notice the discrepancy that makes him a very powerful role..,murderkillragewolves,cgwhymw,1,t5_315rc
811459,0,t1_cgwijt5,yeah much as ive griped about the setup for denying us agency at every turn the bulletin board is a great idea that really rewards creative play which i think the games should be all about.,murderkillragewolves,cgwimi3,1,t5_315rc
818971,0,t1_cgx1rgw,Ok good to know but it means there was no post by the real Oracle then?,murderkillragewolves,cgxdb98,1,t5_315rc
940386,0,t3_24vy7u,ok i dont want to be that guy but allow me to be that guy after all Im the brains of this operation which by the way goes to show how fucked we are but there you have it.Are you guys going to prepare an end game strategy and a rock solid fake claim for each of you or are we going to do that thing where were pretty much slomo conceding? You know my position on that I still think that outright conceding is the rational thing to do because unless massive town stupidity happens there arent enough suspicious people left to mislynch and there would be more dignity in that than waiting for the town to pick us out one by one but I respect that you want to fight. Just if youre gonna fight then FIGHT. And if you dont want to which i can understand too then at least own up to it. thats all! Now discuss.,murderkillragewolves,chb6ekr,1,t5_315rc
