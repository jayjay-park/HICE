There was a veteran there that parachuted in but his parachute was caught in a tree and had to wait for rescue.   ddayohio.uswww.ddayohio.us,thelinkfixerbot,d6r3g9v,1,t5_3fpdm
8687600,0,t3_4vo43z,Original Comment by guygtHereimgur.comgalleryGgLV is what bit reduction actually does in general for any audio format. Increasing bitrate increases precision in the audio file as the other responses have pointed out. Whether it sounds better or not is subjective but typically it does tend to sound better or at least closer to the original sound.gtgtmp formatting isnt as straight forward as the difference shown in the link but the concept is the same. What you may be able to hear is that lower bit rate audio will sound distorted higher harmonics are introduced leading to a harsher sound.gtgtThe highest available bitrate for mp format is  kbits .gtgtTheres a lot more to this but I wanted to get as close to an ELI answer as I could. The other responses may be able to shed some more light on this.,thelinkfixerbot,d6rksl6,1,t5_3fpdm

8737075,0,t3_4vo43z,Original Comment by netwreckgtI honestly think that hes reduced the Boogity usage due to the professionalism and what often appears to be competition that Jeff brought into the booth.  Nonetheless I doubt its gone forever as its hard to sell all this Boogity merchandise or support the DWStore BoogityNation Twitterwww.twitter.comBoogityNation account if you dont use that infamous catchphrase anymore.,thelinkfixerbot,d6xs76p,1,t5_3fpdm

8812689,0,t3_4vo43z,Original Comment by EbuVitaeProductionsgtThere is no true holy grail of fonts. Pick what looks best to you. It is important to look professional so dont stick with the default. If you want to find a good font I recommend going to Google Fontsfonts.google.com and sort by serif sans etc. gtgtMy favorite sans serifs are Lato and Oswald and for serif I choose Noto Serif. All of these can be found on Google Fonts and downloaded for free. ,thelinkfixerbot,d775yt0,1,t5_3fpdm
