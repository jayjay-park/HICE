2236032,0,t3_2kres1,Ephesians  ESV  For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing it is the gift of God  not a result of works so that no one may boast. I think this is a bit better wording.Grace is the love and mercy given to us by God because God desires us to have it not because of anything we have done to earn it. When we choose to believe in the Lord Gods grace is what saves us. What it means is that you can be the most helpful charitable person on the planet but if you do not have God then you do not have salvation. Without the Lord you are nothing in the end. This may sound harsh but its the truth. God does not send us to Hell we have sent ourselves there. However God the Father sent Jesus who is God the Son to die for our sins. He took on sin so that we could be saved from it. John  ESV  For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.  For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him.  Whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.  And this is the judgment the light has come into the world and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.  For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light lest his works should be exposed.  But whoever does what is true comes to the light so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.May I ask why you dont believe?,Bible,clo1xi1,6,t5_2qqbz

If so then yes they must have repopulated the earth as they were the only human beings around. If not then no they did not repopulate the earth as no repopulation was necessary.Those Christians who believe the flood is historical and global believe that Noahs family repopulated the earth.,Bible,cpah9d2,3,t5_2qqbz

5082411,0,t1_cuylswq,ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspActually if you look through the Bible any sexual context is presented with minimal detail.  When a man and woman have a child it will always say they conceived or had offspring.  It wont even say something as risque as had intercourse.  It approaches sex in a manner where its meant to convey useful information and avoids focusing ones mind on lustful ideation.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspIf it was for the purposes of harming the mans groin it could have explicitly stated that.  Seeing as it did not I find it reasonable and accurate to assume it meant it to be of a sexual nature.  It does not specify the attacker was wicked and assaults an innocent man so perhaps the attacker could have had reason to physically engage the man.  However this means its possible the attacker could have been wicked.  Seeing as Jehovah will not find it beyond righteousness to take a wicked persons life I dont see how their groin would of such a great value as to be beyond damaging.  Your interpretation would elude that its not acceptable for a woman to save her husband from a wicked man who assaults without cause.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspGenesis ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspAnd Er Judahs firstborn was wicked in the sight of the Lord and the Lord slew him.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp,Bible,cuymgp5,2,t5_2qqbz

6863698,0,t3_48z8e7,For thousands of years we human have always thought that God had a name from the very beginning. We thought that Jehovah was His name from the start. But now that God Himself is working and speaking in the last days He has told us the truth. Only now do we know that God originally had no name. God has only had a name since He began His management plan to save mankind. Exodus   And Moses said to God Behold when I come to the children of Israel and shall say to them The God of your fathers has sent me to you and they shall say to me What is his name? What shall I say to them? ... And God said moreover to Moses Thus shall you say to the children of Israel the LORD God of your fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob has sent me to you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial to all generations. From this passage we can be more sure that in the beginning God did not have a name. At that time God was just called God. He only took the name Jehovah when Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt. Then in the name Jehovah God started His work in the Age of Law. That is He started His management plan to save mankind.,Bible,d0ub6jw,1,t5_2qqbz

Because no one is righteous no not one.True the lamb for sacrifice must be without a single blemish. gt If it is possible then why was there any need for the cross? Which was prophesied for thousands of years previous?If someone stopped sinning by Gods power like Job for instance his past sins were still a blemish to his name. These were covered by sacrifices. Since all sacrifices pointed to Christ who alone could actually be the bearer of our sins Christ had to die to wipe the slate clean for those who lived faithfully and believed in Him and His sacrifice. The cross wipes the slate clean making people perfect but it obviously wasnt required to enable people to stop sinning people had been cutting sin out of their lives since the beginning. ,Bible,d97yew0,1,t5_2qqbz

I dont see that explicitly but I do view it in an app and not the web so maybe Im missing something. The rules seem to suggest this but dont cast a vision for the sub.It does seem like the ASK rule is too much. What if someone has a new realization learned.  Do they have to form it in a question to share?  Do the mods want this to only be an askabouttheBible sub? If so be clear about it.  Also is the sub designed for Christian discussion of Bible topics e.g. What does the Bible say about borrowing money? Bible study e.g. How is foreknowledge used in  Peter chapter ? or the text and history of the Bible e.g. Do the Dead Sea Scrolls support a late date for the redaction of the book of Isaiah in the two author hypothesis??Im happy to listen to an answer on any of those questions  BTW.

What distinguishes it from other Christian subs?,Bible,dc2bo8q,1,t5_2qqbz
10292749,0,t3_5mu6pf,Im not sure if youll be able to see this response in the midst of the chaos of responses. I wanted to point out that perhaps we have such a small view of God certainly God is good but perhaps our concept of good and evil are far too simplified to reduce them into exact opposites without fully understanding the grandeur that is the universe. Death is a consequence of life and our faith promises that one day death will no longer be a consequence. Evil like chaos is the primary condition. Even Neil deGrasse Tyson points out that this universe is quite chaotic this is the condition of the universe from the beginning of time. I view Genesis as poetry a picture of life living in an imperfect world. However this is where my faith plays out. Chaos will one day be a thing of the past. Our scriptures teach us that we must master the chaos around us rather than allowing it to master us. Once we learn how to overcome that chaos we will be better people as a consequence. Christ offered that template while he dwelt with us. One day all chaos will be a thing of the past for us provided that we follow that example. Until that day comes chaos and death will be our reality regardless of faith or lack thereof. Dont hasten to think that God the one that made all life possible loves you any less because you dont believe. Its not about going to Heaven or Hell. Once this world is restored the meaning of our existence will become more apparent.,Bible,dcaqlxh,3,t5_2qqbz
10353647,0,t1_dcboy5z,Youre not breaking my bubble at all. You raise a valid point. Sometimes life sucks. Yet our first world issues are nothing like what Ive seen in other parts of the world. In fact the problem of evil raises doubt in many believers...the point of If god is all good...why does evil exist ?  I believe that we have a responsibility as human beings to make each day better little by little. If I see someone suffering and do nothing then Im a part of the problem. If I see someone suffering and do what I can to help then Im doing what I can to make this world a little better. Satanism however is an interesting notion because it has so many meanings to many people. Anton LaVey had a very interesting philosophy and was bound by a set of ethics even within his world view. He was a nice guy and very intelligent. After deep personal reflection I can see all the vile things that guided him to the genesis of his philosophy and model. The horrors of religion. We can throw the ball back and forth for hours but in a sense I side with you on this. Satanism is the current state of humankind but I eagerly await the restoration where there is no more war no more poverty. Satanism is merely sojourning in life without the expectation of a god because everything seems to point the follower into thinking at least subconsciously that this world is incapable of restoration.,Bible,dchna3m,2,t5_2qqbz

10555108,0,t3_5r4an7,IMHO to understand the Bible one needs faith taking God at his Word.  The Old Testament is a testimony of the Jewish people written by Jews regarding the history of the Jews.  Yes. incest did apparently take place at different times so what and get over it it will not matter in the long run.  That was part of the divine plan of God.   Cains offering was found unacceptable due to the fact Cain did nothing to grow the plant.  God watered and give the plant up to harvest. not Cain.  Abel chose the firstlings of his flock which he nourished and cherished and presented it to the Lord as a acceptable offering.  Cain was bitter and coveted Abels favor from God.  God cursed Cain and set a mark upon him warning others not to kill him.  God is sovereign omnipresent and cannot make a mistake.  Genesis  tells the story of Noah and the Flood and more incest.  Remember to have faith and take God at his Word.  Abraham is selected in Genesis  to be the father of the Jewish people.  God promises him a land Israel a people Jews and a royal government.  Sarai his wife laughs when God tells her she will bear him a son since she was  yo and past her prime.   In the meantime Sarai supplies a bondslave Hagar to bear Abraham a son Ishmael. Sarai has a son Issac when she is  yo and Abraham is  yo.  Sarai forces Abraham to banish Hagar and son to the desert because of her jealously.  There God promises her her son will grow to be a great people.  Ishmaelites could be the Muslims of today?  Anyway the Bible tells of Moses and the journey to the Promised Land via the Red Sea and  other various kings and kingdoms that rose and sank with Gods discretion.  God knew the Jews would not be able to keep the laws.  God sent a promised Redeemer Jesus to lead the Jews and he was rejected.  Hebrews  But without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.Hebrews   Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. Cor.   But if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost In whom the god of this world Satan hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them. For we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake. Cor.    Moreover brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand.  By which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures And that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.  This is the Gospel.Romans  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved. Also called faith.Pray before reading the Word and seek Gods purpose for your life.  Les Feldick on Youtube does an excellent job in teaching verse by verse.
