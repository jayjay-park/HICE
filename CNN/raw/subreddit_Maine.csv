My sister also just recently fell at her job and hurt her wrist although they cant figure out exactly whats wrong with it even after an MRI physical therapy and many doctors visits. She is still in pain every day and its been a couple months. The worst part is the doctor she originally saw didnt want to schedule additional testing because its on workers comp and he didnt want to waste money. Another doctor laughed at her for wanting to see the MRI results saying Why? You wouldnt understand. Now she is on her third doctor and about to get the bloodflow in her bones tested.

189709,0,t1_ceytim8,I can comment on Save A Lot. Basically you can find good deals on canned boxed or assorted snack foods. Most of the food there is weird branded versions of normal food although you will find some name brand stuff there. My advice Stick to the name brand stuff mostly. If you want to try one of their other brands try it dont stock up on it.The meat case is somewhere I generally veer away from although I have found things like Hillshire Farms Kielbasa of which I stocked up on because it was like half the price you would find at the regional grocery stores.Dairy? Yeah no. My sisters ex husband one day found sliced processed cheese for like . for  ounces. Being a family of big sliced cheese eaters he stocked up on it. The stuff tasted like really strong margarine. We could not eat it. It was that bad tasting.On the flip side one day I found some catfish nugget Hushpuppies in the frozen foods section there that personally I fuckin love. I have never seen or heard of them before but they are delish.In short dont do your normal grocery shopping there. You will regret it. Go in pick through the products and experiment. You will save money.,Maine,cf01pzv,1,t5_2qts0

2797153,0,t3_2s2c75,I moved to Maine from the DEEP south mid. After the honeymoon phase wore off I was really shocked at how many similarities there are between here and there. A couple of weeks after arriving I saw some trucks with REDNECK stickers on them. I was so tickled! Coming from the south I wondered what the hell they could possibly know about rednecks. Well I came in the summer so I didnt get to walk right into the proliferation of Real Tree camo that comes with Maine winters. Wow. To my dismay the hillbilly trailer trash dueling banjos scene is alive and well in Maine as much so as it is in the south. However its still a completely different world up here. We havent dealt with too much of the yall aint from round here are ya in a bad way here. Most people are just curious about the accents why I came to Maine and overall kind and interested. I was a little taken aback by the lack of ethnic diversity here but there is still a different feel to it. If I saw a black man walking around where I live in Maine I wouldnt give it a second thought and I dont really think anyone else would either. In the South I am so serious where I am from I would fear for the person. I would hope that they would be out of town by dark. I know that sounds dramatic but hate is real and it still thrives in backwoods BFE towns. Im sure there is some of that in Maine too and that I just havent had the misfortune of discovering it yet but the larger city approx k pop. that I commuted to in the South had a fucking Confederate Heritage Park in the middle of town. We were about an hour from Memphis TN and yet countless trucks and shitty little Chevys were driving around town with too loud exhaust sporting fucking Heritage not Hate and rebel flag stickers. You cant walk into a high school there without seeing at least a dozen rebel flag tshirts. Hell there are even public school sports teams still named the Rebels and Im not talking some sweet Star Wars shit either. Im talking about hate and stupidity. Also in Maine Ive been shocked at other social differences such as between the sexes. Here Ive seen so many female police officers a state trooper workers for the highway department etc...that is so rare in the south! It seems silly to be excited over such a thing and I never thought I cared but I found myself getting so giddy when passing a flagger...THAT WAS A WOMAN! And all these women driving motorcycles I feel like its the fucking s again and I should be saying you go girl or something. I dont know. Maybe its all silly but its a different world. Christ you can buy plan B at Walgreens here! Im pretty sure the whole county I was in had a ban on that...and dont even get me started on abortion and gay rights. Because there werent any of either. I havent heardread faggott nor nigger anywhere but on Reddit okay and YouTube since Ive been here. I recognize that Maine has problems like anywhere else and I have surely had my eyes opened a bit more in that people are people everywhere you go. However Maine has more than enough beauty and kindness to make up for whatever else it may lack. Ive never had so many amazing opportunities and have never felt more at home than I do in Maine. I agree that its not for everyone and thats the beauty of it. The road less traveled would surely lose its charm were it to be trampled. ,Maine,cnm0y64,11,t5_2qts0

Closing time is  here and that problem of whole bars emptying out into the street all at once is pretty much nonexistent because only a small proportion of patrons stay out that late so departures are staggered.

They take donated items from the waste stream and treat them like theyre selling at retail prices. Its the only company I can think of that has had locations popping up at an insane rate in the last couple of years. They pay the low level employees very little and according to some things Ive read some at less than minimum wage.

4301732,0,t3_3a5ltw,Someones never been to southeastern New England I see. You think its ridiculous in Maine? Youve seen nothing my friend. Nothing.I used to live in Providence. There are  Dunkys within city limits and over  in the greater city area. There are Dunkys in Providence that you not only can walk to from others but you can easily see from them.And theyre not alone. In Westborough Mass. theres a Dunkys   hours with drivethrough  directly across the street from another one just like it. And thats not at all unique.Dunkin Donuts is based in Quincy Mass. just outside Boston. Saturation is heaviest in the Greater Boston area though there are slightly further pockets like Providence where its nearly as bad. I used to live walking distance from four of them.And the totally screwy thing is that thats not the only major chain like that in the region. Though much smaller Honey Dew is another regional brand that gives Dunkys a run for their money in some places and enjoys strong customer loyalty. In Providence Cafe La France has a strong representation. In Boston Au Bon Pan. In East Bay Rhode Island Mas Donuts. In New Haven Willoughbys. And countless smaller chainlets and independents. Starbucks is a damn joke in these areas barely hanging on. Tim Hortons got run out after only three years giving up three dozen units practically overnight.Dunkys likes to say that American runs on them. I would use a different verb such as lurch awkwardly gasp a bit then stumble forward but theres no question that Rhode Island at least totally runs on that shit.,Maine,csaj2ps,1,t5_2qts0

Commercial activities are allowed these people just need to get permits.  The goal is fair use.The sort of people who ignore these needs and just treat shared woodlands like their own personal playgrounds to use however they please could use a public shaming now and then.My tax dollars help support BSP.  If Clif bar REI LLBean and whoever else are going to be making money based on activities in the park then I damn sure want BSP to get its miniscule permit fees and for the people partaking to act respectful.

4880015,0,t3_3hgmsp,Sometimes people confuse the terms All Season snow and studded.  To make sure we are talking about the same thing all season has an MS rating on the sidewall snow tires have a snowflake and studded tires have metal studs in the tread and probably all have a snowflake on the side as well.Most people run all season tires even in the winter.  Some people switch over to winter tires and some switch over to studded winter tires.I really prefer studs in the winter on my honda civic.  The traction is just so much better on that packed snow we get for several days after storms and of course on ice.A set of snows or studded snows will run you an additional  or so.  There are some really nice studded tires but even the cheap ones will give better traction that all seasons.  Theyll just be loud as hell.  You cant run studded tires year round and the cops are quick on the fines come spring.  Supposedly they tear up the roads although IMHO winter itself does far more damage to the roads than studs could ever do.You may be able to prebuy change over service.  That is for a fee your dealer will do fall and spring changeovers for free for the lifetime of the tires.  Worth it.My suggestion would be to see how your all seasons run this winter.  Notice the traction on packed icy snow.  If you want better traction get a set of studded tires.  The cost sucks but so does a  insurance deductible!Edit  You havent lived until you have driven from Orono to Key West running studded tires!,Maine,cu9nwc0,1,t5_2qts0

A laptop is not a means of production it is most definitely a product of human labor and therefore human social interaction.  Its raw components had to be gathered by workers and then assembled by workers.  The factory and equipment that assembled it are the means of production which are under the control of a capitalist who exploit labor to create surplus value which he then extracts in the form of profit.    ,Maine,cumtrkg,1,t5_2qts0

I have family that moved up there and absolutely love it one of the places you might want to look into is living in Veazie especially if you haveconsidering having kids. There is no high school there its super tiny so you can choose from one of the surrounding high schools including the private one in Bangor for free. Orono because of the college actually has a lot of opportunity in the way of performersconcertsetc. The Collins Center gets some awesome shows like Lewis Black Steven Page Elvis Costello Broadway touring companies etc. Also the rec center is super nice and you can be a member of that without having to workgo to the college. Theyve been opening a lot of breweries too I think but dont quote me on that.I will say that I really love the Downeast area. Thats EllsworthMDI and North up the coast. I also consider Blue Hill and the peninsula area part of that too. Those are all really nice places to live even if they are small towns. Theres decent shopping in Ellsworth where ever you end up GO TO MARDENS and Bangor has good shopping too. And yes it does get dark at pm. Stock up on Vitamin D.

5555120,0,t3_3r7ptl,When you say Portland probably wont be affordable youre right... for what youre talking about you are going to be far from anything resembling a population center. Dont even bother looking for anything south of Rt .For that spend theres plenty of old camps or trailers in the middle of nowhere that may or may not have electricity. These are great for what you describe as far as selfsufficiency but are unlikely to be turnkey so youre going to have to really rough it while you work on the place. You may find yourself needing to run a gasoline generator as needed until you get solarwind in place. The other options are dying towns like Millinocket similar to areas of Detroit where you can buy a house on a small lot for under k. Those may have a high tax burden though probably a k a year compared to the offgrid option which is likely only to be a couple of hundred. These wont lend themselves to selfsufficiency as the lots are postage stamps but they may be an OK base of operations as you work on a remote lot over time.No one can give you legitimate numbers on a cost of living thats all dependent on your individual needs. Maine is average in pretty much every way except for heating costs.... and heating costs are highly variable due to structure type efficiency fuel type temperature preference. You need to guesstimate these for yourself and keep a spreadsheet. As far as work you need to be creative unless you want to hope for a min wage clerk type job. Most workfromhome jobs require good wired internet which is out of the question for offgrid where at best youll get Satellite or G. Rural Maine is really geared to the selfemployed even if that means doing just odd jobs.I did something similar to what you describe coming from out of state and I wouldnt want to go in cold across the country without gainful income to float the process. My tip to you would be to do things in steps... Move to Maine rent something around Portland or Bangor so you can work in one of those areas while you save more cash and findbuild the right homestead.

I personally get nose bleeds because the winters here are so dryId also buy some boots or boot covers for walking on ice if you plan on going anywhere more than a quarter of a mile on foot. With winter coming ice is going to be a problem. Lastly buy snow tires. Its not the greatest experience changing your tires out every winter but youll be a lot safer than if you use allweather ones.

7287103,0,t3_4f78xm,If you have money and dont have to rely on the local economy then Franklin County is a pretty good place to live. You could find yourself a nice place on a rural back road and itll be quite peaceful. If you want to be on a hill with a nice view you could find it and if you want to be somewhat secluded and surrounded by trees you could find that too. But if youre coming here expecting to find good jobs then you will probably not have a great time. The economy is very depressed. Its an area that has been slowly dying for several decades. You should cross Livermore Falls off your list right now. Its very run down place and its not really rural. It will be hard to find any place to live that isnt an old rundown houseapartment with neighbors right on top of you. The same can be said for southern Jay but North Jay is more rural and probably closer to what youre looking for. Chesterville...thats not really even a town. Its just where a few rural roads meet and there might be a post office and a convenience store. Theres nothing there but then again that might be what youre looking for. If you really want to move here Farmington or Wilton would be better in my opinion. Farmington is a college town and a bit nicer definitely more alive. It has a good high school shared with Wilton so that will be ok for your kids. Wilton also has a beautiful lake that is great to spend time on in the summer. Definitely visit before you commit to moving. Explore the entire area...drive around all of the rural roads. Visit towns like Industry and Weld...you might love them. It can be very beautiful here in the summer but just remember that half of the year it is extremely cold and there is a ton of snow. I know you probably think youre used to it being from Ohio but I promise its a lot worse here.I grew up in southern Franklin county and Im here now but Ive also lived in Southern California and in Tennessee so I have a pretty good perspective.

7604798,0,t3_4jgca4,Portland is a fun town that keeps going all winter. The cycling is not as good as in Minneapolis because a the center of town is up at the top of a hill and b the old narrow road rightofways are clogged with heavy vehicle traffic lots of speeding aggression and road rage. But there is definitely a dedicated community of yearround cyclists and  organizations that support them.The part of South Portland nearest Portland within a mile or two of the bridge has some worthwhile destinations of its own  Pickett Street near SMCC and the water is a great cafe Taco Trio is good and there are a couple VERY real dive bars if you like that kind of thing. The western part of town has the regional mall and is more sprawly but there are some trails and quiet roads that lend themselves to cycling. The other thing that isnt super in Portland is actually Internet access at least at the home level. But as a professional you can probably make it work. Above all it is pretty awesome being near the ocean especially I think during the winter when so often you get it to yourself.

7814681,0,t3_4mcwfy,Couple things to note from it in case you cannot view .pdf currently Water contamination is not exclusive to city water and gross negligence aside EPA recommends everyone with a personal water source tests regularly since there is nobody else checking your water. If you live in the city Id still test ASAP. There are far more contaminants than lead in water. Some are easy to deal with others require a shitload of work to mitigate or fix. The longer you wait the worse it gets for your health and the problem. Stomachbowel issues of any regular occurence are a strong indicator of something wrong with your water. Theres many moreworse effects but this one is overlooked easily.Edit You may search for EPA information by zipcitystateetc. here. This means we can find out what exactly is going on. Or what exactly is being done about what has been announced thus far.By checking out this I found out that LewistonAuburn Waste Treatment is requesting NPDES approval from EPA which forks over responsibility to the state for permitting water treatment levels. This happened immediately after a severe violation was applied to the water treatment facility on May st. There is a slew of inspections and the program approval may be failed by EPA. But if approved the pollutant levels can be laxed if Im reading the information correctly.. You can read more about that program here and the information regarding EPA inspections is on the EPA site under Lewiston for the other link I provided. In any case either the river is being polluted or they arent meeting requirements on cleaning the waste water  whatever is being sent to a home.

9030507,0,t3_53x3h6,Waterville is going through a revitalization but you may want to check the school systems there. Have lived there but my kids are grown. Anything off of First Rangeway in Waterville is a pretty decent neighborhood that is if you look at this map the little curving roads to the left west of First Rangeway are pretty niceIts also very close to the highway and about  minutes to Augusta exit to exit not sure how far off the highway shell be commuting.Oakland is not bad but its a very small town again not sure about the schools. And commuting to the highway you have to travel uphill. Its a decent lane road Kennedy Memorial Drive but would rather be closer to the highway if I had to commute to Augusta from Waterville andor Oakland.Waterville also has Colby College with a great art museum which has activities for kidsYou should check it out regardless of where you chose to live.The little independent movie theater in Waterville is nice however be aware that its also very small and the seating is not as comfortable as a regular movie theater. They often have art displays in the lobby and the clientele seem really nice.There is also the opera house downtownYou can read about the latest on the downtown developments hereThe downtown really needs the help. There are some decent restaurants there and shops but pockets of sort of run down looking buildings as well. The little strip mall that borders the Concourse parking lot has a Goodwill a Shop n Save grocery store and a Dollar Tree etc. The clientele there range from your average working class citizen to packs of homeless teens roaming around as they tend to hang out at the library which is nearby. The library is pretty decent overall.Agree with another poster that Winthrop is a nice little town. They just redid their library. Would avoid anything with a long driveway in the winter ask me how I know Triple A almost ditched us due to getting stuck in snow drifts. There is an element of small town gossips which youd want to avoid. That is if you talk about your personal business to anyone at a local restaurant pretty soon everyone in town will know your business and it might be good or it might turn into puffing it up into something negative. Be aware of gossips especially in small towns in Maine. Most people are nice talking about the weather etc. but some thrive on drama and cant wait to pass on what they consider to be juicy information. Youd be surprised at some of the Peyton Placelike drama that goes on in small towns maybe not if youve ever lived in one.Hallowell is nice as is Gardiner. Id chose something a bit away from the river and agree the East side of the river Randolph etc. are nicer as another poster said.Id avoid downtown Waterville if you continue to house hunt there. That road First Rangeway provides easy access to the highway the local Hannaford on KMD gas stations places like Applebees and the big movie theater AMC and yet its not that far from downtown maybe  minutes about a mile. Silver Street has a few restaurants that are pretty decent not star by any means. A big Mexican place which gets super crowded on weekends because the food is cheap and plentiful a pub and another more upscale pricey restaurant and an oyster bar which Ive never been to.Waterville also has the Harold Alfond Youth CenterNever been as my kids are grown.Winslow has some nice areas but there is a giant hill leading down to the bridge across the Kennebec not something Id want to traverse in the winter and you have to get across the river to get to the highway unless you want to take the back roads to Augusta. There are some nice scenic drives from Waterville to Augusta on the back roads however especially in the warmer months. If you plan on visiting Portland on a regular basis choose Augusta or the outlying areas Richmond is a nice area rural so you have to account for driving to Augusta for grocery shopping etc.. The closer to the highway the better its a bit of a hike to Portland from Waterville and from Augusta about an hour if you take  there is a toll in Gardiner. Also living east of the river its a bit easier to take day trips to the coast and explore all of that area Camden Mt. Battie etc.Youve got some good answers here especially the detail about where to hunt for houses in Augusta.,Maine,d7xbom7,3,t5_2qts0

If a crime is committed with your weapon because you cant properly store and secure that weapon you should face consequences.  If youre afraid of the big bad government knowing who owns weaponry let me clue you in on the fact that your birdshot rifle isnt going to help you in a fight against our military.And thats where my gun control would end.  You want an AR have at hoss so long as you go through the proper channels and have it registered.  You cant secure your weaponry?  Then be willing to get sued by anyone your weapon is used against in a crime.  You dont want to run those risks?  Dont own a gun.

9787334,0,t1_dajhf9m,I beg to differ. There is nothing on the market even close to The Substance ale. Ive only had  beer that comes close to their balance and thats Santilli from Nightshift brewing in Mass. IPAs are only getting old for a very small amount of the population.The malty style beers are the ones that are losing ground in all areas of the country especially the west coast. Even here on the east coast you are seeing it with all the breweries its not just Portland. The main people that cant stand the taste of IPAs are the older generation. People who grew up on malty sweet beers with no bite to them and very little carbonation or people who drink Bud Light which has no flavor. IPAs are here to stay and youre seeing that all over the country. As far as recipes being the same that may be true with companies like Shipyard and Gearys or Grittys but I challenge you to try a Bissell and a Foundation and draw comparison. Hell even if you like malty style beers a company like Barreled Souls and their Quaker State ale make Shipyard and Gearys look like they copied some  year old recipe and have no inspiration. ,Maine,daji2tq,3,t5_2qts0

To the people who love Bangor I suggest seeing what its like in other places.leave.  no one is forcing you to live here.  I dont love Bangor but I did live in Bangor and Brewer for about a decade. I lived in nice neighborhoods where the homes were well maintained and lawns were well landscaped. No one had junk in their yard or screamed in the streets. I had a nice one acre lot  minutes from downtown Bangor. My closest neighbors were college professors business owners doctors and nurses.  What I liked about it was I was reasonably close to Baxter Acadia two places where I spent a ton of my time on the weekends and also not too far from the family camp. I had season tickets for UMaine hockey when they were still decent.  I would hit the Bangor City Forest after a big snowstorm to do some quick after work snowshoeing sometimes by headlamp.  Id meet friends at the climbing wall at UMaine.Is it in my top  favorite citiestowns? Not even close.  But it does have one thing going for it  location near a lot of other places I love.  A last outpost of civilization. I agree about the poverty but for better or worse it was mostly out of sight out of mind for me. Also rednecks tend to get on my nerves.

Being asked to borrow your phone cigarettes etc whenever walking downtown.  . Not very many nice places to live unless you like old buildings. Im a fan of updated and modern living arrangements.  . Short business hours  everything closes early in rural areas and this bothers me.  . Very few career opportunities. Unless you work remote dont expect to land a highpaying gig while living here.  . Its pretty gray here for a good portion of the year. Pretty much everywhere northeast of Augusta gets this rainy dreariness in the sky that seems to last forever. If you fall victim to seasonal depression Id say maybe consider moving somewhere in the Southern portion of the state.  Aside from that I mean.. Bangor is Bangor.

When you take away the needed social safety nets along with the massive cutbacks to public education funding you create a more expensive future with problems that will blow up in our faces. For instance the reduction in state funding to school districts has caused the schools to both make cuts to the bone and shift a lot of that cost onto the backs of poor rural property tax payers who are already stretched passed the point where they should be.If you cut back on other social safety nets its been shown to increase things such as crime and incarceration. Jailing our citizens has a direct negative impact on our economy. These people that felt they needed to resort to criminal activity to just get by are now out of the work force and no longer paying taxes supporting their families and starting new businesses. There is no excuse for committing crimes but their are reasons.These people who get less help with food stamps and health care are already spending every penny they earn each month on food and rent. They dont have a savings account. Any money you give them is directly returned into the economy. Now this  billion dollars will have to go towards fixing these problems in the future when they could have been avoided by spending one tenth of the cost these last few years.

People who own vacation homes already pay higher taxes since they cant use he homestead exemption.  Theyre also not using any town resources yet they are paying for them.,Maine,dfblw8w,1,t5_2qts0

About half the houses built in Aroostook last year used a frost protected slab. I agree though basements are way nice. They are much more expensive though.,Maine,dge9t7r,5,t5_2qts0

11734277,0,t1_dgpfkpt,Honestly craigslist is probably your best bet. Even the local property management companies advertise there. If that fails try giving calling some of them I know Guarette properties is handling a few nice units downtown they are loft units but a couple were two bedrooms. They would be on the top end of your budgets though. You could also call apex though they are a mixed bag. They have some nice house rentals but they also have some pretty low end stuff.,Maine,dgq3z2h,2,t5_2qts0

11766013,0,t1_dgsgcbx,gt Fuck all you people in this thread shitting on my people though. Youre not neccesarily wrong but its fucking disrespectful to judge people in the Katahdin region from afar like this when you arent even from there and dont understand the background and context. Its basically a foreign culture to southern Maine.This is the attitude that is killing the Katahdin region. How dare someone from the outside suggest solutions to our unique problem.That automatic aversion to outsiders is toxic. I know people firsthand who have lived in Millinocket for  years and are still seen as from away because they moved there. I know people who moved from East Millinocket to Millinocket and are still seen as from East.Whether theyre judging from afar or not theyre not wrong. Theres a shitty attitude in the area in general many people have entitled attitudes because they worked for a formerly booming but now dead industry and far too many people feel like they own the entire woods because the mills let them use their land for generations. When CBZ Associates did a study probono  years ago their biggest piece of advice was You have to improve your attitude towards the outside world.And before you pass me off as another one of those people from away I am one of your people. I grew up in one of those towns. I was in high school when the first major shutdown hit in the early s. I still live within driving distance of the region. And were not special.,Maine,dgtphpo,6,t5_2qts0
