At least thats how I find it.  And dont worry youre clearly cute enough ,LGBTForeverAlone,cf5q0le,2,t5_2vuwh

4104776,0,t1_cro2jp1,Did other people sit by themselves? Thats what the LGBT group at my school was like. The longtime members talked among each other while everyone else kept to themselves. It was peculiar.,LGBTForeverAlone,cro63mt,2,t5_2vuwh

6446186,0,t1_czk86fy,yeah... theres sex and theres sex within the traditional dating context where you explore an emotional bond with someone also. You want the lattermost younger guys dont as youve experienced.Forming an emotional bond with someone is not easy or common. If I meet one person a year that will blossom into a deep friendship Id say Im doing pretty damn good. Its really hard to develop this kind of deep friendship and thats among everyone out there. Then restrict half the population that youre not attracted tothe women. Of the guys Ive always been of the opinion that a smallish percentage of them will be physically attractive say . Then out of that  you may be sexually compatible with  of them. And then its probably about  of the remainder that youd be emotionally compatible with. So the odds are stacked against all of us IMO. Im a hairy mofo so I need someone who loves a super hairy guy cutting my odds even smalleryou get the idea. So you have a choice lament the fact that its so hard to meet people and allow that to get you down about life. Or get out there and continue to meet people. The vast majority of them wont work out but the more you meet the better your chances of meeting one that will. This was always my approach to dating and it served me wellI actually enjoyed dating. I never wondered why I couldnt meet a good guy. I assumed that they exist out there and I just need to stumble across one. And that did eventually happen... so dont give up hope. In fact dont hope. Screw hope... go out and increase your odds and you will find what youre looking for.,LGBTForeverAlone,czm2qn5,1,t5_2vuwh

9191892,0,t1_d8h4943,No but there are a lot of people that post here that arent forever alone. I thought my story would make sense here since it falls with LGBT. Thanks for the downvotes anyway.Edit But Ill cross post there because I didnt know that thread existed.,LGBTForeverAlone,d8h51e5,-1,t5_2vuwh
