7888016,0,t1_d42nwt1,gt How is the quality of my effort so far with no help?I will happily confess that from a programming and development perspective you have easily exceeded anything I could accomplish.However your studio as a customerfacing entity is not excelling.  If youd honestly like any help with that or even just advice or just some pretyped form responses you can give out let me know.,Farcraft1,d42opg0,3,t5_3ez3k

7910266,0,t1_d44zfmd,gt Ive allowed the trolling to continue because there is just no way to avoid it after telling the world that FARCRAFT is not MINECRAFT.Okay im going to take off my troll hat for a moment and Im going to get serious for a moment.The trolling you are receiving is not because you claim farcraft is not minecraft. People would understand that based on a brief glance of your game. Yes its different. We understand its not a minecraft mod.Why youre getting so many trolls however is because of your actions specifically in rredditrequest hereWhile I personally do not agree with uchtorrr about the reasons you were denied ownership of rfarcraft I too have similar issues with not being able to remove an inactive mod squater your actions after the fact were to put it mildly more in line with that of a petulant child than an apparently grown adult with a wife and kids.Forget everything else for a moment. Forget about Farcraft forget about reddit forget about your trademark. How would you as a father react to your child speaking to you the same way you spoke in rredditrequest?On top of that you for some reason decided to post your trademark video in rfarcry rmicrosoft rubisoft ryoutube rmojang rminecraft and possibly more subs Also on farcraft.net. Ignoring for a moment that that is not even remotely how public notices work while youre at reddit thats what most people here will consider spam And likely why your account was shadowbanned for a few hoursa day. The spam filter probably thought you were flooding selfpromotion. Which you kind of were..Im not sure if youre just confused as to how trademarks work or if youre under the impression that no attention is bad attention but I have  suggestions for you. Find an IPtrademark lawyer. Even one that has just passed the bar and is looking for some work to build their legal portfolio. They will not only be able to advise you what your rights are in terms of trademarks but what rights you do not have E.G If I invented a new type of cellphone and called it The FarCraft Phone Id be able to do so and even trademark it as your trademark is limited to computer software. Again like a previous comment I made to you UPS trademarking the color brown doesnt mean no other company can use the color brown in their logo or promotional material. Just means they have that color locked down for their specific industry.. Theyd also be able to work on properly enforcing your trademark without the negativity youre going to receive from the way youre going about it. Because at the moment the only thing people associate with your game is your history here on reddit and thats not helping you thats damaging your brandtrademark. And that brings me to. The No attention is bad attention mindset. Im not sure if this is your mindset but if so you really need to look at the Streisand effect as well as what being an asshole on the internet will get you. I suggest going through and reading the following Everything from the Popehat archive on Charles Carreon in the Funnyjunk v Oatmeal case. The following from techdirts archive Caribou Coffee Learns That Even When You Win As A Trademark Bully You Can Still Lose Rage Against The Convoluted Rage Trademark Dispute and Houston Convention Bureau Claims Trademark Infringement After Buying Into The ComicCon IndustryLook I personally dont care if Farcraft makes a billion sales or if it makes no sales ever. But the way you are going about this is only going to cause people to associate you and farcraft with trademark bullying and a developer who is too immature to properly support their game. Like seriously how is this acceptable at all?gt Q What if I dont know how to copymove files?  A Then youre a stupid user and you need to stop being a stupid user. Your ignorance is your fault and you should be reminded of this early and often until you do what is necessary to teach yourself the very bare basics in any computing environment.gt Q What do I do if my developer insults me?  A If he tells you the truth then thank him.You know who are into the types of games you are developing? Younger children. Someone like my autistic stepbrother would probably be interested in your game. But he doesnt know how to copymove files. If my autistic stepbrother came to you for help installing your game would you call him a stupid user?If youre going for the Derek Smart philosophy of Game Development.... well you cant then be surprised that people are turning around and going to troll you and your game.
