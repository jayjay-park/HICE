5080724,0,t3_3kl80o,To solve a puzzle fast you use every technique you know at once.  I suggest you care less about being good and simply try to understand the general logic behind the puzzles.  Doing  puzzles is incredibly little.  Complete the puzzles to enjoy yourself or to practice simple mind games dont worry about speed or comparing yourself to others.,sudoku,cuyf4jo,2,t5_2r2mp
7032925,0,t1_d1dg1bc,Thanks I dont like ALS too much and I usually have a really hard time spotting them. WXYZ Wings still gives me a hard time and ALS just feels like those on steroids..I do like forcing chains alot and this was the first Ive solved that required dynamic ones. Chains seem much more tangible compared to ALS but thats my preference anyhow Spent about  hours across three attemps to get this one but I usually try to progress a bit more linearly in terms of difficulty. Getting stuck too much and you tend to lose interest after a while P,sudoku,d1djcgb,2,t5_2r2mp
8084366,0,t1_d4oqw4s,Second thing I would do it solve for a long chain that has  quadrants with  possibilities. In this puzzle  works. By picking any quadrant with two possibilities for  and checking what happens when you solve for both. In this puzzle youll find that when you try the two possibilities a  in rc never happens. Youll notice that means there has to be a  in rc. This will make the rest of the puzzle easy.,sudoku,d4or96y,1,t5_2r2mp
10030516,0,t3_5jbsxi,You have a naked  pair on row  that eliminates the  in rc. That cell must be a .  You should see a lot of progress after that. ,sudoku,dbf051a,3,t5_2r2mp
10627214,0,t1_ddc37va,Once that all looks good take a look at this The idea of a swordfish is the exact same idea as an xwing but one higher level of abstraction. An xwing can kinda be summarized like this there is a candidate in a set of rows or columns where considering the candidate as already existing in those rows or columns will exclude it as a possibility from cells outside those rows or columns no matter where you consider it. Essentially you have a set of possibilities and every one of them results in a certain candidate being excluded from some cells. The definition is exactly the same for a swordfish however the number of cells is  or  instead of . In a swordfish rather than finding x rectangles you need three rows or columns that have that candidate three or less times to form a grid it wont always have to be a grid but its easier to understand it this way. The s that are in the green circles form a swordfish. When you consider the possibilities of a swordfishs cells you end up with either a direct elimination like the first scenario of the xwing or youll end up with an xwing or one extra step to direct elimination. In the image heres the way it plays out Ill use row s possibilities for  and Ill show you how rc cant be  you can apply the same process to any of the cells with a  in a red circle. In row  the  can be in column  column  or column . If its column  then the s that are still possible in row  and row  form an xwing that excludes  from rc. If its in column  then it directly excludes it from rc. If its column  then rc cant be  so the only possible  in row  is in column  so  cant be in rc. No matter where the  will be in row  it is impossible for there to be a  in rc or any other cell that crosses the swordfish. ,sudoku,ddc46w7,3,t5_2r2mp
