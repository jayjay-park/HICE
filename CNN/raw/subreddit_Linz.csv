740503,0,t3_22lm7y,Im not sure if ars electronica is going to be open on sunday but its for sure something cool to see. i would also recommend poestlingberg. its nothing special but it has a nice view on the city. if im not mistaken they also have a little zoo there if you like animals. im not from linz myself but i can ask few of my friends who are from there if they can suggest more. if you want i can suggest few places with good food as far as i know them  ,Linz,cgog7c8,1,t5_2sne5
