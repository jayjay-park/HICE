Firstly even if all politicians happen to be in the congress building theres always COOP which guarantees the continuation of government in a wide range of circumstances.Even IF you were to destroy all governing structures you would then have a few hundred million people with no infrastructure in place to do things like manage roads maintain power grids provide welfare to the poor etc.Even if those people could organise and retain a semblance of organised society youd still have a huge population of disgruntled folk who liked life the way it was and theyd be angry and fight to get it back so be prepared to face decades of civil unrest and wholesale crime and slaughter.The only way to win this battle is by winning minds or down the barrel of a gun.

184657,0,t3_1w7e25,No meat is not destroying the world. Modern industrial meatgrowing practices are contributing to the problem but theres a lot more going on than just livestock. For example yes a lot of petroleum is used in the meat industry. Lots is used in the veggie business too.But more importantly the type of meat raised is a major concern. Beef is a very bad industry because the caloric input to output ratio is awful. Pork is better but still sucks at an industrial scale. Pork makes far more sense as a smallfarm industry as pigs can eat a lot of stuff that would normally just rot turning it into valuable protein and produce fertilizer as well.Even better are poultry and rabbits which have an impressive caloric input ratio and goats and sheep which transform plants grown on nonarable land into protein.But if it came down to it the smartest form of meat production is invertebrates. Shellfish are fantastic and worms and insects have incredible reproduction rates.

This also makes sense in terms of network theory where you can have all kinds of systemic and random perturbations at the edges that dont collapse the centre. So if collapse is a drawn out set of processes that take hundreds of years to play out a city might be as good a place as any unless there is a local fast collapse climate disaster political failure war etc. This is largely because the centre will try to preserve its functioning for as long as possible by consuming the resources of the periphery.I think rural environments definitely give you more options and degrees of freedom but they also can leave you a bit isolated unless youve chosen your community carefully  ,collapse,cf2xk2o,5,t5_2qhw9

1247270,0,t3_28cwu8,One issue right off the bat is that there are at least as many interpretations of collapse as there are subscribers to this sub.  I think the first thing to do is realize that there are many facets.  Collapse may refer to economic environmental governmental andor public health catastrophes maybe more than that and maybe more than one at once.Further its important to recognize that predictions vary regarding the relative rate of collapse.  This is the long gradual decline vs. catastrophic snap.  I tend to lean toward gradual decline in my thinking.  Its more in line with historical examples of collapsed civilizations.I suppose my favorite collapsitarians if you want to put em in a category would be James Howard Kunstler and John Michael Greer.  Both have written books on the topic and maintain regular blogs.  Both center their discussions largely around the predicament of peak oil and its implications for the future particularly the future of American empire economy governance and culture.  Neither of them are petroleum geologists theyre writers.  However both make frequent references to sources like The Oil Drum which can be fairly dense to the nonspecialist.  Kunstler hosts a weekly podcast and Ive heard him talk to a variety of specialists in the energy field.Greers got a firm grounding in ecology history and mythology which is why I find his writing fascinating.  Yes there are scientific and technical aspects one must understand in order to reasonably face the predicament of peak oil and an energy poorer future but I think a larger obstacle is being able to think a different story take a different worldview than that of the happy talk on the evening news about Americas imminent energy independence.  Unless you can take your brain out of the myth of progress for a minute none of the hard facts of geology and thermodynamics are going to mean fuck all to your outlook on the future.  This is what I like about Greer.  He not only tackles the facts of peak oil climate change etc. but also tackles the habits of thought that plague much of American culture and discussion regarding the shape of the future . . . binary allornothing thinking.Now I hold that weve already entered the early stages of collapse.  Google global crude oil production chart on an image search.  Try shale depletion in a news search.  Also just check the Detroit Free Press once in a while.  You dont necessarily need to look for people writing specifically about collapse to find people writing about the symptoms of it.Looping back though Id avoid getting stuck on the internet or subreddits to educate yourself.  Find an author writing about this stuff that you like and go get a book.  The nice thing about credible nonfiction is that it generally has a big bibliography at the back stuffed with credible sources.  My starting points were JHKs The Long Emergency Too Much Magic and JMGs The Long Descent.  I own Jared Diamonds Collapse but have been distracted by Strauss amp Howes The Fourth Turning which has more to say about cycles of history than collapse per se but theyre also calling for a crisis right about now and they dont seem too far off the mark.,collapse,ci9xm3g,2,t5_2qhw9

1298111,0,t3_28xxnl,So I work at a hospital and when elderly people get hit with a UTI it can get scary. That person mentally changes and is much stronger than at base line. Im not saying this man provoked anything or that he was violent but its scary and life threatening to get in a fight with an elderly person with a UTI.A few weeks ago there was a man in his late s who was in with a UTI. He would refuse to go back to his room and would wander the halls until security forced him back into the room like literally had to carry him in because he was trying to go into other patients rooms and such. Well he was put in  point restraints after he tried to stab a nurse with a needle. Then he was completely fine and the next shift decided to let him out of the restraints. He behaved until his room mate left. He then put on his call light and when  nurses came in he asked one to pick up something he dropped and couldnt reach. When she bent down he pulled a butter knife he was hiding in his bracelet and got her across the throat. He then pulled a metal fork with all but one prong bent off and he tried to swing that at her too but she backed up just in time. He then barracaded himself in his room and kept yelling I got the bitch! I got her security busted down the door and had to take him down with force and a night stick and restrain him again. I guess the family was upset about how much forced was used on their father even though he tried to kill a nurse who was just trying to help him.Of course the cops went way too far and are responsible for this poor mans death. But I have a feeling we arent getting the full story here. Why would a bunch of cops open the door and open fire even with bean bag shots on a  year old man without some sort of reason? Families dont often believe what their parents do when they arent mentally stable because they arent the person they know. Some one who would never hurt a fly can snap and go crazy. Ive seen a woman who I thought was possessed. Eyes bugging out screaming in latin telling me I was responsible for everyone burning to death and that I too would feel the burn when I rot in hell and that the devil was coming for me. All I was doing was sitting in a corner and nothing had provoked it.TLDR Old people with UTIs can be mentally unstable and crazy. We may not be getting the whole story.,collapse,cifnkdg,13,t5_2qhw9

1442175,0,t1_ciwzvhk,I think that the current peak oil collapse business as usual scenario will trigger step like downward collapse events.  we hit a peak in oil demand and price the so called economic collapse was an triggered by a sharp increase in the price of oil.  Expect future events of a similar nature as our oil reserves deplete.Now add onto this the climate change events that can cause local or regional disasters floods storms drought and bushfires.  Additional stress to the system in the form of heat waves droughts winter blizzards ect.But if we adopt a  renewable energy system then we can offset the impact of both fossil fuel depletion and climate change.

Different but fine.With lower available energy for production and transport the market economy will contract and draw those with the financial means back into the major market centers in cities.  Property values will rise and prices will push the economically disenfranchised back out into the country where they originally came from.  Now however the surrounding countryside to most cities is suburbs and this where the poor will go.  They will eke out their existence in relative poverty compared to city living today but they will survive.  The vast majority of them will be forced to be sustenance farmers again using the large lot parcels as makeshift farms for highvalue crops fruits and vegetables where they can.  In the future everyone will be relatively poorer than today but the same social dynamics that have always shaped urban and rural development will still exist.  The rich will take the land thats most valuable to their enterprise and the poor will take whats left and live where they can.  The suburbs will just be whats left thats all.

Production from the companys wells fell in  and  and is expected to be flat this year. What was I saying about escalating costs? Nevermind.And...gtIn addition the expense and difficulty of operating in such a remote part of the world where hazards include icebergs and subzero temperatures mean that the developing discoveries may not be economic at todays oil prices. So very harsh conditions with super high costs with the enemy du jour on the geopolitical stage that will only be available hum when exactly? Oh and they need higher prices. Which world economies just cant seem to afford.Any other success stories that youd like to point to?Right Shell from your own link.gtA big factor swelling Shells spending in particular has been its troubled venture into North American shale where about  of last years exploration budget went. Shell gobbled up acreage in prospective U.S. basins which needed drilling. And results have been uninspiring Shell last year took a  billion aftertax impairment on its North American acreage. This is striking given that the key issue with regards to shale resources there is less whether they are there but more how efficiently they can be extracted.So explored a lot got nothing. Sounds like its expensive to find stuff.gtThere may be more disappointment to come. Chief executive Ben van Beurden wants to maintain spending to add to Shells longerterm growth options both in shale and conventional resources. With more drilling he concedes come more dry holes which boost exploration expenses hitting profits.And the piece ends with this nuggetgtThe hope for investors is that as Shell rethinks its U.S. portfolio and sells assets spending will fall. Reducing Shells exploration budget to its  level would shave about  off its total capital expenditure boosting free cash flow to the tune of . billion. That looks like territory worth exploring.Is that investortalk for stop wasting my money? Because it sounds like that.Hang on I think someone at Shell is saying something about costs. Oh the chief executive again?gtShells plans for the Alaskan Arctic had looked doubtful since Ben van Beurden took over as the companys new chief executive nearly nine months ago. Mr. van Beurden pledged to increase discipline on rising costs and improve cash flow. Under his guidance the company has begun to sell off underperforming natural gas and oil fields around the United States while stepping up production from its deep water Brazilian and Gulf of Mexico oil wells. Profit is improving though Shells investments in Russia could be at risk if Western sanctions tighten.Oh yeah rising costs and geopolitical concerns. And now Shell wants to drill in one of the harshest weather conditions and offshore as well? Im going to call rising costs on that one.And a final look at you guessed it rising costs through the industry...gtHigher billings by service providers in the past three or four years have been far in excess of what we would consider normal said Arnaud Breuillac head of production and exploration at Total.gtIf high costs should force the cancellation or delay of large development projects this oil will not be in the market  years from now which will lead to an oil price rise that could be detrimental to the world economy he warned.gtGo look at the carpet boom from the s.

2360144,0,t1_cm39o8c,Money is a social construct. Its dynamics are only very loosely coupled to the underlying flow of goods and services. Look at the various bubbles in markets from tulips to stocks to real estate. Look also at hyperinflation cases like the Weimar republic. One place to see this more clearly is to look at inflation and how inflation is measured. It might be measured purely in terms of money supply and velocity. This kind of measurement doesnt look at prices at the goods and services that money can buy.There are serious problems with trying to compare prices at two different times separated by more than a few years and especially moving into decades or centuries. Sometimes you can find a reasonable comparable good e.g. a bushel of wheat. But prices for one such good went up for a different good the price went down so somehow you need a weighted average but then you can tweak the weights a bit one way or another to get whatever answer you like. I.e. the final answer is pretty much meaningless.Then of course most of the things that people buy in year X are things that just dont exist in year Y and vice versa. Or anyway something commonplace in X is very rare in Y.Furthermore even if the same commodity is widely available in both years the way that commodity is used might be very different. E.g. people would often heat their homes with coal  years ago but pretty much nobody does that any more. Coal is also funny because the coal you could get  years ago was often much better quality than what you can get today. Wood is often that way too  the big trees are long gone by now. This whole question of comparing standards of living... it is a seriously tangled knot.

2921072,0,t1_co01coj,No it doesnt absolve personal responsibility but when the system routinely makes a bunch of yearolds sign strange legal documents to them worth  it kinda makes you wonder. Think about it. Your parents tell you that you need education to succeed your teachers in high school tell you to get a college degree to fulfill your dreams movies newspapers and tv tell you that education is the key to everything. You finally end up at a college after graduating high school and then some bureaucrat at a college hands you a stack of loan papers and tells you to check in a box from which bank and how much. Yes they should know better but everything was peachy all the way until  and if the parents of these kids didnt teach them any better the schools and the media sure as hell didnt. Student loans in the US are a very dirty form of economic oppression since tuitions are artificially inflated and they have sometimes tripled since fifteen years ago the loans are not dischargeable in a personal bankruptcy and kids have been socially pressured to get huge loans as the default way of life. Sure you could have gone to an instate school had parttime jobs applied for every possible form of financial assistance and gone in to a field that offered some future prospects but millions didnt. Now the young people in the US are in a situation where even engineering college degrees dont offer good jobs or depending on the field any jobs at all and you are accumulating a body of people with huge student debts and no real future earning potential to pay them back.Its not just the kids themselves the system is all fucked up due to financial interests. For profit colleges and banks gingerly handing out student loans are milking the kids dry. So many people regret that they shouldve gone into crafts but then again when the housing market stalled now you have construction people and HVAC installers moaning that they dont have enough business either. It seems that the whole economic system has become wholly unstable and deciding on a future career is a huge investment that might or might not pay off and the only party who will certainly profit are the banks. You might think that this rlostgeneration thing is an American exclusive phenomenon but its not. We are building an embittered lost generation in Scandinavia too. We have educated professional people who will never be able to afford their own house or a new car because theyre eternally stuck in entrylevel jobs parttime jobs outoffield jobs and shortterm contracts all the while the housing market gets ever more inflated with hot air and purchasing parity is plummeting. When you have a vast pool of  year olds who are not able to enter a traditional career you will end up with a large chunk of the population retiring with nothing to show for. At least in Scandinavia the state pays the retirements so far! but in the US the social fabric is going to implode because something like  of Americans have little or nothing saved up for retirement.

3231330,0,t1_covzcz9,Peak oil while quite real is of secondary significance to the compound growth in the amount of energy expended to acquire what oil we still can.  If the energy in the oil acquired is equal to or less than the energy expended to acquire it then exploration essentially ends leaving us only with existing fields at that time which themselves deplete on average about  a year.  Total oil production peak is significant in the sense that as energy expenditures to acquire oil increase more total production is necessary at the lower net gain in order just to stand still.Here is a study predicting that by  new deposits will be unobtainable because of the then huge amount of energy necessary to acquire them. If you dont have the time to read this summary report at least look at this graph and the explanation below it in the commentary section which sums up the dilemma we faceBut dont think we need to wait till  to be hit over the head by this disaster.  The authors also say that by  even the lowest cost oil from existing fields will be unaffordable by the average person because the economy will have contracted sufficiently for want of fuel that people wont have the incomes to pay the price necessary.  It is the end users of oil products after all who much pay the dollar price associated with large energy expenditures to acquire oil.  Some analysts attribute the economic slowdown since  to the damage being done by this end of cheap oil.  It is argued that alternatives will take up the slack my opinion is this is a very weak argument discredited by the poor return on energy invested for these projects and the late hour.  The magnitude of the energy loss as the oil age wains and the huge demand for resources energy and other  to attempt some retooling are an obvious mismatch.  ,collapse,cowxlcf,1,t5_2qhw9

3481157,0,t3_3038je,The misunderstanding of economics is impressive here. Shit you even get the basics wrong. Your apple analogy is blatantly false. As production grows the cost per apple goes down. Thats the underlying principle of mass production. You get to spread out your sunk costs over many apples instead of one. For example lets say you have to pay rent and its  dollars nice round number to make my point. You find an apple tree that drop  apples on the ground a month so you gather them up and sell them for .. By the end of the month youve paid rent and pocketed five dollars. Awesome. You use that five dollars to invest in a ladder. That ladder lets you reach  apples. JUST BECAUSE YOU HAD TO SPEND MORE TO GET MORE PRODUCTION DOESNT MEAN YOULL CHARGE MORE PER APPLE! Now that you have  apples you can charge  cents per apple. Despite having to pay for the ladder you still made  dollars revenueexpensesprofit ...    You made the mistake of thinking that because YOUR COSTS are higher that YOUR CUSTOMERS costs would be higher. Thats an incorrect assumption. If your investments allow for greater production the customer will see prices drop because you can sell more product. Thats all Ill say Im not even going to bother with the rest.

In the meantime lets get the idea out of the way that there is such a thing as a free market. Its difficult to convey just how nonsensical this idea is when you consider us as complex organisms whose behavior feeds back into the social and ecological systems we are interdependent with.The premise that ideal behavior is regulated by a single philosophically and psychologically simplistic driver such as price is fundamental to the mess were in. The assumptions of current economic systems are complexsystemsilliterate. This is to be predicted however as their simplicity is what allows exploiters to mass produce the artificial conditions that are most easily harvested.We either engage in sustainable behavior soon with full acknowledgment and detailed maintenance of the the complex mutually interdependent systems we must live symbiotically with or our species can die the same as any blind parasites who kill their host.     ,collapse,cq0320r,3,t5_2qhw9

Not go to work for one day out of the month? You cannot realistically cut from these uses and if your discretionary gasoline budget is a few gallons per month that one gallon is not trivial.  Of course most people in the US with a car could save that one gallon of gas for now but my point is that energy consumption among the low income class and lower middle class is quite inflexible and the times are getting worse. As purchasing power falls employment falters and energy becomes more expensive more  and more people will have pruned their car use to the bare minimum. The bigger problem is that our society is so wasteful inefficient and energetically active that even using the bus is too much CO. Energy use that is entirely beyond our individual control accounts for Id say most of our energy use and its certainly a large enough slice of CO to guarantee climate doom. Even if we as educated consumers decided to cut  of our CO direct and indirect emissions assuming were capable of it there will still be tens of millions of other consumers who will not and who will keep the system running on their behalf. Just remember that a mere  of our emissions is too much. That  will bring about climate calamity all the same but it just will take about  times as long to arrive.

We need to grow food to live  and at .F proteins denature and plants and enzymes cease biological activity. Quintero amp Weins  found that at the current rate climate is changing  times faster than any vertebrate can adapt. The atmosphere is gaining  more H vapor for every degree in temperature increase meaning we currently have  more H vapor in our atmosphere. H vapor is the most ubiquitous greenhouse gas. It traps short wave radiation which is highly energetic compared to the long wave radiation that CO traps. H vapor feedback has taken over as the lead forcing shoving CO to the back seat. CO has not yet doubled in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution  but methane CH has tripled. CH is  times as potent as CO over a  year period. Extinction will come because we have super saturated our atmosphere with GHG and initiated runaway global warming. Water will dry up and if rain does fall it will be in an enormous deluge causing topsoil to run into the rivers and the sea drowning plant roots which need oxygen and breaking tender stalks of grain. Plants will die animals will die we are animals. We will die. At a wetbulb temperature of F our bodies can no longer cool themselves by sweating  and we die of heatstroke sitting unclohthed in the shade in front of a fan. Already in  Seattles average high June temperature has climbed from  to . During the Permian Extinction event Earths temperature climbed C over a  year period due to melting methane clathrate structures in the seabed. Methane from livestock has caused  of anthropogenic warming. The seabed methane has been outgassing at least since  N. Shakhova amp  I. Semiletov. Were going Venus.

Climate modeling is being used to correct historical assumptions and those historical assumptions are then being used as input to models.  This is circular.Of course that does not meant the methodology is bad In the modeling world the only true way we have to test models is to make predictions and verify the results vs expectations.  This is another trope...its called analysis.  The less synthesized the independent dataset the better as it removes modeling bias.

How many species have gone extinct largely due to wolf predation?  Other predators?  My guess is lots and lots.  Obviously humans crossed a line at some point where they were operating outside of what we think of as nature but are we really going to describe that as the point at which they caused other species to go extinct?  That makes little sense to me.  The real difference is that human beings used technology to alter their environment.  As soon as we made hunting tools and shelters and harnessed fire etc. we were no longer one with nature so to speak and there is no  year debate on whether early humans were doing those things.  ,collapse,cu7qyw2,5,t5_2qhw9

I agree financial goods are mostly useless for common people.  .  What does a low energy future look like?  Solar panels horse and buggy rail ways only public transport?  Paint a picture of what we will be doing when we get there.  Its ok if its ugly we can all sacrifice to get there as long as we know what we are getting into..  I like extreme localization.  I am a member of a local farmers market.  I see it as the wave of the future.  We should have little local markets for all sorts of things unfortunately federal laws prevent most of it and they are tightening!. I agree sailing ships are the future but that doesnt end international trade.  After all Rome imported wheat.  Our own country exported maize and tobacco.  Agriculture is the future so you flesh out a bit of that future.. You flesh a little more of what will need to be done to reduce our energy use by stating we need to can and root cellar but for the landless city dweller you leave much to be desired..  All Amish are not a great place to look.  Only the oldest order ones do what you describe.  Most are no different than you or I except they might drive a buggy.  So now you are fleshing out that cars and big machines are out.  You are not doing it in a positive way just what we cant do really...not what we will need to do.. How do we improve our soil?  I propose using night soil as they did in England.  Dig it down and use no root crops for two years..  Working on the current soil conditions now such that theyll be usable without huge oil inputs would be a good start.  But that might cost something so sadly its not likely to happen.  This is too negative.  Instead push people to do it where they are by composting and using their night emissions to fix the land.. A useful first step would be to get rid of HOA laws that prohibit growing gardens in front of houses.  Lawns are not useful.  Gardens are useful.  Pure Awesome.  Good suggestions of what we need to do right now.. We should be designing and retrofitting homes to heat their water with sun and as much as possible heat their insides with sun.  More good suggestions too bad no one left a link to see how to do it . Just because we want an SUV electric please  you know to save the planet in every garage an air conditioner in every room and all the power we want So you are saying no ac...you do realize without an alternative way to stay cool...many people will die.  You must provide an alternative. .  Lets work within the current political system to get people elected who may not support endless growth but will work to do something useful in the future were likely to get not the future we want.  Exactly the opposite of what you should do to change things.....  Yes its likely well get shouted down as out of touch with the latest gamed government stats that show everything is rosy  but as more and more people lose their jobs more and more people cant afford to heat their homes and the view from outside the beltway keeps looking worse we can be in a position to offer people something useful  a plan forward.  Except you didnt give anyone a plan forward at all..you gave few household hints...made a couple of guesses but not a plan.  What about medicine?  How will we treat gout?  What about heart attacks?

The only real question is whether this will be an oscillatory decline small cycles of miniboomminibust heading downward on average or a damped declined just monotonically downward.  Which it is depends on the friction and amount of money available.

Even learning things like how to organize meetings so that everyone gets a chance to be heard without it turning into a screaming match is a skill that can take a while to learn. Things like community gardens form a basis for building further community ties and organization skills and you learn a hell of a lot from other people who know how to grow food at least on a small scale. Plus you get food almost for free I added some homemade fish fertilizer to my plot this year and got  lbs of tomatoes from about ten plants crazy.Other ways to build community are through volunteerism of various types active involvement in local schools and community centres and other types of cooperative ventures. And it doesnt have to be broadcasted that your involvement is because the world is coming to an end because then everyone will take a step back away from you in alarm.

Using Solar PV to grow plants indoors is lunacy and we will not be building tens of thousands of new nuclear reactors to compensate for the energy that sunlight delivers to millions of square miles of farmland. Its just not going to happen. Vertical indoor farms are good for mushrooms tomatoes lettuce herbs and such things but corn wheat potatoes and rice need surface area time and plenty of raw energy from the sunlight. They suck for growing indoors.You cannot compete with a million dollar warehouse against a few people with shovels a patch of dirt water hoses sunlight and potatoes to plant.Do the energy calculations for the LED lighting and the cooling needed for a dense vertical farm for wheat or even worse for a C carbon fixing plant such as corn and then look at the price of wheat per tonne and the price of a kWh of electricity and you should hopefully quickly realize that you cannot grow things like that indoors profitably.

Jobs that used to be well paid stable jobs are outsourced laid off or not filled after retirement. The big manufacturer in my hometown shipped the white collar jobs to Poland. The new blue collar hires are put on probation periods for six months where they cannot get benefits. All of the new hires are replaced with other desperate people before they reach the six month mark. Most jobs if you are lucky to get one  now are part time minimum wage no benefits and subject to cut hours if they realize they dont need you.  Even the schools have reduced staff every year and increased class sizes. The public employees from police and firemen to librarians are all being cut permanently. New public librarians with masters degrees are being hired part time with no benefits and no hope of full time employment. Technology has replaced many jobs. My brotherinlaw used to manage a record store at the mall with benefits. The store closed with iTunes. The travel agents are few and far between after Travelocity.

Almonds the proverbial takes a gallon of water to grow one almond can be grown elsewhere where there is no drought. Same with alfalfa hundreds of gallons of water to grow a pound of ground beef. Perhaps we should all pay for water the same way at the same cost.

6772223,0,t1_d0jt6aa,Im not literally talking about taking money from the rich and handing it to the poor. Im talking about things like universal healthcare and tuition free public education all the way through college expanded social security. I dont think you understand how much money is hoarded by the ultra wealthy. Do you really think they deserve to keep all of that money? Did the CEO work  times harder than a minimum wage worker? Did they provide  times more value to society than a minimum wage worker? Do they really owe nothing to society? because why? Because they worked so hard that we should worship them and say yeah keep your millions and millions and dont pay taxes. Thats ok. You earned it.The fact is people that wealthy either inherited it which isnt taxed as much as it should be earn it by creating money out of nothing in the stock market credit default swaps speculation money creation and pay very little tax on it or they started and grew a successful business and in doing so they used publicly built roads and other infrastructure were protected by publicly funded police and fire used public mail hired publicly taught employees etc. The point being is that to have a healthy society they do need to give back. They dont have to give it all back. Just a fair and reasonable amount in order to have a healthy functioning society. Look at Scandinavia most of Europe Canada literally almost every other developed country. They manage to provide all these things we dont have like universal healthcare and affordable college for all. And guess what?! They still have rich people!!! Magic! And guess what?! I bet everyone still wants to work hard too probably more than here because in a society where people dont have to worry about going bankrupt paying medical bills or going into huge debt just to get educated the have time to pursue their passions. How do ALL of these other countries manage to do this? They make wealthy people pay back into the society they live in by paying a fair tax rate so that everyone is able to live a healthy productive life. Its logical as fuck. Use your fucking head.

7216745,0,t3_4eapsc,For sure.I had a really unique occupation in a big city that allowed me to meet a ton of the people who are actually in positions of power.  Think politics business government big agencies and so on. I met technocrats leaders thinkers...these are the architects and designers of some of the big systems.  I was already aware of the big issues that could lead us to a societal collapse but meeting these people really shook me.  I sort of got to a moment where something shifted irreversibly for me.  I mean several thousand people all of whom relating that there are huge problems that are not being dealt with at all.  There is no plan.. Truly.I took the chance and closed my business at a high point and I have since been traveling for the past two years.  Basically relocation was in the cards.  All my travel has been slow overland and very thorough.  It has been a road trip around North America.  A little over  miles covered basically two laps of the entire continent.  Just looking at everything in person.  Really seeing what is happening all over.That has been just as lifechanging as meeting all those people.  Basically I am pretty sure we are all screwed.  I could go into the details but the bottom line is that we have really invested in things that have zero future.So for me there have been layers of knowledge.  And basically I think the scope of the coming disaster has been hard to comprehend all at once.  I have taken years to fully see how total and allencompassing our predicament really is.  I started from going deep in one locale in a kind of intensive investigation and now I have gone broad in an extensive investigation.  Just for my personal  life to function I will need to assume some sort of settled existence sometime soon.  Like get an address and a job again.  I currently have health care but it is worthless in the sense that I cant get a reasonable standard of care when I use it.  I have enough money for my lifestyle for basically forever but probably not enough if I settle down and stop traveling it is way cheaper to travel than to live in one place.I have all the financial assets from cashing out my business but cant find any real obvious investment opportunity that doesnt have a major down side.  I may buy a property just to get the money into something tangible.  I may start a business.  I know I can do either but it seems silly to bother in the face of what is coming.When I talk to people it goes like this...They see my lack of a job or extreme early retirement as either a mistake or a problem.  They then try to help me solve it.  What it sounds like to me is them talking about whether I would prefer smoking or nonsmoking section in some kind of prison.  The big issue the prison that never gets spoken of and if you point it out and they acknowledge it the conversation will quickly slip away to details that dont matter again.  I generally have no patience for this now and I have started asking people what they are going to do with the rest of their own precious lives.I was driving with relatives and they admired a large new home being built near a large river and how nice it was.  I was the one that pointed out that the river looked really bad.  Just this morning I read the headline that there has been months of human shit flowing in that river due to a breakdown in the sewage treatment.  So much of what people are thinking about is laughable.I have been concentrating on finding a place in the world where everything that is important to me is found or produceable locally.  Including food water transportation and an intact natural environment.  Amazingly there are maybe only a tiny tiny handful of places that I have seen so far that might mostly qualify...I dont really worry about money or jobs but I do worry about climate built infrastructure community my own health and so on.  I no longer think there is any future for me beyond  years and I see things like saving for retirement as a waste of time.Thanks for listening.

7410839,0,t3_4gt87x,Automatic Text Summarizer VersionOver the last month weve been talking about the convoluted landscape of privilege in American society and the way that the preferred rhetoric of both ends of the acceptable political spectrum falsifies the actual complexities of privilege that exist in contemporary American life.The conventional wisdom on the Left holds that its not only possible but mandatory to create a society with no inequality at all where everyone has the same privileges as affluent American liberals have today.From the standpoint of the privileged liberal the only reason everyone in todays America is not equal is the machinations of the Evil Ists that is racists sexists fascists and the like who hold down all of American societys underprivileged groups out of sheer evil evilness.Its a more generous vision but also a far more clueless one because the privileges perquisites and comforts that make the life of an affluent American what it is today are made possible first by the breakneck consumption of irreplaceable natural resources at wildly unsustainable rates and second by a distorted global economic system that until very recently allowed the five per cent or so of humanity that lives in the United States to consume around a third of the products of the global economy.An economy based on the conservation of natural resources tends to concentrate influence instead in the hands of those who own sustainable resources such as land or those who work directly with those resources again the conflict between owners and laborers determines the distribution of wealth and privilege in such societies.Does that look about right?,collapse,d2kkay9,2,t5_2qhw9

I used to post on the Oil Drum too username KLR mostly graphs that were I hope illuminating  like how theres a persistent secular trend of more countries having declining oil production for a given year.  What are the ramifications of that?The tight oil phenomenon has been astonishing if only for a stay of execution.  Well have to see if has legs  whether it can be sustained at low prices in the US or high prices for that matter or whether it can be adopted in other countries perhaps the US having the worlds most developed EampP is something that cant be replicated elsewhere or our unique mineral rights ownership laws are essential.At any rate what is most startling to me about the Permian basinBakken phenomenon is how it was on absolutely no ones radar whatsoever  years ago.  I dont even think the CEOs of companies like EOG realized what a bounty theyd harvest.  EIA graphs of future US production from that time show tight oil contributing the tiniest of slivers.I had some fierce arguments with JohnDenver and Freddy Hutter at peakoil.com about the Bakken around then in fact  to me the idea that drillers would punch tens of thousands of holes in the ground seemed laughable not to mention thoroughly uneconomic.  But sure enough thats what they went in and did.The take home message from that for me was that no one knows what the hell is going on or going to happen.  Present company included!  Keep trying of course.  Thats what people do and always will.In the long run I agree that we live on a Finite World and if we want to be here for anything approaching a long haul well need to evolve in some fashion or move off planet.

7628934,0,t1_d395u22,gtThere should be a good inventory of spare parts.edit I think you mean cannibalizing. I would make a clear distinction between having actual spares and cannibalizing existing infrastructure. Theyre not functionally equivalent.In information technology telecomms and electronics? Not a fat chance. Its all just on time delivery with very small stocks and long delays. They move the productions up and down based on cumulative orders and big orders can easily swing these up dramatically. Only the most basic components have bigger stocks and even then keeping big stocks is a waste of capital. If the production of integrated circuits and passive electronic components even partially stops a lot of factories will be running out of components in a month or two and soon they will be missing critical components that they cannot find replacements for. Thus the crash cascades into smaller companies further away from the largest factories. Its also important to realize that just missing a few components out of thousands needed for a product will make the product most likely unmanufacturable or render it useless in the field. And lets not go into logistical complications. Having a stock of certain components in another country means nothing if the logistics no longer works reliably.Nobody keeps around large stocks of internet infrastructure components subassemblies and complete devices. Its not financially justifiable to prepare for black swans so we dont. When the lights go out in the electronics factories in China were screwed unless we can ramp up and broaden existing production and have flexible designsalternate designs for reduced complexity.

His total experience of homosexual men was creepy pedophile flaming annoying stereotypical queens like the one who raped him as a child. One day he met a homosexual at work doing construction who he could relate toconverse with and realized homosexuality wasnt in constant conjunction with the other traits he associated with it.example . Poor white kids who grow up in black ghettoes are often victims of constant racially motivated attacks and the totality of their experience as children is that their families were kind to them and everyone else they knew was black people who brutally beat them on a daily basis completely unprovoked. Now their life experience has been that black people are bad violent criminals. example  An embarrassing personal story. I only knew females who were extremely neurotic histrionic low IQ lunatics and i thought all females were stupidpsychotic until my early twenties because the totality of my life experience up to that point showed that to be true without exception. Then i met a mentally stable intelligent female who called me on my shit and i had to rethink all that shit. If that girl had simply decided i was immutably a piece of shit and not worth engaging with i would still have had fucked up views of women until someone else enlightened me to my shitbaggery.so maybe im talking about edge cases like  in  fascists just need a bit of engagement to flip them out of their bullshit which has huge  potential dividends in the long run think of all the people they wont fuck with and prejudge for the rest of their lives. your work will save many vulnerable people from that.,collapse,d3rkx6v,1,t5_2qhw9

7850119,0,t1_d3xzojn,My apologies then i erratically thought you indeed suggested that. Yep we wont have it. Even what we have right now would be seen as a paradize im pretty sure Greenhouse Earth is surely able to have mighty rich massively supporting ecosystems but only after long enough evolution of species on Greenhouse Earth. Last few million years it was much closer to Snowball Earth most of the time so species and ecosystems are all evolved to thrive in nonGreenhouse Earth conditions. And the speed of the change pretty much insures that majority of already few species and ecosystems which still exist without critical dependancies on human intervention industrial fertilizers and such  will fail once Earth gets into the most rapid phase of the Interglacial to Greenhouse state change. Yep i exagerrated mostly for simplicity. There will be little left. Sure. Some insects at very least and some plant species which endured for dozens millions years. Those will most likely survive and thrive in some regions. Few vertebrates too. Wild mice i bet. Deers? Not so sure already. Some birds most likely. Lots of edible berries will go away though  i have experiences collecting several kinds of wild berries and gardening almost a dozen kinds of edible berries both for years most of them are very sensitive to weather extremes and well have pretty much whole Earth in weather extremes by  you can quote me on this if you want. Trees are in much danger business as usual destroyed nearly half of remaining worlds trees during last ... years and right now deforestation goes further on and rapidly. By the time mainstream civilization dies most likely there will be little forest left on Earth. Further cuts will surely be done by thendesperate remains of human societies  see Easter Island story if you never read about it. Then add much more devastating forest fires out of general warming especially in higher latitudes. Then add all the imbalances of dying forest ecosystems  woodeating insects exploding in numbers in warmer conditions etc. Overall i wouldnt count on the forest ecosystems for future huntergatherer activities at all. Etc etc. Considerations are very many i am positive you can think further in such a critical practical manner dig for related observations and trends yourself  wish you luck about it too!Oh and your last point  not exactly true. See primary photosynthesis is the thing we humans have much experience in utilizing. I bet you know that in many cultures burning plants before using the land to grow crops  is regular practice. What can you gather or hunt for on a burned field? Pretty much nothing significant. But you can grow crops on it. I can only hope that mankind will findsave varieties which will remain able to grow up into humanedible and animaledible grains despite the chaos of the climate turning to Greenhouse Earth state. Because if not then quite possibly itll be the end of human civilization of any form with barely few really tiny groups of humans surviving in highelevation losing pretty much everything of everlasting value i mostly mean knowledge the present technological civilization accumulated. Itd be huge tragedy and large risk of complete human extinction too. Id try to avoid it if at all possible.Cheers!,collapse,d3yf8ud,1,t5_2qhw9

For short amounts of time on the order of months or years methane emissions are doing their thing much faster than carbon.  For longer amounts of time not so much.Two things to keep in mindOne the process of oxidizing methane in the atmosphere involves a catalyst called hydroxyl IIRC which is only available in finite amounts.  A large enough burst of methane could potentially overwhelm that catalyst for some amount of time anyway and thus amplify the greenhouse potential.Two the byproduct of methane oxidizing in the atmosphere is you guessed it CO.

8250411,0,t1_d58grrc,Thank you for finding the paper. I was not familiar with this website and will return to it in the future. A moderator removed this submission to Collapse judging my altered headline to be unfaithful to the content. Perhaps it was but the original headline was worse. No matter for I now post links primarily for interaction and material such as this usually goes without comment. Granted it is a rather trivial paper but its subject has become important to me  the biogeology of the Carbon cycle.If not significant research this paper has an important subject  how calcification by coccolithophores will respond to the acidic oceans of the near future. Their skeletons are calcite CaCO and they deposit . million tons of this compound yearly to the bottoms of the oceans. That might seem insignificant compared to the gigatons of carbon dioxide we are dumping from fossil fuels but this will be one of the principal ways that the carbon cycle can remove all of that for the long term. In his latest book A New History of Life Peter Ward and his coauthor assert that the limestone and chalk formations atop the continents secure from subduction into the mantle and an eventual recycling back to atmospheric carbon via volcanos have been the most important determinant of Earths climate history.Yet until recently we understood little of these vital organisms. Edward O. Wilson claimed in his last book Half Earth that coccolithophores were unknown until the s but my fact check just now suggests that is somewhat exaggerated. Certainly they are now a hot topic of research both as a paleontological indicator of past warming events especially the PETM as an eventual remedial factor in the approaching one. The Wiki page has many useful citations of the papers.The significance of this paper is that is measures the genetic adaptations of the most prevalent of these species over four years of acidic conditions the midrange being the  ppm of CO projected for the next century  presumed to be the worst case scenario. The higher  ppm was a positive control. After four years in the modeled environment of the nd Century the coccolithophores evolved the ability to downregulate their calcite production but could recover this synthesis in response to lower acidity. On future Earth acidity levels will not fall for centuries or millennia. Furthermore there is no full understanding of the purpose of the calcite skeleton. The paper alludes to grazers and viruses meaning it functions to ward off predation or infection. What this test tube simulation does suggest is that if we fuck up the oceans plankton our anthropomorphic carbon will persist in the atmosphere for even longer.IMO the collapse of civilization will only mean that emissions tail off. In that I concur with Peter Ward who sees no reason why the end of hydrocarbons should not be followed by two centuries of coal burning. In his New History they assert that the PETM was caused by a methane release  perhaps that lesser mass extinction is now his best case scenario.I study this existential threat in search of a philosophical purpose. Is there a chance of human survival or should I return to the embrace of the nihilism of this age? Maybe I should give this up and join the millions of adults now out in hot pursuit of Pokmon.Thank you again for your interest.,collapse,d58uvxc,1,t5_2qhw9

If you subject someone to high levels of stress for long periods of time then their brain chemistry will suffer.I am simply pointing out that one way of attacking depression is to take steps that alter brain chemistry in a positive way such as good exercise and diet. These can also be used preemptively. E.g. if you are experiencing life circumstances that think might make you depressed but you arent depressed yet e.g. losing a job being dumped exercise and diet can act preemptively.If diet and exercise dont work my next advice would be to see a doctor. It also should be noted that depression isnt always a result of having a shitty life. Some people are simply prone to it and become depressed despite living relatively comfortably.

8708609,0,t1_d6twwdr,IIRC the place the lethal wet bulb threshold will first be crossed is the Persian Gulf where they already have cooling infrastructure AC and a cultural awareness of the dangers of extreme heat. But not many years beyond the Persian Gulfs threshold crossing are places with poorer infrastructure fewer resources and higher numbers of AClacking people places like the Indian subcontinent subsaharan Africa etc. Unfortunately that might not be shocking as those places already experience high death tolls in heat waves a wetbulb heat wave would just be a worsening of an existing problem there. The biggest potential for shock value and catastrophe in the early stage of crossing that wet bulb threshold and even now with the extreme heat waves that happen increasingly frequently is what you alluded to the weak link of regional power generation and distribution something that AC depends on and the inadequacy of our building design for living without power in extreme heat. Whether a metro area or regions power AC is knocked out by shoddy or decaying infrastructure a nearby storm or by welltimed terrorism for a major metro area to lose AC in an extreme heat wave would be as if they had no AC at all. Consider that in the context of buildings that arent designed to be livable without AC in contrast to building design prior to the mid th century and even a mere extreme heat wave that we experience today would be a mass casualty event. Vehicles would become lifeboats with their AC many would attempt to flee the city clogging highways paramedics and hospitals wouldnt be able to do much to aid those with heat stroke not to mention the crisis involving other critically ill people when power and transportation infrastructure are disabled and most people would have absolutely no idea of what to do or where to go. Panic could really set in as an urban population turns into an overwhelming wave of refugees in a matter of hours.The key bit there is theres nothing in the above scenario that is dependent upon future changes that could happen any day now and in every extreme heatwave were just skating by on luck.  Compounding of problems is what overwhelms individuals and systems. Inadequate AC in the context of good building design for extreme heat  or vice versa isnt a crisis but compound both of those inadequacies and throw in an extreme heat wave and it is a crisis. We really should be building redundancy and resiliency into our infrastructure off grid power options buildings traditional design and basementcaves into governement disaster planning they have plans for single disasters but what about compounded disasters and into people prepping plans providing resources in advance for materials especially as what is coming is entirely foreseeable. ,collapse,d6u7n0b,5,t5_2qhw9

Many people that I met continued to go to and do their jobs teachers transportation workers engineers despite not having been paid in many months and when I asked why everyone would universally respond Well what else would we do?.There was no mass rioting murdering graffitiing looting not that there was anything to loot to begin with no cannibalism even though food was scarce hard to come by and you got it through a friend of a friend.

9098133,0,t1_d8574w1,Im reading a bunch of Christopher Alexander right now. Alexander if you arent familiar is one of the major inspirations behind new urbanism aka the reason why city planning stopped sucking so much. Alexander argues specifically against the tradition of Le Corbusier and Wren which is actually very short less than  years because these plans arent generative and dont create living structures. Favaleas and informal settlements by contrast are generative. They are locally adaptive and self correct mistakes. He argues a planned neighbourhood will on average make  mistakes in geometry alone simply because its not possible for a team of planners to account for all of the specific microconditions of a site. As a result the form doesnt fit. A simple example is the photo in the article. How many of those buildings have the proper solar orientation? How many are aligned to the contour of the land? Or of the prevailing winds? All of these things will affect the inhabitants but you can tell that a grid was just plopped onto a base map without any of these considerations. By contrast in the Favela you see a pretty consistent orientation of the buildings towards what is likely the solar aspect. The buildings fit each other and fit into the landscape.  Long story short Im pretty sure Alexander would argue that a huge part of the problem with refugee camps is the inhumanity of their planning. They arent living spaces and as they become cities this structure will only make things worse. ,collapse,d85g5zv,3,t5_2qhw9

A system that overshadows owns and influences our political system to a massive extent.Fact The sun is the only reason we exist at all and also produces enough energy to power our civilisation many times over.As renewable energy is also becoming cheaper to use and more affordable than fossil fuels past peak fossil fuels are more expensive to extract its just a question of how quickly we can ramp up renewable energy and ramp down fossil fuels.I do believe if we went Pearl Harbour on fossil fuels only this time instead of a massive industrialisation to build tanks planes and ships we build solar panels and wind turbines we could mitigate some of the future damage that climate change will deliver.In a way we are at war with the giant monster that is climate change and we are the ones making that monster more powerful with our pollution.The OP is right there is no silver bullet to take down climate change just a massive change in our energy usage which will affect every aspect of our lives our economy and even our political system.The casualties in this war are already mounting with rising amount of damage injury and deaths from air pollution floods heat waves cold waves storms and wildfires.Every day the solution rises for about  hours and then sets its a massive working fusion reactor that gives our planet more than enough energy for life and only about  years ago supported a global civilisation without fossil fuels.We can either burn up our fossil fuels and set our sights on a global desert dystopian Mad Max future or tough it out and battle our way to a cleaner solar powered future.,collapse,d8gc9bs,1,t5_2qhw9

Thats a direct result of a completely unsustainable credit system and the sooner thats gone the better. Destroy it by taking up large sums of credit spending the money for something that cant be easily impounded for example gold and declaring bankruptcy. Convince other people to repeat the process for maximum profit literally. This is probably illegal in your country prepare your postbankruptcy life accordingly.Second civilizational collapse. That ones inevitable because our energy resources are declining. Try to make fossil energy sources unprofitable to speed it up. A famous example is sabotage of oil pipelines  they have a large attack surface theyre eay to break and expensive to fix. Also illegal. Getting miners into a union can help too because that makes extraction more expensive.Third environmental collapse. You really want to do everything to slow this one down as much as possible. My best idea to actually do something against climate change is to fell trees to bury the wood a few feet underground and to plant new trees. Removes CO from the atmosphere and doesnt cost anything. Other than that the usual dont do highcarbon activities flying buying new things and shame your social circle for doing so.Disclaimer Im not advocating for any illegal activity.

Thats different from knowing that the organic producers were using it. Anyone familiar with bee collapse knows that pesticides are incredibly hard to contain.gtAnd lets say there are some cases of farmers who genuinely didnt use pesticides. How did they grow their plants? Did they grow them outside? Id reckon that most of them grow their crops indoors in greenhouses where most pests cant reach them. In greenhouses farmers tend to artificially raise CO concentrations and artificially keep the plants warm using fossil fuels. Such conditions are not sustainable of course we cant cover  of the Earths service in glass to feed everyone.Um no. These farms are outdoors as farms tend to be. I think you have an extraordinarily unrealistic view of how farming works.gtI grow my own food but what does it get me? Worm infested blackberries and raspberries pears that begin to rot before theyre mature in trees that suffer from fungal parasites. My red currant yields practically nothing and even one of the gooseberries had a worm in it. I also have some pumpkins that do perform well but thats about it. Thats the reality we deal with. Grow your own food without using pesticides and youll see what happens. Catastrophic harvests.This is hilarious. I live on a farm. Ive been farming for almost  years. I worked on organic farms prior to that. Youre hysterically exaggerating the extent of the problem. I would love to have an intelligent discussion of postcollapse crop yield and pest management but this is impossible if youre delusional to the point of thinking that you literally cant grow food outdoors. Id be very interested to know what you think people ate before the midth century.gtIf you grow the same crops a few years in a row you now find yourself stuck with all sorts of nastiness in the ground. Grow potatoes or tomatoes a few years in a row in the same ground these days and you will get golden nematodes that kill your tomatoes and potatoes. You have to switch to another crop. Grow rapes a few years in a row and the soil is ruined you get clubroot in the soil. When you get clubroot in the soil its over you cant grow rapes there anymore even pesticides dont work.Im familiar with crop rotation. Ive been doing it for years. Its actually not that hard and there are other benefits to it when it comes to soil fertility anyway.gtWhat do you think survivalists are going to do when they decide to leave the cities and try to grow their own food?Thats a different problem. Youre saying its basically impossible to grow food without pesticides hint we ate food before the th century. This is false. Lets focus on that first.gtDo they really have the means and knowledge to grow tomatoes potatoes or rapes one year then wait a few years before growing them again? Modern industrial farmers can do so they buy their seed. All these pathogens are going to cause decimated harvests.The  organic farms in the US alone would seem to indicate otherwise. Wherever you are assuming youre in the US there is almost certainly a commercially viable organic farm within easy driving distance. Id strongly encourage you to suspend your fantasies for an afternoon and go see how much food you can produce without pesticides.Now there are lots of real problems to deal with  like finding adequate substitutes for mechanical traction optimizing nitrogen fixation balancing soil management with new productivity constraints and yes dealing with pests.

I pay local school tax despite not having kids and not attending school in this jurisdiction and I pay fire department taxes to cover people who arent me.  Those are just local programs dont get me started on TANF obamacare TARP SNAP or any of the other hundreds of blatantly unconstitutional programs that are funded with my labor but dont benefit me.

Indoor farming cannot provide you with enough calories to sustain you with any kind of reasonable personal investment. It will not save you if the shit hits the fan. Indoor grown lettuce herbs and tomatoes can be more sustainable than the ones shipped from  miles away but calorically speaking they are next to useless. You need raw light flux ample heat and plenty of area to grow for example wheat in any significant volume. Just think about how much sunlight a square meter of prime farmland receives in a growing season and even when you compensate for optimized growth cycles wavelengths and light reuse consider the amount of led power you will need to grow this crop indoors.

They attack the common man by claiming that a small private pond is navigable water and therefore under their purview and then wonder why anyone associated with real manufacturing farming or power generation considers them lower than the pond scum that they hold so dear.  What we need are real honesttogod common sense environmental laws designed to keep our shared air and water clean but also very finite in the jurisdiction of the federal government to regulate private property.  No sane person wants dirty air and water but forcing companies to continually upgrade existing facilities to the next big thing in pollution controls while our economic competitors couldnt care less about theirs is an artificial hinderance to progress.  Weve spent billions getting to where were at and now are spending billions more to capture the small remaining amounts while China and India are pumping out so much pollution that you cant breathe outside Beijing any given day.  The simple solution to this is market driven if the majority of product importation Giants such as walmart simply said in a unified voice we wont import from countries that do not have basic pollution controls in place then theyd be up and running in days.  The problem with that is it would also destroy the worlds manufacturing economy in minutes so no one does it. Meanwhile the EPA still worries about and fines regular people for small amounts farm runoff in a private pond.  If they were sane wed have companies citizens and politicians reply with sanity.

The warm weather has acted like a time machine turning the clock more than a month forward in places.gtIn the Southeast locations are seeing spring arrive up to four weeks early according to the U.S. National Phenology Network spring leaf index. Spring coming earlier is another hallmark of climate change.In central NC the pollen allergy season started about Valentines Day  and the lawn mowing season started about Presidents Day . Thirty years ago the common wisdom in this part of the country was that you didnt want to plant anything suseptable to frost prior to Tax Day  But increasingly were seeing trees flowers and bushes come into leaves and blooms in February. Some say not to conflate weather with climate but even the USDA acknowledged the climate had actually changed here several years ago when they reassigned this area a warmer Plant Hardiness Zone number in  as an update to the plant hardiness zones that had been standard from . The Central Piedmont area went from mostly being classified as a to mostly being b and the whole Eastern part of the state went from a mix of b and a to solidly a.

Its tough to understand especially if one does not consider themselves a living animal interacting with the biosphere. Let me explain I have personally experienced more than  degrees of temperature variability today and Im doing fine. The city outside is virtually devoid of life and Im doing fine. The wetlands behind the hill are polluted and Im doing fine. Clearly when I use the phrase our surrounding environment that I do not literally mean the area outside my house. If the trees in your neighbourhood died from a fungus for example you would probably be fine. The reason why that phrase is seemingly misleading is because we dont really live in our habitat at least not in the way most people think.Sure  we have houses caves and apartments but all that stuff is just shelter. Our habitat includes all areas within which we may find appropriate food shelter protection and mates for reproduction. Thus our habitat includes all of the land we use to sustain our population. When this is taken into account one quickly realizes that most of the earths terrestrial surface has become our habitat with varying degrees of dependency. However we must consider the fact that the biosphere is comprised of interconnected interdependent ecosystems  changes that occur within one will affect them all to some degree.

What I dont have is the ability to live out my meager dream.  And I mean meager!  Buy a cheap rambler in an okay enough neighborhood and maybe afford a decent used car.Instead Im watching housing prices rise I have to deal with the other people in my life of my own generation who dont want to make the compromises like moving to a rural area and taking a longer commute to get to work or they dont want old stuff so millennials shot themselves in the foot too on top of the change of circumstances.Im not like most people my age Im still driving my first car I moved out on my own at  Ive lived in apartments and struggled through years of contract work to now get a permanent position somewhere albeit through another company as a IT support provider.  I have saved  I have to blow away my savings every so often to take care of things like medical bills car repairs or the occasional issue that comes up  usually due to faulty technology on some other businesses side like how TaxAct screwed me on my income taxes via glitched software....total shit.Ever known the joy of clearing out your savings to pay the IRS due to a TaxAct glitch?Ever enjoyed social networking to get your car fixed under cost with the aid of your own two hands so you could pay off K of medical debt while your S.O. struggles to find a job that wont useabuse them and will keep them around for some time rather than make some dumb business mistake that destroys the whole company  you think local is better than corporate most local businesses are shady as fuck.Ever enjoyed being in the company of mostly baby boomers who blame all of your problems on your unwillingness to work and your laziness and your carelessness which whenever it fucking suits them they love how even keel you seem to be even though youre almost always stresswise three cents short of grabbing the first sharp object nearby?Right now Im trying to find a damn house near where I work everyone says it sucks and now is not the time to buy  but Im paying  a fucking month on a  bedroom one bath apartment that is a mold hole and has shitty neighbors that cause car wrecks in the parking lot and management who does not give a fuck unless their ass is on the line.  Id RATHER be putting that  into a bloody mortgage.  Ill tell you something as much financial finagling as Ive had to do over the fucking years to make ends meet one thing I can hold to and FOREVER hold to  is I have NEVER ONCE in over  years EVER missed a single bloody rent payment! NEVER ONCE!  How about your mortgage lenders take a look at THAT.  You WILL get your money.  Because Priorities.  The hardest thing to keep moneywise is a ROOF over your head.  Water? There are faucets at work.  Food?  There are all sorts of degrading or do what you got to do situations you can find free food at or earn it from.  But shelter.....something has to fucking change.Right now Im here with . in my savings accouint again  so I have to start over all over again.  And Im sure something else will come and wipe it out before I can get the massive hurdle of owning a home around it.And then the boomers say you dont know what owning a house entails  yes I do.  Im a son of a single mother!  I was RECRUITED at age  to do things like plumbing outlets.  I learned to do drywall  by myself  at age  because I broke a wall in my room.  Hell the reason our apartment is not entirely a shithole is because I can do most of the things maintenance can do  faster and better! Ive caulked windows installed toilets installed sinks faucets cleaned rain gutters painted houses removed termite damage removed pests dragged the maggot infested carcass of a dead raccoon that crawled into the crawlspace and died fixed leaks saved  flooded bathrooms in my lifetime.  I watched our bathroom renovation when I was  and asked questions.  Dont tell me what I dont know about home ownership.  I practically WAS a fucking home owner as a kid!  Sure mom was fronting the bill but I was fronting the tools.  And a lot of my work is STILL there and working  years later.  My plumbing never leaked and worked the first time!  My wiring was clean properly polarized and up to code.  Screw you people who say I cant afford it.  Its not THAT expensive if you use the tools parts and do the job properly!  Savings would not piss me off so much if I were in a house and not throwing money away on renting.And you fucking boomers are a part of the problem with your investment housing.  You come here and buy up all of our basic little homes like the ones I want  little  story . bath  bedroom ramblers and so fourth and then drive the costs up by renovating them and flipping them.  Fuck you.  Fuck you for creating gated trailer parks for  that I would kill to live in even if I lost value.  I never thought Id see the day a house smaller than my  childhood home would cost half a million dollars but it does.Dont even get me started on yard work  I find zen in it.  Probably one reason Im so angry and using the fbomb so much here.Now lets talk work.  Im lucky I found a place as a permanent hire for the most part but there are many others who cannot.  Business is greedy  and you corporate mainstream loving dumbshits that say dont blame corporate greed its your problem  well fuck you.  Greed IS the problem.  Greed is why people are buying cheap houses and flipping them.  Greed is why corporate America hires cheap labor for all but the most important tasks and pays them peanuts for something that would have been a livingenough wage  years ago at the latest.  You cant save when you are struggling to make ends meet and you cant move up in life if you have nothing to save and everything tops out around ish an hour unless you go back to school rack up thousands in student debt and learn an  year career that your life may already be half over by the time you get in the field anyway and you might start out being paid the same as you were doing regular people jobs before.So yeah fuck the system fuck us all and fuck humanity.  It not like Im looking to get a mansion a Mercedes and start investing in stocks and traveling the world.  Im looking to move into a cheap shitty fixer upper drive what I can afford and MAYBE if someday I get the big stuff out of the way maybe I can have fun investing traveling every once in a long long while and enjoying the fun stuff.You cant work with a system that does not work.

Like I guess one of her clients was a farmer with a couple million dollars worth of grain harvested a few million dollars worth of equipment and a ton of land. But he was leasing all this land from people in the area and he had to go door to door telling people he wasnt going to be able to pay them back. So my moms job was basically negotiating with the bank the farmer and the land owners. In a way she is kind of amoral about the situation and just tries to represent her clients the best she can. I have had long email conversations with my brother. Again someone who I have to schedule appointments with almost months in advance if I want to see and talk to. I keep telling him how I think technology is going to displace more jobs than it creates in the future. He disagrees with me pretty fervently. I get the impression from conversations with him that he thinks things are rough going to get harder but that humanity will pull through and adjust in a similar way that we emerged from the great depression and WW.My dad is depressed and angry at all the wrong people for the wrong reasons if you ask me. I hate to talk shit about my family because they have done so much for me so its like... I guess kind of hard. I think my dad is a bit of a bigot and a racist. I think he buys into the idea of the world going to shit but only a few will survive. But he is so unmotivated that he doesnt work. We are well off enough for him not to need to work. Yeah yeah here come the shit storm of attacks. But he has in a sense lost his purpose in life. Where he used to be a provider now hes more of a dependent and its basically destroyed his psyche.

Ideally youd exclude the brain and spinal cord tissue as inputs because of prions.Ideally youd run the food source through two disparate intermediate species before consumption of any outputs to deal with any possible disease transmission.I see a food processing and live surplus storage system that would operate without refrigeration incorporating elements such as Black soldier fly larvae to process the initial inputs without having to engage in any hands on processing  primary outputs being the larvae in quantity Larvae fed to fish in an aquaponics system  outputs being fish and vegetablesherbs Larvae fed to chickens  outputs being eggs and chickens Pigs as a bulk storage for any surpluses  outputs as a storage mechanism for system surpluses as well as meatfat and piglets as a trade item.Also other small livestock might also have a role such as Pigeons in a dovecote to glean nutrition from the surrounding area  output being eggs amp squabb Small insect eating bats in a variation of the dovecote  outputs being inputs to the black soldier fly larvae guinea pigs and rabbits as processing systems for grass and other vegetable inputs  outputs being meat as well as a smaller scale barter item.So it might look likeinput gt black soldier fly gt larvae gt chicken gt egg gt eattrade gt surplus to pigsinput gt black soldier fly gt larvae gt fish gt fishmeatherbsvegetables gt eattrade gt surplus to pigsinput gt black soldier fly gt larvae gt fish gt fishmeatherbsvegetables gt chicken gt egg gt eattrade gt surplus to pigsThis could be made to work.,collapse,dfxtbxt,1,t5_2qhw9

Even the Late Bronze Age collapse seems to have been sudden locally but to still have taken a century to play itself out on a more global level. A slow collapse is the most likely scenario in our case too with one caveat  that assumes that the nuclear arsenals end their existence through decay and the loss of the technical expertise needed to maintain them. If there is a nuclear war it will obviously be a very fast collapse. So slow collapse globally with dramatic episodes on a more local level. A slow collapse is a very bad scenario though  a fast collapse but without using nukes is the best option from the perspective of preserving knowledge and expertise. Slow collapse ensures that knowledge is lost and that is the worst consequence of collapse. ,collapse,dgdu7nd,3,t5_2qhw9

Its funny to me ironic how many of the most educated science promoting people ignore the mountains of findings on human behaviour that clearly demonstrate the humans are wired for short termisim and are not really in control of themselves........The destruction of the natural world is not the result of global capitalism industrialisation Western civilisation or any flaw in human institutions.
