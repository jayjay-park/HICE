804123,0,t1_cfle93q,I know this is an old comment but I love the app and used it all the time but then an upgrade came out and I can no longer get the most recent version on my iPad . Will the app ever be made backwards compatible again? ,sentinelsmultiverse,cgvokle,1,t5_2x8g6
853195,0,t3_23vwt4,I dont hate the game but I have a few problems with the design that make me less a fan of it than my friends despite or because of? often best getting how all the pieces work.The core issue from the player side is youre using decks but it doesnt generally have the flow of a deck building game. Some characters can especially end up stuck doing extremely little if their initial shuffle is bad and only a few characters can really fix this for others. Further I can see the concern that the nature of the deck mechanics often make you think too much about the randomness of the deck and its proclivities to keep thoughts on being the character. Theres a sense of immersion one could want in this game and the awkward flow is detrimental to that.Exacerbation of that is how there are a lot of similar but different effects in the game that can stack up and interact in myriad ways. In comparison to an RPG the lack of someone running the NPCs makes the game clunkier and the CCGclever mechanics in the game can require a lot of headspace to track over several players actions. Its also very easy for many villain decks to suddenly wreck one or more players ability to do interesting things and that can be a big frustration when the deck fails them right after.Finally theres the added wrinkle of the environment deck adding even more complexity and there are potentially a bunch of different interactions which can greatly throw off the games difficulty. For example we had a game with IIRC the Baron on the Moon and a streak of a few meteor showers just wrecked us while playing the same location against the Swan was hilarious as her birds kept getting wiped.I think theyve done well with their mechanisms but I would take an utterly different tack if I were to build my own version of Sentinels. Rather than have powers as random deck cards expand the character to have a bigger power set and have ones deck represent time power and opportunity. Have momentum cards that heroes can gather and spend to pay for bigger effects and let villain cards interact with those. Taking more of a deckbuilding flow to the game allows for a conflux of story and mechanics arcing together and the central card concept allows environments and villains to have a more standardized interface that is potentially easier to get. The fewer discrete effects one has to watch at all times the easier to focus on the things that matter.,sentinelsmultiverse,ch19hog,3,t5_2x8g6
1015319,0,t1_chj1cu6,Its worth noting that the promo pack will be different from the original promos so they retain their value. Most likely different borders or something similar.,sentinelsmultiverse,chjp66f,3,t5_2x8g6
1140829,0,t3_276c5j,In my experience having more than  players unbalances the game for the reasons you mentioned. I would not recommend it. Perhaps you can play two  player games instead. You dont need two copies of the game to do that given its modular nature. ,sentinelsmultiverse,chxycw7,2,t5_2x8g6
2383746,0,t3_2k2bvp,Lead developer here! Sorry its been a while but this post slipped under the radar while we were in Australia I think.Thats a good suggestion and matches up with general UI best practices.

11749647,0,t1_dgrtya4,Agreed. I really dislike playing Miss Information. Based purely on funfactor I dont think Id ever pick her. My friend and I are trying to improve the Game Statistics by recording more games against all of the villain variantsmodes that only have a handful of games Miss Information Advanced  Challenge only has  previously recorded gameAgainst villains who have lost to the heroes every game recorded like Miss Information Advanced  Challenge were restricting ourselves to random teams until the villian wins a game. We were really lucky? to get Haka in slot  and someone with environment destruction in slot . After we get all of them to somewhere between  and  recorded games well probably move on to something else and I can forget Miss Information exists again ,sentinelsmultiverse,dgruoew,1,t5_2x8g6
