9508715,0,t3_5b1khz,It does appear that way. I personally think the Americans EU NATO etc. sold out the original FSA despite being major players in egging on this revolution from the start. Now they focus on their new allies the YPG now called SDF for PR reasons who are more concerned with carving out territory for themselves than saving Syria from Assad family. They are even begging for truce and cooperation with the SAARussia axis and USA seemed to have toned down on calling for Assad to step down and rather focus on defeating ISIS. The only player that is seriously supporting the FSA is Turkey and Erdogan is not playing his cards correctly despite starting Operation Euphrates Shield out of desperation.

SAA clearly have more than enough men to spare if they wanted to spare them. Look on Facebook or Twitter photos of new busloads of troops arriving in Kuweiris are being published every other day and these troops didnt materialise out of thin air. The only conclusion is that no significant reinforcements were sent to southwestern Aleppo to inflict a crushing defeat on the Mujahideen because the SAA believes that committing all available resources to the upcoming SAA strategic offensive is a smarter investment. gt ALEPPO Im talking about Aleppo.

They do as they want but I prefer politics and religion to be separated and the law of Man to be superior to any religious law as well. Also I dont give a single damn about Israel the country might disappear that I would care more for my next pair of socks I guess.The problem with the rebels is that I dont see your leftist centrists and right wing I see right wing movement like SSNP with the SAA though.... What groups are they part of ? How do they compete with groups like Jabhat Fateh al Sham Jaish al Islam and Arhar al Sham for instance ? When Assad is gone how are these people going to implement their ideas against superior islamist forces exactly ?As to your th point I dont like when people call the other side rats or goatfuckers and I never use these words personnaly. Even terrorists though some rebels share a good deal of ideology with people who murdered cowardly many of my fellow citizens ISIS. I dont like the shia crusade neither since I dont have any religious faith and I think its not a proper reason to go and kill other people but  I have more general sympathy for shia because they never attacked my country Im French and I find their Islam more subtil and liberal than sunnis and their weird Caliph worshipping. Also I never heard of a video where shia militia would say they were happy to go and kill sunnis and I say sunnis not takfiris or whatever brutal version of Islam so Id be happy if you provide me with some granted that I dont speak arabic. As far as I know they arent helping the SAA to implement a shiasharia ruled society contrary to huge groups on the rebel side which I never hear talk about secularism right for everyone to follow its own religion freely dress up as they want etc.One last thing I dont buy the  victims are Assads fault thing. What are you implying that we would be better off with ISIS at the head of Syria for instance because they kill less people ? To me ideology and international equilibrium is far more important than who kills the most of people. Also a lot of these people wouldnt have died if the rebels didnt chose to fight with arms fighting for the interest of foreign partners funding them. Civilian deaths are as much the fault of the rebels than the SAA. You cant go to war and expect nothing in return.

10068378,0,t3_5jugt3,I generally have to agree. I think you have to accept that the Regime can be expanding on the map but rotting at the same time. Im partial to looking at thing through economicfiscal lenses perhaps too much but the situation for Assad fiscally amp economically is brutal. Sure its been bad the whole war but not this bad. Its falling apart. Its bad enough that there are serious discussions about removing the bread subsidies. All signs point to this coming to a head soon. Theyve been funding the budgetwar effort through a combination of Iranian creditloans and reserves at the Central Bankother public banks. Local reserves are out they tapped them this year though theyve been parasitically pulling more private money into public banks to then fund the budget because thats always a good idea and it isnt likely that Iran or Russia are going to extend billions in new credit lines. They do have . billion worth of gold but  not enough  good luck selling it they tried in  and got shut down.  national budget is less than a third of what the  budget was in real termsand the deficit is the biggest its been yet riddle me that one? Electricity rationing has been a thing for a long time but before Daesh took the gas fields it became worse because of a delayed fuel shipment reason for the delay? Payment issues. If they had trouble paying for fuel before Daesh took over  million m of domestic gas production how the hell are they going to pay for the added burden now? Projections for  preDaesh taking over Palmyrathe gas fields had costs to provide fuel for electricity generation being roughly  of the total value of the budget  whats it going to be now? Blackouts are reaching  hours a day in parts of Damascus. Regime efforts to provide shortterm solutions to the fiscal crisis amp the severe lack of foreign currency are only going to further destroy the general economy banning lists of imports centralizing pricing raising new fees amp increasing existing ones on all walks of life jacking up reserve requirements so the Central Bank can scrape together more funds etc etc.Regime cant pay to maintain any kind of national army I believe its a big reason why youre seeing so many militias pop up actually the reason I started looking into them. Assad cant pay but the IRGC can or the handful of warprofiteering members of the warlord class that now exists. These militias pay significantly better than whats left of the SAA amp they give you protection for dodging conscription. As the central governments fiscal position continues to deteriorate the incentives to join militias are only going to become more pronounced. Granted no one militia is more powerful than Assad but as a whole direct control in Regime territory is slipping. You see local actors acting out in ways that would have been unimaginable prewar blatantly defying the central government when its in their interest. Ex  What happens after another year of the central governments position being eroded? Another year of better paying militias growing in number size amp strength. In a kind of sick cycle the growth of these militias is parasitic to the legitimate economy further cutting into the central governments revenue base. As an aside back to that point  Regime cant pay to maintain any kind of national army maybe that is what this th Corp is about. Wages are better than militia wages and allegedly are going to be paid for by one of Assads foreign backers. Pure speculation but if its the Russians paying I do wonder if this is an attempt at recreating a fighting force directly loyal to the central government because outside of the remnants of the th AD SRG and SF the there isnt much left as far as fighting forces that are directly loyal to Assad but checkpoint holding conscripts. Maybe I suffer from a bit of confirmation bias but I just fail to see how the situation is sustainable as is. Every data point Im looking at besides nicely colored maps suggests that the Regime is rotting. Barring a complete collapse amongst the rebel groups or a complete shutdown of support Assad is a lot further from winning than a lot of people are making it out to be.,SyrianRebels,dbjxkyo,6,t5_3fohl

11001829,0,t3_5x3la2,The comparison between Syria and Iraq is flawed for many reasons. Syrians  initially not limited to Sunni Arabs  rose up against Assad before there was talk of toppling the regime. In rebel held areas there is already a vast network although it is under severe pressure by extremists of local councils if given more support could mitigate the effects of a power vacuum. That said Im not in favour of invading Syria and ousting Assad by military means. The resulting chaos will only lead to more instability. I dont understand why it has to be a binary decision. Its never black and white but its what everyone is adhering to. IS says we or the infidels Obama says allinboots on the ground or no intervention Assad says me or the jihadists and so on. You dont have to take out Assad and his regime to stop the killing of civillians degrading his airforce and other forms of punitive strikes on military targets can achieve that goal. I understand the reservations people have against the rebels. A rebel victory  in its current composition  could be just as bad as a regime victory. Weve all seen what happens when Nusra and other jihadist groups take over Druze and Alawite villages. But that cant be an excuse to stand down and let the regime murder civilians in oppositionheld areas.There are good reasons to support Assad. If youre living in an Alawite village in Tartous or Latakia its perfectly reasonable to pick up arms. People who are living in the West and supporting Assad from behind a laptop are In my view morally flawed I support a secular Syria just isnt going to cut it. As for the other group I just dont understand why they think letting things continue down this path is a good idea. And Im not talking about the next couple of years but the long term. The pressure in a barrel is building the lid flies off and your reaction is to put it back in its place fasten it with chains and put a Shabiha on steroids on top of it to make sure it doesnt happen again.

11519794,0,t1_dg1l9tr,Crap you maliciously said that the claim was disproven but it isnt so if Putin want to prove the contrary must open the base to the Un otherwise is hiding something in the opposition area the evidences have been already collected,SyrianRebels,dg1rqph,1,t5_3fohl
11539196,0,t1_dg3shy7,Rebels tend to win in manonman engagements due to better morale discipline and overall fighting skill honestly. Assadist troops only ever advance if the area has been flattened by airstrikes but rebels have built an entire warrior subculture around deepbattle shock troops Inghimasi and precision fire TOWs and snipers while the regime prides itself on the farless glamerous and more destructive method of fire saturation.,SyrianRebels,dg3yxlc,1,t5_3fohl

11589463,0,t1_dg9nj9m,Ignore my previous comments  you have already responded elsewhere.It is so very refreshing to read such words.  Do you believe it possible that a transitional government will eventually come into play?  A government without Assad and his cronies but a government willing to protect its people regardless of their sect.,SyrianRebels,dg9o8z9,1,t5_3fohl
11600777,0,t1_dgay72d,Thats really interesting! You should definitely make a post about it thats important stuff. It was weird that the article only mentioned Ahrar since the siege is maintained by JaF no way Ahrar did it unilaterally without involvement of HTS.,SyrianRebels,dgaygmv,1,t5_3fohl

11683271,0,t1_dgkax2c,Main problem is they dont have that many men. Its probably just a few thousand when you include Badiyah and East Qalamoun together. These are sparsely populated areas.And they have no way of recruiting more for an offensive against Assad because their salaries are entirely paid by MOC so theyre kind of at Jordans mercy ,SyrianRebels,dgkbdqv,1,t5_3fohl

Why do I still support the Syrian revolution? Because its the only human and reasonable solution  for all of Syrians. And because I know the Syrians can do far better in this regards than all the possible idiots are lying about them already since decades. Ill support ideals like those of the Syrian revolution as long as I breathe. So if you like tell me its not my problem my heart tells me something else. ,SyrianRebels,dgq3dsc,8,t5_3fohl
