154085,0,t3_1vuj9i,Well I will explain all of the points you mentioned all of this info can be found on our Unobtanium.io website.proof of no premine or any company involvement New innovations implemented a new metric scale system that replaces m and u integers from bitcoin. Working on new security and also we have a partnership in the works that will add a layer on to our protocol.more technical innovations and benefits of the UNO network also for network stats see the main page We are currently running at  THs with a difficulty of over . You can compare this to other coins but remember UNO is a rare substance we trade in Kilos similar to gold.,Unobtanium,cevzcn4,2,t5_2zkhx

565677,0,t3_20gu1k,if it goes fast all of a sudden keep stability in mind. The last crash was only possible in my opinion because there was absolutely no buysupport and it fell like a rock when the first  of the buysupport got bombed on high levels when nobody expected it. So if there would still have been orders on the way down uno would not have fallen so far so quick and maybe the dumper would not even have dumped on better support. I know you dont like having too much btc at cryptsy but think about support on lower level in the next rally in case of dumps so we dont get destroid completely from the first mediumsizedump. The higher we get this BEFORE the halving the higher the halvingparty will go because we will start higher.May this adventure be a success this time.I see unomarkets coming to exchanges like the ltcmarkets. We should demand that from several exchanges! I want Unoltc unoxpm unonmc unoppc unoeverything else. so main message was buysupport on lower levels absolutely doesnt need to be pulled by everybody only because market went  higher in a moment. See you at the party  ,Unobtanium,cg4kn29,1,t5_2zkhx

3362804,0,t1_cpb4tg6,Hey Mark! Good to year from ya! it has been a little while. How has Summer been treatin ya?? Although I have taken CryptoTown quite a bit further than just crypto the reasoning is that it seems necessary to address culture holistically. Its not just about the tech. Tech is actually easier than the getting it done on the ground part! Minds change slow but I think there are ways to speed it up or at least find some good direction.,Unobtanium,cpbl27s,1,t5_2zkhx
