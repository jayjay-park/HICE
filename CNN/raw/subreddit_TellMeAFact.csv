4028962,0,t3_36mcjn,Heres the thing. You said a jackdaw is a crow.Is it in the same family? Yes. No ones arguing that.As someone who is a scientist who studies crows I am telling you specifically in science no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either. Theyre not the same thing.If youre saying crow family youre referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people call the black ones crows? Lets get grackles and blackbirds in there then too.Also calling someone a human or an ape? Its not one or the other thats not how taxonomy works. Theyre both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But thats not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow which is not true unless youre okay with calling all members of the crow family crows which means youd call blue jays ravens and other birds crows too.

5447290,0,t1_cw7uz2g,The problem with the original release of those albums was not audio compression as in reduced file size. Standard audio CDs always hold uncompressed audio.The problem was dynamic range compression which basically reduces the difference in volume between loud and quiet sounds in the recording allowing the whole thing to sound louder at the expense of quality. This has sadly become the norm on modern albumsThe root of the problem is that louder music is almost always subjectively judged as sounding better. Of course the same effect could be had without destroying dynamic range by just turning the volume up a little bit when playing it back but when a quieter album comes on most people wont realise that the reason it sounds less good is that it isnt loud enough.,TellMeAFact,cw7xzsn,26,t5_37mb4

6309791,0,t3_41z9n1,In Operation Midnight Climax the CIA set up several brothels in San Francisco California to obtain a selection of men who would be too embarrassed to talk about the events. The men were dosed with LSD the brothels were equipped with oneway mirrors and the sessions were filmed for later viewing and study. In other experiments where people were given LSD without their knowledge they were interrogated under bright lights with doctors in the background taking notes. The subjects were told that their trips would be extended indefinitely if they refused to reveal their secrets. The people being interrogated this way were CIA employees U.S. military personnel and agents suspected of working for the other side in the Cold War. Longterm debilitation and several deaths resulted from this. Heroin addicts were bribed into taking LSD with offers of more heroin. ,TellMeAFact,cz6up9m,6,t5_37mb4

6429704,0,t3_43pnra,The  BC Eruption of Thera also known as the Minoan eruption appears to be a contributing factor in the decline and eventual disappearance of Minoan Civilization.It has been theorized that this may be the source of the Atlantis myth in antiquity.  You have a large technologically advance and rich maritime empire centered on a large island. It appears that the eruption did not destroy Minoan civilization instantly as there is further building after the eruption but it does coincide with the beginning of the decline. One could see how easily the tale could be exaggerated and mythologized in  years between the actual eruption and Platos account that got passed down to us. The Minoan civilization was ancient and mythological to the classical Greeks.,TellMeAFact,czkdb98,6,t5_37mb4

8304955,0,t1_d5fmxd2,Thanks for the very informative reply and the overview of your thesis. I was realizing the same thing as I typed my earlier replythat she was truly victimized but by the scare itself. So shes still a victim. That may be an in for helping her face what really happened. Shes been going to family counseling with a real therapist who also is very aware of how damaging the SRA scare was so I hope they cover some of that territory.

11706499,0,t1_dgg21ub,I know what youre meaning and why of course  its impossible for us to get a picture of the Milky Way as a spiral but in the spirit of pedantry and as an excuse to post some impressive photos of our galaxy its not strictly true to say that any photo of the Milky Way isnt the Milky Way.Edit Not meaning to imply youre not aware of this by the way especially as the COBE shot is in your link  but I thought it might interest people to highlight that we can see our own galaxy albeit edgeon.Of course we orbit the Milky Way something like  light years from the centre and it extends quite a bit further out and any photo thats recognisably of a spiral is going to be that bit within our orbit  it just looks like a mess of stars looking the other way.Its also helpful to map the photos onto galactic coordinates that line up the Milky Way with the middle of the shot. And most importantly its very useful to take photos in infrared or microwaves or radio waves. Thats because visible light is of the right wavelength to be heavily scattered by dust and the galaxy is one hell of a dusty place. Infrared is long enough wavelength to pass through the dust unimpeded and we can get some beautiful shots from COBE in infrared shows our galaxy edgeon from our point in of course from WISE again in infrared from Planck a range of wavelengths clustering around the microwavesThough Axel Mellinger has been able to make composite photos in visible light that show our galaxy quite clearlyandI strongly recommend following the link in the latter to  which is a zoomable version thats quite breathtaking,TellMeAFact,dgmyjgl,1,t5_37mb4
