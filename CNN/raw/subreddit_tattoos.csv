404902,0,t1_cfmabuy,Thank you that was very informative! Do you mind if I ask who the artist you are seeing is? if not I totally understand And how have you felt so far with the process all things considered? Im not one for willy nilly decisions and I like the thought of taking my time and having an artist who also would take his time and discuss my choice with himor her. I also like the idea of it being treated as an important process not just walk in get it and go. That being said I think the points you have brought forth are probably going to lead me not being able to get the tattoo in the manner I had imagined I might. So I guess Ill have to wait until the time is right. Thanks for you feedback though!,tattoos,cfmqg2v,1,t5_2qj9g
405015,0,t3_1yp7ru,Could you not cover it with clingfilm or something? Not sure if that might help. Itd keep the dirt out but I can imagine the sweat buildup would not be good.,tattoos,cfmqv8h,1,t5_2qj9g
405427,0,t1_cfms0rg,I mean I suppose you could go over it again and put crisp lines in the letters. But unless you do some laser removal sessions that spread out ink will still be around it. So it would have blurry edges.Or theres this route with the white but thatll still have to be touched up again the next time it blurs out. Generally speaking if you know that youll have to get it touched up its best just not to get it tattooed. A good tattoo with solid design done by a good artist will last a long time before you might want to get it touched up due to fading or whatnot.,tattoos,cfmsejp,2,t5_2qj9g

530595,0,t3_207l9s,I had the exact opposite experience with my artist. I came in with selfmade artwork for my first tattoo and what he came up with was as close as he thought would come out well given the size constraints and the intricacy of my design. For my second tattoo my request was more abstract. I had an idea of what I wanted as far as I know an entirely original idea but no actual design in mind. All I knew is what I wanted it to depict where I wanted it and that it would be in the same style as my first tattoo. What he came up with was totally original and exactly what I wanted.Did he do some research to find motifs and inspiration? Im certain he did. I know I did when I drew up my design. A good artist will know how to take an idea from somewhere and turn it into something original. Also a good artist should respect your artwork and your desires as his customer.tldr ditch that guy. He doesnt deserve your money. A good artist will work with you and respect you.Also my artist is Clark Kent  Slave to the Needle in Seattle and he does fantastic work.

549541,0,t3_20fhox,. In general comfortable loose fitting clothes. But I have no idea where you want this tattoo. At the very least you can wear a bikini top and just untie the back of it for the session.. It depends on a lot of things from your own pain tolerance to how heavy handed the tattoo artist is. But in general it will hurt bad enough to grit your teeth and make a fist but not bad enough that you would pass out or die from pain.. While healing avoid materials that have lots of lint and any type of garment that would excessively rub the tattoo.,tattoos,cg2qm7e,3,t5_2qj9g

I didnt get quotes done but I choose things about me that represent me have deep meaning to me always will and remind me that no matter what life throws at me I will always have my passions and inner strength and nothing or no one can take that from me. I wouldnt recommend getting a quote that overly common and everyone has but if thats what you want your doing this for you and no one else.,tattoos,chs9fyt,2,t5_2qj9g

1123141,0,t1_chvyfke,Watercolor tattooing hasnt really existed long enough for there to be any real evidence of how well they age so all I can say is what Ive heard in the past from people more knowledgable than I. Watercolor tattoos should age well if you use a process similar to the one OPs artist used which is to use solid outlines. As I understand it something about the solid black lines keep the ink from spreading as much. More than that even if the colors were to blend the piece would still maintain a discernible shape instead of flowing into a blob.As always if this is something youd be interested in find an artist who does the style well and ask them their thoughts about it.EDIT My first point about the solid lines was apparently somewhat misguided.

1207841,0,t3_27x135,Shin hurt me surprisingly little.  Chest can be rough especially around the collar bones and the sternum.  Your mileage may vary everyone takes it differently.  Eat a good meal have plenty of sugar on hand.  The big tip is just relax and breathe through it  Let it hurt and dont fight it because it will hurt no matter what you do.  Struggling against that just makes it worse.  Breathe.  During my first few times music was critically important as was the Litany Against Fear from Dune  Fear is the mindkiller.  Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.  I will face my fear.  I will allow it to pass over and through me and when it is gone only I will remain.  Eventually youll get into a rhythm and itll get easier.  No matter how long Ive been in the chair though some days are better than others.  Sometimes that shit just hurts!As for the images...  You should talk to the artist you want to work with.  If you click with himher share your ideas whatever they are.  My artists have either steered me to something I hadnt even imagined that I ended up liking way more than my original ideas or gotten excited about what I proposed even when outside their usual wheelhouse.  Both are cool outcomes and have led to a body of work haha  that I am very happy with.Dont worry about being a noob and dont try to pretend you arent.  It is pretty clear to an artist whos been around and whos a first timer not the least of which is the clean expanse of skin.  They are happy to work on both types and most are very kind and comforting to newbies.  They want you to have a good experience as much as you want to have one. As for price while you shouldnt let yourself get suckered into an expensive tattoo from a lessthancapable artist cost should be way down on your list of concerns.  DO NOT EVER TRY TO GET A CHEAP TATTOO!!!  Good tattoos arent cheap and cheap tattoos arent good.  Know the shop minimum ask the artist or the shop help what the usual rate is and extrapolate from there.  They can guesstimate and will what a normal sized piece will cost about.  They will rarely give you a solid quote.  They never want to be haggled with but they will hook you up if you click if they really want to do the piece if you do a lot of work with them etc. I tip around  most of the time.  A  session Ill round up to .  It might be a little excessive but Ive never had an artist complain.  It shows that you appreciate their work and their time.  Heres a secret tip from a person with  hours in a chair...  Shops LOVE food.  Bring your guy and his mates some tasty donuts or BBQ from that cool place in town or home made cookies etc.  It sounds silly but they love that shit!Another tip  respect and take care of the shop help and they will take care of you.  Sometimes they are apprentices or hangerson but often they are totally happy doing what they are doing love the art and the customers enjoy proximity to good artists for their own work etc.  Tip em a little here and there.  Make sure to include them in food.  Talk to em about stuff. Theyre usually funny and good with people.  They can always hook you up  free shop shirts and stickers getting you on the book with a hardtocatch artist getting you in touch with artists who sometimes dont want to be bothered etc. Most of all enjoy the journey.

The thing with these tattoos is you dont have to go to a Hr World renowned artist who specialized in large format work.  What you want is very straight forward so find someone who has simple and very clean lines and text and go to them.  When you do they might have some input and definitely listen to it  but it is totally fine to go to them a font that you want.  Some tattoo artists might get annoyed if you tell them exactly what you want in terms of larger pieces.  But having an exact idea for something simple like this is absolutely fine.  They still might have some input to give and listen to them  they are the artist... but most will be  willing to do what you want no problem. ,tattoos,cink2hb,1,t5_2qj9g

Rather than just using numbers you could create a great little piece of art that reminds you of the feeling of achievement you have and stands alone as an attractive piece too. Is there anything you are capable of now that you werent before that you love? It could be personal in thst sense even if its quite abstract. A phoenix is also a popular choice for a theme of rebirth. Getting a tattoo to celebrate something is a great idea and im sure if you sat with a tattoo artist and told them the things you like and the feelings you want to sum up they could come up with something!

The design looks great I really like it more with a bit darker outline.. besides that its awesome though. If they give you a lot of grief about it find a new artist. Any decent artist will always take your opinion and wants into account unless its super unrealistic. In that case they should just explain why something wouldnt work. I.e. tiny tattoos with too much smashed up detail that they know will bleed together and not last well. Or a tattoo in mostly one color that will fade easier like light yellow or white The only time Ive seen a artist advise against a tattoo was a male friends yellow tri force on top of his hand and it has to get recolored almost every year because the yellow alone fades too quick on hands. He still got it though and doesnt mind getting it recolored.... seems like a waste of money to me.,tattoos,cjjkfup,3,t5_2qj9g

Many Chinese characters have traditional versions that are composed of more lines and such and would probably be more aesthetically pleasing but shui doesnt. However this literally just means water so if you wanted to select a different Chinese character that has a relationship with Confucianism you could do so easily. ,tattoos,ck9aa8g,2,t5_2qj9g

1882594,0,t3_2g69ch,Stippling has been around a long time. Current wave is largely influenced by London tattooers who brought back the sacred geometry sorta vibe. Its definitely a stylized look but it can be done really well.Thats an example of some great dotwork the technique allows for a lot of gradation and control over shading just in the concentration of points used. I dont really know what makes it attractive  but I like it. A really consistent dotwork application is kind of like a great mosaic theres a sort of larger image which takes some close appreciation to really understand but the minor bits are skillfully composed as well.This dudes hand tat also mixes line and dotwork. Its also versatile just as a shading technique.,tattoos,ckg1mv8,2,t5_2qj9g

1964009,0,t3_2h6kwl,I have eczema and I can only tell you my experience for my tattoos.For my arm there were slight flareups but not in the area of the tattoo itself. Tattoo went in and as it was healing it was of course itchy. It wasnt too bad and my skin was relatively under control.My chest tattoo was a lot bigger but my skin was also almost free of any of the rash aside from the remnants of an allergic reaction I had a day or two before. I was really vigilant in the coming days to be wearing clean loose clothing and kept where I was sleeping as clean as I could to avoid irritating my skin any more than the tattoo had. Since the first month its acting like normal skin but I still try not to scratch or give any attention to the occasional rash there.Definitely ask a dermatologist because anecdotes arent medical advice and avoid tattooing anywhere that is currently acting up.Also most artists will not tattoo someone with a psoriasis flareup on their skin as the inflammation and blood in the area will distort and change the image more than the normal immune response will. ,tattoos,ckpv5a9,5,t5_2qj9g

2247453,0,t1_clphklx,if you think your tattoo artist is NOT at fault here you seriously need to research tattooing before ever getting another one. this is literally JUST AS BAD as your original.it might not look as bad to you but this design was flawed from the first moment. st off i wouldnt have decided to go with the exact same imagery if you didnt like it the first time... nd there is no emphasis on making the symmetrical parts ACTUALLY symmetrical. rd the SHADING... omg. so bad. black should be black. not with little grey bits throughout.,tattoos,clpi5sc,6,t5_2qj9g

2323405,0,t3_2lskjv,i would just say that it lacked design completion and tattooer skill. there are weird inconsistencies in lineweight and line thickness and some just weird shapes for your images. if you didnt say it was dna i wouldnt have ever guessed. the butterfly is a little wonky too among the other ambiguous shapes. the recognizeable shapes like the octopus and the shark are awesome. overall cool idea nice concept i wish you took it one step further to clean it up but i can be super happy for you if you love it! its definitely always easier to love your own concepts and its cool that you did that for your first. itll mean more in the long run to you and you can always attribute it to a portion of your personal history as opposed to some piece of flash.,tattoos,clyvxeb,2,t5_2qj9g

Thanks for pointing it out though.  I do go in once more to have some final details and touch ups on the girls a bit more detailing on the dresses etc. I highly recommend this place for the atmosphere professionalism and sheer talent of the two artists there Carlos Ransom and Chris Hess.

2419133,0,t3_2n2vrd,Wow. Thanks for the criticism. I do feel I must clarify some things as this is my hard work.  I realize the faces are not perfect but this piece is not finished. We have one more session to finish the girls as Ive only done one pass of color so far.   Their faces are about the size of a nickel which is MUCH more difficult to do than if they were the size of a fist.   I am working from two different screen shots which are the largest screenshots I could get but are still quite small and pixelated. Also keep in mind when this movie was made and the media it was shot on. Its not like Im working from the highest quality reference here but Im doing the best I can with what I have.  Obviously this is a tattoo on skin. Its not flat so there will be some skewing depending on what angle youre looking at. I appreciate the positive comments. I understand the negative comments are just going to happen no matter what. Its art. But its art in progress so please take that into consideration before making negative comments.

Definitely check out his other work. But he should show you the drawing before any needle comes in contact with your skin. If youre not okay with it just say so.

Idealistically the lines of the knots are actually supposed to be made up of one line or multiple lines that are not broken up but continue to form the pattern. These are random shapes and designs way too complex around the edges but again not...knots and much less so around the inside. Also pretty sure they do not use a pretzel or hearts in Celtic styled knots either.This is like someones take on a Celtic knot piece which like a few people said is like modern tribal tattoos a.k.a. a take on traditional possibly hundreds of year old pieces of ink.TLDR  Your artist doesnt know Celtic knots but can sorta fake it...,tattoos,cocjarz,2,t5_2qj9g

Always add a bit more to the estimate. Most places go by hour and it could take longer than they estimate. Plus giving tips is nice.Its been my experience that all artists will draw what you want you just have to give them the details. And if its not what you were thinking theyll try again. Some places do walkins others require an appointment. Then you can set it up to be exactly whenever you want.,tattoos,cp863sh,1,t5_2qj9g

Bigger is often better for tattoos and I dont think youd have wanted a faint and washedout tattoo either  and its going to change a lot as it heals. Dont panic now in that regard.I agree that you should give it some time. It might grow on you or you might never like it. Either is okay. In time you can figure out what you want to do about it.Dont worry about what look you give just if youre happy.

If your concern is that it will be to feminine speak to your artist about this maybe they will have an idea as to how to make it less so. Like maybe just some patches of scales scattered down your leg in a geometric pattern? And in some more bold colors like reds and dark blues. Or maybe even black and grey. Im sure if your artist wants your business and it sounds like you want a huge piece wich means more  for them.

Just be very cautious finding the correct molecule exactly as they are frequently done incorrectly due to a teeny tiny mistake somewhere.,tattoos,crmtkrg,2,t5_2qj9g

4109473,0,t1_cro3suc,Thanks! Initially it was an idea from the artist after I explained him the pun I wanted to have and told him my story but it rapidly grew on me I suppose you can easily understand Im a huge geek just from looking at my style not in a bad way that is Im proud to be how I am This tattoo mainly is a message from me to me Ive been pretty unlucky with love stories see the annotation  next to the hearth? Its to remind drawings from anatomic books. And  because of lack of luck another small detail I like P.You dont see it but there is a pun with three words REAL EYES coming in top processing hence the circuit pattern the information and coming out you have REALIZE far right not visible and REAL LIES bottom right partly visible. Learning to stop allowing anything out of love whenever I feel something isnt right that is something I didnt do a lot in the past.Also are our feelings just chemical reactions or is there more than that?,tattoos,crope9a,1,t5_2qj9g

Patriot and nationalist are used sarcastically at best as straightup insults at worst in Germany. Of course Germany is a bit different than most countries seeing that nationalism lead to one of the worst horrors the world has ever seen just a few decades ago.In Europe in general theres usually the people who dislike the European Union and would rather see more sovereignty for their nations. They probably wouldnt think bad of tattooing your own flag. On the other hand there are people who believe in the European idea and the community of nations to them such a tattoo implies that you put your native country above the others.,tattoos,cs4285a,11,t5_2qj9g

But then I found another design same thing happened...by now I am starting to think I will go find another artist!But he explained his thinking basically he could do any design I wanted but it wont coverup the piece I wanted covered period. Ultimately I found a piece he ran with it and I am thoroughly happy with it...and it covers my old piece quite well even with scarring from previous reworks by other artists.  ,tattoos,cs4u2gm,31,t5_2qj9g

If youve studied history as you note how can you say that tattoos are nothing more than ink on skin?  Hows that different than The Mona Lisa being only ink on canvas?  Sushi being just balls of rice and fish?

And Im from the Pacific NW where the forests here are my second home.  I also really love the look of sacred geometry style tattoos.  The original idea was based on the concept vinyl is not dead as when I first started listening to electronic music and going to raves in the late s everyone used to spin strictly vinyl  that has obviously changed in recent years.  So I wanted the turntable to look like it was in the forest floor with foliage roots etc. growing around it and sacred geometry symbols coming from the stylus.  The tattoo also represents the type of events I now attend and love transformational music festivals which combine electronic music yoga visionary art workshops and camping in the forest.

The vibration from the tattoo machine kind of acts as a counterstimulus that makes it more bearable somehow. With my last tattoo on my bicep my artist used this spray with Lidocaine in it after he was about halfway through and was getting towards inner part of my arm veeerrrryy sensitive!. It burned like hell at first but it really helped calm the pain down so I could get through the rest of it without having to suffer too bad.

My sister needs a valve replacement and shes put on a no tattoo restriction and antibiotics for dentist appointments and is even on glycerin.

If it were me and Id put that much time into a project and that close to finished and the client had someone else finish it Id be decently upset and it would certainly damage the relationship. Under no circumstances would I send the drawings no way.  Honestly Id feel a little insulted.  Thats just me though put yourself in the artists position.also the new artist will have a completely different style and vision and it might not work at all with what you have started.

5877291,0,t3_3ut8os,Everything is one tone. Areas where there should be expanded values the mane should have dark mid and light tones arent present. This can be achieved from either lighter tones far enough away in value to be noticeably different or by having open areas of skin that act as a natural highlight to let the tattoo breathe and be readable from a distance. The blending from the blacks into the face arent smooth. They need to be whipped and softened a little bit better to not look so choppy. Adding value to the piece overall will give it depth. I would def find another artist in town. I didnt want to criticize it without explaining how it could be made better. All of the things Ive listed will make it  times better and can still be done to the piece to salvage it and thats before you even get into the saturation of the color splotchiness which can easily be fixed as well. ,tattoos,cxq1mfc,2,t5_2qj9g
5880884,0,t1_cxqfk16,It has the potential to look like a sketch pad rather than a coherent piece for starters. If thats what you want then great! All tattoos lose definition with age if you have lots of tiny pieces theyll eventually just be blobs,tattoos,cxqilr1,3,t5_2qj9g

The occipital lobe is on the posterior side of the brain just above the cerebellum. That arrow looks like its pointing to the frontal lobe. Luckily its small and not too noticeable haha.,tattoos,d08amon,1,t5_2qj9g

Smalltown local shops.You want something complex and elaborate? Go to Slave or something. This is partially your fault for asking an inexperienced artist to do something beyond their competency and partially hers for agreeing to do a piece she wasnt competent enough to pull off.Hopefully you can find a more competent person to finishfix this.

7422917,0,t3_4gylw4,The absolute easiest way to get a complete cohesive tattoo would be to have one artist design the whole thing before tattooing so you know it will flow this is only if you know all the elements you want of the tattoo.It is possible to get multiple artists to create something that works together the best way to go about this is making sure they have VERY similar styles. It can also help greatly if the artists are clearly familiar with each other you might see them commenting on the other artist theyre hanging out together etc.For personal experience I have one sleeve put together by  different artists and the other by  and all the artists looked at elements already in the tattoos I had and chose colours that would compliment the other tattoos. I personally found it easy so long as the artists are aware there are other tattoos to work with it makes for a easy experience.,tattoos,d2lxqy9,1,t5_2qj9g

7872420,0,t3_4n0h3v,My second and third tattoos have a lot to do with courage. My second tattoo is the white tree of Gondor which in itself has a lot of meaning. What I didnt realize though was that I got it when my immune system was so low and it was actually dangerous for me to have gotten something that large. My white blood cell count was sooooo low the doctors were worried that if I got sick with even a cold or a flu I would be in the hospital for a long time because of it. My third and more recent tattoo is the word sisu which is from Finnish and kind of translates to courage in the face of adversity. I got it while travelling and had a really bad flare up of my autoimmune disorder the same one that had made my immune system so bad when I got my second tattoo. I needed a physical reminder to push through the pain and the uncertainty that comes with having an autoimmune disease.I like it when people ask about them I like to explain why I have them and what they mean. I much prefer people asking about them instead of being kind of weird and just staring at them.

Take some time and research artists in your area. Find ones with similar styles and good linework. Talk to them. Show them your inspiration and explain what you want. I guarantee you can find someone who will be excited to give you the art you want much closer than halfway around the world. And you get to support local artists. ,tattoos,d4ni2h9,2,t5_2qj9g

9822855,0,t1_danxdnc,Because its obviously all about the relevancy to DaS and not the meaning that it carries.  From the other post  It is related to suicide and not killing oneself or dying for no reason. That youre not hollow on the inside even if you feel you are. It also from the game mechanics is a reminder to keep your humanity even when times dont call for it.The bonfire is a classic Dark Souls reference. It represents the trials and tribulations I have gone and have yet to go through. That I will always overcome them no matter how bad it seems. It shows that no matter what happens youll continue on You can overcome great problems even if it takes a while. OampS comes to mind right?Its where you rest and recover and come back to time after time. Its where the light is that allows you to keep pressing on to never give up to fight the darkness.

Image He had to mold it a bit because I have relatively skinny forearms. Insofar as the tie in its actually from Dark Souls and they tie in actually really well.

10261428,0,t3_5mvl6m,First off Id like to say that I think Ben did an amazing job with my tattoo. Ben did note that the tattoo would fade so he went with darker colors in order to help keep the tattoo looking good after it starts to fade. He is known for his watercolor tattoos at his shop so I trust that he knows a thing or two. As to why I got the tattoo I got it because I think it looks damn cool. But to those who absolutely must have a reason like my mother... Id say that I am a fairly freespirited person. I like going out and following my own path and I think that is represented through the paper plane. A paper plane also represents a new beginning. This semester will be my last semester as a student at Texas AampM University before I graduate and move on. Thanks for all the whoops and nice comments!

Its clear what the goal was but almost every element comes up short of that goal. For instance the hearts are flat and inconsistent the shading on the halffaces is mostly missing and that skull on the bottomright flower is just bad.I think this piece still has great potential but Id go to a different artist to colorfinish it.,tattoos,dcdh1ru,5,t5_2qj9g

Around  hours in Chris nipped in to see how everything was going had a really friendly chat and offered me lidocaine to help me get through the next hour and a half or so. Id never tried it before but he was so helpful and encouraging. I knew how big Chris was in his specific style so I hadnt expected him to be anywhere near as welcoming and nice as he was.

10986473,0,t1_ded8vst,Nope.The text is objectively bad. Its shaky and uneven theres no personal judgment call there.  The symbol is objectively uneven look at the serifs on the X. And I admitted I wasnt familiar with it so maybe the shading is accurate.  These are not opinions they are not idiosyncrasies of the art style they are technical shortcomings and nothing else. The same shortcomings can be seen in the artists portfolio. OP failed to recognize that and got burnt but maybe now he can get it fixed or avoid it in the future. If he or anyone feels bad that I pointed them out good. Thats part of learning from a mistake.,tattoos,deda5p1,15,t5_2qj9g

11004630,0,t1_defbt14,actually they probably have a really old ranch. One of the first in the state maybe? Single character brands are kinda rare. In Montana where I am from the dept. of livestock first issued single character brands. Once they were all taken they started with the letter and symbol combinations. Since these single character brands are few and far between they have actually become quite valuable. I brand my cows with a single character brand that I have been offered K for. In Texas assuming this is where your from I bet that brand could be sold for a big ol chunk of money. Anyways I really like it! I have my brand tattooed on my chest and it is something I take a ton of pride in. ,tattoos,defcdlg,3,t5_2qj9g

11148327,0,t3_5z5f60,I did a . hr tattoo session and by the end of it I honestly wanted to curl up into a ball and cry. Tbh for the first  hrs for me the tattoo pain is normally really manageable and almost a nonissue but after your adrenaline wears off youll just feel exhausted and the pain will be a lot more obvious. Im also particularly small though so I was wiped out for roughly  hrs afterwards with exhaustion so Id recommend breaking your tattoo up into multiple sessions. ,tattoos,devnfz4,9,t5_2qj9g

Unless you need to get it done in a small time frame Id go with the  hour session. Id also highly suggest the shorter session as this is your first tattoo. ,tattoos,devs6bm,2,t5_2qj9g
