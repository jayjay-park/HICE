2561733,0,t3_2p24fh,Hello!Alright the problem with the retrigger can be solved quite easily. Create a boolean interactionStarted you might find a better name for it that will tell you if the interaction was opened and start the timer timer  numberOfUpdates.After that you can start a timer a decreasing integer that will tell you how much time has passed from the time that the interaction has started. You decrease the timer each update by .Then simple only allow keypressed to cause an action on the NPC if the timer is lower or equal than .The second thing about textboxes might be a bit harder to do. You might want to look into  patching Its basically a tehnique for rendering expandable different sized rectangles from  patches.In case you have any more questions please do post them ,javagamedev,cmsyfc6,1,t5_2v423
