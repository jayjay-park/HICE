2391440,0,t1_cl3fvgi,Hello eventsalldayHad a Q for you I am beginning to work with a small amt of clients on a freelance basis and have recently acquired some pro audio and video gear that I rent out. My question is what can I do to become used more frequently and from new planners? What keeps you going to the same production houses? Thanks!,eventplanning,cm7af9e,1,t5_2v9m3
