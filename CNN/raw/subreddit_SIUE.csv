Neither office can do much for you over the phone but they might be willing to mail something to the address on file. If you have been out for a year you will need to reapply.a SIUe requires advisement for almost all students prior to registration.  An advisement hold is placed on your account to prevent registration prior to talking tomeeting with them.  So either way you will be talking with your adviser and they can help you through the process. I dont believe they can accept payment by phone.  You can mail in your payment or do it via internet.  Here is the site specifically for former students to make a web payment  You might also be interested in the Veterans Services page  Kevin is great to work with and is always available to help veterans at SIUe.Hope this all helps!,SIUE,d70p5f9,1,t5_2s2rr
