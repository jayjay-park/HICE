2396370,0,t1_cm7sbc9,So you accept a game being releashed and IMMEDIATELY needing a day one patch? Sounds like your standards are pretty low. This sort of thing never happened  years ago and now companies are severly cutting quality control. To have to download a day one patch to play a primarily single player game is ludicrous. ,FarCry4,cm7wd7m,-5,t5_2vtua

2444946,0,t1_cmdtcdn,This needs  upvotes. Lots of people  me included are having huge problems to the extent that game is not even playable. Tons of crashes stuttering map not loading MP not working etc. Dont get me wrong when its working I really enjoy it problem is I have spent more time watching the intro due to the frequent crashes then actually playing the game. Let ubisoft patch this game and fix all the thousands of bugs players are experiencing then buy it. As for now chanses are you wont even be able to play.Edit If you are on Xbox then go ahead this only goes for PCplayers  ,FarCry4,cmdwefb,0,t5_2vtua
2449410,0,t3_2nkpye,I often watch game play throughs to see if I will like a game before I buy it.  My favorite YouTube channel is theRadBrad.  Hes playing FC now.Exploration is my favorite part of the game.  The map is large  about the size of FarCry s I think.From my experience the game isnt as buggy as ACUnity which I am also playing. However make sure you complete missions and save as I got stuck repeating missions either from a glitch or my not saving properly  not sure which yet.Edit poor grammar amp misspellings fixed,FarCry4,cmeg8nj,2,t5_2vtua

2685948,0,t1_cn964qt,If you go to any trading locations there will be a tab for signature weapons. You have to unlock them through various means if you highlight them it will tell you exactly but its generally things like liberate X amount of bell towers or outposts or do x amounts of a certain kind of mission and so on.They are rather expensive ranging from  to about . Most of them are in the k range though.A few notable mentions are the sawn off shotgun that can be used in the secondary slot. The Bushmaster assault rifle and the Shredder I think its called? Which is a modified Vector with an extreme rate of fire.,FarCry4,cn9691u,1,t5_2vtua
2695496,0,t3_2qwcqi,I have a  also. Make sure you have the latest patch for the game as it was supposed to fix this issue. Another thing to try is run the game in borderless mode. No config file fixes that I know of. All in all FC is not well optimized and running in  made my fps tank. Hope you get yours working. ,FarCry4,cnaf530,2,t5_2vtua
2709791,0,t1_cnc2ls6,Tried Blood Dragon which also caused a crash took longer time though. Could be UPlay or the Far Cry engine I figure. Ill test other games later today.,FarCry4,cnc3bth,1,t5_2vtua

2781941,0,t1_cnk9pgd,I cant really think of anything except for maybe total  of kills or something similar.  Everyone seems to unlock it by doing something different but they never mention their total number of kills.  I cant check mine because my playstation is currently km away but maybe you could check yours? Maybe theres a milestone that one reached unlocks the perk.
