3752418,0,t1_cqjhus8,Ive never been able to enjoy a Transformers game so I cant recommend it.If youve got a fast Intel computer check out Planetside . If you want a hardcore competitive game check out Toxikk or Quake Live or Tribes Ascend. If you want a single player rpg check out Witcher  or Divinity Original Sin or Pillars of Eternity. Look at rGameDeals they have free and cheap games every day. You will like or hate Elite Dangerous.There are also lots of old games which are just awesome. Freelancer is one that immediately comes to mind.Also if you want to get your hopes up about a game that is not yet out check out Star Citizen.,strikevector,cqk03bc,1,t5_2y2mb
