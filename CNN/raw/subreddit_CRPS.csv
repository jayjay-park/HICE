5739477,0,t3_3pmwkq,When I try to snuggle under my blanket at night. I cover my feet and make sure to wrap them in the blanket. If my feet feel any movement while asleep. I wake up from pain. Its mostly tenderness and sensitivity. I cant stand to have the bottom of my feet in contact with anything. Walking is uncomfortable but I refuse to use it as an excuse ever. Its something that I adapt my life to. ,CRPS,cx8jdtg,1,t5_2skgz
