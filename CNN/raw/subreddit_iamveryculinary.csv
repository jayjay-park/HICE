9755067,0,t1_dafca3z,I learned a new word  emulousness  and in the process learned that he was using it based on a obsolete definition.  It hasnt been a synonym for jealous since the s.  It currently means to emulate or exceed.I love duck more than almost anything else but I dont want to be a duck dish.  Especially one that is depraved.Do he and Kay share this speaking style?  I want to read a review of his latest sock purchase.  ,iamveryculinary,dafj3wl,2,t5_3h6on

11765421,0,t1_dgtm0yq,Yeah but thats a  dollar microwave meal.  Adding onions breadcrumbs and eggs makes sense in a microwave version of something.  What about the video that I linked to you before that you dont seem to have watched wherein a german man in German shows us his recipe for rinderhacksteak which is cooked identically to the way I claimed it was cooked in American restaurants that served Hamburg steak?This gentlemen doesnt use eggs milk breadcrumbs or onions.  Just plain ground beef.  And thats the dish.  Sure the microwave version has extenderbreadcrumbs and binderegg and tenderizer onions but the homemade version doesnt.gtAs you can see the word is a very recent addition to the German vocabulary. But its been in use since the s according to your graph you cant say what you said earlier and just pretend it doesnt exist or dismiss it as regional.  Its so popular they turned it into a microwave meal.  Thats not something that any old dish can become!  It has to be a popular dish right?  Something that people will recognize and buy?,iamveryculinary,dgtn2ik,0,t5_3h6on
