577018,0,t3_20qehy,Footwork! Start by being very conscious of your feet and try to move them deliberately. Most of my friends and I realized that we had our strength and hands at a much higher climbing level than our feet and needed to focus on footwork to bring it up to par. One of our games which I think I read around here or rclimbing somewhere is to try to not make any sound when placing your feet and to have a friend call you out when you do. If you make a sound start the problem over. Im glad you like the sport! The best thing to do is just keep climbing!,bouldering,cg5v0od,3,t5_2rb1o

Check the gym rules first in this regard.As for use use it when your hands feel slick. You can also dab some on the holds to absorb moisture then brush off before you attempt again to expose the freshlydried texture.I find a LOT of new climbers dont brush holds often enough. If it feels slicker than it did when you started trying... give it a gentle brush to remove olddamp chalk you or others have caked on.,bouldering,ckr6tnv,3,t5_2rb1o

2216045,0,t1_cll8ihl,Hey I had an issue with my A pulley  months back as well. I havent been climbing for too long and got on a problem at the gym in a stupid manner and fell right off. Immediate pain in my pulley and I was probably less than a hundred percent for a month or so. What really helped me was constant massage of the pulley. Few times a day just massage it with your opposing thumb. Another thing that I personally greatly helped was Power Putty. There are a few levels of toughness that the putty comes in. Im pretty sure I used the softest putty there was for general rehab and then when my pulley felt better I started using a tougher putty. Honestly stay off of it till you dont feel pain when hanging off a pull up bar for a few seconds. If there isnt any notable swelling or discoloration it might be a minor injury. Stay off rehab get yer ass back on the wall. I didnt wait for mine to heal completely and Im still reinforcing the base of that finger with tape pretty much every time I climb. Few weeks is always better than a few months off. Hope all goes well. Let me know how its feeling if you end up getting the putty,bouldering,clligiw,1,t5_2rb1o

2529853,0,t1_cmopn62,Are you gripping like youre holding on for dear life? I used to get super pumped really quick my first few months of climbing and then I was stumped when I couldnt send a V which I usually onsight. After I was frustrated from getting pumped too much I read some stuff online about training methods and being a better climber etc etc and I found that its better to hold on to holds with as little grip as possible. Just enough to keep you on the wall and send yourself up with your feet. Once I started consciously gripping lighter and working on my technique and footwork I barely get pumped unless I dont give myself rest time before problems at all. Footwork is super important especially on higher grades. Ive been climbing for about the same time as you and Im projecting Vs right now. Havent sent any but working on it but gripping lighter is definitely whats helped me be able to climb longer and harder. Also xs and circuit training definitely help with the pump because they it builds your anaerobic threshold. Do circuit training of easy problems that you can send without any issues at the end of your climbing sessions when youre really pumped. Itll help build that endurance. Also top roping is great endurance training. I recently got into top roping and its helped me become a better boulderer. If you want any other advice or any specific training that I do feel free to PM me. Ill be happy to help D,bouldering,cmosdow,6,t5_2rb1o

2562298,0,t3_2p3j2r,a few things you dont want it that hard again and if it required  physical and mental focus you wont be able to do it until you either commit  again or raise your climbinglvl way up!really hard projects i know the beta like no one else in the gym or outdoors i barely do twice because they are so close to failing on almost every move and just being not  focussed means a fall for you or if you tryed too many project before instead of trying the problem if you are at  physically in the session.on most of my projectclimbs i can do every move almost with  accuracy as a single move but the linking is the main problem.or there is a climb with a move you need  trys to stick it once and  trys to stick it once while not  focussed.there are also problems i need  trys because im simply too dumb to figure out the right beta and the moment i got it its  repeatable with little efford it really depends on the problems.mastered? i think if i know exactly how to do the beta correctly and can pull that off and that sometimes means you can only do it once because your the moment you loose your commitment to do the problems its not possible for you anymore.i had one problem at the gym i did the whole problem in my mind a few time before going to sleep i feel like i truly mastered that one i was physically so weak compared to now and im still surprised that i sent it eventually.it can be it really depends!there are some problems its worth it to figure out another beta that works for you some arent its up to you to figure out if it will benefit you to try that problem again.,bouldering,cmt1353,1,t5_2rb1o

4706051,0,t1_ctm40y4,There are no magic time thresholds. Go hard enough long enough to get better. Rest enough to recover. Stop before injury. I generally boulder x a week with one twoday rest period. Sometimes this ends up as climbing every other day for an extended period. I climb from  hr sessions totally dependent upon how I feel throughout the session eventually tapering off to more slabby problems. If anything feels tweaky a move a body part a problem type I adjust and do something else. I also boulder with a rotating group of friends... so thats a lot of the session watching talking shit chilling. Some days I go for volume and lower intensity. Some days I have just a couple super intense for me projects I try. Most days its between these extremes. I never boulder to the point that I cant climb stuff I can reliably flash when fresh.... at a certain point running the tank into the red only results in worn out skin and shoe rubber higher chance of injury longer recovery and sloppy climbing habits. ,bouldering,ctnqhp4,1,t5_2rb1o

5388862,0,t3_3onsfh,Youve already gotten enough input on when shoes are usually retired so Ill just add my input on what pairs to get next.If you live near a shoe retailer I highly advise you to go and try out shoes before buying them. If the retailer also has a small wall for you to test them out on even better.Your best bet with a new pair is to look for something that will fit you well. By that I mean no dead space within the shoe in the toebox and heel cup area. I personally advocate sizing a shoe small enough that theres slightborderline discomfort but not to the point where its cumbersome or painful to climb let alone walk.If you like Evolv so far I would recommend the Luchadors or Pontas. With FiveTen my personal favorite is the Anasazi VCS for its edging. However my qualm with FiveTen is that the heels for their shoes dont fit me so Im often left with a lot of deadspace that would make heelhooks unsteady.Dont be afraid to look at other shoe brands too different shoes for different feet.

6236433,0,t3_40z3e3,Hello! Im also a new climber about  months and have climbed at both city beach  Fremont and touchstone gyms Concord San Jose. I dont have the knowledge of the route setter at city beach obviously  but I can tell you my experiences at each! It looks like others have ready given you sound advice regarding the shoes.  Im a  F so we may have different experiences but heres what I can tell you I started climbing at city beach doing Vs and top roping .. From then to December I began climbing a consistently and one b. Vs were really easy but I could barely even begin a V. After trying touchstone I was able to climb VV and .c. I think its easier to progress initially at touchstone since Im not too experienced but when you make gains at city beach it feels amazing. Also city beach has the auto belays which are great. You dont need a partner for those and they have  bouldering areas. Touchstone doesnt have the auto belays. Membership at city beach also includes other perks such as free shoeharnesschalk rentals. One other thing to mention city beach uses gri gris and touchstone has ATCs. Im not sure if that makes a difference for you!I now climb at Planet Granite the Presidio Belmont Sunnyvale which I would also recommend! Its more similar to touchstone than city beach. The one in the Presidio is my favorite. Good luck!,bouldering,cyyijjk,5,t5_2rb1o

6626080,0,t1_d04m8ex,gtOpen grips also train the entire hand vs a crimp which is a pretty localized set of muscles dont ask me to provide sources on that... I read it somewhere and it stuck could just be hearsay.Yeah thats pretty much an old wives tale. Training a muscle isometrically is tricky business because isometric training basically only trains a muscle to be strong at that particular joint angle. There is some evidence that training a particular joint angle will increase strength at that same joint angle   degrees. So for instance if you train a half crimp fingers flexed at  degrees then the benefits will include when those same joints are flexed at  degrees close to a full crimp as well as at  degrees close to an open hand.The main takeaway is if youre going to use it you have to train it.

He has to deal with the fear of highballs and appears to have a bigger fear than some of his friends who do highballs. In order to overcome his fear and execute flawlessly he practices meditation. Then he breaks the climb into  separate parts where he adheres to a specific breathing pattern to help him execute and control his fear. Im not sure if I remember the order exactly but it was something like this Section   Breath in mouth out mouth because it is the most physically demanding section Section  Breathe in Nose out mouth because it is physically demanding but he is getting close to the lip and that is when the fear starts to creep in so breathing in the nose helps to stay calm. Section  he is coming over the lip where it is the scariest part breathe in nose AND out nose to remain as calm and focused as possible. This is the least physically demanding part but the hardest part because of the mental crux.,bouldering,d19abfg,2,t5_2rb1o

Make the larger section at least  degrees and the smaller around  for tiny crimps and difficult slopers. Connect the walls with a  foot roof section for some real spider monkey action and you will love the thing. Also consider setting the bigger wall up as a semisystems wall with mostly symmetrical holds and placement. This will be the best for training. For holds I like Atomik especially systems holds and the Yaniro series they offer. Great customer service price design and you can pick colors at no upcharge. Egrips and So ill have cool stuff too. Flooring wise get some  thick interlocking MMA mats and sandwich them over a few inflatable air mattresses. This is bombproof and reasonably cheap.

When the clock runs low in a redpoint comp you have to be able to accept that you might not send your uberproj in the next  minutes and that tossing a V worth of points on your card sure beats no points.I started climbing local comps in college at the Intermediate VV level dove into advanced just out of college VV and made the jump to Open at  years old.  This year at  I made it into finals for the first time ever.  That said I was the oldest guy in finals by  years. Just a word of warning if you aim to get into the Open category  its a very different pond all of a sudden.  If you climb V in intermediate the strongest guy in your category is  grades past you.  If you climb VV in Open the strongest guy in your category may have made finals at Nationals last year.The thing about bouldering comps is its competitive in the way a track meet is not the way a football game is  everybody can set personal best records and still someone is gonna be first and somebody is gonna be last.

Thats a good link to Dave Macleod whose book underpins most of my thinking outlined above. Heres a snippetOne of the shifts in understanding from the past decade is that slowonset tendon injuries such as golfers elbow do not respond well to complete rest. In fact it often makes the condition worse. Moreover many of the adjunct treatments often offered  stretching massage ibuprofen may do little to contribute to healing and only affect pain. Instead the most promising treatment has been large volumes of exercise of a specific mode eccentric and at a level which causes some pain.

8798038,0,t3_50kvzq,When I first started getting into that grade range I struggled with overhangs much more than vertical problems. For me being tall and having good reach was a crutch that I relied on to do most of the routes I did. Since then Ive become much better at steep climbing and now find that it is easier to do hard routes on an overhang than hard routes on slabvertical terrain mostly just because finding the beta is easier all you have to do is try hard.Things Ive found made a big differenceBODY TENSION This is absolutely necessary for steep climbing. If you feel like you are just throwing yourself around and your feet cut all the time then you need to improve your core strength and body tension. When Im training for steep climbing I try to make sure that when Im doing a move there is no body sag when I hit the hold. I also focus hard on PULLING with my feet to keep myself on. After a night of training like this I can feel the muscles all around my core like abs obliques and lower back muscles.FINGER STRENGTH This can take a long time to build up if you dont have naturally strong fingers and is something every climber should focus on to improve their climbing. If you can do a move when it has larger holds but cant when the same move has smaller holds then you need to improve your finger strength. At the V level this isnt often a problem but as you get around V strong fingers are much more necessary.The best way to improve finger strength is to spend time climbing in a controlled manner on small holds. Even if you are only doing tiny moves it will help. To increase difficulty you can make the holds smaller the feet worse the angle steeper and finally the moves bigger.FOOTWORKTECHNIQUE On vertical routes the feet are generally pretty passive and are only used to support you. On steeper terrain you often have to be a little more active with how you use your feet. This could mean heel hooking toe hooking drops knees etc. Or it could mean pointing your toes to reach and PULL yourself up the wall. As for your question bringing your feet up high only helps if it gives you extra reach and doesnt cause your butthips to get too far away from the wall. Keeping your hips close to the wall makes the holds feel better and gives you more reach for the next holds.Hope this helps. Feel free to ask any additional questions!,bouldering,d75ejzz,11,t5_2rb1o

8930283,0,t1_d7kx2zz,gt They are entering with preconceived notions... they designed the beta in a way that made sense to themYeah having someone else who didnt set the problem and doesnt know the intended sequence or grade is super helpful. And another factor that gets overlooked is how tired a setter can get from the actual setting process and how that can skew their perception of the difficulty or flow of a boulder problem.This is particularly true for any kind of competition. Like at a local ABS comp where they havta set  boulders between V and V. Setting that number of problems and then trying to forerun tweek and appropriately grade them can be really overwhelming. And even in a regional or divisional comp where you may only be setting ish problems the tweeking and sussing can leave the setters too spent to accurately gauge the difficulty.gt The best scenario is to have all of the setters climb every route and come to consensus grades Because of the aforementioned reason of setter fatigue I would argue that the best scenario is actually to have a forerunner whose sole job is to climb the problems and who has nothing to do with the setting process other than noting where sequences feel awkward too cruxy etc. Although I think that this isnt always feasible for every gym thus getting all the setters opinions for a consensus is the next best alternative. For several years I was fortunate enough to be the forerunner for my local gym and aside from being an awesome gig for me it was incredibly useful for the setting team to have someone who could climb and grade and comment on things from a fresh rather than exhausted from the last  days in a row of setting and tweaking problems perspective and whom they could put on a problem without any knowledge of the intended grade or sequence to see what came out naturally. gt It also helps then if your setters cover a wide variety of body types short tall female male lanky bulky.Yeah this is super helpful too,bouldering,d7lae0o,2,t5_2rb1o

10291893,0,t1_dc9qydv,For outdoor bouldering it really isnt too complicated. It helps if you have someone who knows the area or climbs outside but there are a couple universal rules.. Know how to place pads. Make sure they are placed where the climbing might fall not necessarily directly beneath them remember you swing out away from the rock when you fall so dont place the pad right up against the rock unless it is a slab.. Know how to spot. Always have at least one person watching the climber at all times. If they fall off make sure they hit the pads and dont land on their head. Directing your hands to their hips or back helps to stabilize them as they land. Also make sure they dont roll off the pad when they land.. Clean up after yourself and leave everything nicer than you found it. Practice Leave No Trace including picking up bits of tape or candy wrappers on the ground and brush off large tick marks left on the rock.. Prepare to be humbled on your first couple times. Dont think youll climb a V your first day out and be psyched if you climb harder than V. The fun come from finding routes with really cool moves or tricky sequences. Take your time to learn how to find beta including foot moves.,bouldering,dcan46l,2,t5_2rb1o

10347194,0,t3_5o2fxw,I built my own wall ab  years ago and i have to agree with some of the other comments about extending the overhang for max length...now that being said i really wanted  small roof section in mine similar to yours but decided against it and now ive realized that while having my wall has absolutely made me stronger you can very easily train on a pull up bar the and a set of rings the correct way and get the same benefits. So if you are keen on the overhang for a bit of variety like i was in hindsight i say go for it and just add a pull up bar and set of rings somewhere to train on. My wall is about  off  vert with a  ft vert section at the end and i absolutely cannot wait to rebuild in a couple months and add a vert wall for slab training and slightly overhanging wall and the roof section...youll be surprised the techniqe you loose for slab and slightly overhung if you ONLY climb super steep stuff every day for months on end so take advantage of you vert walls now and set some tricky balancey techy stuff to everything on point.

Aim to be gritting your teeth...As for hover hands climb the same s and s but when you make the hand movement you must hover your hand above the hold for a second count. You will be amazed at what this does for your core activation.,bouldering,deeskjq,2,t5_2rb1o

11227028,0,t1_df4k6ee,Thanks I think my skin is pretty tough havent been using tape for the last two weeks and its somehow miraculously fine will take tape with me just for safety. Topping out shouldnt be a problem because my climbing gym has a few problems where you have to top out.,bouldering,df4khwr,2,t5_2rb1o
11252684,0,t3_60l3y7,I dont think you would need a training program yet you can probably keep improving by just climbing. It helps so much if you ignore the grade and just take it by how the problem itself looks. At my gym which is quite small when they add a new problem its left ungraded for  week until its graded by committee. When I first started I found I just ignored any problem above my grade but when I tried the ungraded problems that suited me I could often send way harder things than my usual grade.,bouldering,df7h43c,1,t5_2rb1o

11305688,0,t1_dfddkzr,I honestly dont care much for the lifestyle aspect that you seem to be describing for sbp have you noticed any stylistic differences in the setting of problems? You mentioned that sbp has far and away the best training area which from pictures and videos Im inclined to believe so the other major factor would be setting style and how much of that crosses over to outdoor climbing.,bouldering,dfdhe37,2,t5_2rb1o

11538747,0,t1_dg3hiib,They do totally different things and neither will directly improve your climbing unless youre pretty weak or out of shape or very inflexible.You cant improve climbing skills any way other than climbing.  You can improve body strength and flexibility but that doesnt always translate into harderbetter climbing.,bouldering,dg3x3nz,5,t5_2rb1o
11545229,0,t1_dg4bvg1,Not sure why Im getting downvoted on this. Did I personally attack John Shermin himself by pointing out the limitations of the Vscale or just people with no personal experience with another grading system?    I guess I could have pointed out the super obvious and gratuitous fact that grading in general is subjective no shit or lazily added some snark...    Good to know that rbouldering is such an open minded group.,bouldering,dg4njnc,-2,t5_2rb1o
