8098307,0,t3_4q483h,. The timetable is the same for everyone having a PhD doesnt make you special when it comes to dealing with HR and hiring managers. I met someone who entered the federal government as a GS and he still had to wait four months for his final offer. He called after two months and they told him to sit tight and keep waiting. He was even taking a huge pay cut to take the job because they wanted him personally. . With a PhD I would apply straight to GSs but it also might be wise to apply to ones rated as  if he doesnt have experience. Accepting just a  depends on how badly he wants into the federal government  once he accepts a GS he is going to have to work a year before applying to GS regardless of his degree. Whether he should apply to a  is up to him. Does he like his current job? Would it be a pay cut? Is his greatest desire in life to serve Uncle Sam? Is he older and wants to make sure he gets in his  years for his good retirement benefits? Who knows? Up to him. EDIT Getting a GS will not hinder him at all from getting an . Might even help him if he really wants in. He will just have to work the GS for  weeks before he can apply for the .. I read federalsoup.com a lot when applying mostly for the forums. They are a lot more active than here. I just landed a GS and no one ever looked over my resume. I just used google a lot to find examples and kept tweeking it every time I applied for a job.,usajobs,d4qbmh6,2,t5_36omy

8751134,0,t1_d354rhu,Thanks for posting this. Im new to applying for Federal jobs and have some of the same questions.When you talk about applying for too high of a paygrade would it ever make sense for me to not list a graduate degree so that I wouldnt be applying for such a high pay grade? I really want to work for the USFS or NPS and Im fine with taking a lower pay grade if it means Id have a higher chance of landing a job.,usajobs,d6zjqwk,1,t5_36omy

9429032,0,t3_59slit,I know its not what you want to hear but you gotta have patience. Some agencies are worse than others but its taken  months for me in the past and the offer came through. Keep yourself busy with other shit and it will eventually come through.,usajobs,d9b70dz,1,t5_36omy
9576379,0,t3_5c3wt6,Shoot. If thats true does that mean that Im in trouble as a GS? I applied for a lot of Recent Grad positions. Just thinking out loud but those seem like nonessentials. Would they disappear?,usajobs,d9thfwg,2,t5_36omy
10394374,0,t3_5ouc0y,Well you are already hired and working so no a hiring freeze wont directly affect you. The side effects can be a pain though like jobs with high turnover in an office such as admin assistant that are really necessary to running an efficient workplace.,usajobs,dcm9opj,6,t5_36omy
10491097,0,t3_5q6hs4,How about those of us with a tentative offer but with a set start date prior to Feb. ? Thats my boat and my office is working hard to claim that a tentative offer should be enough. My worry is that they will say no as I do not yet have my final offer.,usajobs,dcx9yby,3,t5_36omy

10701595,0,t3_5t07qj,Could you elaborate on what you mean by old or ended jobs? Do you mean former vacancy announcements on USAJobs that have closed or jobs that exist in the current organizational structure of an agency? I dont know of a public resource for either but someone else may and that distinction may help make things more clear. ,usajobs,ddjsgan,2,t5_36omy
10785397,0,t3_5u9xgb,There is. Certain jobs are exempt. Additionally if the ad was posted prior to the freeze they can still interview. They just might not offer you a job until after the freeze is over.,usajobs,ddsfoks,3,t5_36omy
10802928,0,t3_5uhbom,Move on from these jobs. Many of the jobs I applied to in  are still in an applied or referred status. Doesnt mean much of anything.,usajobs,ddu8uvt,4,t5_36omy
