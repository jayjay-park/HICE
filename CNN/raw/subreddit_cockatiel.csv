355998,0,t1_cffbjv7,Some birds will clip their own nails. We always had our birds nails clipped at the vets we had to bring them in way too often for other things but then we got one of the birds I have now. She had one really long nail once and we were debating whether to try clipping it ourselves or taking her in to get her clipped and she just snapped part of it off with her beak. Our other bird learned to do it from her we havent clipped any cockatiel nails in  years. They just do it themselves when they get too long. Maybe you should see if your bird will take care of it himself hes young enough to learn.,cockatiel,cfhnz49,1,t5_2uqu9

518285,0,t1_cfz6ani,The thing about the avian vets Ive seen is they can never seem to really give a straight answer about anything.  And unfortunately this vet was no different.  Every forumsupport group Ive posted in give me thousands of opinions and ultimately just advise me to seek veterinary assistance... Its a giant circle.

5036877,0,t3_3jx1kw,My  cockatiels escaped two years ago and I was able to recover  after  weeks.  Jerry went missing from metro Boston area and was found in Pawtucket RI   miles away from home. I recommend contacting animal control and local vets within  mile st week and then keep expanding  miles further.  Post at parrot alert and even create a WordPress page to be searchable. Setup a Google phone to keep prank callers in check.  I had assholes from  kids prank calling drunk  year old calling us losers and retired old women getting angry for caring so much over stupid birds.                              And not all animal control officers are the same. I had some that really cared and one who put the a found cockatiel back into the woods because it looked injured and he doesnt want to deal with vet care. When I specifically offered to pay even if it was not mine.                              During our search for our pets we actually found  grey male cockatiels we made posts and I kept a blogprivate phone for  years in case someone recognizes them  no bite.  The first one we found fell into a pond and was dying of starvation  he was on emergency care for a week.  One passed away within a month even after avian vet checkup probably ate something poisonous and had internal organ damage.  He already had a sprained wing and we caught him hiding in a shrub.  Another passed away last month of natural causes he was found drinking at a private pool. Out of the  two are still alive and thriving.                      Lets recap I lost   recovered  weeks  miles and  state away found  that are not mine  found passed away.Good luck.,cockatiel,cut4vkx,7,t5_2uqu9

10523295,0,t3_5qn1io,I posted on your first post it can take months to bond with your bird. It seems like perhaps you are going too fast for your tiel. Just keep hanging around the bird talking calmly just make sure that you arent mean or frustrated around them. Place your hand in the cage for a few minutes everyday and when the birds crest doesnt rise move closer. Once you get really close to him dont touch him. But handfeed him some seeds or something try to get him to eat from your hand. Then try to lead him to step over your hand. Then once hes ok with that try to get him to step up onto your hand to get the seeds.Can you tell me where you have the cage? Describe the room he stays in please. Its very important.When you do the above you should start training him. Make sure to train him at the same time every day for the same amount of time. Also does he have lots of toys in his cage? How do you react to their bites? You shouldnt be reacting to the bites at all if you do youre reacting exactly how they want you to. Theyre training you then.,cockatiel,dd0xgno,2,t5_2uqu9

10762293,0,t3_5tq9i4,I just noticed you have photos. A couple of suggestions. If you are keeping her cage by the window she will be in a draft which will be deadly. Short periods by a window on a sunny day or with a heat lamp near is ok. her plucking is bad it could have been from lack of attention. Judging from her feathers Im guessing she didnt get spritzed or baths. She needs those very much. I bet she will love it. That cage seems small. Please see my post below with the cage with the play top. As I noted they need to be out of the cage as much as possible. They like to be up high as well which is their instinct. I think it is probably very  stressful to have the blinds hitting the top of her cage. Broken tail feathers could also indicate that a cage is too small although she could have fallen and broken them. Although the cage I listed below seems expensive it is really well made is on wheels has removable side panels for cleaning and a shelf below on which to store things. A uva lamp will help a lot and I recommend reading the ARTICLES in the box right below the picture that detail the benefits.   Again good luck and please keep us posted on her progress.,cockatiel,ddq1uev,1,t5_2uqu9

They eat their veggies pellets and seeds no problem. She is a bit larger than him but she doesnt bully him so I think its healthy relationship. ...I just miss the lil guy chirping. Cant separate them or they both go insane. At least he isnt lonely anymore so there is some silver lining.,cockatiel,de08yjw,1,t5_2uqu9
11109360,0,t3_5yizi7,You can make some changes but no hate here as youre willing to make them. The only time I at least get mad is when people come here complaining about biting or plucking or whatever and are unwilling to take any advice or make excuses for why they cant or dont or wont do something like spending at least an hour or two a day with their bird how are you not even home an hour a day? Why even ask for advice if you arent willing to change anything?Back on topic dont feel bad about not picking a name something will come to you eventually. My cockatiels name is Piper hes a male but its a good gender neutral name. Honestly though I practically never call him Piper hes more often Pibbles Shrimply Pibbles from Rick and Morty Pib Piblet when hes being fat like piglet but with a Pib Pibbly and Featherbutt when hes being a butt.How much time per day do you spend with your birb? A good practice is to take them out of the cage as soon as you get home and to put them back in before you leave againgo to bed. Mine waddles about if he wants cuddles or pets he comes over to me if not he waddles about my bed picking at bird safe stuff just doing his own thing.For toys cheap things you can do are strips of paper weaved through the cage barstied to the bars so they can tug on them and shred them tiels really like shredding stuff. My tiel likes playing with small toys meant for children like tiny plastic animals that are small enough that he can throw them around. He likes buttons too especially ugly buttons... Think like brightly colored gaudy shaped ones like stars and daisies maybe cute on a toddlers clothes but on an adults clothes... well maybe on an ugly sweater party one.,cockatiel,der8imx,1,t5_2uqu9

11162808,0,t3_5zd48d,Isnt this from a breeder? You can ask them they would know and you should be trying to mimic their schedulestyle as much as possible for a smooth transition. ,cockatiel,dexaje3,1,t5_2uqu9
11271370,0,t1_df9hco2,Yeah the guy was super nice and he wasnt an actual breeder. Plus it definitely wasnt for the money otherwise I feel like he wouldve sold them for a lot more. He just has  cockatiels of his own and said they have had babies a few times that he cant keep for obvious space reasons. It seems he knows what hes doing when it came to personally caring for the birds because all of his were so sweet and well mannered as well as trained. He even asked if I could send some pictures so he caresof course I happily agreed. I think he just assumes that people buying them know what to do or can figure it out like he has. I think I will be okay I have resources and I am doing my absolute best to learn how to properly care for them. I just worry about any of the others hes given away! I know most people want these non existent cute self sufficient and what I like to call accessory pets and when they realize how much work is involved the animals suffer or get dumped on the street ,cockatiel,df9ldbx,1,t5_2uqu9
11289483,0,t1_dfbj252,Wish all the best to you and your bird OP. My bird had a medical emergency last year probably crop infection hes fine now so I know it can be very stressful.,cockatiel,dfbnafe,4,t5_2uqu9

11532518,0,t1_dfme6ax,Thats good to hear. Most do seem to love it and its so easy and healthy. I have to work on introducing more kinds of veggies as well to give my Piper a greater variety of choices. He really likes peas so if you havent already give them a try for Sherlock. Ill try cauliflower as I havent tried that one yet. Also dont be too alarmed if after eating a lot of rice your tiels poo turns white... It happened to my little man but the vet said it was fine and just from the rice.,cockatiel,dg37oin,1,t5_2uqu9

11751702,0,t1_dgs2l4p,its not fertile. maybe ill boil it and make a salad with it  JK! my wife and I joke about it its the second time she did this when I got her initially I was told Maxine was a male.,cockatiel,dgs32fu,5,t5_2uqu9
11787829,0,t1_dgv1n9j,Yeah. She is very reserved and nervous but then sometimes we have this beautiful bonding moment where she spends some time with me and isnt afraid or cranky. ,cockatiel,dgw6ud7,1,t5_2uqu9
