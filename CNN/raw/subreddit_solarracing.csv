The lightest prepreg setup would be gsm weave around a low density honeycomb with adhesive film on either side for proper bonding. However that will not be very impact resistant. Honeycomb at that density can be bought for about  a x sheet. Honeycomb should not be heavy.  lower density honeycomb should be able to drape quite a bit as well. We used different cores throughout our car but  was a pretty standard size in many places honestly we should have designed for thicker. Wetlayup is another beast in its entirety. You cannot should not wetlay honeycomb structures with simple epoxy resin only. If you do youre asking for it to delam and get a heavier than necessary part. Nuon wetlays most of their structural ribbing inside their car so its not like it cant be done well. From what Ive gathered they cure the outer laminate using resin infusion and then wet lay structural ribbing on top of that but im not entirely sure on their process. I dont understand what you mean by a PrePreg surrogate Also we had to sign ITAR agreements with a few companies basically we promised not to give it to Iran  NK and not ship the rawcured material out there. ,solarracing,df9u485,1,t5_31y25
