Im actually in charge of looking for an automation solution at my current employer at present so Id like to review Helium but if it is a timebased free trial I down want to sign up until I know Ill have the time to use it. ,selenium,cgurkcj,1,t5_2srjs
796887,0,t1_cguolri,There is nothing different between the way Selenium commands are sent by python and by Looking Glass which is just Java commands.  I see two possible issues.  There might be a difference between selenium libs you can look at lib dir in Looking Glass to see selenium version LG is using.  You can replace them to whatever version you want..  I have noticed that some page elements are being updated by javascript even after whole page has been rendered.  This is most likely a timing issue.  To make sure that it is just put a sleep statement before you try to interact with the element.  I have even created my own click function that loops for  seconds waiting for an object to become visible.I have created google group for Looking Glass and other open source projects I plan to release.  That would be the best place to get support  Good luck!,selenium,cguuxz7,3,t5_2srjs

To make sure we were hitting our target I sent text color to the field and it displayed as expected. blur and focusout did not work with the same css.We also tried it in the Chrome console with the same results.Im cornering our primary React dev on Monday to see if he can provide any more insight.,selenium,cwal4ay,1,t5_2srjs
5842316,0,t1_cxkvk4d,Kibana is great to give an overview but we can not send all the metadata our testing framework produces like screenshots step by step status per test case etc. Our detailed reporting is served via Serenity BDD framework previous Thucydides  . In this way you dont have to look at Jenkins logs. For alerting we have always had emailpidgin notifications send around to the rest of the QA Test Engineers. So the overall process starts with Jenkins build that sends information to Kibana and alerts the responsible people for their respective test sets and we send the job name as well with every test case so if a failure is not reproducible we can go back to the job at Jenkins and check on the HTML report produced from the job.Pros and Cons Real time reporting is fast but you wouldnt want to send all the details of the HTML report while the HTML report is very detailed but you need for the Jenkins job to finish.Hope this helps to understand more our process here ,selenium,cxlgcxk,7,t5_2srjs
