2050301,0,t1_ckzxwyn,Collards do fantastically well.  I cant figure out my blueberries though.  Soil is acidic but they just stay stunted.  Had them now over  years and just over a foot tall.  Im moving them this fall.,seedexchange,cl0fsp2,1,t5_2s6bv

6768211,0,t3_3nz2vx,Completely missed the above post as it was made after the swap was finished for the year. In case anyone was wondering about the questionThe swap runs the same time every year. It starts at the end of September and seeds are due in mid November. I am the host amp I pick the dates. Here is why. I like to get the packages back out in the mail before the Christmas post office rush.  . Seed catalogues start coming out in January. This date allows people to plan their orders without doubling up.. Hot Peppers especially Superhots amp flowers are often started in January. . Good timing for popping in any garlic bulbils or walking onion before the ground freezes in many areas. Winter sowing seeds are also able to be placed out.. Canada has a HUGE diversity of planting weather. Google last frost dates across Canada. The swap date is early for some late for others. . The timing works for me. It takes at about an hour every day in October responding to questions and inputting wishlists. When the seeds start arriving it takes most of my free time to sort seeds amp lists. I typically spent  hours a day during the last week getting packages ready to mail. Basically the swap takes over my life in November!   If you find that the deadline is too early then perhaps this swap just doesnt suit your needs. There are quite a few that run early in the new year. Gardenweb now Houzz has Lots of group swaps.  Check out Seedy Saturdays in your area or focus on personal exchanges.For anyone who IS interested it is a fun exchange. The regular swappers are fantastic.  You can see the pride taken in sharing seed packages. From the colourful homemade packages with detailed planting instructions to the computer printed labels and gardening blog links. It is the kind generous swappers that make the packages great.If you would like to be added to the list of reminder emails please reach me on my blog or email as I dont get notifications for old Reddit threads! ,seedexchange,d0jggkq,1,t5_2s6bv
