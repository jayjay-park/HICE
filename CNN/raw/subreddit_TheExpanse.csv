2941930,0,t3_2tuawu,I really hope they nail the Roci crews relationship. They should be tighter than even Serenitys crew. My favorite Roci crew moment is when Holden feels like he has to announce that he and Naomi are a thing now and Jim starts to get bent out of shape with worry that itll complicate things and Amos and Alex are like Bout dang time you guys.I also cant wait for season  or whenever Bobbie shows up. I cant wait to see who they eventually cast in the role since I dont really know of anyone who would fit. Sometimes I wish I could be a casting director just so I could pull from a broader pool of acting talent to use in my imagination while reading. ,TheExpanse,co2ie1y,5,t5_2xi70

5770163,0,t3_3twk2m,Overall I liked it and am excited for the rest of the series.  This episode was so dense with information that you really need to be paying attention to take in all the stuff going on with Julie then to Miller then to Holden then to Avasarala and back again.  Unfortunately the sound mix was so weird with the background sound being louder than the dialogue made me feel like I was watching a silent film at times.  Ive read the books so I was able to pretty much know what was going on but I saw it with my dad who was asking me questions every few minutes because he kept missing key information.I think the episode was a little rushed but they wanted to end the episode with the destruction of the Canterbury which is a great ending to a pilot so we had to get a lot exposition and character introductions out of the way first.On the positive side the effects looked great.  The tone was really cool and the dirtiness and grittiness came across well.  I thought the writing and acting was good just felt a little rushed.

6190074,0,t3_403fg6,Why ships have to flip is because spaceships are not automobiles. If you put your foot on the gas pedal in an auto it moves. When you take your foot off the gas friction with the ground makes the auto slow to a stop.There aint no friction in space. There is nothing to drastically slow your spaceship down Newtons First Law says your ship will travel at its current speed forever.When you travel from Earth to Mars in your spaceship presumably you want to slow to a halt at Mars not crash into it at a hundred kilometers per second. So you have to burn your engines to slow down. Specifically burn in the opposite direction you are currently traveling.To burn in the opposite direction you have to flip the ship so it faces the opposite way. Hence flip and burn.,TheExpanse,cyt8vni,2,t5_2xi70

6221740,0,t3_40rv49,Spinning it up would be silly but Ceres looks like it might have a lot of useful resources  particularly water.    The surface gravity is only  Earth so getting stuff out of the gravity well is not that hard  youd could build a railgun to shoot buckets of material up for use.  You could build on the surface where digging into the rock would help with radiation shielding and build small ONeill cylinders for places where you wanted pseudo gravity.  I dont think people would be the point here  the advantage from my perspective would be access to resources and robotic systems might be best.  Use people as needed to help things work.  I think for the foreseeable future transit times to Ceres are going to be long so robotic craft that dont require life support resources and systems are going to be far more economical to operate.  Build ONeill cylinders but probably keep them near the Earth cheaper to get to and away from in an emergency until the technology matures or a needdesire arises to put them further away.You need a big offworld economy to justify more than a handful of people  focus on the economy and the people will follow.,TheExpanse,cywueuy,3,t5_2xi70
6223798,0,t3_40r8qb,Ill largely repeat what I said in another thread and I generally love making real worldhistorical comparisons to the Expanse so here goes The OPA is roughly equivalent to organizations like Hamas the PLO and Hezbollah. All three are quasi state entities in that they provide organization some degree of governmentlike services and act as political parties when legitimate politics are involved. All three do this in marginalized nonstate pseudostate or satellite state regions like Palestinian territories or parts of Lebanon. All three are also wellknown for their militant wings and acts of political violence terrorism The OPA is exactly that. Its a pseudogovernment a political party a culturalpolitical movement and an organization that commits political violence terrorism in the name of the people residing withing a pseudostatecolonial territorynonstate region. Some OPA members are on the asteroid habitats version of the city council. Other OPA adherents look out for Belters working the docks like a union rep. Still other OPA operatives carry out acts of political violence to further the OPAs goals. Wherewhen they can OPA people will try to assert themselves as the actual government of Belter or outer planet colonies. I like it because theyre a very nuanced approach to terrorists really adding to and embracing the everythings grey world of the Expanse series. ,TheExpanse,cyx2ttt,7,t5_2xi70

They would be carrier ships where the missile boats are stored and serviced.  These missile boats not crippled by having human crews would be little more than a drive a limited computer brain and the rest are missiles.  No limit to fast they can accelerate except design limits.  The missiles and boats would be loaded with a mission profile and objectives.  They would act autonomously within those parameters no hacking or interference once they have been launched.  Winning engagements would come down more to brute force numbers strategy intelligence and supply chains rather than tactics or fancy flying.

6628116,0,t3_46d5de,My biggest problem in getting people to watch The Expanse is when I say its a Science Fiction show.  The past decade or  have watered down Science Fiction so much in peoples minds that they think all Scifi must be somewhere between Aliens horror and Sharknado  goofy camp.  To a lot of people I talk to serious Scifi doesnt exist outside of the realm of books the best example aside from what Ive named above that they can come up with is Star WarsTrek or some low budget timetravel movie and both of those dont even come close to the feeling that The Expanse has.  Serious Scifi is a thing of the past but hopefully if we can change peoples minds about the nature if Scifi entertainment and get away from the campy lowbudgetcallitscifibecausewhothehellcares crap then we might be heading in a new and better direction.As an aside while the other Scifi shows on Syfy Killjoys Dark Matter could be considered somewhat campy I do enjoy them as much as The Expanse they are just a different version of what I consider  good Scifi because at least they try to do it right.,TheExpanse,d04wkas,1,t5_2xi70

6747494,0,t1_d0h6ktb,Yup the full name Outer Planets Alliance got mentioned several times early on but not often with the acronym too in the same scene.I agree there are many types of viewers and some more willing to simply go with the flow than others.  One of my friends in particular really love the show and Avasaralas character but as much as she enjoyed that they let the viewers figure out a lot of things she was really frustrated by that impression she was missing all the subtleties of the political plot all the time because her understanding of the world building was too limited and a lot of it was vague in her mind.   She enjoyed the show a lot more after I explained the great lines about Mars the UN and the OPA and she watched again from the first episode with that in mind.  It was much easier to get invested in that aspect of the story.  Its little things really.  They did explain Ceres at the very beginning but it was a bit early.  Its the Belts main trade port. The goods from the Belt and outer planets and the good from Earth and Mars all transit through it. It makes it a pivotal location for the OPA Mars and Earth. Earth controls it and keeps it running smoothly but the OPAs power is on the rise and it worries both Mars and Earth. At the start Avasarala believed Mars destroyed the Cantebury to stir up trouble on Ceres would blame Earth for having lost control of it and would use this as an excuse to come in and pacify Ceres in effect taking control of it from Earth.  The bit they did more poorly with is really Tycho Station. They didnt explain well why the OPA could seemingly run it unhindered.  CBQ was an awesome episode indeed.     Personally I thought at first they were doing quite a good job with the political exposition that they had simplified it all just enough so people wouldnt be confused and that it was a good thing to really focus on the OPAs cause for a while and let people sympathize with the Belters etc.  But I was a bit biased by my knowledge of the books I guess.Its via non reader friends and coming here after a few episodes that it made me realize a lot of people were quite confused by the shows background and others who thought they werent simply got a lot of stuff wrong.   Then it started showing up in reviews as well.  So I guess its a widespread issue they better address next season.  As I said not all of it is an issue either and people also need to be patient.  These are very focused books they dont get lost in subplots secondary players and world building porn and a lot of the world building gets revealed along the way.  A lot of the understanding of the solar systems politics and economics comes really into focus through book .  They are just starting to explain it.,TheExpanse,d0h8x2x,2,t5_2xi70

Yao is confident she can handle the situation from a military standpoint but its kind of Lopezs job to be worried about whats really behind it all.  Whats the point of the OPA in sending six ships on what amounts to a suicide mission six warships theyre not even supposed to have by all intel and if they do it would be extremely precious assets they look about to waste for what?????

7202223,0,t3_4dmjjs,I thought Nemesis Games went off the tracks.  The basic idea from Cibola Burns is that the opening of the ring worlds dooms the economy of Mars and the belt. Mars is kind of like the Soviet Union  no longer able to fund a super power military.  But the idea that the rebel belters could afford to buy it seems incredible. The belters are poor. Where would they get the money?  And as Avasarala foresees the problem in Cibola Burns she could have arranged for Earth to buy the Martian navy ships.  And why destroy the Earth?  Mars and the Belt depend on the Earth and dropping rocks on the Earth gives them no advantage or benefit.  And if asteroid weapons were such a danger why wouldnt Earth have a defense system in place?  And how are belters able to colonize the ring worlds? The gravity should make the planets uninhabitable for them?,TheExpanse,d1wu2s5,2,t5_2xi70

He sincerely believed in the Inner Planets as an alliance governing humanity and that their interests were aligned and he suffered for it as that political reality became fiction.

7391422,0,t1_d2hvdx0,Cibola Burn would have made a very good long novella.  As a novel its OK but not as great as the others.  Its strays too much from the larger story arc and this appeared even worse after NG that spectacularly returns to that.  I think this one might actually turn out better once dramatized than it feels in novel form especially if they shorten it quite a bit.  Basia once rid of his POV might be more interesting.The way they are going with the adaptation and the hints they are giving about their approach I doubt well recognize that much the structure of the story by the time they reach that part of it.  Theyve given up on a central concept of the novels to focus each story on an adventure of the Rocithe crew.  Already in season  we see that this is much more the story of the universe with a few focus points Holden being always one forcibly. Ty or Daniel warned that as the series moves along it might diverge more and more from the structure and specific plot as opposed to the larger story they are staying faithful to of the books. From what they are hinting at what theyve changed already I seriously doubt Avasarala or Fred Johnson are going to take long break from the series any time soon. This will probably turn out true of Bobbie too. Maybe Dawes will make guest appearances and there are signs they probably intend to move forward Naomis back story perhaps because they need a certain player to start interfering sooner. I kind of expect them to introduce sooner than later some Martian political or diplomatic figure too to complete the triad of the factions. What this suggests is that they wont stop telling the political story the bigger picture that in the novels can take a more secondary role for a while especially in AG and CB where they merely book end it.  What I think they might do for CB is condense the novels story intercut with an AvasaralaFredMarcoSmithMichio Pa etc. storyline that will set up the events of Nemesis Game.  NGs That could culminate not only with the departure of the Roci from Ilus but also coincide to Filips attack on the Martian shipyard.  I think they may expand the story told in the Vital Abyss into something like a story line about the whole conspiracy introducing the Martians into it sooner etc.I expect they will do something a bit like that for AG as well. I think theyll develop a story line that progresses in system while the Roci and co. are on the other side. It would just have to be something for which what happens on one side might be impacted a lot by what is going on the other side so that the two arcs come together in a momentous way at the end.    AG to NGs Options for Bobbie could include joining the Roci crew early or returning to the Marines and being part of the contingent sent to the Ring and beyond or starting early her work for Avasarala on Mars and being the anchor character for Mars like Avasarala is for the UN arc in season .,TheExpanse,d2ics0a,4,t5_2xi70

Given that Havelock and Miller didnt part on good terms in the show Im not sure well even see him until his part in the later novels which I havent read yet!Which also reminds me LWs Did they ever mention Protogen in the show? I just rewatched it and couldnt find it anywhere. It was one perk of visiting the Anubis after Eros because that mystery was solved. Instead they introduced Dresden and Thoth in the final two episodes without ever explicitly stating the groups name.,TheExpanse,d80ndw4,1,t5_2xi70

Particularly with regard to Miller  I feel hes much more likable in the book both in his motivation for finding Julie his realizations about himself and about how he feels about her and his interactions with everybody else especially Havelock. You also get the sense that deep down he actually is a good guy but that a lifetime of seeing people do the worst to each other has drastically altered his perspective and he ends up being worldweary.  In the show he seems more prideful than anything else.That said I really wonder how theyre going to handle him next season.  With where hes currently at in the show characterizationwise his actions at the end of the book dont really seem to track with that too well. For example In LW s he actually cries when he realizes Holden considers him part of the crew of the Roci and I cant see the show version of him reacting that way at all.  I have a feeling the show is going to continue to characterize him as an asshole loose cannon type which would be kind of a shame because it would really minimize the emotional impact of his story a bit.,TheExpanse,dc4posv,1,t5_2xi70

There wasnt any mention by anyone from the show that Netflix now has a say in the content of the show the way the broadcaster Syfy Alcon is producing the show for does.  The mention Netflix Original is something Netflix likes to negotiate when they grab exclusive rights in a market. We got told by people from the show after the episode in which Avasarala said shit the scenes at Holdens mom that while s was still filming they learned that Syfy was relaxing its directives about foul language and so they could give her that first shit.   That person cant recall if it was TyDan or one of the showrunners added that we could expect a bit more colourful language from Avasarala in s.  Syfy probably decided that mentalities have evolved or saw their demographics for the Expanse is older or simply made a strategic decision that edgier language would be good for the networks brand theyre currently repositioning with shows like The Expanse.Hope the swearing isnt muted on the broadcast or at least the iTunes version.

This type of slang comes from repeated attempts at communicating until the slang becomes widely known by all cultures living in the belt  forming a new language.

Youve got to make compromises it was already hard enough to find a polyesian actress tall and stacked enough with the right age and good at her job acting that is jurys still out as to how good she is I personnally find her good but definitely not great.Im not even gonna dignify your stupid comment criticizing her for being somehow chubby instead of some kind of  bodybuilder. Dont mistake instagramabs for fitness look at female MMA fighters or tennis players for example lots of them have curves and are still extremely fit and strong.For now the main problem I see is that her character has been extremely dumbed down in the first episodes. I understand the need to make her grow during the show and introduce her earlier but I think it gave Bobbie AND Frankie quite the baggage...

11161420,0,t1_dewumes,Not sure I see what could be major deviations but of course we all have different perceptions of whats major and what isnt.To my perception they are being extremely faithful so far to the bigger picture the political story from book  to  if you prefer.  They have also been extremely faithful to the essence of the first books Roci crew story line and so far its much the same with for CW.  The details of each major event vary massively but for me that doesnt count as big deviations.   The arc that got a major rewrite is Avasaralas but so far its better than the books  and I dont mean how shes depicted or her language etc. for that I love both versions of the character for different reasons  I rather mean the politics are better written and more interesting in the show than they were in the earlier books.  Its like from the start they approached that aspect of the story the way it is in the books circa book .  That OPA meeting for instance was stellar stuff.  The political scenes in the Eros episode were also really great.

The Apollo  fire occurred because they pressurized the capsule to around psi to simulate onorbit operations and did so with pure O. Conversely gas based fire suppression systems such as ye olde halon systems arent actually designed to remove all the oxygen from the area.

11436294,0,t1_dfs22b6,When you have drives as efficient as they do in the series aerodynamics dont matter nearly as much. It would make sense for the MCRN drop pod to be designed to power its way down to more or less maintain g as it falls through much of the atmosphere. At the upper layers its doing rocket assist to slow down and avoid entry heating. We saw in the initial part of the first view of it that it deployed  control surfaces on the corners so it steers its way down as it falls at terminal velocity then at the appropriate time they engage the rockets again to slow down and do a powered landing.Basically its falling with style.Going the other way again when your drives are efficient enough you climb straight up at constant velocity paying a terrible gravity drag penalty but do you care? then pitch over and accelerate to orbital velocity.,TheExpanse,dfsajo2,5,t5_2xi70

I also did notice all the ambiguity of his relationship with Avasarala.  It was almost as if he looked up to her and genuinely wanted her on his side.  At times he looked like a boy who did something really bad and doesnt want mummy to find out but at the same time he might have wanted mummy to approve of what he did.  The thought even crossed my mind that he might throw himself at Avasaralas mercy since she had made him an offer but I didnt think the writers would have the balls to make that change.  We see him at a desk writing a manuscript letter... thats very quaint and formal...  I put my wager on a resignation letter which could explain the domestic scenes and the novel.

So maybe they had the best power armour you can currently get and thats why they were able to defeat the Donnager Marines. That would only make sense for the book though because in the TV show the Protogen guys look like theyre wearing fancy diving suits not ultra strong heavy power armour.I reckon the TV show retconned the book.

They justify this because of what you said about Earth as a wholeabundant resources breathable atmosphere wealth enough to provide for everyone.But like you also said Basic is far from a life of leisure and far from a choice for many many people on Earth. Its a hard sad meager and generally unpleasant existence and it persists not because people choose it but because there literally are not enough jobs and opportunities for them to do anything else.I didnt say the Martian view of Basic was hubris just that it was propaganda.
