136403,0,t3_1vmhci,Heres a great chart on oilsbutters and what they add to soap and how much to use Either HP or CP blend it in with your other oils. If doing CP you will probably need to heat your oils up to melt it or use a warmhot lyewater solution and allow that to melt your oils called the heat transfer method  if your recipe traces quickly youll want to warm up your oils first. ,soapmaking,cetysp1,3,t5_2tux8

1211822,0,t3_27xdmv,When you make any soap there is a chance for it to cool unevenly and that is what happened to your cracked soap. To fix a crack you can spray it with alcohol and cover it with some plastic wrap. It should then seal itself back together. When you are CPOP a soap  just get the oven to  and put the soap into the oven and turn the oven off. Keeping the light on gives a little extra heat. Leave it in the oven overnight and it should be fine. You could use a towel or even a big plastic box covered with a blanket and get a similar effect. The one thing about adding lavender buds is that on the top of the soap it is fine but once you incorporate and stir into the soap it will look like mouse droppings and turn brown from the batter. I personally hate the way it looks. I keep it on the top only.,soapmaking,ci5y5dn,1,t5_2tux8

2519622,0,t3_2oigja,Generally  its a good idea to keep the gloves on until after youve stowed away the filled mold safely. The lye in the batter can still cause a pretty nasty chemical burn.While saponification can occur within  hours your soap will be not all be reflective of what it will be after  weeks of curing. Its going to be a squishy mess that may hurt your skin after only a day. Resist the urge and try to wait to sample the soap after it has cured to its full potential. Cure times vary but most cold process soaps take at least four weeks my goat milkolive oil soaps take nearly two months . What kind of soap or what recipe are you using? That might help us advise you a bit better.My safety faux paux  I removed my gloves right after molding once and accidentally brushed the back of my hand and forearm to the top of the filled mold. Very very uncomfortable itchy burn that carried on for days.

I used to use my Note s camera...then I discovered my fiance has a Cannon Rebel Ti.Despite having lights and a lightbox my Note  raw images were coming out yellow forcing me to correct it later in Photoshop. No matter what I did I couldnt get the yellow out of my photos. The Rebel Ti has a bunch of settings on it like white balance isos ect so even with the same light settings beforeI also got a better background setup my raw pictures can pretty much be set to go with just a simple crop This is just me though. I agree with uJology that with great lighting you can use any camera in any setting.

4026368,0,t1_crf3ooq,I think coco butter would be perfect. Just make sure you pust it into the soap calc to see how much lye and water you need. Also remember to always add lye to water not the other way around. When mixing your oils. You can just measure out the olive and coconut oil in a micing bowl and melt them together either on the stove or microwave get it to about  degrees Fahrenheit  then afterwards add ur coco butter. Thatll help bring down ur temperature. Then you wanna mix your lye into your water. I like to get my oils and lye within about  degrees of each other before mixing. Just a heads up your oil will stay hotter than your lye for longer. Youll want to add your lye to the oils when your lye is about  and your oil . Your oil can also be about  and your lye . Ive made soap both ways. after you mix your lye into water youll want to hand stir for about  minutes then use your emerssion hand blender to mix until it looks like pudding. Take short  second breaks to just stir it without the power on to get any air bubbles out. Then dump it all into your mold! If its a rubber mold you may wanna use cardboard on the outsides to make it more stable so it doesnt like bend outwards. edit grammar typed this on my phone ,soapmaking,crf8hss,1,t5_2tux8

5295433,0,t3_3nies4,Bright and vivid colors can be tricky to achieve. For example if you have a soap recipe that gives you a very white bar of soap getting it to color a bright red will be VERY challenging. One thing you may want to consider if you are using cold process is to stop gel phase from happening by placing your soap in the fridge. Non gelled soaps tend to have better color vibrance than those that go through a complete gel. ,soapmaking,cvojwsy,2,t5_2tux8

The most important thing you can do is freeze the milk or coffee first.Freezing in ice cube trays will yield better results than freezing in one big chunk.

I feel that this can be a contributing factor to DOS but although I have read about some experiments done by soapbloggers those are only based on empirical observations that allow one to make better guesses how to avoid the problem.  But these experiments offer nothing in terms of qualitative data such as would be obtained with ICP or MS and I wouldnt go to those lengths unless I had access to that facility through work or school.  I wish there was some study or even anecdote that said something like We believe that the high Fe levels present in this water sample could have caused this batch of soap to be more susceptible to oxidation by facilitating the formation of freeradicals.  I just made that up as an example of the type of declarative statement I wouldnt mind seeing.  Other species such as chlorine and chloramine in the water could also do the same thing.Here is a cool little summary of reactions involving freeradical chemistry.Here is a paper published by some researchers at the University of Buenos Aires about a study of lipid peroxidation which is the reason why transfats are unhealthy for internal consumption.

Crude pomace oil inasmuch as it could exist would be the olive mash left over once the mechanical pressings had removed all possible oil. If youve got the fear about hexane and dont want to use pomace oil for this reason then you are probably looking for regular nonvirgin olive oil available in every supermarket.  I recommend the extralight version.  This isnt pomace oil however.Soapmaking would be the one area where the bland uniformity of pomace oil is actually a good thing.

Each time I am learning new things and testing my batches every which way I can for safety. It was drilled in my head that best practices are you should not give or sell one bar of soap until you have insurance and are confident in your recipes. Id feel horrible if someone had a bad reaction to my soaps or I did something wrong in labeling etc. I have filed a fictitious business name and started the process of getting business license etc. Though that is with the intent that in  months would want to start selling from my own website and be a legit business. I have heard of people that start soaping and in first couple of months throw up an Etsy store and taking orders even before the first bars have cured. From what I see there is so much to learn on all sides of business and the process that shouldnt be selling till have the knowledge of it all.  Also theres quality standpoint I would think.
