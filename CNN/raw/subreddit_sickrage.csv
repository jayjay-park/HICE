8763408,0,t3_503wkk,gtWhat I was expecting is those episodes to be reset to wanted statusThis would be terrible.  No one should assume that the file they just deleted presumably because they watched it and dont want it anymore would be immediately REdownloaded.gtthis is the default status I have setNo its not.  The options for Default deleted episode status are Archived Ignored or Skipped.   If you want to set something to Wanted you can easily do it manually.,sickrage,d7135n8,2,t5_2rj81
