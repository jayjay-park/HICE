596602,0,t3_20yv65,Ill be posting on the subreddit tomorrow As a side note  We started on  and downed Garrosh on . So its taken us four months from start to finish with the major winter holidays in the way. It looks like we spent a little over a month on Big G himself which shouldnt be too surprising as we had to gear two toons from scratch once we started and only a bajillion different strategies. Congratulations again all. ,ffsgarry,cg835q6,3,t5_2z1y1
