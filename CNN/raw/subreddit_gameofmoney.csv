320664,0,t3_1xrh3c,I have not researched SODA at all but from a strictly consumer standpoint what makes people want to buy into SODA products? Not talking about stock here just the products themselves. What is the appeal? Why do I want to make soda instead of buy it? It seems only marginally less expensive and Ive heard less than promising things about their syrup flavors. ,gameofmoney,cfe08wy,1,t5_30b3r

525001,0,t3_205gl1,I have no postilions in these stocks but it seems crazy how all  dropped and rebounded at exactly the same time. Seems like market manipulation to me.,gameofmoney,cfzy5ku,1,t5_30b3r
539178,0,t1_cg1c7t2,I dont use golden crosses as the end all be all to when to put money down on a stock. Rather I use them as an indicator for signifying a possible leg up or run. I begin to watch more heavily the price action and daily volume on stocks that are approaching golden crosses to see if a lot of other technical traders are loading up andor if freshnew money is coming in.,gameofmoney,cg1k7tt,1,t5_30b3r
540149,0,t3_20adcm,Ive also considered writing a book more on power than money. About different types of power with colloquial stories from my last experience.

2835960,0,t1_cnqfbjy,Yeah why buy  more today? There is no demand for these right now.  of the people that could be convinced these are the future have bought. Youre not going to sell regular people a bitcoin for  or more. And everyone says hurr durr its about making transactions in bitcoins not just buying them. which is all well but for  of the population and  of their transactions cash or a Visa card work better than Bitcoin does. ,gameofmoney,cnqg18u,1,t5_30b3r
