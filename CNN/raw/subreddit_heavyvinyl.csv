147703,0,t1_cev8vm6,Well I really cant say anything bad about it other than the fact that since its unofficial its not directly supporting the band. But its not like theyre making it easy to do that when it comes to getting the album anyway!Just a tip I made this order from prophecy.de shop section you might have to search. They offer free shipping for orders over  euro and thats worldwide. Its pretty much the only reason I was even able to get these albums in the first place since so many people charge  euro extra for shipping to the US so I saved enough money on that alone to make it worthwhile.,heavyvinyl,cev95za,1,t5_2uogx

899779,0,t3_24fa4j,Neurosis Pain Of Mindst PressingBlack VinylAlchemy RecordsStill one of my favorite punk records ever.  The Word As Lawst PressingClear VinylLookout RecordsAlong with Pain of Mind I feel like this record is underappreciated because of the later era.  Still a great metalpunk record and definitely a massive inspiration in my style of guitar playing. Souls At ZeroReissueGrey amp Black SwirlRelapse RecordsI went bonkers at MDF when they ripped into The Web Scored the repress because I wanted the extra songs Enemy Of The SunReissueRed amp Black SwirlRelapse RecordsPicked this up with Souls at Zero. Through Silver In BloodFirst Euro PressBlack VinylIron City Records GermanyThis has been at the top of my wantlist for YEARS.  Top five record for sure.  That goddamn bagpipe in Purify gives me frisson like no other song when it kicks in.  I put off buying this when I got through school I put off buying it when I got a decent job.  A month ago I had to get some unexpected car repairs done.  My shop hooked me up and I ended up with  extra that I thought Id have to spend on the car.  Saw a copy for sale in good condition at a good price.  Pulled the trigger.  I havent even listened to it yet because I want to be totally focused and just let this album demolish me.  Given To The Rising First PressBlack  Gram VinylNeurot Recordings Still a damn good record but not on the level of the other  to me.  I scored it for  from a friends moving sale a few years back though.  Triple gatefold jacket is pretty crucial.  Debating on finishing the collection but honestly dont care as much for the other albums to pay collector prices.  Not to say they arent great but these first  are some of my favorite records of all time.  Anyone holding a good copy of Times of Grace though...feel free to toss a price my way.,heavyvinyl,ch6k5wa,3,t5_2uogx

1359856,0,t3_29nwlc,Posted this on rvinyls listening group last week but it didnt seem to catch any interest. I really dig the band so I thought it should be shared here as well. It a whole different level of heavy.        Tarantula HawkUntitled    Well there are actually two Untitled Lps by this band but they pair up like a LP set. Vicious stuff!   Imagine if Emerson Lake and Palmer took a time machine to the year  and soaked up live performances from all of the current doom sludge and heavy metal bands and then went back to create a new postTarkus album album. I think the sound would probably be close to what Tarantula Hawk has crafted. This band is amazing yet not very talked about.    Every now and again a group comes along that is just to much for people to accept. Maybe in  more years a kid will dig up these albums and fall in a trance over them.

Which isnt to say that blue collar USPM is lesser or anything cause the reviewer classified Jag Panzer and Manowar or something as blue collar which are both awesome bands just for different reasons.,heavyvinyl,dd7mvrh,1,t5_2uogx
