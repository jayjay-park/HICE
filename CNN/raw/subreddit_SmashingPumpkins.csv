Computers werent really being used by neckbeards in their basement back then even relatively powerfulexpensive producers werent using them as a standard back then. Given the rise of EDM and mashup hits mostly by guys on  laptops their parents gave them for graduating high school this is so spot on.,SmashingPumpkins,cjp6cmf,4,t5_2sg3a

6352010,0,t3_42nh1j,Very wellwritten and fantastic list.As much as I love SD and MCIS I feel that Adore and Machina featured some of Billys best work. They were flawed albums no doubt but it really showed that there was more to the Pumpkins than screaming and pulling off stadiumcrushing riffs. The last two prebreakup records really embodied the bands maturity as well as the fans and audience who grew up with them. Its always nice to see someone give those two underrated albums some love esp Machina.Awesome list.,SmashingPumpkins,czbniqq,2,t5_2sg3a

7236176,0,t3_4ecjqc,This is really hard as there simply arent many bands like the Pumpkins.  Id say it depends on what you like about SP.  Let me give my thoughts on some of the popular suggestions Silversun Pickups ok shoe gaze if you like song like Whir or Rocket.  Doesnt have Billys blazing leads Jimmys awesome drumming or the army of guitar overdub layering.   My Bloody Valentine Loveless is a great record.  Does have the guitar fuzz army very similar to Siamese Dream but again without the leads and the drumming.  The other things I enjoy that are the most SP like are Muse has fairly talented musicality from all parties.   Coheed amp Cambria especially their Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth album Dave Matthews only for the insane drumming by Carter.  The only person I consider up there with Jimmy.  But otherwise not very SP like.    The Cure Wish is amazing.  If you dont know every note you should get started now.   Other s bands Alice in Chains Live Pearl Jam Silverchair Manson NIN Foo Fighters especially the albums produced by Butch Vig Garbage Tool Some maybes  Deftones Altar Bridge Anberlin Finally make sure you explore the full breadth of the Pumpkins catalog.  Zwan the Tony Iommi record with Billy on it all the Bsides and unreleased stuff.  Theres a LOT of great stuff hiding there if you havent hit it yet.  ,SmashingPumpkins,d20p8mz,2,t5_2sg3a

11462990,0,t1_dfvanzc,Not sure. Most of all their early stuff simply said Smashing Pumpkins and it wasnt until MCIS that the The became prominent. At the time I thought it was just Billy trying to be super fancy  like when you look at the album art its all very pseudoVictorian and I thought it was an extension of that ethos.Even when you watch the Simpsons episode he says Billy Corgan Smashing Pumpkins  sure its scripted but it exemplifies the joke he was trying to make when he named the band. It was meant to be smashing as in destroying as well as smashing as in the Austin Powers way of saying brilliant or great.But yeah the The stayed around until Zeitgeist American Gothic and TBK where it was noticeably absent but then popped up again on Oceania and Monuments,SmashingPumpkins,dfvbmqp,4,t5_2sg3a

I think I like Dross the best but voted for Home because it is good on so many levels. Its a big song and how it got overlooked for so long is baffling. It should have showed up on a soundtrack somewhere or something. Its just warm and endearing. It feels like a great U song or at least cinematic.,SmashingPumpkins,dgp2p7t,4,t5_2sg3a
