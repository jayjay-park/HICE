10082272,0,t3_5k6ovo,Right now the pool of players is all platforms. The limitation is that there is no way to squad up with people on other platforms most likely because the PSVR version relies on PSN friends list Oculus relies on Oculus home accounts etc. I was able to search for a game at the same time as a PSVR friend and found himsent a squad invite though the end of round interface but he wasnt able to accept it. Isnt possible at the moment and really killed a large drive for me to play this. ,valkyrie,dblqn0d,5,t5_2qrax

10648752,0,t1_dde2qyq,I should have added Im not huge on fps style games Im more of a RPG type. I think its a great game just not worth the cost for me.,valkyrie,ddec4o9,0,t5_2qrax
11503561,0,t1_dfzxaw8,Haha. Vr but cross platform though. I fail to see why Sony is solely to blame for it being in vr only and even if they are its all the more a better game for it.   ,valkyrie,dfzxg99,1,t5_2qrax
