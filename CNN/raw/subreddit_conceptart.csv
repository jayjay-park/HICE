230208,0,t1_cf4f0z3,First off I wouldnt have even known you werent English if you hadnt of pointed it out you write very well.  You make a good point about the amount of objectification across the board. Do you think the widespread use of stereotypes is a sign of an industry unwilling to create original content? When I think about my favourite films or books they seem to be the ones that push the boundaries of that genre whilst still acknowledging what they are. Although I see some games throw up interesting propositions for a story such as Skyrim Dishonoured or the Batman games they have never hit the mark as being a great story but instead are more of a it was pretty good. Some come close most notably Metro Last Light Sleeping Dogs and Dead Space. If you consider the the kind of story these games tell the games that offer something new rather than the stereotypical characters and story are usually the most memorable. If objectified characters are a hallmark of storytelling what does that tell us about the industry surrounding it?,conceptart,cf4lxhe,2,t5_2rif3

302068,0,t3_1xk0f7,In the beginning make your threshold for success very easy.  For example make your goal to draw for  minutes a day.  Keep that streak going as long as you can. You can track this using a number of apps for you phone simply search for Seinfeld Chain The trick is to get in the habit and dont stop.  You can always draw longer but get those  minutes in.  After a while you can up your daily goal but dont make it so high that you will get burned out.  This is really important!When you sit and draw pick a focus perspective anatomy shading line weight etc..  This will allow you to actually improve as you draw rather than always drawing what you already know. Finally split your time three ways Drawing From Life Drawing from Reference Drawing from Imagination.  Each will inform the other and make you better. ,conceptart,cfc2q43,5,t5_2rif3

2035506,0,t1_ckv98lr,If your responses were to keep us up to date with your improvement and advice about the work itself its a polite way to say that your work is not good enough yet. I know many people feel their work is very good and why wouldnt they? Theyve been told their whole time in education that its great but the reality is that good isnt good enough. Your work needs to be exceptional if youre gunning for a salaried industry job. And to be honest most people dont reach that level straight out of college. You may be in your late s before you get to be a payrolled concept artist for a company.Focus on individual one off projects and commissions. ,conceptart,ckyk34k,1,t5_2rif3

3902298,0,t1_cr11xw6,Your right there  there are not many. Ive worked in places with  or  ratios of concept to art team.But  Every studio Ive been at hard at least one new guy. Sure they have leads with of  years in  but there is always one or two new people. One studio I was at which only three full time concept guys  per game  one of them was fresh out of school. So shes answer is  yes  major competition  but also  a real chance. Probably a better chance than pro sports for instance or making it in music.,conceptart,cr13hc2,1,t5_2rif3

5006589,0,t3_3jglx6,So I wanted to do a paint over but I cant until later. For nowAnatomically  I would say the eyes are too close together. Typically you want to line up the corner of the eyes where the tear ducts are with the corner of the nose. The neck is also too thin making the head look really large in comparison. But thats just a stylize choice Im guessing and that is up to you. Theres a few more things but I will come back with a redline later. Colors Your shadows are very warm and saturated. Typically with lights and shadows they are the opposite of each other. For example if you have a warm light the shadow will typically will be cooler. You can mix a little bit of purple and blue  especially because of the armor which would have created a reflected blue light back to the neck jaw and chin. Hope this helps you! ,conceptart,cuphdrw,2,t5_2rif3

6821872,0,t1_d0pfg91,Dude as another artists finding my way I find your attitude kind of ridiculous. I understand theres lots of big companies who underpay artists and thats a big problem and its a difficult topic for sure  but this guy just coming on here to ask anyone if they want to partake in his project hes doing through passion is something that shouldnt be slammed down.Hes not making any money from it the D artists arent why should the concept artist? If everyones in it for free for fun to make some friends why is that wrong? Im involved in a indie project which is doing an HD remake of an old game. Everyone involved is doing it for free in there spare time and everyone is doing it because they love the old game and they love what they do. This guy isnt asking you to do  hours a week for free hes asking you to do a measly . Thats nothing and if theres someone out there who wants to do that for fun theres nothing wrong with that. Whats funny is Ive spoken to recruiters for game companies and heard talks from professionals and a lot of them say that getting involved in small gigs in your spare time is absolutely something you should do. My friend a while back got offered to work on DayZ and turned it down as it was free and small at the time but now shes kicking herself as it would have been a great thing on her portfolio even if she did it for free. Anyway uXblade Im gonna send you a PM. I dont know if my style really fits and Id like to know a bit more but Id be interested to chat ,conceptart,d0pk3fh,1,t5_2rif3
6996260,0,t3_4bien7,Heya pals I put up a vlog discussing and doing a demo on how to use the loop tool to do super rapid and loose composition and lighting exploration for an environment.  The demo starts at .  The technique is pretty specific when you can use it but it is still a good tool to have in your back pocket.  A quick heads up early this April I am heading in studio to RIOT and I hope to get a couple different artists on so watch for that down the road.  Cheers!

I am currently a freelancer but its a hard time and I would love some financial stabilization. I know that my skills are not there yet to call myself a professional concept artist but I try to better my skillset so I hope that with time Ill manage.

10949762,0,t3_5we6ap,The jawlines dont match. Try flipping the image horizontally to get a different perspective. The mouth looks a little off in terms of      colour consider that seen from straight on the upper lip is often a little darker due to how light hits it.  The colour thats under the top layer of pink on the upper lip could probably be a better choice. Good use of colour generally though.,conceptart,de9e2f1,6,t5_2rif3
