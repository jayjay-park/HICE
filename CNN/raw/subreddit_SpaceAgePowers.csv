But doing some math I was able to get that by the time  rolled around Japan probably had  active service members. I have no idea how many were in reserves.Anyway your military seems fine.

7723285,0,t1_d3k2hth,The gelling agent is promising but requires more work. Torpedoes are improved satisfactorily but it proves too weak to propel the nuke quickly needing more development. The improved torpedoes will enter service however.The petrol fuelair bomb fulfils all requirements and will be deployed to the air force with an improved version underway. However the coaldust bomb excels expectations in all regards prompting immediate deployment as it can destroy near anything within m of the detonation point even able to destroy bunkers with ease as the dust filters through the air supply. Thousands are ordered built as it uses extremely cheap coal mined in many parts of the Union.OOC NonNuclear Nukes! Thermobaric weapons are great.Explosive designs improve slightly on the currently used Amatol but will see more work before use.AntiAir sights are also improved slightly but need more work as do the improved missile prototypes.Balloon mines likewise need more work with larger hydrogen balloons to be added.Counter espionage is also successful capturing a trio of enemy spies in Sweden The Unions industrial powerhouse and killing a trio in Finland while another trio in Denmark is uncovered but not yet found. The lone spy remaining in Norway is undetected thought to have fled.uicecreamsandwich ,SpaceAgePowers,d3k31u0,1,t5_3abam

7729219,0,t1_d3kqxpi,OOC Thats actually my favourite part of history. However Theres a difference between the ultimatum from Austriahungary and my ultimatum to Yugoslavia. AustriaHungarys required Serbia to essentially give up their sovereignty. And serbia agreed to all the clauses but that one. In comparison my ultimatum is nice. Not only that Yugoslavia has no binding alliance with you. To add onto that even witha ll of that the Russian Tsar was considering withdrawing and stopping mobilisation before one trigger phrase from his aide convinced him otherwise. Russia was also reeling from the RussoJapanese defeat which embarrassed the empire heavily. It viewed its loss of prestige in Crimea and since then to be very embarrassing and believed that it had to recover this at all cost and wanted to keep its influence in the Balkans. TLDR The conditions that started WWI were completely different.I like war though. I finally got my good nuclear bomb made and within a few months my intercontinental missiles will probably be ready. At least I hope so lol.,SpaceAgePowers,d3kra1v,1,t5_3abam

9217914,0,t3_56lo2u,Japans Emperor and Prime Minister arrive along with their delegation via a convoy of airplanes. The planes are carrying the Japanese submissions to the contest. Notable displays are The OU Superheavy Tank an enormous superheavy tank with  lateral turrets and one mm main gun. Although its armor is not as advanced as the Nordic M it uses a sophisticated slanting design that deflects up to  of shots fired at it up to being the key phrase.... It is fast has a long range and is capable of defending itself on any side. The ChiTo Medium Tank is marketed as the most advanced medium tank in the world with extremely fast movement speed and maneuverability and the same type of slanted armor as the OU Superheavy. It has a mm main gun with a high rotation rate and  lateral machine gun turrets. Because of its size and quiet engines it is also extremely well camouflaged. The K Lightningbolt Fighter is the crowning jewel of the Japanese air force with a top speed of nearly  mph an accurate onboard radar control system  long range missiles  short range missiles a dualfire machine gun and highly advanced wings that give it unprecedented maneuverability and control. The K Flying Fortress  Bomber is a flying tank with thick armor turrets on all sides and bombs to spare. It also has a pressurized cabin that can carry up to  crew and has incredible maneuverability for so large of a plane. Its top speed is well over  mph making it one of the fastest highaltitude bombers in production.Additionally other Japanese technologies including artillery guns submarines and other ships are on display. ,SpaceAgePowers,d8kfsj4,1,t5_3abam
