5820214,0,t3_3uw6cl,Addendum Votes Defection Failure Yes. Not all revolts will be successful it seems fair that theres a chance to fail. Itll also lead for some very interesting scenarios haha.  No AI Wars No. The AI being able to make its own war choices will make the game go by faster and it would also lead for interesting RP situations.  ModMade Events No. If they are a frequent and common occurrence like in the Hybrid Game then I vote no because there are way too many factions and it would delay the progression of turns. It would also probably offend some of our more delicate members who dont wish for there to be a player impact on the game. I would however agree to occasional maybe once every three or four parts? events that can affect multiple factions at the same time. Essentially I guess is that I think there shouldnt be a lot of little events but the occasional big events Red Wedding anyone? might be nice. If there are events then they shouldnt affect the game too much more so I suppose it would be better if they were held as RP sessions or something I dont know. In the words of Briusky As prompts for RP  no predefined choices.Quetzal Accords NonAggression Pacts Yes. DenouncementsDoF Yes. Both players and the AI should be allowed to partake in this. Players being able to do this will help encourage interaction and the AI doing it on its own will help make things interesting especially if the factions havent had much interaction before.  Money Transfer Yes. A few ? ? people were saying that they would leave if Hybrid Rules were implemented. If Money Transfer isnt implemented it would for all terms and purposes effectively kill the ERC a faction of  nearly double the amount of members saying theyd be forced to leave. There would no longer be a point for us to be our own faction.  Mercenaries and Foreign Aid Yes. In the same way that I dont want the ERC to be effectively destroyed I dont want Lord Hunters Mercenaries to suffer either. Without this theyd cease to function and wouldnt have a purpose to exist much like the ERC without commerce.  Rebellion No. As much as I love the idea of rebellions as some users have pointed out it would probably be hard for the host and his computer. Unless TurretBox states that he is absolutely confident his computer could handle Revolutions I vote No. Defecting Yes. Trade Yes. ,CBRBattleRoyale,cxijzcp,3,t5_3ayhm
