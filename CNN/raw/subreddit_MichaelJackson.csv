2733943,0,t3_2r6gs1,There is more to this story. Michael got Samm Brown back once they were in a hotel together. Michael ordered room service for Samm to try to make him look like he was cheating too. I read the full story somewhere. Trying to find it now!,MichaelJackson,cneu5wi,2,t5_2r12q
2738813,0,t1_cnf4gx6,Xscape was my third most listened to album of the year. Except I really disliked the non deluxe edition album I thought most songs were horribly overproduced with the exception of a few. The only ones I felt were improved were Love Never Felt So Good the original was a acoustic anyway and I felt the Justin version was incredibly unnecessary. Nothing wrong with having JT in there but the production on the second original version was much better. Slave To The Rhythm XscapeLoving You  I prefer the original although I do enjoy the new version too mainly for the piano riff. Not a huge fan of either Chicago version the song is just ok.Blue Gangsta is probably one of the worst MJ songs put on an album if not the worst. The less said about it the better.The original Do You Know Where Your Children Are is far better the album version just sounds like a B side remix on the single.My least favourite album version is A Place With No Name  the original version would have been perfect for the album they completely changed the tone and made it an electronic sounding song which completely just blends into the other songs a lot of them just sound the same. The original wouldve been a welcome change to this sound if left in the album.,MichaelJackson,cnfe3j8,1,t5_2r12q

Instead they declined and basically allowed Murray to earn untold amounts off the back of his crime.
