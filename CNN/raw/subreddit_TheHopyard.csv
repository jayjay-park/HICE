4562941,0,t1_ct5rkgb,Chances are relatively pretty good that they are unique! If they were planted before  or so I would say that it is more likely they are unique and unknown than known.You can get them tested by some most? MJ testing places... thats one hidden benefit of the weed boom. ,TheHopyard,ct5rvxx,1,t5_38d21

5294067,0,t3_3ngy82,Hops vernalize quite well. They need  weeks depending on strainat f. Because theyre in pots if you just leave them outside theyll go through freezethaw many times which will damage the plant.You can bring them into your garage but a safer option would be to bury them in the ground and cover them with some kind of mulch. The ground will insulate them from the changing weather.If you do decide to bring them into the garage water them very occasionally they use very little water while vernalizing but you dont want them to dry out.Also you want to cut the plant back to the crown.Just Google hop vernalization  and youll find all or most of the above to be true.,TheHopyard,cvodn3u,4,t5_38d21
7116368,0,t1_d1n0xho,Sorry I should have included the growth information.  These are crowns that were pulled from the grown given to me by a local home brewer.  They were established and he had grown them for about  years before I transplanted them.   Based on your comment uquietseditionist then I should be cutting back that  inch Chinook as there are other buds near the dirt.?.?    ,TheHopyard,d1n1ilg,2,t5_38d21

7903494,0,t1_d43labj,Thank you is your farm based out on Minnesota? How much do hops sell for Ive seen conflicting prices anywhere from  lb.,TheHopyard,d44ffar,1,t5_38d21
7923465,0,t1_d46l1ia,Let them grow! Unless these are near the bottom of the bine this is where your cones will be. ,TheHopyard,d46o7yq,2,t5_38d21
8286106,0,t1_d5da03r,Began brewing in about  and hop growing a year later when I found some wild ones growing by the roadside.  Male plants will pollinate the nearby girls and the resulting hops will have some seeds.  The British have been growing seeded hops for a long time and continue to do so   The use of seeded hops in brewing was always thought to produce undesirable oils and phenols in the finished beer but some newer research tends to poopoo this claim.  Ive never seen honey bees attracted to hop cones but some years there are influxes of wasps and yellow jackets most likely feeding on aphids.  Hoppy Trails,TheHopyard,d5dblnu,3,t5_38d21
9104165,0,t3_54z51m,Not sure if they are lacking something or what.  I got these late June for like  each at Lowes.  Not expecting any buds this year but wanted to grow the rhizome a bit.  I am planning to put them in the ground next spring  any thoughts on if they are OK or additional measures I need to take?,TheHopyard,d866afb,1,t5_38d21
9330509,0,t1_d8yp6bc,Thanks yeah Ive noticed that no one wants to talk about new genetics.  Its a shame we could really use a more open agricultural system theses days.,TheHopyard,d8ypkpm,1,t5_38d21
