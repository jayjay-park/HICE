1989139,0,t3_2h0795,Old fruity loops voice maker. Should be under legacy. Whats great about it is you can type out what you want it to say. But it sounds exactly like that sample not very flexible and it can be extremely cheesy at times.,synthrecipes,cksw45x,1,t5_2xepz

3074760,0,t1_cogo0ry,Well simplicity is usually the answer. A good way to do it in massive for example Set one oscillator to a pure saw wave increase the number of voices in the voicing panel and then detune the voicesusing the top slider in that panel just a tiny bit. Add effects and some sort of bass for the low end then tweak parameters until the desired sound is achieved.Edit Theres probably a synth underneath it too to add depth.,synthrecipes,cogp3ib,1,t5_2xepz
3276701,0,t1_cp1gnye,I HATE the amount of reverb DSK has on his stuff.  Although I like some of his base sounds the horns mix well in a track it takes time to tweak all the effects OUT.Theres one piano sample of his thats offpitch as well.,synthrecipes,cp1rqm5,1,t5_2xepz
3998361,0,t3_369uyd,I completely agree and Id like to say Im not great by any means but if I hear something on this sub I will give it my best shot. I feel like no ones even trying anymore. This sub ha sooooo much potential!,synthrecipes,crc1my3,4,t5_2xepz
4019997,0,t1_crei4yk,So youre suggesting that instead of branching off with a whole new sub we as a community try to fix this sub itself.Now the issue is you cant fix a sub unless you either press the moderators to make change or the community itself makes an effort to use their votes and content they post to make a difference.Now the first way is out of the question. One mod is very inactive one doesnt seem invested in the sub at all and one is a bot.The second way seems to be out of the question as well given that theres only a few posts a day and most of them seem to be from people not invested in the sub or a community but rather they want help recreating the th sawtooth with a LPF and envelope bass. So it seems the solution is to create a new sub. Active moderation sudden burst of community with promise of a neat resource for producers and the fact that its not meant to be rsynthrecipes . Its meant to have a more theoretical approach to synthesis and it seems that kind of thing is already underway.So no this isnt a rsynthdiy vs rdiysynth these are two subs that both provide their own resources rsynthdesign just happens to provide everything Im good at doing which is making sounds teaching and using mathematical and abstract approaches.I hope this was clear,synthrecipes,creidk2,2,t5_2xepz
4085758,0,t3_37dna0,theres a couple different layers. all the synths have short attack times on the ampfilter envelopes lowpass filter. one sounds like its running through a filtergate. theres a time synchronized send delay in the background. ,synthrecipes,crm02nu,2,t5_2xepz

5611790,0,t1_cwrjiui,Thanks.  The more that you use synthesis and effects the easier it will be for you to quickly subtract out all the effects in your mind to selectively hear whats underneath.  This is the difference between casually listening to something compared to listening critically to focus on what you want to hear by ignoring everything else.  That takes concentration education to know what to listen for and experience.  Fortunately we humans are very good at selective listening when we develop it.  Its frequently used to focus on one specific conversation in a noisy room with lots of other conversations going on for example. ,synthrecipes,cwsp345,1,t5_2xepz
5787036,0,t3_3uegt2,It sounds like a pretty basic retro brass preset. Its basically a single saw osc with a resonant LPF filter with a slow attack envelope and a quick decay to give that ripping sound experiment with timing. Using an analoguemodeled saw osc and filter should give a result closer to the examples you gave. Also make sure you have portamento on. If youre using ableton suite their analogue plugin has a preset called soft horns brass you could mess with. ,synthrecipes,cxefqej,2,t5_2xepz

7077159,0,t3_4ce478,Heres what I got. The arp is just a saw wave! Theres also some other little things that can help. Add a lowpass filter to cut the top frequency content. I used Serums keyboard tracking many synths have this to move the filter up and down depending on the pitch of the note but if your synth doesnt have this you could just move the filter by hand. Add a little resonance to encourage the sound of the filter. Pull the sustain down on the amplitude envelope so each note is a little plucky. Add tube distortion to add some crunch to the lower notes. Saws with distortion usually sound great. Add a compressor to beef up your plucks a little. High pass filter at hz to cut out bass this is just an arp and if youre going to be emulating the song you posted youll want to leave headroom for the  bass. Or you could leave the bass in there and make a cool bass arp thing. shrug  Use an eqs high shelf to reduce the frequency above hz by about dB to soften the top end and leave headroom for high hats. Compress again at the end and you have an okay arp!Hope  that can help you get closer than before!,synthrecipes,d1ik6jn,2,t5_2xepz

11166365,0,t1_dexoi0t,Saw Pad I have made a similar one for a vaportrack a bit ago that sounds just like it.  standard saws  octaves and  octave to give it a harmonic Detune both with  voices of unison I cut the high frequencies a little more aggressively to take most of the bright out Added a chorus tuned to your liking. Added ReverbSaw pads are all pretty similar and you may just have to play with them to get it EXACTLY right. I EQ the high end out to give it a more analog sound and added a slight pitch sway using and LFO. Just get creative and see if you can get it!,synthrecipes,dexp22z,1,t5_2xepz
11166826,0,t1_dewjt43,hmm how would multiple voices be even sensed if theres no detune? being spread across stereo field? or perhaps you mean just a very slight detune not a lot.Thanks though I will try this out!,synthrecipes,dexqxtz,1,t5_2xepz
11400174,0,t3_62mk3q,Write out the notes. Make them legato so that they are touching each other. Then add a bit of attack to the amp env.  Thats the basic synth. Idk about the timbre. ,synthrecipes,dfo71gi,1,t5_2xepz

11494760,0,t3_60z1jz,Heyo! I tried this out a couple weeks ago when you posted it but got stumped. I was super frustrated about not being able to nail it so I messaged them on facebook and they just responded! gt cool im glad ppl are interested. i created a synth using the microkorg and then another one by sampling my voice through a couple different filters. i layered the  and played the chords using my pitch bend wheel where appropriate. finally i side chain compressed the synth riff with my kick drum. hope that helps,synthrecipes,dfyxhw9,2,t5_2xepz
11560825,0,t1_dg6f07h,You certainly should. For cool weird effects try writing a midi part for the patch and then automate the decay of the pitch envelope up and down it makes some crazy sounds.,synthrecipes,dg6f9wg,2,t5_2xepz
