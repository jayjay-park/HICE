6527036,0,t1_czue0tx,Beginners luck indeed holy crap nice haul!I cant speak for the older models but the MMD and LMDs are both solid and will largely look the same picture qualitywise since as you noted they are both  TVL also assuming their internal components are all in good order of course.The x RGBComponent inputs either builtin on the MMD or via the BKM cards on the LMD are real nice to have for a couple reasons but they might not apply to you depending on what consoles youll be using. If you arent using any kind of switch for SCARTComponent then you can still at least hook up  consoles at once and still switch easily between them using the buttons on the front of the monitor. But I really like the x inputs on these medical monitors for the ability to have a SCART switch hooked up to one RGB input and a Component switch hooked up to the other input and have all my consoles very conveniently available for use.Additionally the BKM card also includes output BNC connections allowing you to passthrough the video source which is also nice if you ever want to do some kind of gameplay recording  twitch streaming setup. e.g. on my setup I passthrough both the RGB and Component signals which go first to the PVM and then from the output BNC connectors to my Framemeister and then it finally goes off to a capture card. With the MMD you only have the passthrough on one of the RGBComponent inputs of course.So yeah basically its just an extra convenience.,crtgaming,czug4i5,1,t5_3c23m

9257372,0,t1_d8pb4au,OK yeah I get it.  I used the make breakouts as an opportunity to make a few cables myself.  When I first started dipping my toes into RGB gaming a year and a half ago I chose that time to do a lot of things I hadnt done in a long time...  Soldering wiring following schematics etc  and I actually ended up with usable results     And I wanted to do it as inexpensively as possible.  In the process over the last year and a half I have learned a lot like that theres a huge difference between a crappy soldering iron and a good soldering station.  Ive also learned that some cables are better off made and some cables are better off purchased.  Ive also learned that every situation is a bit different.  My lead question to you would be Are you planning to solve this wiring issue or every connection issue? If the answer is get me through this particular connection type cheaply the answer there is yes go from console directly to BNC which Ill cover.  It might be that the HD Retrovision cables are the best answer if youre wanting to plug your consoles into anything with one cable  these are very expensive but most compatible since they transcode RGB to Component which is usable by the Crosspoint the PVM Scalers and many HDTVs directly.  I chose SCART before these cables were readily available which is probably the second most compatible because you can plug a connector onto the SCART to downconvert to SVideo and Composite and SCART is directly compatible with scalers.  At the time I also didnt know how to make cables well at all and I was watching a lot of videos about RGB hookups from Europe so retroconsoleaccessories on eBay was a godsend  great cables I didnt have to source parts and I was up and running in a week!  And given that the cables are all hand made  to be frank theyre VERY reasonably priced.Another really good reason that people go to SCART before going into a Crosspoint is to have physical space in the connector for a sync cleaner.  Both the SCART connector itself and a breakout would have enough room so either place is a good place for a sync stripper.  A sync stripper is a LM chip a resistor and  capacitors link to pinout in prior post.  It can be pretty small but it still comes out to about the size of your pinkys first knuckle  small but big enough that finding a place for it is a bit of a pain.  The Crosspoint expects clean sync coming into the device so every input needs clean sync.  Your PVM itself probably doesnt care.  Mine doesnt.  Many scalers perform better with cleaned sync less noise.Another great RGB cable type you could consider if youre OK with breakouts is DSUB  VGA connectors.  First off VGA to BNC breakout is . for a premade cable Monoprice.  The parts are VERY common and inexpensive.  Managing the Sync Cleaner could be done in a gender changer assemblybox.  The cables would be neat and compact.  You could use a premade device for sync stripping like the Sync Strike expensive as it uses DSUB .  Etc.  So thats an option to consider as well.  Its probably not the most compatible but for example my projector allows RGBs over DSUB  so its not the most unheard of connection type.So lets just say youre wanting to go from each console to the Crosspoint youre not worried about other stuff.  Good enough.The basic operation I think youd go through is this  buy BNCtoBNC cables.  Cut them in half.  Solder the loose ends to the signal wires for RGB and ground on the console connector.  The sync wire would be Console connector video power ground to sync stripper to  BNC out ground and signal.The first thing youll want is a good diagram of the pinouts of each console and the connector type from each console to RGB.  Heres that diagram.  Its going into SCART here but that doesnt matter the lines youre interested in are RGB S and Ground and voltage for the sync stripper.     Youll notice that in this diagram there are resistors and capacitors going into the SCART connector.  I dont know if thats needed in your case  that might be to be compatible with devices that natively accept SCART.Youll need to source connectors for each console.  This can be difficult I have not found a great source for PlayStation or Nintendo connectors.  Another example Genesis  uses a  U DIN not a C type DIN like the Neo Geo be sure you know what youre after.  pin Mini Din and some of the other standard connectors are pretty easy to find at either Frys or online.  If at all possible ensure you get connectors that have solder cups on the solder side or holes.  My minidin pins are straight pins and theyre very small and hard to work with middle of the connector is frustrating!.For the sync stripper in this instance I dont know where exactly youd put it but you could mount it to a board and use some shrink tube to have it in line with the rest of the cable  itd probably look like a small wart by the console connector end when youre done or if you go the DSUB  route itd be in a little box which would look OK and in SCART itd be right in the header but I digress.  Be sure to run the voltage line from the console into the chip easy to forget that it needs power!While soldering the connectors to the wires be sure to pretin both your wires and your connector pins.  Have good light and something to secure the connector while you work like this   or this   I recently got a Hakko FXD as my soldering station after using a cheap  soldering iron from Radio Shack for  years.  Its an utterly incredible difference.  I use a  leadtin solder which has flux but I also have a big ole vat of flux on the side that I can brush on where I need to.So  Console Connector  sync stripper  signal wires  BNC ends.  Let me know your thoughts.  Every American that goes to RGB goes through this mental exercise.  Its hard to make decisions that have investments of time or money or both...  especially when the investments are not into games themselves...For what its worth I expect that a Genesis  connector to BNC for your purposes would be  connector   BNC cable   sync stripper  resistors  caps.  .  Maybe a bit more because you have to usually buy several caps and resistors  but youd use that pack of stuff for several sync strippers.,crtgaming,d8pfstt,2,t5_3c23m

9717085,0,t3_5ea5fe,I had the exact same problem when I bought my pvmm early this year. Just moving these sets around can cause slight magnetisation of the front grille. Either the internal degaussing coil has gone or its too low powered to take care of it.What you need is an external degaussing coil or degaussing wand. They sometimes come up on eBay but are often expensive so what I did was buy a cheap degaussing wand from AliExpress looks like a long green block. It worked fine and took care of all my purity issues. Look on YouTube for how to use them.Another option that may work if you have another crt lying around with a good internal coil like an old tv or Pc monitor is to place it right next to your pvm and switch it on. The internal coil will degauss the other screen too. I had a  JVC monitor that had a strong coil and spent half an hour moving it around the pvm switching it on and off. It got rid of most of the issues but over time it slowly started to creep back in one corner. Using the wand over the whole screen and metal casing solved it all for good and the picture is nearly flawless now. ,crtgaming,daaub3b,5,t5_3c23m

11120497,0,t1_derjc5j,reply from sellerHi We would be looking at that price per unit given the price they go for refurbished and in our professional opinion two of the units are good maybe needing a little TLC with dry joints etc the third unit also is giving a picture but does have a slightly noisy line output transformer.thanks for your input guysif i did go see them what should i be looking for to make sure they are in good working order. Im a techie and know a bit but im no expert.  is  each an okay price for one in decent condition?,crtgaming,deshzot,1,t5_3c23m

11393526,0,t3_62ig5q,This was pretty much my experience only I called about  TV stations and around  production companies. Ended up with a MU and x BVM EU.Most of these places are going to say you should have called a few years ago. Then you will be depressed.,crtgaming,dfnfuqs,2,t5_3c23m
11413548,0,t3_62wyca,The instructions say it doesnt convert resolution it basically just amplifies the signal and will combine the Horizontal and Vertical sync coming out of the VGA into a composite sync needed for TVs. The main problem though with VGA output is that computers run at progressive resolutions kHz while TVs need interlaced at kHz. CRTemudriver can help your computer output the correct resolutions if you have a compatible video card. See my Groovycube guide for more details. Anyway all that said this box might be useful since if you go down the CRTemudriver route you still need to combine your Horizontal and Vertical syncs into csync.,crtgaming,dfppqk4,4,t5_3c23m

11623734,0,t1_dgdh648,Ive done my share of cap kits but Ive put off doing my EZ for a while because every video Ive seen on it has you pulling the monitor and disassembling half the frame. Did you have to do that when you did your EZ or is there a way to do it without having to pull the whole damn tube and frame out of the cab?,crtgaming,dgdk8cu,3,t5_3c23m

11805310,0,t1_dgxwajk,The secret is to be as honest as possible and kiss a little ass while you do it. Be as polite as possible and sort of play innocent. I told them how much they go for and I said that they are priced way too high for an obsolete piece of tech. I told them thats why I decided to get savvy and look locally. You have to mold them in your favor. If you come off as some grumpy old man looking to make a quick buck by swindling a poor station you may not get as far. The good news is that I communicated by email  of the time so if youre bad at talking type like youve never typed before! Go for TV broadcasting stations. Go for your local stations that have local news or TV. They have websites and contact info on those websites usually.Here is the last paragraph from my email.   In the retro video game hobby there is a certain way to get the best picture from your old games with a certain type of monitor. Those monitors being old RGB PVM monitors used in broadcasting! These monitors where used before the switch to HD and from my knowledge are all but obsolete in the broadcasting industry. I wanted to ask if the studio has any of these old monitors left lying around and if so can I have one? It seems like such a random question but hobbyists are always looking for these and I figured why not just ask my favorite local news station? Whoever ends up reading this please let me know if you could help me out or point me in the direction of a staff member who can.As you can see I... educated them on the hobby. I told them why I wanted them. I only asked for ONE dont be greedy. I also kissed a little ass. ,crtgaming,dgy686t,6,t5_3c23m
11805668,0,t1_dgt0zxk,its a monitor only right?    philly is no where near pitts.  Might want to update.. got me all excited.,crtgaming,dgy7or9,1,t5_3c23m
