Although we have yet to see the whole thing play out it s clear that despite Andy stating it was gross he is capitalizing on it in every way possible. As for Kenya IMO she as real issues she has no intention to correct and is capitalizing on them too. I find it painful to watch her mental breakdowns whether they are staged or not.

That could not have been a worse time it seemed the sole purpose was to embarrass Shannon. Ive been team Heather this whole time in the whole Shannon v. Heather thing but holy shit that was a low blow Heather. Shannon just made the effort to say how glad she was that she had been invited on the trip and that their friendship was on the right track. Its like Heather decided Shannon just couldnt get too comfortable. If the problem is that your husband is upset with her husband... then bring it up when your husbands are around! I was seriously infuriated by that and thought Shannon handled it extremely well. I probably wouldve responded with Why are you bringing this up now in front of everyone when my husband isnt even here? It was just beyond bitchy. Really lowered my opinion of Heather. Edit Not to mention its a stupid thing to even be upset about anyway. She was mounting a bull everyone was drinking he made a slightly offcolor joke. How many inappropriate jokes has Terry made?! How inappropriate is it to play MarryKillFuck about your friends?! You play that game about celebrities not actual people in the room.

But it would take time because they would have to seek out cast that doesnt think theyre being on a show for the HW franchise. When they originally cast and filmed RHONY the crew thought they were doing a show about raising families in an elite New York system or something to that effect. If you remember Alex was trying to get her son into an elite prek and Jill was the friendly connector that wanted to help. And sadly for Alex her thinking that she was filming about elite NY made her look like a social climber because thats what she talked about most in her interviews. They could also gear it more towards a docu type show if they focus more on telling the ladies personal stories and not setup scenes where theyre filming with other HWs all of the time. ,BravoRealHousewives,clls3z3,3,t5_2v6dk

Theres no sense in alienating an entire fan base that supported you for years. If I were a Rangers fan or even a big JH fan while he was a Ranger that would upset me as well. Hell hath no fury like a fan scorned. I thought you maybe meant hes awful because he keeps relapsing. I dont know what his issue is or why he cant stop even with the best help in the world. The problem is these issues are part of addiction on a fundamental level. I would think addicts people in recovery and those who love addicts could relate to this saga. As far as him being unprofessional and disrespectful to the MLB the Rangers etc. I would tend to agree. I really have rooted for him all these years.

3715807,0,t1_cqfdloq,If you read my comment I said not having a spouse wasnt an excuse but its a huge help when you have kids bills stress Are lonely. And yeah she has kyle on which she has a very messed up relationship with and kathy thats it she cant lean on her kids that isnt fair. And no she doesnt have friends thats why she aligned with brandi and said shes her best friend because she has nobody. Look at her online accounts she never hangs with anyone look at kyles its a huge difference. Yes she has resources a lot dont but you can go to the best rehab in the world but if you dont have a system for when you leave it will go back to the same old same old. I was in foster care and cams across many young addicts and old ones emotionally disturbed and so on. The most important thing was what they would have when out. Some went from say a group home with a hugely supportive environment back to the same shitty family so it failed or they did shit to get back in the system to find that support again. If youve read up on their family its messed up including kathy. My sons father is an addict and he hasnt been involved for years but I know his family and friends are one of the biggest reasons he will never get sober because its an unhealthy environment. Kyle isnt a bad person but that doesnt mean shes great for kims sobriety either a lot of people seem to not get this. Sometimes the ones who we love and love us most are harmful in some situations and I think those two need to separated for a while for kim to getstay sober. They run too hot and too cold. I love my twin to death but there was a period we had to pull apart as well. Sometimes as I say emotions are just too big and too hot. And the thing that seems really messed up with these two is whenever they see the other getting really close to an outsider they lose their shit. Kyle can say its cause brandi is a drunk asshole but I think it could be a great person and she would still be unhappy with it its a weird sibling thing just like how kim feels yet again pump is coming between them.When it comes down to it kim needs a support system outside of her family because even kyle admits shed rather sweep shit under the rug and for kim to stay sober she cant do that. Kim needs a friend like that jenn chic brandi has thats struggled and knows what to do and build from there.if youve ever tried to help an addict get clean you will get what im saying,BravoRealHousewives,cqfttun,4,t5_2v6dk

5450197,0,t3_3pp76v,I love this show! It is my favorite on Bravo right now. Captain Lee is so professional I cant wait to see him put Leon in his place. You know hes serious and not just being dramatic. Leons attitude laziness and lack of creativity tanked him and his antifemale attitude is the karma on the cake to send his butt back to whatever cruise ship or failed restaurant he came from. I hate the way he smirks at Kate and talks about yelling at women in his kitchens in the past. Rocky is a fool for thinking being Team Leon is  the right move. She and Emile are both so immature and I hope they learn a lesson or two from Leons mistakes. Connie is the perfect mix of work ethic and fun and I think Kat Connie Kate and Amy would make the perfect female portion of the crew. Bring back Ben Eddie and Captain Lee.

In a small percentage of cases these symptoms can last for more than  months. Although sometimes called chronic Lyme disease this condition is properly known as Posttreatment Lyme Disease Syndrome PTLDS.gtThe good news is that patients with PTLDS almost always get better with time the bad news is that it can take months to feel completely well. ,BravoRealHousewives,cxm2cbn,5,t5_2v6dk

5959979,0,t1_cy0oh7e,I went and upvoted that comment for you so that should bring it back to one. Yep Kyle exposed Kims alcoholism in a place where she had nowhere left to hide. It was rough but Kim needed it. As a recovering addict myself being outed helped me and being enabled lead to the needle. So I actually sit and watch and get angry at Kim a hell of a lot more than I ever have at Kyle. Then again Kim has probably been enabled to fuck her shit up for years so I know it is hard to crawl back from it. But god dammit you have to face your shit if you want to get better. This goes for every last one of them. Its not even that shameful once you finally start living an honest life its a relief. I believed Kim  when she said she loved her sobriety I know those feels.  I also know how utterly manipulative and I mean that addicts can be and those warning bells were ringing hard watching so many scenes between Kyle and Kim. I honestly and truly do. not. understand. the. Kyle. hate. She canhas been a bit whiney at times yes but that doesnt seem to fit the crucifixion she gets around here sometimes. But hey thats just my c.,BravoRealHousewives,cy0vtwd,4,t5_2v6dk

6534057,0,t3_452q9d,Okay so I have a few things to say about this episode. Queen Eileen I love you! I know people think she is boring but I love how carefree trustworthy and silly she is! Plus she is absolutely stunning. I think she has the most natural and gorgeous look out of everyone on the show. Back off of her for her shoes and handbags hell I know we all appreciate the glitz but I also appreciate some functionality and her willingness to admit she isnt concerned about having pricey accessories. You do you girl.. Something about Kathryn really bugs me and I cant figure it out yet. I mean there are glimpses here and there e.g. how snobby she is about her wealth which is prolly largely due to her husbands career though I am sure she made some decent bank on modelling but that kind of money doesnt really last unless you are a supermodel or getting steady work for a loonnnng time the fact that she is all talk and no game her confrontations w Faye but there is just something inherent about her that I can not get on board with. Her hubby is adorable though.. I was totally team Erika from the start but I feel like we saw a really ugly side of her yesterday. Like these women drove to the bay area to support you and see you perform something her good friend Yo was too sick to do and she was so aggressive re the necklace and the after party. Like I get not wanting to deal with confrontation after a performance but the way she handled it was just on a whole other level. She could have just been like hey Im feeling really great right now I just wanna relax and have a good time. Can we talk about this when we get back to BH? But instead she like went into a hulk rage and was really venomous. It made me really upset to see her turn into this person that I cannot jibe with at all.. Fucking Yolanda. She also shows a really disgusting side of herself. She was so nasty and calculating at that lunch and just handing out her childrens medical documents willy nilly was really disgusting and manipulative. I am not a Lisa or Kyle fan necessarily but I thought they handled the situation really well. Yolanda is in attack mode but she doesnt have the grace or subtlety to do it wo coming off as really abrasive and delusional. She is taking peoples claims and blowing them up  and altering them to fit her agenda and she just looks downright crazy.. Also really Yolanda you felt too sick to take a drive to another city IN YOUR STATE to see your friend perform yet we have seen you go out of the country and state at least twice this season? This was proof that she uses her illness when it is convenient for her. I bet if you asked her why she has never seen Erika perform she would blame her Lyme brain yet we have seen her go to many events go out of the country many times and even engage in physical activities. Does she not know she is on camera and her actions contradict her words? She is clearly using Erika as a pawn and for some reason Erika is willingly going along with it.. The women stumbling around drunk at the end made me laugh so hard. I mean as someone who has been a service worker I feel bad for the employees that had to clean up that mess and it kind of pissed me off they just left it there but it was nice to see Lisa Rinna and Kyle acting like total goons after such a dramatic scene. And Rinna like pushing multiple elevator buttons not sure where her room wasso silly. They were drunk as skunks which you would have to be to handle that after party sheesh.Edit I can word,BravoRealHousewives,czv69ig,16,t5_2v6dk

Yes Ariana has supposedly been doing comedy for a while last week on WWHL Aidy Bryant from SNL was on and said shed known Ariana for a while through a mutual comedy friend so theres some truth to her claim but Kristens friend is also a legit comedian. She had no idea how much Kristen prepared for the show or how the show even went and for her to say Is she trying to be me is rigoddamndiculous when we havent seen Ariana do comedy ever on the show. Its not like Ariana is known for doing comedy either. Also lolololol about Lalas analysis of The Fountainhead. Yes its about architecture. Thats all its about just a book about architecture.

When she teamed up with Brandy and Kyle to take down LVP over some perceived offense that theyre all guilty of regularly doing anyway my opinion of her changed completely.  Im sick of her and to echo other posters sentiments I simply dont care. She accuses LVP of using others to do her dirty work but she does exactly the same thing via  Erika and Brandy and even Kyle at times. Having said that I do believe she was ill with something mentally or physically  we do not know. Depression does manifest physically as well and she may be expecting menopause as well both of which would compound most ailments.  The fact that she seems to have had a miraculous recovery almost as soon as she had her implants taken out or when everyone started questioning her sanity makes me raise an eyebrow. Now she can walk!

6716421,0,t3_47m2wy,Im going to address the differences between how Brandi and LVP addressed Eileens marriage. Brandi called Eileens marriage homewrecking. LVP called it an affair. Personally I feel that homewrecking has a more negative connotation whereas an affair is just a clinical word for what it is. Although neither Brandi nor LVP ever really apologized I think Brandi did so maliciously because she believes that Eileen is a homewrecker. LVP never apologized because shes incapable of it. Thats just who LVP is end of story. She doesnt know how to say shes sorry or admit wrongdoing. For whatever reason I think its worse when someone like Brandi doesnt apologize because I know she can do it whereas I know LVP cant. LVP trying to interpret someones anger is like a dog trying to figure out what a human wants when its yelling at it. She doesnt get it. Something fundamentally doesnt click.

6924708,0,t3_4ajp95,I think the difference here is the reason she left NYC.  If she had a profession or job that required relocation to make a better living for herself and ultimately her child I think that would be understandable.  It seems that she moved to LA to become a cocktail waitresssinger but ended up a cocktail waitress with rich husband.  Thats not cool at all.   She could have pursued her career in singing while staying NYC and being close to her child.I would think the same thing about a father who moved across the country from his child for no apparent reason.

By going to those two different women and saying that LVP was trying to pit Rinna and Kyle against each other should it come public that they were involved in the conversation surrounding Yo and Munchausen. It would have taken the heat off of LVP and placed it on those two. Kyle realized immedietly and told her to stop with it and she did. Fast forward to now Rinna went to dinner w Kyle and told her what LVP said. Kyle replied Yeah I know because LVP told her the same thing all the way back when the original convo happened.

She seems to be having fun Avery needs to drop the resting bitch face though.Ive also been watching the beginning again Im on season  Bethenny v Kelly ep and I gotta say I miss the JillBethenny dynamic. They really were awesome together at first.  Im not looking forward to reliving Heather again theres another one that was too much for the cameras. What an annoying person.

7221984,0,t1_d1z1ay7,Not necessarily...all  admit to making fun of LemonLymes instagram account... Although from observing LVPs behavior over the years I suspect her inolvement consisted of laughing while going tsk tsk and making noncommittal remarks especially around this subject considering her friendship with Mo....LisaLips brings up the munchi rumor off camera either in person or via texts.. Kyle and her laugh about it and LVP was probably in the txts too or there again probably laughing too but tsk tsking like she usuallys does. LisaLips then brings it up on camera which shocks both of them so they pretend its first time they heard of it dont want the fans to know they have been laughing about her all summer. Outside of camera LVP makes her comment and if the above is true... either comment actually makes sense OMG I thought you were going to bring Kykle into it because Kyle was the one actually making fun of LemonLyme too...or OMG why didnt you bring Kyle into it? because screw it if LisaLips was going to go ahead and put this in front of the cameras why not admit Kyle was in it too since she was making fun of her along with LisaLips.Regardless of which comment was said it really is such a stupid nonissue more so now that we know Kyle doesnt give a crap even if LVP was throwing her under bus and it ruined the whole season for me and made me really dislike LisaLips when it showed how easily manipulated she was by Elieen. Look the fans all know LVP is manipulative and for many of us its WHY we love her because of HOW she does it... So no idea why LisaLips even decided to die on this cross... If she had spent the season instead exposing just what a fake LemonLyme was.. it would have been much more entertaining because LemonLyme is such a bad liar it is that more entertaining watching her exposed lol,BravoRealHousewives,d1z32cq,11,t5_2v6dk

While knocking back a dram of bourbon is a decidedly carefree exercise making it is exceedingly technical and requires that the whiskey meet a rigid set of criteria. The Federal Standards of Identity for Bourbon stipulate what is and what isnt bourbon. For a whiskey to call itself bourbon its mash the mixture of grains from which the product is distilled must contain at least  corn. The rest of the mash is usually filled out with malted barley and either rye or wheat. The mash must be distilled at  proof or less put into the barrel at  proof or less and it must not contain any additives. The distillate must be aged in a new charred oak barrel. Most often these barrels are white oak but they can be any variety of oak.,BravoRealHousewives,d30k6s2,5,t5_2v6dk

We got this version of Kyle which has persisted to the most recent season where she was really afraid to say what she wanted to say in fear of the audience. I think the audience retaliation for game night permanently changed how Kyle navigated the show. Taylor amp Kim who you could always count on for drama really pulled back their antics which they rightfully should haveit just didnt make good tv.

7664101,0,t1_d3dcczg,Youre making a false comparison. Desperate Housewives iswas a scripted drama. Real Housewives is a reality TV show. Totally different things. Was the Real Housewives name inspired by Desperate Housewives? You bet. But they were never the same thing and nobody was confusing those properties in the marketplace.The various wife reality shows are a better comparison. Should Bravo be threatening to sue VH over Basketball Wives Mob Wives etc.? Im sure they would if they could but they cant. That concept is much too vague to trademark. Cameras follow a bunch of women living exaggerated versions of their lives. Not much you can do there. Now if VH tried to put out a show called True Housewives of Manhattan you can bet your ass Bravo would sue and they would win. Because thats a BRAND and VH would be deliberately causing confusion in the marketplace.So again I will make this point its not about ripping off the concept. Its about the BRAND. As Bethenny herself has said many of the other housewives have their own liquor lines. If Sonja wanted to do a prosecco and called it I dont know DRUNK SLUTS I dont think Bethenny would have given a fuck. But she did a prosecco and called it Tipsy Girl. Its the BRAND that is the issue here. Its a cheater brand plain and simple and it is intended to cause confusion with consumers vendors and viewers. It is intended to ride on the coattails of the very successful similar brand that is already in existence. Sonja and her partners who I frankly think are the people who pushed for that name to begin with because they are shady af had to know that name would cause confusion. In fact I believe they counted on it. Hence the story in Page Six the next morning. This was all planned. And lastly because Im tired of this argument the overarching issue here is that it was a personal betrayal. If some rando Bethenny had never met tried to pull something like this shed be pissed she would look into legal actions that would be the end of it. But it was a friendcoworker who did this to her. And that is why its a real problem for her. To go back to your point if one of Andy Cohens besties or colleagues hopped over to another network and tried to do a ripoff of one of his shows he absolutely would have every right to be pissed off and potentially look into legal recourse.Its not about competition. Its not about being insecure. Its about protecting your business and brand from lazy uncreative people trying to make a buck off your hard work. If Bethenny DIDNT fight this thing so hard it would only encourage other scavenger brands. She is doing exactly what she should be doing as a savvy businessperson.Edited to fix a few typos.,BravoRealHousewives,d3dd4yu,5,t5_2v6dk

Contextually I can imagine during heated arguments him using those things against her and also those accusations hurting her. In other words Bethenny forever complaining about how awful and acerbic her mother was and then in turn during an episode of being awful and acerbic to Jason he psychoanalyzes her as being as bad or worse than her mother all this is hypothetical and Bethenny taking great offense.

Everyone was miked up everyone knew any interaction between the two would be filmed and most likely shown on TV. The thing is you can say no to the production company. You can refuse! Kyle as much as I like her in the onscreen ensemble sets these things up. She asks questions and the one with the response is then under attack e.g. the whole thing about Adrienne and her children.

I try and distance myself from those traits but it can be tough. Sometimes I slip up Im only human. I think Brianas problem is the extent of her mums actions doesnt hit her properly probably because Vickis on TV and a Housewife celebrity. If any person who isnt on TV acted the way Vicki does her children would probably be no contact or very limited contact. She is a narcissist and I feel for Briana.

8725415,0,t3_4zjijw,I still have a suspicion that the friend who sent Bethenny the Tom photos was in fact a producer on the show and she was more or less told that she had to tell LuAnn on air. Do I have proof of this? I do not. But my gut the whole time has been that the producers invisible hand was present over this situation in one way or another.As for Lu she is in no position to make demands of the camera crew editors or producers. Correct me if Im wrong but I believe she and Sonja were payforplay contractors this season  they only got paid for episodes in which they appeared. If Lu wants a paycheck  and Lu WANTS A PAYCHECK  she had to give them what they wanted. And what they wanted was that truth bomb caught on camera every second of it. Pulling it back a little bit more given how important to the arc of this season the LuTom relationship was I dont think it would have been kosher for Lu to demand on privacy on this. Its unfortunate for her but she made this romance a very big part of her storyline this season. If shes shooting a reality show it SHOULD have been dealt with on camera.And as I said in another thread in the long run I bet Lu is thrilled with this situation. It has only heightened interest in their upcoming wedding which she is actively whoring out any way she can.,BravoRealHousewives,d6wbhp0,35,t5_2v6dk

8910820,0,t3_52bip9,Im tired of Yolanda so Ill give you bullet points Season  Yolanda shows up in white pants is married to David Foster. She has a fabulous house in Malibu complete with lemon orchard. No mention of Lyme disease. She calls herself the Dutch Martha Stewart and tries to get other housewives to do the Master Cleanse like its a new thing. Season  Episode  Yolanda first mentions her Lyme disease. She talks about losing brain function. She has a port installed that delivers antibiotics to her heart though she mentions a few sentence before that the Lyme affected her brain. She gets her port removed in this episode and talks about how shes in recovery. The rest of the season she is active travels to Paris with the ladies and has a few events at her Malibu home. Season  Episode  Yolanda is with Kyle on a yacht in Europe when she learns that her second oldest Bella has gotten a DUI. Later in the season Yolanda hosts a dinner party at her home travels with the other women to Puerto Rico and also organizes a scavenger hunt for the women in Beverly Hills where she runs from place to place. Season  reunion Yolanda mentions her Lyme relapse. Season  Yolanda is suddenly in the midst of a Lyme disease struggle and starts making statements like Ive been in bed for four years despite literally running around Beverly Hills a few months before and I havent been able to read or write despite writing a letter to Bella after her DUI writing a speech for a Lyme event etc.she doesnt seem to realize that absolute statements like those cause people to question her credibility. Lisa Rinna mentions that Yolanda could have Munchausens syndrome. LVP somehow ends up taking the brunt of the blame in this season. Yolanda plays the victim and is so hurt that her friends dont believe her even though shes made statements they know to be false. She also suddenly claims that her two younger children Bella and Anwar have Lyme disease. Its the first time any of the women have heard this and the childrens father Mohammed Hadid says its not true which is a cause of strife between Yolanda and LVP who is close friends with Mohammed. Yolanda has surgery to remove old breast implants due to silicone leakage this season as well.What do I think of Yolanda? I think she was misdiagnosed with Lyme and was actually suffering from silicone poisoning I think she also liked the attention being sick brought her so she dialed it up for sympathy. I think shell get better and better now that her leaking implants have been removed.I dont believe Bella or Anwar have Lyme disease either.,BravoRealHousewives,d7iy88f,1,t5_2v6dk

Being productive as you say. As annoying as she and her mother are in general. I dont like her either but you have no idea what someone can and cant do while they have a newborn so assuming shes going to be writing her dissertation or running for senate or something during this time is kind of off.

9226004,0,t1_d8l9jdn,Ok Im simply responding to your engagement of my post. My original post is regarding how I view Ashlees temperament on social media and therefore the time spent on it the negative energy. Yes I dont have children of my own but I can look how at how others around me in my life at my age handle parenthood. I actually have quite a few friends writing their dissertations with newborns in fact! I have significant respect for women who fight hard for and manage a balance of work and home life. I hope to be able to do the same when I am financially and emotionally ready to have children. I dont quite understand why you feel the need to be contentious or rather feel the need to tell me Im wrong. In no way am I engaging that your opinions are baseless or unfounded because in fact I welcome differing viewpoints of others. So since you clearly view me as someone who has no idea why dont we respectfully agree to disagree? This is after all a subreddit about reality TV. ,BravoRealHousewives,d8lgpho,2,t5_2v6dk

Graziano who has a history of substance abuse traveled to Florida for her recovery though the name of the facility was not immediately revealed.She is getting treatment that stems from her depression and some things that she has to work out Jennifer Graziano the creator and executive producer of Mob Wives confirmed to Radar Online Thursday. I cant get into detail.Renee  might stay at the rehabilitation center for a month. Im hoping she stays as long as she needs said Jennifer who is also Renees younger sister. Shes been battling depression for a while and this kind of treatment kind of digs a little deeper than what shes done in the past.Jennifer didnt say if drugs played a part in Renees decision to get help. Its a personal thing the Mob Wives creator said. But basically she is getting treated for depression and shes trying to work it out.Its unclear when Renee entered rehab but it might have been two weeks ago because thats the last time she posted on social media.

Im getting on the scales this morning to check my progress and my husband comes running up behind me to see how much I weigh. WITH? Ive shared my weight loss with him but I havent told him how much I weigh. He keeps telling me that he loves me and Im beautiful and blah blah blah. But Im just sensitive about this. Ive always been thin until now. But I feel bad about myself and he knows this. I know hw wasnt trying to do anything bad but I just feel like he intruded there. Also hes stick thin.

10036602,0,t1_dbfog6r,I totally see your point in a lot of this and of course we all watch the show in different ways. I can see Schenna being cast as the underdog because of Lisa and producer interference however I really just dont dig her natural personality. Shes not as bad of a person as the rest of the cast but thats a reeeeeeally low standard were hold her to. I think the first couple seasons scheanna comes off pretty sympathetically and we were rooting for her on some level. However her backstory is just too strong. She was the link between VPR and RHOBH being that she had a two year affair with Brandis husband while Brandi was pregnant. No matter what Schenna tries we the audience dont forget that at least not for long. The cast reminds us of it and when they stop WE remind the cast because they act like total hypocrites in similar situations Lala anyone?. We might have felt bad for her because the mean girls didnt want to hang out but it was never at least in my eyes something which I was truly empathetic about. It reflected more towards my anger towards Stassi and her group more than my genuine heartfelt sympathy towards Schenna.I feel Scheana has come off really poorly the longer the series has progressed. She cant keep friends arianna is kind of sick of her S and the Tom texts shes duplicitous vain selfish desperate tacky attentionseeking and the way she dealt with Shay literally disgusted me. Shes not a sympathetic character shes not charming or witty her personality is flat shes entering uncanny valley territory with her plastic surgeries and its so obvious that fame has gotten to her head.I think the series was always a test on whether Scheanna had truly changed or if shed go for another married guy in search of money and infamy once the opportunity hits. Single Scheanna would be too depressing if that happens. And with the way she acted in the most recent seasons I dont know if shes changed. ,BravoRealHousewives,dbfsnlf,3,t5_2v6dk

Im sure the Sacramento SPCA is ecstatic about their alumni  and his fame.Also for some people who say that LVP ignores the dogs she has at home and favors her accessory dogs like Giggy and Harrison I really think some dogs are just more suited for being out in public and hanging around people all the time. Pink dog is adorable Pikachu is adorable but they look pretty hyper and active whenever theyre on camera. They probably wouldnt do well being stuffed in a purse some dogs just arent cool with that while others are.I have small dogs and one dog that does really well in public. hes super mellow and friendly so when we go out I tend to bring him with me and leave my other one at home because that one has a ton of anxiety in new places. My mom was teasing me and saying I prefer one dog over the other since Im always leaving one at home but that couldnt be further from the truth. One just has a more chill extroverted personality while the other is a biter.,BravoRealHousewives,dbghkph,27,t5_2v6dk

For me their relationship is complicated because they are very similar and maybe jealous of each other?

I feel like if you start a show midway through the series you wont have the background knowledge to understand the friendships and fights. For Atlanta I feel like the show has had two different runs. Seasons  are very different from . I think the show was lighter and more fun in the earlier seasons but way more tacky. If you want to get caught up with the most recent season start with season  where Porsha and Kenya come on and youll be able to understand  of the things that have happened. After that go back and watch seasons  to see where the show came from. The dynamic of Kim Z Nene and Sheree are hysterical and the early drama w Pheadra and Cynthia is pretty messy.

Everyone has a different take on it but I guess that I would agree that Katies behavior is not always nice but I feel its a stretch to state that it is abusive. I had forgotten some of the specifics so it was good to read the examples and remember her actual words haha. Lots of storylines and dramas in those words.I actually think some of Toms behavior is passive aggressive towards Katie. He makes it seem like hes not really that into her and not into marrying her. That would drive any woman crazy. Her words are not always nice but in my opinion some of his behavior is not nice.

As we met her family it definitely shed more light on who she is but it also caused me to like her less.

Im just not assuming anything about what is in their contract assuming they have one or what they agreed to. Among many head scratching Housewives business decisions I distinctly recall Kandi letting Kim Z walk away with all the money from Dont Be Tardy so its not like these people on these shows are known to do business with one another like normal professionals. When Phaedra amp Todd began working on this they were all friends. I am simply not claiming to know something I dont know. Again IMO he is wrong about making it a story line for the show. Phaedra owed him money. She was wrong. He deserved to get paid. My apologies if my previous posts did not make that clear enough.,BravoRealHousewives,df44oil,1,t5_2v6dk

There were so many mean maleficent looks  even when no one was talking to Dorit Rinnar sat there shooting daggers and nodding pointing and smirking.
