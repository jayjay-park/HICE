5718301,0,t3_3msum1,I usually use Crunchyroll but in the moments when I absolutely NEED a new episode the MINUTE it comes out Fairy Tail comes to mind regardless of the picture quality I go to animefreak. Id use Netflix if they had a wider selection but they do have some great animes and also recently added Durarara! so I usually recommend Netflix to my friends who are looking for something new to watch.,girlotakus,cx5wthf,1,t5_39q80
