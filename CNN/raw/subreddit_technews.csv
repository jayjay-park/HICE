Instead the NFL must rely on the same avenues available to entities that wish to protect their distribution rights in the private marketplace.This piece constantly talks about the NFL but I know the MLS will blacklist at times as well and Im fairly sure other leagues do too. It seems to reach this conclusion because they assume that the NFL will not move their broadcasts from the major networks... gtFrom free overtheair broadcast television to satellite and cable pay TV as a result of the elimination of the sports blackout rules. I know the MLS it is not currently available for free overtheair i.e. anyone with an antenna can watch NFL on CBS FOX NBC etc. and is often on ESPN FOX Soccer or NBCSN or another cable subscription channel.
