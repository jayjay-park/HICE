145566,0,t1_ceuwbgg,The hearts look three dimensional so I would guess that they are homemade decals.  Paint the base color onto a plastic baggie or cling wrap then paint the crackle on top.  Let it dry and then peel the polish off and cut it into those perfect shapes or better yet use a heart shaped hole punch if you have one.  Finally stick the hearts to slightly tacky polished nails and smother in top coat. ,RedditLaqueristas,cev0eq0,9,t5_2se5q

315705,0,t1_cfddrxa,Thank you for posting this reminder Mod! I was disappointed on glowstars behalf that all her comments were getting downvotes from a couple of people that had taken umbrage over her posts. The things I love about this sub are the friendly atmosphere positive comments especially when compared to the rest of reddit where some people can get downright nasty! constructive advicetips and sharing ideascreativity. And long may it last. Keep up the good vibes lacqueristas!! x,RedditLaqueristas,cfdhq07,2,t5_2se5q
320188,0,t1_cfdxodc,No matter what the rules of the sub are there will always be someone whos uncomfortable. It is unfortunate but it is true. This sub strikes me as a fairly warm and welcoming place  If someone avoids posting due to fear of judgment  over the quality of their mani the price of their polish or some other factor it is their choice. By catering to those insecurities I feel like the sub as a whole would be putting the fears of a few ahead of the benefits of the majority.I feel like making product lists would be beneficial to a large number of people within the sub. As someone who comes here for inspiration finding a color I love and being ignored when I ask what it is doesnt always happen but its not uncommon is disheartening. It also makes the OPs who do this seem more showoffy and less interested in helping others and being an active part of the community. Also if all users are required to post their products I highly doubt that everyone posting will only use highend nail polishes which in itself could be enough to encourage the dissolving of stigmas surrounding cheaper products. In theory this could also make other users who work with cheaper polishes realize that there is no reason to be ashamed of the price tags on what they use.Sorry this comment is so longwinded btw. I tried to sum up my thoughts as much as possible. P,RedditLaqueristas,cfdygot,14,t5_2se5q

1232584,0,t1_ci89ogi,No no.The virgin must be pure not of genitals but of nails. Their nails must never have been painted. Nor with a transparent polish nor with a pearly pink shining a light that would only be the beginning the signal if you wish to alert reds and holos and sparkles and dare I say it gels and textures to come lay their seed to the upuntilthen pristine nails of the sacrifice. Pure! Pure I say! No oils have nourished these cuticles no cream has pampered these untouched nails.Why should it matter that no hands have touched the body of the sacrifice when their nails will have be sullied? Why should the Gods content themselves of a sacrifice with stained nails and pushedback cuticles that are only an invitation to slather the wench with polish?Once the virgin is obtained you shall cut their cuticles with sacrificial scissors specially designed for the occasion  slice into the flesh and collect the precious drops of blood directly into your water marbling bowl.Do not anger the Gods. Do not bring damnation upon yourself. Pour directly from the virgins finger to the bowl. Watch the crimson mix with the water and only then with bloodsmeared fingers to bring good fortune you shall mix your polish.Only then will your water marble be successful.

The ridges formed from flooding cans lead to peeling. Also I dont recall the science behind this but I read on here once that moisturizing and oiling your mani helps it not peel off. Like massage in some cuticle oil every day. Hope that helps!,RedditLaqueristas,ciouogi,1,t5_2se5q

Shelves x cm pieces mm thickRails x cm pieces mm thickI worked off a rough idea of what I wanted it to look like and went from there. I bought the timber and had my dad cut it then got to work painting. This took about  days all up after undercoating and then painting everything with enamel for durability. When it was time to put everything together I used my dad to help me make sure everything was square and to hold bits and pieces in place. It would have been a tough job for just me. The best thing about something diy like this is that you can adjust it to fit your own space. I encourage you to sit with your dad and work out what dimensions you want yours to be.

I was an obsessive groomer. And of course the more you groom the worse they are. Id actually seek out any tiny nuance or imperfection and use that an excuse to gnaw away. Then one day I happened upon a sub reddit devoted to nail biting skin picking and trichotillomania sp. I cant remember the name but I did find a link to a book on amazon. How to stop nail biting permanently. Its basically a form of aversion therapy. But the difference being it made me recognise my habits. It made me aware of my patterns and thought processes. The things that lead up to nail biting. In my case running my finger tips over the nails to find bad spots. For my boyfriend it was running his fingers through his hair. Weve both kicked it!

Most salons will push back and then cut your cuticles entirely too much which just leads to badness but it should never be all that painful. Definitely shouldnt be actively bleeding for this long. It would be one thing if she cut something a little short and nicked you but for your cuticles to be bleeding is just bad bad bad.

3847419,0,t3_34gx0w,The Stiletto shape isnt suitable for natural nails because you cant give them the ccurve needed to give the nail its strength.  Acrylics can extend but filing for removal damages the nail Hard gel can extend but filing for removal damages the nailIf a nail is removed by a professional you wont end up with damaged nails. No kind of artificial nail damages your nail unless its applied and removed by someone whos not a pro. There is removable hard gel that can be used for short extensions without damaging the nail?There are soakoff gels but my experience is that they are not suitable for long Stiletto nails. Soft gel can reinforce but not extend the nails without damageGel polish can reinforce the nail but if removed the wrong way it also can damage the nail. Fake tips can be attached with some type of glue or gel somehow without damaging the nail?Tips are attached with glue this also can damage the nail if not removed professionally. Its advisable to not use tips for stilettos but build them with forms.  Fake nails can be attached with some type of glue somehow...?In my opinion as a nail tech fake nails are sold at Walgreens and are nice for a night out. An artificial nail is build on your own nail and is not attached with glue the products sticks on the natural nails. Ive used wraps that are just stickers. They did no damage but also didnt reinforce. Are there other types of wraps that actually reinforce the nail?I havent found them yet.You can have  stilettos but you need to go to a pro nail tech. She knows exactly how to model them to give them the strength they need. Stilettos are very small at the top you dont reach that model by filing but by modelling them into a perfect ccurve at the end. If you just file the nail into that shape you dont have that ccurve but just a very small and vulnerable tip.,RedditLaqueristas,cquu8us,3,t5_2se5q

4152034,0,t1_crtaf17,I started out by reading on some website that they had some cruelty free feathers used for earrings.I deduced that the other feathers must not be obtained in the best conditionsBoy I wish I were wrong. But no of course not.That really seems cruel to me especially while you can just wait for your bird to molt naturally.I have kept every cool feather I ever found in a little bag. Not all of them just the prettiest. I even made a dream catcher out of them.After learning how feathers were live plucked just to make jewelry and fashion accessories I wanted to make a stand ans use them for good. Even if its just me I used molted feathers to do something cool. Apart from my nails I also bought some clear empty Christmas tree ornaments so I could put some feathers in it and hang it on the tree. It looked like this but with grey and red feathers. Really cool.So for the nail art I covered my fingers with a white base coat then used polish. For my thumb and ring finger I used a pretty grey probably Essie  Merino cool. I covered it with a cheap top coat and tne applied the feathers on the tip of my nails very carefully with tweezers.Same for the other fingers except I used some red cant remember which but a light one so I could see the feathers on it.When it was dry enough I used scissors to cut the extra feathers bit and then I covered all nails with Schevite.I waited a bit then used very small scissors dont know the name of the object sorry its for cutting out cuticles? and I filed my nails a little bit to avoid any part of a feather from sticking out.The result was pretty cool.I had thee fingers with grey polish  red feather and two with red polish and green feathers.It looked really really cool.So yeah get yourself some crueltyfree budgie feathers and do some nail art with them! You have way more colors from your birds and the feathers are smaller I think it has great potential!Try it and show us what it looked like! I love collecting the feathers from my little Pixel. You can really use them for a lot of things.Apart from the dream catcher I attached some on earrings just like this They looked great!You can use them for christmas tree ornaments like I said. Also give them to family members. I even tried to carve a pen out of a huge one yeah that was a failure sorry. Ill try again!.Really the skys the limit and thats not a very powerful restraint for a bird.Take some feathers and stick them on hair clips to get budgie extensions! Or earrings! It works really well plus your birds might try to clean your ears and help you sort out that socially unacceptable sticking out feathers.Glue them to a card that you can sent to family members for christmas or any cool occasion!Make a miniwreath out of them. Make Christmas socks and one for your bird with his feathers on it.Go pick some small flowers and put some feathers in your bouquet to add a touch of color!Sew a tiny bag and fill it with duvet and feathers maybe use some essential oil to the bag and place it in the house.Stick them to gift cards!If you have kids or know someone who does give them a bag and help them make some masks like this its really cool and a fun afternoon activity.Make some hait piece  earring set!Make... Uhmmm... a very tiny pillow out of down?Attach them to a necklace ... Pick one or two! Make some budgie nails and most importantly have fun!... Ill be waiting for your next post with feathers in it!

Putting it on a paper first meant that you have to lay down what feels like a lot of polish  the first bit gets soaked up  but I think thats the same either way. Major advantage in my mind is the blending putting it directly on the sponge would prevent a lot of that whereas putting it on paper first lets it sort of slide around and mix as it goes onto the sponge.Just a matter of personal preference I think. ,RedditLaqueristas,cuadbfc,2,t5_2se5q

There really arent any books on how to make polish and I know it would be a good resource. I dont even really consider it as making competition. I know polish making is sort of a tightlipped community but I was talking to my friend about it like... there are a million books about how to make scarves. If a knitter writes a book on how to knit I doubt theyre thinking this might put me out of business...

5467243,0,t3_3pxtx7,My thumbnails used to rip like this all the time its the reason I started wearing polish again a few months ago thinking it might act like armor. Theyve been fine since then but the long nail on my middle finger developed a tear last week. I repaired it with a small square cut from a tea bag and nail glue and it has held up beautifully. There are dozens of videos that show how to do this very simple repair on YouTube. I highly recommend you check them out if you dont already know how to fix it.  some videos recommend you cover the entire nail with the tea bag and glue but I dont think thats necessary.You can Reddit search this sub with why does my nail and see a bunch of threads about this problem. It seems like there isnt one answer that explains why it happens or how to prevent it from happening. Common suggestions are to moisturizeoil your cuticles more avoid filing the sides dont use nail clippers dont use your nails as tools like opening soda cans etc go with rounded nails instead of square use Nail Envy dont use Nail Envy and so on. Sometimes the advice contradicts other advice thats always fun. ,RedditLaqueristas,cwahpsu,3,t5_2se5q

5532501,0,t3_3qvkd4,I feel like Im a broken record with my constant posting about UV gel polish but it seriously is the best thing that ever happened to my nails. My nails are thin and brittle and yes razor sharp and have been for all of my  years and no matter what I tried I could not grow them long. I had acrylics for a few years here and there but would eventually remove them because I hated the upkeep.I dont remember why I decided to try gel but I bought the Gelish starter kit on Amazon about  months ago and have never looked back. My nails dont break off anymore I have not had a single broken nail in those  months and have to file the length down because they get too long my nails dont feel weighed down and weird and I LOVE not having to go have them done not to mention the expense and having control over when I replace them  like if I decide I want to redo them sooner than  weeks as they grow out. I set up at the kitchen table grab my iPad ampamp Netflix soak off the old ones prep my nails and put the new ones on. It takes a couple of hours but I would have spent that time anyway if I had to go somewhere.Recently I found out that you can use regular polish over gel and remove it with nonacetone remover so Ive been doing the gel a little thinner with just a sheernude color. Once the regular polish and regular top coat are on they are incredibly strong and I can change the color when Im bored. The gel selflevels so its really forgiving and if you screw up like getting it up into your cuticle you can just wipe it away with rubbing alcohol and redo it. It stays wet until its cured. This is a big deal for a perfectionist like me. PI do still occasionally get a little split at the nail bed if Ive waited too long and a set starts to lift and Ive been using my hands a lot but I just do the new gel over the split like its not even there and it holds it until it grows out. Thats as close to breaking as they get.Anyway look into UV gel as a replacement for acrylics. Its not any harder than painting your nails. Youd probably need to wait a bit after removing your acrylics because your nails will be really damaged afterward and if the nail bed is too thin the UV curing of the base coat might really hurt but maybe do some Googling on gel and see if it might work for you.  Its been a gamechanger for me.,RedditLaqueristas,cwitq23,5,t5_2se5q

6325501,0,t1_cz8gb5e,Tweezers is a great idea! I dont mind wasting a bit of nail polish as long as theyre not my top  favourite ones haha because I have a lot of bottles and its probably better to use them up then have them dry out. I do use a top coat but I work in a physical job so theres not really any avoiding the massive chipping I experience. I just try to do my nails on a Friday night so I can enjoy them over the weekend and then they are half gone by the next Friday which makes for easier removal. Some polishes dont chip as much as others so Im trying to keep note of that too.I recently purchased some dotting tools but it seems like I have to use massive amounts of patience for it to turn out good but this technique allows for a few mistakes I think without making it actually look messy! ,RedditLaqueristas,cz8n2wl,2,t5_2se5q

7417019,0,t1_d2l55sa,Thanks for the advice! Honestly my nails have always been weird since i was a kid j was always ashamed of them when they were long because of discoloration this was before I even wore nail polish of course so thats why I bit them. I stopped biting them  years ago if not longer but the discoloration persists. So I just cover it up with polish  I do stay hydrated both by drinking tons of water and I oil regularly both with different cuticle oils and additionally virgin jojoba oil and virgin coconut oil. You did say vitamins though and I havent been the best at taking them regularly. I need to do better with that. It could also probably be diet Im not the healthiest I dont eat enough and when I do its mostly processed foods. Thats probably where I really need to start although I dont know how much that will help though because theyve always been like this even when I had  healthy meals a day as a child. So I dunno. But I will start getting regular about my vitamins and hope for the best! ,RedditLaqueristas,d2l9mi4,2,t5_2se5q

7752328,0,t3_4lhif3,The key to smooth gradients is applying thin coats in a dabbing circular motion to blend the colors. It takes time but it pays off. I usually apply a base color in my lightest shade so for your mani I would have used the pink. Then I apply the shades to a makeup sponge and apply several layers allowing them to dry in between or else the polish peels off.

Using betadine or iodine on any cuts and nail injuries and barrier cream during the night helps as well.I wore gloves for a while cause i developed some kind of eczmaceous rash on my palms which was super aggravated by the bar and it made it way more annoying to do stuff i dropped so many glasses.

8736042,0,t1_d6x7y6w,I love the Jamberry wraps because my nails are thin and peel easily so polish styles tend not to stay very long.The best tips Ive picked up on sealing the tips  dont file away the excess right away.  I usually do three nails and then file the excess on the first nail.  This gives the wraps time to cool down and seal properly.  I use the  method to apply  you can either heat the wrap and then apply to your nail especially if youre good at lining them up right off the bat.  I have super curvy nails so I line up the wrap to make sure its centered then apply heat I use the Jamberry heater.  Then press down from cuticle to tip and slightly over the tip . I usually just use a finger to do this. Apply heat again to one side and press from cuticle to tip and towards the edge of your nail  and then do the same to the other side .  For extra sealing power I like to wrap my finger with a ziploc bag and apply more heat.  This gives it kind of an extra boost to really seal it.And again waiting a few minutes for everything to cool before filing and filing at a  degree angle to my nail really seems to help keep the tips from lifting. Hope this helps!,RedditLaqueristas,d6xnizd,4,t5_2se5q

Otherwise if Im just goofing around or want a  or  day mani its Unt peel off base coat for me.For top coats I agree that Seche Vite is the absolute best but unfortunately it makes the tips of my nails peel not shrinkage the actual keratin layers  .

9049087,0,t1_d64l7ll,Oh my gosh I just saw this while trying to find a pic to show my mom haha. Im sorry!Ive found that I cant get it to work unless I use slightly warm filtered water. Make sure I I dont have a fan on either or itll dry before you even get to create your design. Also work fast. The faster you can get the nail polish in the water the more time you have to create your design. When you out our polish in the water you want to make sure the brush is fairly wet and that you gently dip it into the water for a second or two. If you let the polish drop off the brush it might sink to the bottom. When you create your design you want to use a toothpick tiny dotting tool or a needlepin. I like using a pin because its skinny and sharp. After you drag your tool through the polish once make sure you wipe it off or itll stick to the polish in the water and ion the design. Also dont drag it all the way through the polish and dont start on the edge of the polish. If you start closer to the middle youre still working with wet polish vs the dryer part. And last but not least! I love using liquid latex around the entire part of my finger below my joint. I also put it under my nail. When you dip your finger in clean the water around it with a cotton swab to not ruin the design then remove the latex quickly to avoid letting the polish dry on it. I cut the back starting under my nail and then pull it off the sides. If you dont have liquid latex you can always use clear tape. It wont cover as much so youll have to do more cleaning but its not that bad. I hope this helps and I also hope its not too late! ,RedditLaqueristas,d7zk0xz,1,t5_2se5q

10310970,0,t3_5nmci8,Im not a professional but here is my advice.. As the people from the linked threas says you probably cant change your eponychium but pushing it back and removing the sticky layer that is under could help with hangnails  And a video of the same awesome woman preparing short bitten nails with not perfect cuticles . All shapes are beautiful is you shape the free edge to compliment it but if there is cuticle in the corners and sides of your nails that can definitely also be pushed back and maybe you can try to assimilate a more square or less fanlike shape. If you cant or dont want to rounded or almond shaped nails would be great ways to complement it. . If your free edge looks like that no wonder it get stuck somewhere and breaks. You gotta file that motherfucker smooth especially the corners. I would personally recommend OPI nail envy for soft nails or normal that one is good too and begin the adviced introduction with I think two weeks of wearing  coats of it at all times and use any kind of cuticle oil several times a day. This is not just for your cuticles but for your nails as well use it after you remove your nail polish and let your nail absorb it before you put on new nail polish I usually rub it in and let it sit while I file and shape my nails and then remove the greasy layer with a qtip dipped in acetone just before I add new polish to make it last longer.  I cant advice you on the solar oil but you should probably use it as well as the cuticle oil and maybe some hand cream A general nail care guide Last note looking at your sketch your side walls dont seem particularly low mine go to around halfway to the smile line and at the outer side of my pointer it only reaches about a third of the way. I have never tried the splitting you describe but the split off part is kinda soft it might just be a really bad kind of hangnail that seems to be part of the nail further down I have had mountains of those.,RedditLaqueristas,dccsz1s,2,t5_2se5q

11340873,0,t1_dffv9w2,I definitely say go for it reverse stamping is one of my favorite things to do!This plate in particular is from Born Pretty Store. Their plates are great they have a whole bunch of designs and they are pretty affordable. Most of my plates are either from Born Pretty or AliExpress but AliExpress are kind of a hit or miss kind of deal. Some are great some dont really work and basically I sand all of them because theyre pretty sharp on the edges and they dont come with backing so it kind of depends on what youre willing to do for cheap plates. I have some Bundle Monster plates from waaay back when they only had the circle kind and they are great good quality but the images on the round plates are kind of small. They have gone a long way since then but I havent ordered from BM because shipping was way too much for me I ordered only a couple of plates and shipping was almost as expensive as the plates themselves but if youre from the US I dont think youd have that problem.I have recently ordered some from MoYou London which everyone just raves about I hear theyre good quality but a little bit more expensive than Id like. Still waiting on them so I cant say much but Im sure theyll be great.I cant really talk about any other brands because I dont own them but UberChic beauty is another brand I hear a lot about and those Lina plates look really nice also. I can just keep naming brands I hear about but I cant say if theyre any good maybe someone else can help with that.,RedditLaqueristas,dfhgv80,1,t5_2se5q

11579685,0,t1_dg7upe6,I was just looking on Wistonias website and spotted these on sale and thought of you. Note these are just the heads you will need a shotglass holder for them but these are excellent and a really good price right now. And way faster than ordering from born pretty  edit Even better items not on sale are  off checkout code BIG. You could get a sticky marshmallow stamper and use the shotglass holder on the other heads. ,RedditLaqueristas,dg8kb20,1,t5_2se5q

11591984,0,t1_dg9y85h,I really dont know. I bought a cheap one off aliexpress not IBD and Ive used it once no lifting after  weeks. I just buffed my nails with a very soft grit file and wiped it with pure acetone before applying a gel base coat curing it fully and then applying the builder gel. I felt like applying a base coat would help dont know why.I think your problem lies with capping your tips its usually the first problem when something is chipping.,RedditLaqueristas,dg9yk2z,1,t5_2se5q
