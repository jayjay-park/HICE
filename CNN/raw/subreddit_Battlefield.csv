129006,0,t1_cet44jc,You can unlock the regular versions of these attachments by just leveling up. Almost none of the battlepackunlocked attachments existed in BF. Could you imagine how annoying it would be to get a new attachment for a gun every five kills? Theres no other way to do this except by making them all available from the start adding challenges for different attachments or just integrating it into the normal leveling system. The first doesnt feel rewarding the second would feel tacky and the challenge list would just be cluttered and the third I already talked about. We have many more attachments in BF than in BF and just leveling up to unlock variants of attachments would be stupid especially considering how much of the use of one variant of an attachment might be preferred over a different variant by a specific person.,Battlefield,cet4f1t,1,t5_2rdgw

1113027,0,t1_chusxe4,well rush didnt change at all i just think the maps are not really made for it. either you totally rape the enemy team or you get raped its not like this all the time but it happens pretty often but thats just my expirience. i played rush in bf in about  of my games now in bf i play about  conquest. many maps just dont give you enough corners to hide theyre too flat but for example operation locker is an AWESOME map for rush i love it.for premium  the dlc maps were nice to play on when they came out but after two weeks of playing each i always return to vanilla maps.china rising  almost vehicle only. huge flat maps...heaven for snipers and tanks. since i really prefer the infantry gameplay i only play those maps if i wanna do some long range sniping or flying.second assault  do i really have to say anything? caspian is a bit better in bf imo since the wall on the border is finally huge and its fun to bring down the tower. anyways ive played firestorm and caspian sooooo much in bf im just...kinda fed up of them hehthe sandstorm in oman is very nice though and metro...well its still metro sighnaval strike  WATER FUCKING EVERYWHERE yet the infantry spots of the maps are nice. i just dont like conquest on them that much. oh the flag right in the middle of the ocean is being capped? no boat or anything like that near you? well have fun swimming there for the next hour okay okay its not that bad but you get what i mean.as i said the fights on the big islands with  flags on it are very funny though!the premium events  a UNIQUE one every month. a UNIQUE double exp event this month a UNIQUE double exp eventh next month and so on. the camosknives that you get are....yeah well a few new skins. if you really want that stuff  okay but id be happy without it though.as i said above every player is different. you could enjoy the dlc maps way more than me possibly  buy it if you want though!,Battlefield,chut5ko,1,t5_2rdgw

1234827,0,t1_ci86jpb,Being a beta it is much more polished than the BF beta heck it seems to actually run much better than the current stable BF. Ive died a few times to random terrain but all in all not a heap of bugs.The pace feels slower sprinting is definitely slower. Air to Air is a bit OP at the moment. The money system for upgrades is much better than the grindfest that is the previous battlefields.The map is nicely designed a lot more inside building stuff which is pretty cool. The gameplay is fine. Ive played both modes and Blood Money is certainly more fun but they are going to get old really quickly.In all honesty it does feel like an extension of BF maybe thats because its made in the same engine or has the same guns for the most part. The grappling hook and zip line are cool the taser is fun but I dont see why youd ever use it. These are all things that could have been included in an expansion pack.Overall it probably sits somewhere between an expansion pack and its own game. Its certainly not a game I would or will be paying  for.,Battlefield,ci8j9jv,4,t5_2rdgw

3566887,0,t3_315afu,BF Premium was just on a big sale! You missed it but pay attention and itll come up again surely. I havent played Hardline yet but am looking forward to getting it on sale as well. No rush though as Im happy with BF and according to the stats page BF currently has about twice as many players as Hardline on PC.So Ill only be concerned about the playerbase when I cant get into a game any more. Going by how its still easily possible to play in Bad Company  thatll likely be many years from now. Even more likely though is that my main Battlefield game will switch to Star Wars Battlefront  by next year.Anyways back to your question the maps in Premium are fun and there are plenty of servers rotating through them. So Id get that when its on sale again and the same for Hardline when it hits a pricepoint youre comfortable with.

4332306,0,t3_3amh1s,It annoys the hell out of me when people complain about certain weapons being op honestly let alone banning for it. Shotguns instantly kill at close range sure but pump actions shoot slowly and semi autos have less range. People complain about DMRs because they kill in like  shots but ARs and PDWs kill pretty much just as fast assuming that you dont miss with the DMRs. Like if you kill someone with an AR in half a second its fine cause thats whats accepted socially or whatever. But if you take  shots in  seconds to kill someone thats  feet away with a shottie because the range on them is shite youre a noob and I just think thats bullshit,Battlefield,csdzap6,47,t5_2rdgw

4469756,0,t1_csrov3m,Yeah thats what I like about console everything is presetup for you and all games are optimized for the specific console. But the advantage of running PC is graphics. Something we achieve amazingly the technology we can run is far better then any Console. Yes Sony PS is AMAZING. But simply because we upgrade and have our own custom machines we are better. But the issue im having is an a BIG issue PC gamers are having with HARDLINE apparently its low FPS game at the moment and needs to be fixed. Once it does get fixed Im certain the PC playerbase will go up to the roof because performance is a big issue for majority of the playerbase with high  end PCs even. That is why people are playing BF over HARDLINE on PC because of the performance is beaten. If you cannot play the game on your machine its a big issue you will never find that issue on a console playerbase because its guaranteed once you buy it from the store you can play it  My point is you dont have to upgrade all the time you just have to build our machine for todays and tomarrows game and you will be fine for a very very long time.,Battlefield,csu35i5,2,t5_2rdgw

Another youtuber who isnt in that group is westie. Im also subscribed to him however I find him more informative but less entertaining to watch than the first group listed and what do you play on?

IMO Shotguns in close range are just as they need to be and in your situation you are upclose and in the BACK aswell. Some shotguns should need a damage nerf Such as the fullsemi auto shotguns as most of the shotguns have are a little too good on range.  Maybe they only would need to increase the spread of the shots  a small range nerf. So that you have to use atleast a little brain to be able to get upclose.  ,Battlefield,cx3325r,3,t5_2rdgw

6358810,0,t3_42qbmi,I did  hours on BC on the  and over  hours on BF on the .I then switched to PC for BF and the number one thing I found that helped the switch was consistency.  Everybody told me to learn KBM but I didnt.  I plugged in a  pad that I already had  hours of muscle memory learnt on and used that.  Did I get destroyed? No.  I can hold my own. Sure Im not as accurate as if Id learnt KBM but I have a better KD than on either BC and BF and no I dont play lockersmetro or whore the mobile AA.  I can also jump straight into Jets and Helos which my KBM friends have trouble with. What I would say is that practise and familiarity are more important to success than the actual control method. Stick to what youre best with get teh controls configured and then never touch them again.  After a while you dont even need to think to aim you will instinctively be able to place the cross hair over the target.,Battlefield,czcfch4,0,t5_2rdgw

In movies and pop culture the Vietnam War and WWII have taken a major dip in popularity.  Never mind what people who have some interest in military history think.  They have to sell this to the masses.  Theres too much money at stake not to play the safer hand.  Im saying  percent chance modern warfare  percent future combat  percent anything else.  With Hardline failing to be a hit on the PC I dont see them going with an unknown quantity.  They can reliably predict that a BF modern warfare title will make them a lot of money so why would they try something more interesting. It would be bad business and EA is first and foremost a giant money making machine.Also people love their real world weapons in games.  Its harder to make weapon pack DLCs for a WWII or even Vietnam War game without including weapons that were barely if ever actually used in the wars that the game is depicting.,Battlefield,d0qenpa,2,t5_2rdgw

The last months of WW were some of the most exciting and innovative months in human history. I feel it neccessary to pass on this  part podcast series to you all to educate and entertain you all on the prospect of a WW BF setting.With graphics outdoing Battlefront you could put together hellish landscapes never before seen in picture or film of WW that would turn the stomach of even the most hardened veteran. For the first time we take part in a VR war simulator that truly highlighted war in all its highs and lows.Theres something especially authentic about a historical shooter that could captivate an unprecedented audience in ways no other game maybe other than Star Citizen has ever done.The podcast series linked can be a captivating companion on your commute to school or work and will have you on begging for more at the end of each episode.

7316126,0,t3_4fatxm,Personally I play a lot on conquest large. My highest kill streak is  in a LAV on Siege of Shanghai. When playing infantry you will die a lot more. You are at the bottom of the food chain in bf. My recommendations is to use smoke grenades they can help make an advance to the next cover and take the enemy by surprise. Suppressors can turn you into a ninja. Always going towards the flank is the best way to stay alive. Take your favorite assault rifle pdw the ASVAL is in this class and has the highest dps in cpb btw or whatever and work the outside. If nobody does it your team gets flanked and wiped out. Not good. When playing a conquest game I mainly use vehicles and rack up kills. If you choose to use a vehicle in conquest please for Christ sake do not be the sniper who taxis the attack jet just to get to his favorite sniper spot. If you use armor know the lanes in the map well know how to pillar behind cover know the optimal angles to point your tank and be a menace! The most important things I can tell you is never overextend  and you can only be as aggressive as the infantry around you. Getting that one extra kill is not worth dying for and losing a tank for  minute  seconds. Take this from the guy who has over  service stars in the IFVs and  in the MBTs.When playing an infantry focused game I usually choose to play as a spec ops.Using a spawn becan motion balls and a suppressed carbine you can be menace to the enemy team. Get a squad on comms to all use suppressed guns and keep backraging the enemy. You will get many kills and win the game for your team! Good luck soldier ,Battlefield,d29slcu,1,t5_2rdgw

7364933,0,t1_d2f8rrq,I think Jets can be done right. Unfortunately BFs design philosophy is mostly throw more vehicles at it until it sticks so while a map with a lot of buildings like Dawnbreaker can make air combat interesting most of the maps are fairly flat and very boring both for jet pilots and people defending against jets.One solution could be to make some vehicles like jets temporary battlefield pickups.At the end of the day BF is not a very serious competitive shooter and DICE has been getting better at balancing the game so maybe they can find a way to keep jets or rather aircrafts and make them more fun for everyone in the next game.,Battlefield,d2fcbuu,1,t5_2rdgw

7448654,0,t1_d2oulbc,As I said you dont need to make everything  historically accurate.Biplanes are already not too far off from Bf Jets so incresing the speed a little bit is not this huge problem.You can balance the anti tank rifles by making so they have a significant bullet drop so you cant snipe veichles across the map. Sniper rifles in real life dont have that huge bullet drop like they do in BF but in the game it is that way for balance reasons. Also the damage model for veichles and things like anti tank granades  is not a huge problem you only need to care mainly about vehicles balance it dosent need to be  accurate to real life. Can a transport chopper take two anti air missiles and still fly in the sky in real life?No but it can in Bf!Why?Beacuse its game and not a simulator.,Battlefield,d2ov5a3,3,t5_2rdgw

I wish Poland was featured in games more since they were major Allied power in WW and fought many wars during the Interwar Period most importantly we stopped Bolshevik invasion of Europe at Battle of Warsaw and pushed them pretty far back to Russia. They even offered us more territory than we took  we had to refuse since Polish minority in those areas was very scarce and it would be more hassle than worth to keep it in our borders.One member from my family fought at Wizna in  which is called Polish Thermopile later joined Home Army Polish resistance and was eventually expelled to Siberia by commies. He send few letters back home but eventually stopped and was never heard about again. Just another victim of communist scum something to which many young people from Western countries who never experianced the beauty of communism seem to look up to.,Battlefield,d2ssnfn,3,t5_2rdgw

The Germans tried to make the use of the M Trench Gun illegal because our guys would get up on the sides of their trench and slam fire  shells in  seconds.  Buckshot is a shitty thing to get hit with.Also you should be able to shoot grenades out of the air.

President Wilson came up with the  points which later became the points which the league of nations was based around.Later on the League of Nations turned into the United Nations. Isolationism is a category of foreign policies institutionalized by leaders who asserted that their nations best interests were best served by keeping the affairs of other countries at a distance as well as a term used sometimes pejoratively in political debates. Most.Isolationism isnt a separation from the world stage or furthering interests of your country. Its staying out of other countries interests and dealings.

In the early beginning of the war during the battle of the frontiers armies operated similar to that of armies during the Franco  Prussian War. After  was over trench warfare did indeed become prevalent. So basically during the time of tanks and mustard gasthe time period of which I assume the game is set. Trench warfare was king. Thats not to say that they were always in the trenches but towards the latter more technology advanced end of the war most of the fighting was trench warfare. That being said I do hope that they dont segregate the game based on the year of the battles for entertainments sake.

Then after a reboot install the newest drivers.Step  Use Origin to repair BFStep  Disable Origin in gameStep  Check for latest windows updates and any relevant hotfixes in my case there was a hotfix for AMD bulldozer that I never downloadedStep  In the BF folder in program files find the vcredist fodlers and uninstall reinstall  repair DirectX  and  and PunkbusterStep  After backing up your BF fodler in my documents delete it and launch the game. A new one should be written.Step  Uninstall battlefield plugins from control panel and when prompted redownload.I also use the recommended settings with Directx  rather than mantle. All this coupled with a new stable OC means I can open the game no more BF has stopped working and I no longer have lag spikes.

You should be able to skip this ofcourse. The respawn timer would remain unaffected but youd at least have the ability to change your loadoutetc. rather than sitting through the whole death sequence.

You are effectively killing the person how you do it makes no difference cuz its a war and wars are gruesome and disturbing but there is no point in trying to bring that up in a game that is made for entertainment.

7768469,0,t1_d3p75fs,I wouldnt go so far as to say remove spotting because I think it does increase the teamplay mechanics I would however love to see spotting be far more ambiguous myself. The doritos and minimap spotting gets a little bit crazy. Its omniscient allowing people to see you through walls and cover and foliage and just allows people to find enemies who would otherwise have skillfully taken advantage of the map and terrain and taken out their enemies with flanks and tactics. Personally my favourite ideas would be to replace spotting with the tagging you see in Rainbow Six Siege. This has  benefits  it doesnt let people have this crazy omniscient information about exactly where a player is for several seconds even when they dodge behind cover or around a corner. And  it allows people to tag areas that they dont have line of sight on. What if you see an enemy run into a building? You cant spot them but you should be able to tell your team I saw a guy over there somehow. Id also love to see a tactical map like ARMA  in Battlefield. Let people place temporary markers to alert each other. Tank here Squad here moving south etc... something... I think both of these would go a long way to both fixing the hack feeling nature of the current spotting system while also actually providing more teamplay information. ,Battlefield,d3p7o8o,3,t5_2rdgw

7929853,0,t1_d476v7s,Theres no chance on earth theyre going to remove the minimap honestly I dont even know why youre entertaining that idea. Id hate to not be able to see where I was on a map during play.The other things I partially agree with but also understand their reasoning. The voice... I assume theyve gone that route because the thinking is that shes a radio operator back in London or something like that reporting positions. Its flawed reasoning because thered never be timely updates from a main home base like that so I agree she should be changed.Id also like to see bolt action rifles become more prominent but I doubt there will be much change on that front. I havent watched the live stream but Ive heard they were useless. Hopefully a headshot at least would be a onehitkill. The balance of every weapon in the game is going to change many times before release and many more times in the year after release so I wouldnt worry about that at the moment. I miss the rifles from Forgotten Hope but Dice are never going to get rid of all the automatics and semiautomatics because it would make gameplay too challenging for your average player. You can be crap with an SMG and still do reasonably well but youd have no chance with a bolt action rifle. Is that the way it should be?

I did a tour of Normandy  years ago and visited Carentan the area Dawnville was based on as well as Brecourt and Bocage. I could legitimately trace my steps through the area based on what I remembered from the game... it was phenomenal I couldnt believe it. I think part of it was that the map design was very inspired by Band of Brothers i.e. Carentan which if Im not mistaken was quite historically accurate. Yeah for sure the BAR and Bren gun both had quite the learning curve. I also remember how it was kind of taboo to play with the thompson mp or ppsh because they were spray and pray guns.

What you are talking about is literally experience begetting skill which is exactly how bad players become good. I have had team mates say I should spawn this or that do this or that or whatever. Do I? No. I use vehicles as taxis. I love wolf when I am not feeling a good gel with my team. I have over k hours in the franchise and believe that the only training the game severely needs is a fully optional offline full battle mode with bots. Am I selfish? No not really. I bought to game to play it. I didnt spend money to be told what to do by people that havent proven themselves to me. In fact I would argue that you are the one being selfish by wanting to force players to do hundreds of hours of classes over the span of many years in order to get their PhDMDwhatever in repairing allied tanks. Because the reality is people will always play the way they want to and adding a silly tutorial mode which isnt new to the Tom Clancy world of games and is more a staple than an innovation  would not make enough of an impact to merit its inclusion.,Battlefield,d4chrl0,1,t5_2rdgw

8354087,0,t1_d5lsq0j,I love  more than any other title and I understand what youre talking about but  the games are still at the core the same. The only reason the newer games feel differently is because the movement and shooting mechanics have been improved so much. You cant tell me that shooting feels just as good in  as it does in BF. Another big factor is map design. The earlier games were all about the size and scale because that was what was new and exciting at the time. Arena shooters filled the hunger for tight infantry combat and so BF pushed for vehicular combat and team play over gunplay. In BF and BF dice has catered to both with very good shooting mechanics and maps with sections designed just for infantry play. Think the sub base on Wave Breaker completely sheltered from the air and naval power outside. ,Battlefield,d5ltb7u,2,t5_2rdgw

8377740,0,t1_d5on8gd,again I ask if youve played verdun.its not that realistic nor is it comparable to battlefield no vehicles no aircraft  players smalltomedium maps. if you have the time try and get it when its on sale which is often should be coming out to PS and Xbone soon.Aufmarsch The Great War  its a mod is a better example of what there might be as an alternative given the support for  players and tanks. Development on it seems like its stalled as there are rumors that its creators are transitioningwaiting to transition over from RO Heroes Of Stalingrad to RS Vietnam before continuing development.but anyway back to battlefieldone... I guess I just disagree with consensus. I dont want super realism I just want things to be nudged in that direction more as it seems a waste to have a serious art direction andor great graphics and then to not try to make gameplay reflect reality even a little. perhaps if DICE were to make it Battlefield Heroes  in terms of art direction Id be less bitchy... idk probably not lol..My apologies for getting angry just sick of people telling me to go to another game when its not really comparable. I guess its not so much a strawman but it certainly came across to me as one at the time. anyway have a nice day.,Battlefield,d5orluk,2,t5_2rdgw

What was wrong with making it the same way as always. Dice seem to be going backwards not visually but in content day . ,Battlefield,d6wj6nt,1,t5_2rdgw

Worse still bad players like you straight up LIE about this to push some pathetic agenda. gttotal blind to the fact that good pilots go unscathed by any lockon weaponAmazing lie there. Keep it up I know its easier to lie about the things you cant competently fight against to get them nerfed then it is to simply get good yourself. You know like the pilots youre always screaming about? They got good in the face of all the crutch easymode lockon spam youre constantly crying for instead of simply whining about it as you would have done. gtmultiplying their KD based epeenFunny how its always the objectively terrible players that are constantly whining about KD. Its amusing to know that you care about KD far more then any actually good players do and that youll never be good enough to put up good scores yourself. gtin their eyes or vehicles are meant to crush infantryAnother obvious lie. When the reality is that bad infantry scrubs clearly want the game to become CODlite where vehicles are background set dressing that cant ever hurt you poor baby.gtGuess whos whining now? Still you?

8785979,0,t3_50bpjz,Heres what Ive noted during my short sessions playing on PC  Tweak needed  As a medic you dont automatically see the revive icons as they only show up once a player has requested a revive.  of the time people dont ask for a revive.   UI  When youre arming  disarming the telegraph its not clear if you are actually interacting with the telegraph. The message should always show up at the same place once the player interacts.   UI  When youre repairing a vehicle from the outside its not clear if you are actually repairing the vehicle. The message should always show up at the same place once the player interacts.   Tweak needed  Exiting from a vehicle should put you where you were looking at just like in BF and BF. Its really confusing to now know where you are after exiting a vehicle.   UI  The unlock system is kinda weird  from what Ive understand you can unlock weapons if your class is high level enough. But right now its not clear at all and I couldnt figure out where to find the level of the class. EDIT  Ok Ive found where it is. I still dont think its clear enough though...  Balance  Tanks are not op but canister shells definitely are  Im almost playing as a super sniper tank.   Bug  in Rush when youre in the deploy screen when the blue and red lines are overlayed the lines blinks.   Bug  Sometimes I cant change seats in a vehicle. Dont know how to reproduce this bug.   Bug  Quitting the game with the Quit button on the Home Screen sometimes doesnt work sometimes nothing happens or the game freezes in a black screen. Tweak needed  The HDR or brightness not sure how its called is FREAKING ANNOYING. You cant see anything inside of a building. You cant see anything if you look at a white surface. I was once blinded by the sunlight reflected by the sand dust. It was not good in BF and BF. Its really bad in BF.   Tweak needed  Requesting an order wont put you as a squad leader even if the current squad leader doesnt give new orders.  Tried several times. Feedback  in Rush mode having tanks as an attacker can be really OP  Ive been able to capture several telegraph just with my own tank driving to the telegraph exiting arming the bomb getting back to my tank. I was able to do that  or  times in a row without dying. And I was alone without anyone else helping me. I dont think that should be that easy. Feedback  During gamescom remember when people were amazed when the two teams did two draws in a row ? Well it didnt happened to me but I still got a draw round. And I got several draw rounds during the alpha. The new rules of conquest are making draw rounds not as rare as it used to be. Thats probably not a bug but I just wanted to add this just in case.,Battlefield,d73x59j,1,t5_2rdgw

8799953,0,t1_d75m8sv,It depends on the reviews youre talking about. I usually wait for Angry Joe. I like to hear what Total Biscuit and Angry Centaur have to say as well. As far as mainstream reviews go PC gamer is good I like to hear IGN reviews but generally ignore the score. Gamespot is a little more brutally honest. I am certainly not talking about top Reddit comments when it comes to reviews. An actual review is constructive and if youre going to take it seriously should come from an accepted reputable person or organization. The reviewers I mentioned above Im certain dont play the game for an hour and then write a review. Reddit top comments YouTube comments metacriticthe user side etc are just that commentary thats not a review. Theres nothing wrong with waiting for actual reviews and lets plays to determine whether or not I want to drop  on something.When it comes out Ill read PC gamers review wait for Angry Joe and Total Biscuit and probably watch Stylosa and Jack Frags. If it looks good after that then Ill probably buy. ,Battlefield,d75mure,3,t5_2rdgw

If theres no point in being revived then whats the point of trying to stay alive? Why run away when hurt if you might as well let the enemy kill you so you have full ammo spawn wherever you want kinda etc etc. Oh right cause see that medic revived you so you could fight the good fight just a bit earlier in the place you were since clearly that was an important place to be otherwise why were you there? If that medic revives you then gets sniped now he can spawn on you and so can your whole team. Further reviving people has the effect of keeping people together rather than spread out and once again reduces the odds you will be wiped out. Its a video game not to sound overly serious but the level of selfishness displayed in these forums is beyond belief Battlefield is a team game let your teammates help you for crying out loud.

9274764,0,t1_d8rkvtd,Trying to fly air vehicles in bf is cancer. You come in from over a hill make one run maybe kill one or two people depending on your vehicle then inevitably have to pop flares or ecm and run and hide for  seconds while you wait for it to reset. If you fly high youre boned because the entire map can see you. If you fly low  youre boned because there is not enough time from when the enemy fires the missile for your flares or ecm to deflect the missile. So the only tactic that doesnt result in instant death is flying at medium height  firing one volley and then running for  seconds while you fly around some pretty hills waiting. And if you are in a jet flying low is harder than it should be due to the inconsistent hitbox of environment objects coupled with latency. Plus your plane can be destroyed by one second of gunfire from a  chasing plane and there are no moves to get away.,Battlefield,d8rn4u9,0,t5_2rdgw

And a close range you got several handguns that wreck at close range.The SLR and LMG classes seem to lack any area they excel at. Add in the hk radius generally m big somewhere between m Worst feature implemented ever in BF and you just made scout the easiest class to play.Is long range sniping still hard? not as hard as BF but yeah it aint easy. Medium range sniping with or without scoped rifles? just aim for center mass and get a kill easy if not in one go just shoot again.And dont even get me started if you know exactly where your weapons sweetspot is you can just tag players and get instant kills.

9360225,0,t3_58lfhz,. In past Battlefields you had the option to choose camouflages for your soldier. Its possible that something may be implemented here helmet customization maybe?.. Operations will be worked on and Im sure something will be changed about them. They are in my opinion the hallmark game mode of BF and the best mode that has been added to the franchise since well ever. Im not sure that they are going to make them carry over into one another as they are meant to represent a single theatre of combat but the mode will be adjusted and more operations will certainly be added as they add more nations and expansions.. Additional weapons and maps will come out. There are already planned expansions at the moment and if BF is any indication we will get free expansions and weapons that are not part of their formal expansion plans at the moment.. Hardcore is already announced that it will come out. Id expect it sooner rather than later.. Rotating the camera has never been in Battlefield. I wouldnt expect this one to happen. Honestly the death screen telling us how close a medic is to our body is the best improvement weve ever gotten to it.. I think that a player findersquad finder is a reasonable ask and could certainly be something that is added to the game. Battlefield is best experienced with others especially if there is some continuity there instead of feeling like you are just in a squad with a bunch of random players.Finally Battlefield isnt like Call of Duty. When they make a game they do it right. They take care of it after launch they hold community events and they keep producing content even free content.

9398306,0,t1_d96rytl,I agree. It creates a sense of urgency for the attackers and gives the defenders a chance against attackers that have an already substantial advantage. Example   days ago as defenders on Amiens we were getting rolled and were pushed back to the last telegraph with  minutes leftthe one in the alley with  directions of attack. The enemy would get it armed wed push back and get it disarmed back and forth. One of my teammates got the Wex but the enemy was spamming incendiary nades after arming. As the timer counted down  I ran out and began disarming. At  disarm I went down and under withering fire my medic revived me while teammates provided cover and I disarmed it right before it exploded and the clock ran out. Best part  my son was the medic.

On the other hand I think BF dealt with some of the play and balance issues from BF. The class roles are more balanced and defined. There are a lot less opportunities to play like a shit head for example you see a lot less snipers camping on the map edge team play is better rewarded etc.  Also it looks fucking amazing.

9409589,0,t1_d98pnva,Whether or not its awful will be a subjective matter. Whenever hardcore is mentioned theres always a bitter argument over which is better or more skillful or whatever which Id like to avoid. But the fact is that DICE previously have not put much care into HC there arent any changes made to balance the weapons according to the lower health pool. People enjoy it regardless and thats fine but the mode isnt up to the same quality as core.

Most windows are tiny too near the floor obstructed by fixed position rubble like hanging pane frames and the head position provides really crappy vision. Is this one of those moments where they side with historical accuracy to sacrifice gameplay?Just like most of the most powerful fixed emplacements and vehicle weapons in the game it seems like theyre nerfed by inaccessibility in their interface more than anything else.I keep thinking back to Day of Defeat which had a really polished feeling LMG setup process that was essentially required to use the weapon at all and rewarded good placement in a few key locations which were clearly optimal placements you wanted to defend as hard defense chokepoints but which required defending flanks that were also designed into the map.,Battlefield,d9fwmel,3,t5_2rdgw

Hug the outside of maps to flank enemy squads depending on mapmode.The skill gap can be pretty high youre already setting the expectation low and out of your favor by assuming the skill gap is small.Knowing when to runhidereveal location.You have choice on your spawns... dont spawn in an area that is highly contested or squad mate that was taking fire even the game prevents spawning on targets in combat.Squad wipe text can mean youre in the clear.Choose a class for the counter.Choose a weapon for the job.If you wanna be Rambo use trench weapons or the Model a hunter.Its a different type of FPS you have to factor a lot more in than your typical shooters.

All was fine and dandy.now that the game released they have those  new options and i believe they have something to do with the game running so bad.I was running it on ultra p with no issues back in the beta at fps.So i doubt its my CPU but rather DICEs fuck up on the games release.Another thing that the beta didnt have but the final product has its the ingame origin overlay and DENUVO DRM.,Battlefield,d9xfbv5,1,t5_2rdgw

9632885,0,t3_5cw1a1,I use the MG Suppressive ammo crate Limpet charge and smokes. This is only a loadout to use if you really want to be a support role though. MG packs a punch and is really accurate when mounted. Use it to cover your squad when attacking a point or throw an ammo crate at your feet and hold attackers off of a point for as long as you can.Use whatever sidearm you want because with that  round belt you wont be using it much. I rock either the  or the No. .Limpet charge is an invaluable breaching tool and will fuck up any vehicle you put it on. It just takes one to destroy half of a house take down a door or disable a weapontread on a tank.The smoke grenade is an under utilized grenade. It can provide you and your squad with an escape route cover to advance or when paired with a spotting flare a great way to disorient your enemies and clear out a point. ,Battlefield,da0g91k,3,t5_2rdgw

This means they are static objects that arent affected by physics. The old method actually threw the box out. It was a dynamic object that would travel in varying arcs based on your moment vector.

9643778,0,t3_5d28s3, uManliestManAmongMen your issue is likely an issue with the OCXMP profile on your RAM. Just because other games run fine doesnt mean all games will like those clock settings. Ive been overclocking stuff since some of the first OCable nonK series chips from way back. Another thing to keep in mind Ive been building and fixing computers for almost  years. So Im not talking out my butt here.Your issue definately sounds like one of the followingThermal throttling Unstable OCXMP profileDriver issuePotentially SSD issues Ive seen it on my own rig where  failing SSD would only cause issues on  applications and nothing else.What you should do to fix itpotentially isolate the cause Disable your OC reset your RAM XMP profile to default. Reboot run a CPU stress test to see if there is an issue with any of the coresabnormally high temps. If stress test passes and temps are good then try the game. If you still have issues then it is more than likely an issue with the GPU drivers. Once youve completely removed and reinstalled the GPU drivers try the game again. If it still doesnt work then check your SSD health using the Samsung Magician software. If that comes back fine then the issue lies with the game and youll have to be patient and wait for a fix. Given the fact that there are multiple people on here with worse rigs than yours reporting no issues and I know of many people with similar setups as your with no issues Id surmise that the issue is on your end.Now I dont say this to be rude but If you are unwilling to take the extra step on your end to do your due diligence and troubleshoot properly then youre just going to have to deal with your issue.EDIT For the downvoters I have a nearly identical media centerencoder machine w a nonK series i from the same series and a different mobo wo a SSD and I have no issues playing BF  P. Kinda odd that I dont have issues so that is what leads me to believe the issue is on their end. ,Battlefield,da1smc9,0,t5_2rdgw

9652908,0,t3_5d8hb6,I agree that LMGs are still pretty far from balanced. There are several major flaws not even counting the idea that we should primarily do suppression  which in reality is a sideeffect at best and suicidal at worst considering all the accurate longrange weapons in the game.The biggest problem is still  as it has been since the bloody beta  the damagedropoff at m. Anything below m goes against all the ideas behind the class role. Another thing is the ammo count  we have one real LMG platform and one LMG variant which is frankly sad. When most SMGs have the same ammo count and beat us at close range and usually at mediumish range  because balanced there is something seriously wrong. Make the Lewis Gun and Mercie high capacitybox magazine variants the standard platform which is historically accurate btw. I have no idea what to do about the Madsen though  apart from just saying the magazine holds  rounds and screw historical accuracy.Side note Try the Mercie Telescopic. It is great trust me. You wont do much at closer ranges but at mediumlong range it is a damn beast.,Battlefield,da2x6fw,5,t5_2rdgw

SBMM is never a good idea so I have no clue why they put that in and of course  of the population still hits skip revive. I still think BF is going to be incredibly frustrating to play until something is done about the team balance every noob playing  HXR sniper and allowing revive skips or moving spawns closer to points.

9770970,0,t3_5eys0l,I havent quit and dont plan to. But I understand the communities issues for sure they are well founded.Im astonished by how many people seem to be bothered by the snipers in this game though. It seems to be a fairly popular position oddly enough. Im more worried about the significant amount of Hunter shotgun variants and automaticos with devilishly long ranges.  Ran into a guy with  service stars in Argonne today and in case you were wondering yes he was behind the doors in A camping in to cubby hole to the left....like  percent of every game on that map. Snipers are not as prevalent as some people on this thread in particular seem to assume  could be game mode specific though. I play hardcore mostly and find sniping to be relevant in that mode  not so much in others as the sweet spot mechanic doesnt work as advertised. Ive done testing on a friends server and its very spotty at most regardless of what youtube ect tells us. Essentially what Im saying here is snipers bug people because theyre paying attention to those deaths the most.Id like to see some changes though Somewhat shorten the nasty a hunter Range or increase the spread at range. Perhaps the pellets that spread farther do more and those in the center of spread less  bullet physics tells us clunkier trajectories do more damage. Show blue dots on every friendly the moment they get on screen and consistently and always show squad mates. Please show the damn kill feed in HC.  Switch the  of rotation for AA guns to maybe  pointing towards the rest of the map. Increase vehicle respawn timesincrease vehicles by  ...Maybe. More viable solutions to antivehicle capabilities. Honestly the scout class should have some kind of antivehicle response...lets face it..K bullets blow. Hard. Like really hard. Allow viewports in vehicles to be shot threw. Theres no reason my bullet shouldnt pop the guy clearly behind the giant open slot in the vehicle.  Remove the damn aim acceleration on consoles. Its ridiculous to move past a set amount and have your speed increased linearly it should move left to right at a consistent speed.  Please stop the spawn on A? Here Ill put you  meters over here spawn system. Ok...its not that drastic but ya feel me?  All pistolsAll classes. Lee Enfield Gewehr  Springfield  ect  all classes but perhaps make them something like a Standard Issue version.  Customize classes outside of games...wtf...

10014519,0,t3_5j107m,Id pay  for a Cold War like ss right now.BF reintroduced the idea of using lots of different factions which flavors up the gameplay if even indirectly. Poland The Netherlands France Britain WestEast Germany Czechoslovakia the Nordic countries Turkey Romania Italy these are just minors. Not even including US and USSR.Now of course you couldnt put all those countries in there at once. Im just saying you have these different options to work with. All their arsenals are available too. That ranges from the French MAT submachine gun to the good ol MA and AKMAK P or MM revolver grenade launchers MGs to PKMs M Dragons to Carl Gustavs or various RPG models s to TTs and CZs. FALs to Italian BM s a crazy Garand modification.And since BF expanded vehicles we could run the gambit on those as well with steadfast Ms and BTRs alongside revolutionary designs like the BMP fighting the Bradley or Marder. Really versatile yet older vehicles like Ts fighting MsMsCenturions or Leopard s alongside powerhouses like the first variants of the M Abrams against the new T and vaunted T. Maybe we could even work in a way to have SPGs and SPAAGs. How about special vehicles like a heavy artillery gun such as the M or S Pion which have shells that can level small portions of towns?And geez the amount of air vehicles. Mi and Huey gunships. AH and Mi attack helicopters. F Phantoms and F Eagles MiGs and MiGs or fast interceptors like the F Starfighter or MiG Foxbat. Small but nimble and adaptable MiGs and F Tigers. You could have like SEAD aircraft which can hunt down SPAAGs with their own radar or versatile fighterbombers. Hell maybe even Bs and Tus. Those may just be a bit too big though for Battlefield maps. Best of all the map options. Siege of Istanbul anyone? Fall of The Netherlands? Fulda Gap? Danube River Plain? The Alps just like in WWI? If you want to get biblical about it you could do a Siege of Jerusalem. Bring new and old actually meaning to WWIII and the Apocalypse.Look at me Im dreaming again.,Battlefield,dbcx5eo,4,t5_2rdgw

10074603,0,t1_dbke2sl,If were talking about the Trench variant thats because bursting doesnt suit the weapons strength which is to be a highDPS powerhouse in CQB. Its used by players with poor aim because it still allows them to be effective but only within a very short range. In the hands of a player with good hipfire aim you can pull off some pretty ridiculous kills. In my experience the Automatico tends to be more consistent than the shotguns as well.Also if Im engaging a target at a range with an SMG where I need to burst fire then Im already outside the weapons effective range especially considering that tapfiring isnt as effective like in previous BF titles.That being said I do prefer the Storm variant because its a more allaround weapon but the hipfire while still good is noticeably worse.,Battlefield,dbkqqsu,2,t5_2rdgw

The only counter to Supports sitting in spawn with airbursts and mortars was to do the same.The engineer class was the biggest issue in the game following the nerf of medics from BF. Try pressing X when squadrons of engineers with MBTLAWs attack your vehicle. If that wasnt the most casual launcher in the game then I dont know what is. Considering it was a day zero unlock it was quite common.It was evident that DICE was following the efforts of Call of Duty.

We cannot go back to that.I agree that using it puts you at a disadvantage in that you dont have the ability to shoot as fast as you would with other rifles but the sweetspot is larger so it kind of evens out.If anything the only thing they should change is the reload time. Make it a bit faster and then itll be fine. The sweetspot is already massive. The gun itself could only hold one bullet at a time so adding clips would be bullshit.

It allows me to not only PTFO as an assault but to also use my favourite rifle at the same time. At first it was a nightmare playing with a bolt actions with irons in CQ but after getting used to it I find that a good rifle like that is the most versatile weapon in the game.I highly recommend you try it out. Find an HC server with SIRs enabled and try playing with a bolt action as say assault or medic. It will be challenging at first but after you get used to it youll be having tons of fun.

Example  Before you needed to lead your shots like    cm on screen after patch you need to lead    cm depending on distance. they did this because you had an advantage with high ping low pings cant shoot people around corners D its more like you need to adjust to the new leading rather a nerf to high pings like you need to learn how a new gun shoots.. give it a couple of rounds and you are fine again,Battlefield,dgddfuw,5,t5_2rdgw

11796293,0,t1_dgwse9z,I think that DICE is trying to create an experience of just being another expendable soldier in a war. What they didnt realize is that despite the accuracy it has in terms of the context thats not what people want. Playing around with ones gun is like half the fun of battlefield. It creates an important sense of identity. Really high up competitive people are able to create that sense of identity through their unique playstyle and in competitive situations the Standard issue thing could actually fit. But for many others a big part of the fun factor is gone. Theres very little longevity.Add that to BFs different map biomes and colour schemes dissimilar to BFs Grit with some vegetation and its little wonder really. Instead of getting excited by the things you do like blow up a tower or get a wicked multikill you have to get excited by prescripted battle trains and flamethrower pickups. The sense of user generated chaos has been weakened by DICEs desire to guarantee something awesome happens every match. The problem is that when people know what to expect and the same awesome thing happens every match well...The era is perfect the graphics are nextlevel the game play is massively refreshing. Its just not the same kind of fun.,Battlefield,dgx5ers,2,t5_2rdgw
