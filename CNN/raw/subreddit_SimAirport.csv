Well be getting back to it in the near future though!In this case its most likely that the cause is an AI behavior that ignores securityis using too low level access or we have an object that is misreporting its security status.  Well get it looked at and resolved as soon as we can  am going to take a quick peek at it now  but in general we just have to prioritize issues and so it can take some time especially if a given issue takes substantial time to debugfigure out.  Were getting there though and were making progress each amp every day!As far as oneway objectsdoorsexits  we actually played with an implementation late last week and it worked and was pretty nice.  Itll require a good bit more testing but we will eventually get there!  ,SimAirport,df8tw74,5,t5_3etus

11561219,0,t1_dg5piw5,It only started doing that after I removed the one gate with the stuck plane so I assume after I put it back itll go back to normal. I started a new one since. ,SimAirport,dg6gvub,1,t5_3etus
11609725,1,t3_65o48j,Short answer No. Long Answer not yet. Deluxe Answer incl all DLC have you checked out Airportceo.com? A lot of people are on the fence between these two and are waiting with their purchase because ACeo still has to be released coming Q... they say. I was one of the impatient ones who bought SimAirport and in my personal nonprofessional opinion its not even ready to be alpha. Also it tries too hard to be the Airport version of Prison Architect and doesnt even do it very well. I could actually go on to list a number of things that I dont like about the game but each one could be countered with its alpha itll get better so Im not going to waste my time. If youre watching Lets Plays of SimAirport and not convinced dont buy it and wait till AirportCeo releases. Then you can compare Lets Plays and make a better decision. I do however think that your choices will be  limited to SimAirport and AirportCeo. ,SimAirport,dgbz0sf,3,t5_3etus

I know you can have foreign flights on smaller planes like the  but for the sake of simplicity perhaps there could be a mechanic where XL gates the ones servicing big planes are from foreign countries. Therefore the PAX arriving from those flights will need to go through immigration and customs.,SimAirport,dghxtb0,2,t5_3etus
