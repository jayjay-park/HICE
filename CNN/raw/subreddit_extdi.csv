9475623,0,t3_5ak4bi,I have a  VW Jetta TDI sedan.  I have no idea what Im getting.I test drove a VW Golf GTI Autobahn edition and was blown away surprisingly.  Not a performance vehicle person I drive automatic.  Hubby has an Evo that terrifies me.I also test drove a Subaru WRX and a Legacy Sport sedan.  I did not like the WRX as it was not comfortable at all.  Seats were so thin and I felt every bump and jostle.  Legacy was comfortable and responsive but felt HUGE.  Theres just not a lot out there that compares for somebody like me.  I dont want a wagon and Im not a huge fan of hatchbacks.   But...something about those snazzy red lines on the GTI Autobahn...Hmmm.    T.,extdi,d9h2pg2,2,t5_3hbtg
