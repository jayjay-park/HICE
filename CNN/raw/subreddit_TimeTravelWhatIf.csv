3161637,0,t3_2wak6i,Do what Doc Brown did Send clocks forward in time to demonstrate how they lose time by the amount they skipped. You can throw phones with GPS in to show how they lose network connection location and time all at once.To be a bit more scientific send a radioactive substance. Since the decay rate is known any missing amount of decayed material is pretty strong evidence.You can also send the machine forward during some kind of process that has a fixed length of time in which it can occur  a grenade with the pin pulled for instance. Its basically the same as sending a clock but its a more dramatic example. If the time machine is large enough and transparent you could just drop an object jump forward and watch as the machine returns which will show the fall completing long after it should have.,TimeTravelWhatIf,coppa6l,1,t5_3291n

6119576,0,t1_cyl7qf0,Basically lets say there is a crossroads that the us army wants to capture they want to bomb a bunker but to bomb the bunker they need anti aicraft attack planes sead they go to attack the aa batteries for this they need air support to defend against enemy aircraft. Once AA is down the bombers go in could range from f all the way to b. Now that the bunker is down its time to mop up the enemy tanks. Apache gunships destroy  enemy tanks and go home. The heavy hitters now go in while infantry in apcifvs follow up. The abrams destroy the remaining  enemy tanks and maybe mop up some infantry. Near the cross roads is a small town. While the tanks guard for any incoming ground threats the infantry move in and clear the small town. Once the town is grabbed they then move up to the crossroads dismounted but are escorted by the tanks and transports they drove in on. Any resistance can be taken care of. Combined arms. ,TimeTravelWhatIf,cyl8doq,1,t5_3291n

The telepathictelekineticteleporting teenage heroes are sent back in Time to ancient Britain and must prevent the creation of a split alternate s where Roman Empire has spread to the stars. All thanks to gaining access to a small working steam engine. Ill try to track down more about the storyline but basic premise is the time jumped future tech allowed Roman Empire to leap from slave based economic model to Industrial Revolution mode. Edit turns out was relatively easy to locate in Wikipedia. Plot is basically what I remembered. Our Tomorrow People heroes encounter Roman officers from an alternate history are trying to alter the past in order to ensure their own timeline one in which the Roman Empire never fell and has had a thirteen hundred year technological head start on our own world due to the premature invention of a working steam engine which meant Rome has become the core of a major galactic empire.Tomorrow People  A Rift in Time.
