172982,0,t1_cew0yoj,Python really is a nice language to learn on and also to use so Id put in a vote for that as well. Ive been more into the static compiled languages lately but its something that rather should come after youve grasped the basics. There really are a lot of fun languages to play around with thats my biggest weakness Im a linguist and I find it so much fun to just muck around with languages and learn to write some small programs with them that I never really get good in any of them but since its more a hobby to me than anything else I guess that isnt such a bad thing.,CoderRadio,cey4vmi,1,t5_2u9rm

Seeing as it is in their best interest to do so a good recruiter can sometimes negotiate a better salary for you especially if you are not someone who negotiate well.    . The problem is actually finding a good recruiter and yes the ones that do the least amount of work also do the most spamming.On the plus side with  years experience I cant see you struggling to get a new job with or without recruiters.PS Have you considered using LinkedIn?  Personally Ive found that to be of great help.,CoderRadio,cjrx5bx,1,t5_2u9rm

3758888,0,t3_33gey7,Code School is pretty great. The JavaScript Path is good to get started. If you want to learn the language without the learning the DOM Node will certainly help you. Remember that while something looks basic its important to have all the foundations.Babel is an awesome tool to help learn some of whats in ES. What exactly are you looking for? What do you want to do? What do you find fun to build?,CoderRadio,cqkqocj,1,t5_2u9rm

5535287,0,t3_3qgk9n,Im kind of disappointed that your smartwatch conversation essentially boiled down to I only actually use my smartwatch for things that Pebble is doing way better than everyone else but I dont actually want to use PebbleWear devices always seemed like little more than yet another way for Google to get metrics and as an interface for Now and Apples watch seemed like an Oh shit we need to innovate this first before people catch on that we stole the idea from Google. Neither product feels like it was designed to be a watch and theyre trying desperately to cram too much stuff on a tiny screen.I wanted a smartwatch not a wrist mounted dumb phone. I want a watch that functions at least resonably as a watch when I dont have my phone. I want a watch that enhances my smartphone not a poor attempt to replace it. And finally I want a watch that doesnt require me to drastically change my habits to continue using it.These are all reasons I got my Pebble and ultimately it seems like these are the reasons people settle on as most important when the new shiny effect wears off.Mikes business reasons for not caring about smartwatches are valid there isnt much money to be made in the smartwatch game as its too niche. Hearing you two complain about smartwatches as a platform and why you personally have fallen out of the honeymoon phase with it was infuriating though. The coversation reminds me very heavily of what many people do with Linux. It checks all the boxes for their needs but its dismissed for some arbitrary reason or another. ,CoderRadio,cwj6jxt,2,t5_2u9rm

11337107,0,t1_df8n0du,gt Flagship devices are amazing.I think I have to disagree. Mostly I always hear this. Well the Nexus  is a bit slow but the x is much better. Oh sure the x is slow but the  or p really improve performance.And its never good enough. And I think I just dont have the faith enough anymore to try a Pixel. I would just be so disappointed. ,CoderRadio,dfh1i1c,1,t5_2u9rm
