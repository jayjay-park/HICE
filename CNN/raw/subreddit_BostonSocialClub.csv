They never seemed to have the latest games but Ill be honest the last time I went for board gaming was maybe a few months postopening.   per person just to use the space on a Thursday seemed a bit steep to me and I have board games so I usually go to Panera to meet up with friends around the corner or something and bring a few games. Ive never been bothered and for the money I get dinner  gaming with friends and a place I dont need to clean. ,BostonSocialClub,dbpwcu2,3,t5_2svxx
