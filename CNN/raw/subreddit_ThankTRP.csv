7337211,0,t3_4fqjv4,To recap your relationship history she knowingly or unknowingly took advantage of your running errands for her plus awkwardly mentioned amazing sex with her ex right after sex with you. It seems like there was also a span of time where your sexual needs just werent met with her. Can I assume that you communicated all of these grievances with her? I assume you didnt just keep it bottled up right? Because if you did stay quiet about your issues with her or if you did talk but your grievances fell on deaf ears then one might interpret your recent adoption of RP as an outburst of pentup frustration with your relationship.I can understand your beef with this girl. No one likes their good deeds being taken advantage of especially when the whole experience is made worse with a longterm period of nonreciprocated sexual interest. I can also understand why the recent change can feel like a cathartic experience  youre not only getting the sex you wanted but youre also treating her with the same disrespect for personal time that you felt mistreated for. Its emotional revenge  you want her to know how you felt.But like the other commenters have said this relationship wont last not without underlying problems and conflicts that one or both of you wont address with each other. Not until you can understand each others issues and have both sides willing to make sacrifices while having their needs met.Lastly personal advicegtAnyway I was the sweetest boyfriend a girl could have. I bought her flowers regularly respected her busy schedule working at a caf jumping to meet her for coffee or even only to tag along as she did her errands just because I missed her so much. I did all college administration stuff for her because she was so busy with her job etc.A lot of young guys fall into this trap of letting their emotions overwhelm their sense of practicality or longterm consequences. That happens to a lot of guys for their first relationship youre not alone. Relationships dont have to be this extreme of control or be controlled  its possible to balance and negotiate meeting each others needs.Additionally not everyone is right for everyone. If what she needs right now is an errand boy whos willing to help her with things while expecting little in return perhaps shes not what youre looking for. And supposing that she is deadset on her requests for you which hey maybe she isnt maybe youre not the best for her either.A lot of shits happened to you in the last week. Take some time to yourself to chill and think about where you want this relationship to go then act accordingly.,ThankTRP,d2c6v9q,2,t5_30381
