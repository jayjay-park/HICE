191585,0,t1_cf087kb,when we brought our guy home we setup to den like areas in the house. One in the bedroom and one in the living room. In both cases  sides were wallsfurnature so the dog only had to worry about one entrance this worked pretty well for our dog. However our dog is pretty alpha and VERY independent.

513417,0,t3_1zypfg,There are some incredibly strict greyhound people on this subreddit who obviously love their dogs quite a lot but have unrealistic expectations for greyhound owners IMO. I own  greys and am an adoption counselor for my local greyhound adoption agency in Colorado. We would love to adopt to you if you lived in CO! Dont get discouraged youll make a wonderful greyhound owner. If people who worked full time couldnt own dogs I would be SOL.  My greys are home by themselves for  hours a day with no dog door about  daysweek. It used to be  before my husband started working from home. I do think it helps that they have each other but the right dog will be ok with your situation. Try to keep your dog entertained and spend time with him or her in the evenings and on the weekends and theyll be fine. Good luck on finding your new companion. ,Greyhounds,cfymn11,1,t5_2sqf9

931883,0,t3_24sghk,A friend of mine had success with this method  She would ball up socks and lightly toss them at him and call his name to get his attention ... sort of the gentle from afar wake up until he gets used to it.  After time she progressed to closer distances and was able to finally probably over the course of a year or more touch him.Its not just greyhounds that sometimes have wake aggression but they are one of the breeds where it is more common.Think about it this way  your whole life you lived in a condo where you always knew what was going on.  When someone came in the building you knew.  When it was chow time you knew.  When someone was coming to touch you you knew.  If someone was coming into your crate you knew ... you could clearly see them.  Never not once were you woken up from a deep sleep without all the warning signs to get you up out of your slumber.And certainly not every greyhound does it.  Simple dog will rest his head on my cheek and sleep if I let him.It takes some desensitizing but dont give up  it can definitely be done.  Ill try to find out more about the desensitizing training my friend did.,Greyhounds,cha7k8p,3,t5_2sqf9
947653,0,t3_24yold,Why cant you take him home for a month?  That seems awfully long.Wellness seem to do well for us.  When he first came home his digestive system was still wobbly so we gave him Wellness Simple grainfree no preservative limited and simple ingredients.  When he had adjusted we gave him a mixture of Wellness and ProPlan for sensitive stomach.  I think mixing two kibbles is a good idea in case theres a recall on one you dont have to immediately switch his food and cause an upset.I supplement with fish oil he has skin like an old lady.  After a month with us his rough kennel coat grew out but his dandruff was as bad as ever.  You could pet him on the butt and skin flakes would fly out.  I tried everything fish oil olive oil ground flax seed and then I started to put one hard boiled egg in his dish once a day.  Within a week his skin cleared up.I also give him cooked human food such as mashed sweet potato rice mashed with swiss chard when I make chicken stock I throw the drumsticks in there and debone it to give to him with the carrots and celery no onions.  Sometimes he gets a can of tuna packed in water split over two feedings.  I also give him yogurt occasionally and I make a frozen treat with yogurt and bananas and blueberries.  He is the only fruiteating dog I know so when I cut up an apple or as were going into summer an apricot or a peach he gets a slice.  Its nice to see him crunch away.  Dont give him grapes though.Damn as Im writing this out Im thinking that dogs got it made.  Im his unpaid cook!  What do you guys make for your hounds?,Greyhounds,chc07di,2,t5_2sqf9

I think they are all capable of learning it just takes more or less work on your part.. Mine have both been interested in strangers. My first would approach and sniff looking for some love. Our current boy took some work to teach him not to jump but he does get very bouncy and greyhound excited which I think is generally less excited and lasts a shorter amount of time than other breeds Ive been around.. I agree with the earlier poster  greys in general are more velcro than other breeds. Aloof or not I think they all want to sit on or near their people whenever possible.. Depends on the dog and the age. My first grey would run only occasionally but would go on regular walks. Taking her to the dog park would just result in endless sniffing and no running at all. The new one gets walked every morning zooms around the yard most days and loves running with other dogs at the dog park whenever possible. If he hasnt had a good run for a couple of days he is definitely antsy.. I have never seen one. Mine will sometimes pick up something that I throw but usually deposit it somewhere farther away. Often they run after it but just keep running and never even pick it up. I tell people that my grey only knows one game  the running game. He gets very excited seeing other dogs run to fetch and often runs and gets in between them and the ballfrisbee and is then confused when they pick up whatever it is and trot back  he seems to question why the running game stopped. I havent met one I havent liked and it can be hard to guess at what they might be like at a kennel or meet and greet. Their personalities sort of evolve over the first few months as you get used to each other and they learn how to be a pet. And sometimes like my last one they pick you and not the other way around.,Greyhounds,cw6haj3,2,t5_2sqf9

5755514,0,t3_3txfz1,Hi there weve been working with a pup who has really bad SAX. When our rescue obtained him through owner surrender he had basically never been alone since his prior owner was disabled and never left the house. This dog has made huge strides of progress since the rescue has had him and he is also of the destructive variety. So I dont think its too late. One thing weve noticed is that he has accidents and is more anxious when he hasnt gone to the bathroom recently. I think a long walk before you leave is important. Also try restricting water for a few hours before you leave. Otherwise theres also thundershirts calming collars and medication as a last resort. Youre already providing a source of entertainment the Kong. It sounds like youre not currently using a crate  some dogs find them comforting it might be worth a try. Look into cratetraining.Another poster says theres no real difference between  min and  hours and thats not really true for this dog or a lot of dogs so dont be discouraged if it doesnt work that way for you.,Greyhounds,cxaiydh,1,t5_2sqf9

6112947,0,t3_3z1zbq,Like others have said it depends on the preydrive of the dog. Make sure when you talk to your rescue you let them know your concerns almost all rescues will cattest their dogs and can tell you if they think its a good fit or not. My grey was  when I got him and has a very low drive indoors he has been around  cats in the year and a half Ive had him and has completely ignored them and respects what it means when a cat hissesswats. My cat likes my dog much more than he likes her actually and will come up and rub on him or lay down next to him pretty frequently hell occasionally playbow at her but thats as far as their interactions really go. We did a slow introduction separate rooms then dog leashed and muzzled then dog muzzled then supervised and havent run into any hitches yet though I would never trust him with a cat outside my cat is indooronly luckily. A puppy might work but keep in mind that the benefit of getting an adult dog is that you know their personality already  a puppy raised with a cat may be fine until they mature and turn out to have a high prey drive. Theres really not a failsafe way to be sure.,Greyhounds,cykh9ek,2,t5_2sqf9

So maybe once a week these days.When I had her and her brother back when I was more of a runner wed do  miles regularly. My female could definitely go further than  miles but my male had always had enough by then so that was the limit. And they were littermates so they were the same age but she could just handle more than he could from the getgo. So clearly some dogs can go further than others even within the breed and youll have to see what your dog can handle.Now that my female is  she shows her age on stairs slippery floors and while hiking but the running is still easy as pie for her.

9477616,0,t3_5akzbf,gtHow much money for vet visits annually? Do you spend money on doggy day care if so what does that run? Any unexpected costs that have come up for you that might be helpful to be aware ofMy vet center charges  for an appointment exam but if you have to do walkin or emergency its more like  and yes they are open  hours as a regional trauma center. Annually for vet visits probably more than  but thats because my vet  clinic requires exam appointments before giving out anything basic like metronidazole Flagyl or antibiotics or antiinflammatories. In other words I cannot just call and ask for antibiotics. Unexpected  costs for us would always fall into the emergency surgery or serious illness category which we have been lucky to not have yet but things like dog attacks cancer allergy testing seizures bloat or anything that can happen in  dogs lifetime. For that we have money set aside. No use of doggy daycare here but its usually  a day in this market. Halfday is . A halfhour dog walk through an insuredbonded company is . I would not use someone uninsured so I dont have a pay rate for that in my city. Group training classes for a series of sessions usually run around . Private training trainer goes to the house can run  and higher for the hour. ,Greyhounds,d9hbjn7,2,t5_2sqf9

11445455,0,t3_63dwcc,This breaks my heart to say but I think that the woman from the adoption group is correct.  This is a hound that will probably never be happy in your situation.  She needs somebody who is with her all the time.  I would agree that it appears that the habit of peeing in the crate is very very bad and will be very hard to fix.These things happen.  It is going to be very hard returning her and it will be hard on the hound initially but I think it will work out for the best.  ,Greyhounds,dftbyw2,6,t5_2sqf9
