829871,0,t3_23gq25,There is a box for the rules in the bottom right before the submit button. That is a seperate box that can be used for whatever. It might be nice to add in some FAQ resources. That is what I did with rTWGOK and it mostly worked I think. ,MetaAnime,cgylwhw,1,t5_2ujin

1614516,0,t1_cjio74j,Im no longer a mod here. I guess Mod remains so if people do read some of my older replies itd be clear under what capacity they were made.This subreddit is very much for discussing things. It means people are entitled to their opinions but said opinions arent protected from being called stupid.,MetaAnime,cjiod4c,1,t5_2ujin

2864253,0,t1_cntnu6a,Ack. I realize where the confusion and difference is. In my mind gifs and stills are the same thing. Because really what is the difference besides a few more frames? So to me a single frame capture is more or less the same as a multiple frame capture.      So fan art albums are banned but if it was an album of fan made gifs it would be okay. How stupid.,MetaAnime,cnto07a,1,t5_2ujin
