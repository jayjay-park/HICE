1365807,0,t1_cimvqnm,By the way its for Unity . because it uses serialized structs.It could work in .. but youll have to turn IntVector into a class and make sure to never modify any coordinates the  operator does this! and give each cell a new IntVector instance.,unity_tutorials,cinhrmf,3,t5_2r9tr

6301151,0,t3_41wlth,Totally doable great project.  BTW using Unity should make this way easier than programming on android from scratch.So if youre working in Unity you dont even have to do anything special with Android.  You just make the game in unity and tell it to build to Android.Your main challenge then will be making the game.There are hundreds of unity platformer tutorials you can find online.  Heres one that looked good to me.Unity lets you do the actual coding in either C or javascript.  Pick whichever you fancy theyre both roughly similar to C.,unity_tutorials,cz5vbbl,3,t5_2r9tr
