People like these two who would be willing to pull out a gun and take another persons life based on nothing but an argument really shouldnt have guns. We all have a right to guns but we need to prove that we can handle guns before we can obtain them. I dont think that takes away from ones constitutional rights because everyone could potentially have an equal opportunity to showcase their ability to handle the gun whether that be through some sort of psychological screening or background check.,LRCHAPGOV2,cf86bwi,1,t5_2y80m
