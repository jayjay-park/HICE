6809754,0,t1_d0mga95,So what exactly is so amazing about flying units?  I have an Orc Wing  to help with the early stage clearing speed but its not like its able to just straight up fly to the enemy crystal and kill it unless its one of the rare stages that has no enemy flying units or units which can attack flyers which cause your own flying unit to stop and attack.   of the time it seems that my flying unit gets to the crystal to attack it at the same time my front liners Death Knight amp Wolf Warrior do after clearing the ground enemies.Overall the early stages really dont seem much faster at all with or without a flying unit.  ,EndlessFrontier,d0o6kt1,1,t5_3cpei

The numbers are not concrete and the devs can figure out what numbers would work best. I think thisll promote paying the game more and then the rewards are substantial enough for people to work towards it. ryn  Edit Just in case the the above was not clear.

For FTP players its a lot of gems but even then for valuable units that you are definitely going to use for a long time you might think its worth it. Another thing to ask is is it going to make you happy? Buying the priest made me happy. And that happiness cannot be defined or quantified by other peoples opinions.

10131028,0,t3_5kywb7,Ok I can provide some input on this. Lvl  and just dinged  mil on scorpion to make me ranked  in top damage.In the raid KL means a LOT and the starting point seems to be lvl . That being said you want to ensure you have all  troop slots of all  races opened up. Next start raising your instructors. You will eventually want  of each at T but start at  of each.First thing to do before each raid run is close down the game and reboot it fresh. Huge decrease in lag times.Next when you raid you want to make sure you are following the tooltips. If human is up  then use human. If ranged is down  then use melee.Next up is hero selection. Your  heroes will only count for roughly  of your total damage so survival and buffs are super important. Most ideal team setup is matching racetype boosts across all  slots but that is normally out of the question. I lead with a T Lich for crowd control and then T HBX then Senior Pilot T Succubus then Senior Priest for Scorpion that is. Succubus and Priest are super important if you have them not for their damage but for their support. Succubus increases atkatk speed while Priest keeps your troops alive and helps counter crowd control.Next is your raid skills. I find that atk speed and attack damage give the best boost with movement speed as my final. You WILL get knocked around so having the ability to get everyone back on track quickly will help greatly.Hope those tips help and remember your KL... that is where your damage comes from the rest is just about optimization for each boss.,EndlessFrontier,dbs2tvc,3,t5_3cpei

11768416,0,t1_dgtrf2p,The catch is that innervate is useful in one place raids. Priests Dark Archers Fairies IP SA these all affect your personal growth directly. You either have them or you dont. Raid progression helps progression but it is a group effort.Raid progression is strange in this game in that KL determines your damage. Because of this almost all guilds end up carried by top  dps or so. Max innervate on a top dps will increase their dps a lot but max innervate on a lower person in the guild does basically nothing. So if you are a top dps in a top guild on your server max innervate is good. Could probably boil it down to if you are planning on being top  on the server it is valuable. Anything else and you can probably get carried by top .So buying a basic set of the current honor units is good for build flexibility but buying extra specifically to max innervate is probably not great especially if you have need for honor elsewhere k? been a while to buy all artifactsTrans   artifacts takes  honor per reroll honor to finish the transk or so honor to max out a set of  artifacts  would increase thisCan buy pet fragments much more valuable for most people than innervateNext honor rotation units that actually directly affect progression k for  hippos however many s of thousands for SR buff. Hippos btw are probably much more like priestfairy in their gotta have them statusNext honor rotation fire resist may end up similar to innervate in that it is only critical for top dps.,EndlessFrontier,dgtzbe7,3,t5_3cpei
