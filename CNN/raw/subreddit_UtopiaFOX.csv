1836781,0,t1_ckaiuhs,I can see where Dave is coming from saying that but I think that Hex is the type who would fight a man regardless of the outcome.  She seems to be the hardheaded fighting type who would take on someone much larger I dont really see her being the type to send her man after somebody.The reason she said that by the way is because Dave started telling her that she was egging Josh on to act the way he did and that shes the reason that he was grabbing at her when he was drunk.  Im not much for the victim blame thing but she was giving clear signals that it was not acceptable and he kept on she was actually making a good point.  I think he got mad because he jumped the gun and decided to hit Josh that night and now he wants an excuse for his actions so he is trying to blame it on her.,UtopiaFOX,ckaj16i,2,t5_32wkc

Telling him about all the Type A personalities who do things for themselves but try to make it look like its for the group and fighting for leadership.

2049330,0,t1_cl09d2q,I feel like theyre shaping the facts to fit the theory.  Josh is currently working on the workshop.  Bri is a menace in the barn so anything that keeps her out is a good thing.  Repackaging coffee doesnt sound like a major time investment in any case.  Aaron does the boot camp twice per week afaik.  The less control he has over the food supply the better.By their own admission they average about three hours of work per day with some doing more and some doing even less.  Its sheer laziness combined with nonsensical structure provided by the producers planting in Autumn for instance or generating gallons of surplus milk that cant be sold that is causing the collective to fail.,UtopiaFOX,cl0bcc0,2,t5_32wkc
2055861,0,t1_cl0deux,No.  This show is hemorrhaging money.  It is not a precedent for cash strapped reality shows AT ALL.,UtopiaFOX,cl158fx,1,t5_32wkc
2063187,0,t3_2ift7i,What is awesome and unique is watching a show fall apart and self destruct on the live feeds. So many of them are sick of it sick of the manual labor sick of the shitty food the bickering and gossiping. A few people do most of the work and the rest sit on their assess all day. How long do you think thatll last?Please please please... I want to see them get cancelled live on the cams. Really it isnt the casts fault. I think poor timing and execution are to blame. If this was a summer show like Big Brother with less competition it could have done well. The bigger problem is the story lines created for the TV show failed to be interesting or unique    typical showmances and following the reality TV playbook. Id be shocked if the show makes it past Halloween.The only way to save this shitshow at this point is to go nuclear.   Exploit them.  There is a goldmine in exploiting the fuck out of these douche bags they could do show after show of them contradicting themselves about how honest they are and then stealing shit  lying  being scum... like Arron SketchyChef saying Im a man of my word and then cut to the video of him hiding the receipt behind a shelf all the crazy shit Bella says that are opposite her actions Bri being a fucking mess x Kristen plotting to be the next Heidi and Spencer because the antagonists get all the air time in her words or mock her for wanting to be a fashion blogger with her hideous scarves big nose and fat ass or a social media expert who deletes emails and cant run a web site. But Kroll doesnt think that makes good TV. Ha ha no one has pointed out that if he knew what made good TV the shows ratings would not be tanking and the show headed for Guinness Book of Most Expensive Failures  sadly typical for television people they all are experts until they fail miserably and publicly. Pandemonium. Destroy the set. Turn off the water. Turn their world upside down. No comforts no Amazon no internet. Make them tough it out. I bet these guys would all walk out the door except for Cal and maybe Ernestol. Finale.... Death match  winner take all including title to the ranch. They all have to hunt and kill each other until theres one sole survivor. Im calling it now the show never returns after the upcoming baseball break. The only question is when the feed will be cut. I expect one day before the end of October they will just disappear the link will be removed for live cams on the Fox web site the cast sent home.,UtopiaFOX,cl22r84,7,t5_32wkc
