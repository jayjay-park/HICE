3248937,0,t1_coymacc,But there more people saying Greg is full of shit. Im guessing there was a dispute more than one and it got to the point where Greg went to far and Jirard showed him the door or made it known if he wanted to leave he could and Greg made it out to him being forced out.I know this all too well because the same thing happened with me and another friend. It being a long friendship just makes people more bitter and more likely to lash out make things difficult which is what hes doing. if he wanted privacy why not really leaveHe knows Jirard has to diffuse things when he can walk away with no repercussions. Yeah Greg seems silly and lighthearted but thats all he ever seemed which to me is more of a fakeness to it than Jirard has.So am I going to believe the person who looks and acts like a real a person or someone who always seems to be putting on an act? ,TheCompletionist,coyreft,0,t5_2vtx6

I personally love the new format of the Completionist and look forward to it every week whereas before it was honestly my least favorite of your shows. It genuinely makes me angry when I see how much hate youre getting right now when all you did was try to make the show more interesting and unique. Especially with the new format youve made something special something very different from any other type of review. I know youve worked your ass off to get there and now that youre there people hate you for being there.
