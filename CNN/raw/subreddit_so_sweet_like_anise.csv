10440325,0,t3_5krhge,Agreed on the nevermore album Loomis is amazing. Opeth is also very good I saw them live with nevermore some years back. Their song blackwater Park is one of my favorites of all time. That tension and release masterful rhythm guitar. Also the live version of their song hope leaves off their in live concert at the royal Albert Hall album damn does that songsolo pull at you. The last solo to hit me like that was the first time I heard floods by Pantera.Edit thanks for reuniting me with that glorious carcass cd. I used to listen to this years ago and had forgotten about it.,so_sweet_like_anise,dcrhklg,2,t5_3htgj
