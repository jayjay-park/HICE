2444293,0,t1_cmd3r7h,Good idea. Dont you think it could maaaybe get a little wonky at corners? Specifically if a  corner has a honeycomb strut run right into its inner corner or whether the struts are symmetric about that corner? Then again I guess a corner being crushed wont necessarily spell the end of most parts. Engineering is fun but it sure gets deep in my brain sometimes,fea,cmdthws,1,t5_2rqj1

4607040,0,t3_3e2obk,Nice read!Im still an amateur at CAD but Im really interested in topology optimization. I think I first read about it when GE was doing that d printed engine bracket contest and Ive been interested ever since.,fea,ctbavdo,2,t5_2rqj1
5610859,0,t3_3rucjm,You can use the RambergOsgood relationship to develop stressstrain curves for your material. The problem with using a bilinear perfectly plastic curve is that you can run into convergence issues. ,fea,cwskxla,1,t5_2rqj1
