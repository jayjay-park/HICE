3746894,0,t1_cqjclyc,Thank you! I get the first draft actually usually the same version that Isaac and Peter get which is basically the first version Brandon shows anyone outside of maybe Emily. Brandon seeds a lot of the ideas into the text just by saying that Shallan sat down and drew suchandso thats how we get the Santhid and the Lait in particular. Weve been really careful about portraits so that why we dont see her drawings of Taravangian or Gaz. Even so theres always more choices than I have pages allowed... though when one of the choices is Shardplate or Chasmfiend its not really a choice at all. Thats usually about six to eight months before we publish though were trying to push it out even more if we can so that we do have more time to develop our concepts. Unfortunately I dont work for Brandon fulltime so I kinda only get to focus on Stormlight during those periods when were on so to speak but Im always itching to do more of it so its never far from my mind. ,imaginarycosmere,cqjddm2,3,t5_344w7
