3882552,0,t1_cqyuavw,I havent seen them on the street personally yet. I have seen trains a mile long full of them though. I have witnessed the drone flying over Tulsa for the last  months. Personally seen the  Blackhawk convoys over the last month. Drove through the WalMart parking lot and personally seen the Tulsa police in full tactical gear carrying ms and shotguns guarding all exits. I have to go over to that side of town in the morning. Ill take pics of WalMart and If I see any of the assault vehicles on the road.,JadeHelm,cqyuetf,1,t5_383vz

4556729,0,t3_3dfamh,Its a travesty of injustice. I went to Sonic. Ordered a single with cheese. No tomatoes. IT HAD TOMATOES ON IT! So obviously Sonic is a NWO shill. Also played some EA Golf  on my PS. Double Bogey on on  at Royal Troon. Ive been totally oppressed by EA Sports. And to top it off my cat upchucked a hairball. Thanks Obama. My life is ruined forever. ,JadeHelm,ct4zv0u,3,t5_383vz
