365504,0,t3_1y9goe,The parts when you are directly talking about the game reactions to dying and whatnot were entertaining enough the problem is when sometimes you kind of went off into a little thing about something completely unrelated like the milk thing around  minutes it just wasnt doing it for me. It felt kind of out of place forced like you were just making noises for the sake of making noises. Id try to just stick with the game related commentary and cut the weird random bits.Otherwise it wasnt bad.,LetsPlayCritiques,cfinefe,1,t5_30ftr
369429,0,t1_cfj19vh,Now that I think about it theres really not a ton  you could add because of the nature of the game.  Maybe just be more expressive in the things that youre already saying rather than the mumble you drop into sometimes.,LetsPlayCritiques,cfj2200,1,t5_30ftr
427482,0,t3_1ytki2,Ok so the first thing that I notice is that Im  minute and  seconds in and literally nothing has happened so far. Its just been menus. That should have been cut out in post production in my opinion. The second thing I notice is that you need to talk more. There is a ton of dead space and the only things Ive really heard is a whole lot of What? Huh? and I dunno what Im doing here. That is not interesting commentary. Youve got to find something to talk about. Talk about whats going on in the game. What are those things attacking? How did they get there? Why do they hate you? Where do you think you are right now? Just anything you can think of. ,LetsPlayCritiques,cfp2nzb,2,t5_30ftr

Your outro is also awesome The only thing I would say you could do better is to be a little more precise when positioning the annotations at the end make sure that they are almost unable to be seen by matching them with the border of the videos.,LetsPlayCritiques,cfvsk0a,3,t5_30ftr

1034165,0,t3_25y5h1,So the AudioVideo quality is great.I felt like you kind of rambled on in the beginning. You should also use different voices for characters dont just read in your regular voice. If you want an example of that you can look at my Superstar Saga series.Also try not to talk too much when characters are talking it drags the scenes out.Keep up the good work!,LetsPlayCritiques,chlu86r,1,t5_30ftr

1517432,0,t3_2bj4i7,Hello there.As always Ill type the feedback as I am watching your video. I think you should get into the game a bit faster. After  minutes you are still looking at the menu. You really want to try to capture the viewer attention in the first minute. I think its nice to see you do something different than all those other Lets Players. Looking up indie games and kind of reviewing them is a great idea. I think that your commentary could use some work though. You talk rather slow and when I listen to you I can hear almost no enthusiasm at all in your voice. I understand that talking over such a fast paced game can be very challenging of course.  Maybe you could profit of doing a script or maybe even doing postcommentary.Thats the problem with those kind of reviewlike videos. They usually just show gameplay and talk over it using postcommentary. You seem to mix up lets playtypecommentary and a reviewlike video which just doesnt really fit together in my opinion. I am aware that other people manage to make entertaining video using exactly that combination but they usually have more experience or manage to pull it off better by having amazingly entertaining commentary.Maybe try playing games with a slower pace first. I think it might be easier for you to commentate on those kind of games and when you have more practice you can come back to those fast paced games.I hope you get what Im trying to say. Sniff,LetsPlayCritiques,cj6hjcr,1,t5_30ftr
1700811,0,t3_2due5s,I enjoyed the extra edits and stuff you added in. This is a personal opinion but I prefer videos where a little extra work as gone into it. For example cutting out bland moments adding music having a running gag ect.The soundvideo quality was good to. My only advice is to keep doing what you are doing.,LetsPlayCritiques,cjtjst1,1,t5_30ftr
1720712,0,t3_2e4mt1,Hey Pandas. I watched your video! I have some notes. You need to work on being interesting. That sounds really harsh but I mean it in the way that most of the video you dont talk about anything. A lot of reaction noises a lot of kinda dull boasting with no real meaning. Its just not that fun to listen to. Pick a topic talk about your feelings on the game design. Anything on your mind.You made a smart decision cutting the bossfight the second time around. The outro music is way louder than you are and it shouldnt really be blasting my ears out haha.Thats about all I had. Overall I think you have a lot of potential.,LetsPlayCritiques,cjw256b,1,t5_30ftr
1730847,0,t1_cjxb0cy,I usually practice talking to myself every day standing in front of a mirror and doing different impressions etc. Also because I play a lot of Rock Band  I sing a lot and this helps my pronunciation and vocal range. Of course you dont need to belt out a microphone and scream into it  just iunno casually sing to yourself. Personally I sing Handlebars by Flobots more rapping than anything and One Week by Barenaked Ladies  if you can sing One Week without faltering youve mastered the art of speech.Of course this doesnt work for everybody. And some people are absolutely tone deaf so its not always an option. Just talk as much as possible. If youre home alone talk to yourself. I know it sounds weird but yknow its practice isnt it?By monotone I mean that you talked with a very limited vocal range  it didnt change a terrible lot. So yeah just express a little more energy. It takes some getting used to  some of our earlier videos were pretty dang terrible because of it  but youll get the hang of it.I look forward to seeing more then!,LetsPlayCritiques,cjxc6bs,1,t5_30ftr

The game was published first for the Xbox in  and the PC version followed in .gtCall of Cthulhu Dark Corners of the Earth combines an actionadventure game with a relatively realistic firstperson shooter as well as with elements of a stealth game The game is based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft author of The Call of Cthulhu and progenitor of the Cthulhu Mythos and in particular the game is a reimagining of Lovecrafts  novella The Shadow over Innsmouth Set mostly in the year  the story follows Jack Walters a mentally unstable private detective hired to investigate a missing person case in Innsmouth a strange and mysterious town that has cut itself from the rest of the United States.gtIn development since  the project was repeatedly delayed going through several revisions and having some of its most ambitious and immersive features abandoned and the initially planned PlayStation  version canceled. Although well received by most critics the final game was a commercial failure. At least two additional Cthulhu Mythos games were planned by Headfirst Productions including a direct sequel titled Call of Cthulhu Destinys End but they were never completed due to Headfirsts failure to find a new publisher and their subsequent bankruptcy.gtgtImage iInteresting Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game | H.

I plan on upgrading to paid at some point in the next year for a few more features but it can do just about anything you need it to do  transitions overlayingadding images overlaying a facecam adjusting video sizes changing clip speed etc etc. The free version defaults to exporting to YouTube p which is prettttttty great for us. and the support forums are AMAZINGLY AMAZING.,LetsPlayCritiques,ckbt3ih,2,t5_30ftr

I have my headset on the youtube profile Its perfect for hearing all youtubers and watching anime and I cant hear a single word youre saying. Matching your volume to an ok standard is important.

2032911,0,t1_cky79sl,Thanks.Yeah Im sure there will be a few cuts here and there but in my other videos I splice in images and slow down time and stuff like that. In another series I am doing multicam and adding background music depending on whats happening and it takes so much longer!The game so far has been pretty good at speaking the story bits for me but if theres ever any important reading to be done Ill be all over that.,LetsPlayCritiques,cky87c0,1,t5_30ftr
2060644,0,t3_2ifc8d,Hey Nickachuu!Firstly the video is great quality and I didnt see any slow down at all so thats awesome your humor is good as well had me smirk a few times so thats great  I will say though I would have probably had this as a setup video rather than a true part one however you noticed the audio was probably going to drown out your commentary and it was! had turned that down half way through as well as changed a few control settings right at the end. It might have been worth recording these first  minutes checking the video out afterwards make the changes needed and then delete the save file as you did before then going for your part . Bare in mind if you want someone to watch a series of yours everything relies on getting their attention in the first few minutes if its not of decent quality they are going to assume the whole series is like that and stop before youre able to make the corrections you need and since the first  minutes of the video are talking about the technical mishaps of the recording you had before thats  of the minutes youve allotted so youre not giving yourself much it mightve been better to put in about fraps extreme bit rate or that you attempted the video before later when there isnt much to say but keep it brief  minutes is a little long and you risk losing audience attention sitting on a menu screen As i said before the humor is good though it might be worth switching the commentary occasionally to the game itself by all means have a few funny moments but talk about the game likes and dislikes what it does well in your opinion. You started doing that when you commented on the batmanesque fighting which it is by loads i noticed! but expand on that then people who are thinking about playing the game can be informed by your video. There was a lot of uhhs and umms to begin with at the start of the video so toy with the idea of post commentary if that would be better for you Im not a fan of it but I know it works for some. If you insist on live commentary though be sure to sound interested and engaged uhh and umms means youre unsure where youre going with what youre saying or doing and you need to make sure you sound like youre enjoying it otherwise its going to bring me down as a viewer or worst case stop the video early.I think ill stop there I hope anything Ive said up there is helpful to you i recommend if you keep having problems with shadowplay to try out bandicam its working well enough for me so far! Best of luck!  x,LetsPlayCritiques,cl1r3vw,2,t5_30ftr

2120366,0,t1_cl9cchw,You got it. I am curious though as to why you needed to amplify it further. A simple normalization at the end with a compression in the middle should bring all the audio to a very audible level.

I had a little problem with background noise and i still struggle to find what works best for me using audacity for the commentary recording. i already took care of the noise level pitched  the game sound sound and the commentary up a bit in the last  videos.Do you have any sugestions for affordable mics that are predestined for this kind of projects?all in all thank you for your feedback I will try to keep as many of it in mind while finalising future videos as possible.,LetsPlayCritiques,clo0o8d,1,t5_30ftr

2444928,0,t3_2nifp8,First up I see in the description that you knew there were a bunch of screams and grunts and accepted that but I think you should try and tone it down a little in future videos. Only because with a group dynamic like you have you could really establish some relationships and bring comedy out of that. Conversation between friends is funny so if you guys can try to communicate frustration or anything like that in words!I actually enjoyed the editing I thought it was pretty funny so thats good stuff. Also I think the video length was perfect. You didnt drag it out past the videos lifespan at all and that made it so much more digestible. I really like that format and it seems like so few people are doing it that way so keep it up! Good first Lets Play!,LetsPlayCritiques,cmdwbjt,1,t5_30ftr
2449880,0,t3_2ngoxb,Gotta say this had me laughing because I never expected to see such a crazy idea in practice actually work and be entertaining. Well done on that aspect!I saw some of your earlier stuff your Sir You Are Being Hunted vid along with others and I really do enjoy your normal commentary and general LP style. However this video even though I was laughing at the start gradually lost my interest because it was kind of ... more of the same? I dont want that to sound offensive in any way. I hope you understand what I mean.Either way youve definitely got the audio and video quality down. The only thing Id say you could improve on would be to carry on putting out videos with more of a focus keep people interested with the commentary etc.,LetsPlayCritiques,cmeibtl,1,t5_30ftr

2614897,0,t3_2pp6nm,Hello! I have quite a few comments so hold onto your butts. Your intro was not punchy enough for a first episode. We would go there for the game looking up something like Metroid Prime Part  and we have you faffing around with old save files. You have to grab us with the start of the video. You could have cut so much of that and spend those minutes showcasing actual gameplay. You didnt even finish the tutorial. Though I agree with Louis CKs view on the word faggot there was very little commentary about the game for a long while. Its fine to go off topic but you have to centre yourselves around the content the game! otherwise its just background noise. Are you using audio ducking? If you are please dont. If you are not then somethings up. The way the game sound drops and then lurches up after each sentence is really distracting. It doesnt feel natural whatsoever. Also the game sound when you are not speaking is a tad too high. Ditch the ducking and just reduce the overall game audio in post. There are moments when you dont talk. Around the minute mark for example. All we are seeing is you aiming at things so the action isnt taking our attention so your commentary has to. I get one of you is playing and is maybe concentrating pretty hard but the other one has to pick up the slack. Who are you? You didnt introduce yourselves remember this is Part  and you will get new viewers for sure here. And which one of you is playing? Are you taking turns? We need context. Your audio quality voicewise is actually very good. So good job on the mic and setup. Then again there was that time one of you touched the microphone. That bit was horrible. There was a cough. These things are almost unavoidable but if theres any way you could edit that out in future videos please do so. They sound so much worse through a microphone than they do in real life. You mock the graphics of a game that was released on the GameCube back in . This game is over a decade old. What did you expect?Other comments Your channel is called Pantsless Grandpas but your actual URL is BoykoMix. Im not sure if you can still do it but if theres a way to change your vanity URL to a more appropriate one I would suggest you do it. Your channel banner is not seen fully  when viewed on a mobile or when I hover over your avatar on a desktop. The Pan of Pantsless gets covered by your channel icon.I hope that gives you stuff to think about for your next few episodes!,LetsPlayCritiques,cmzwlei,1,t5_30ftr
2616655,0,t1_cn040db,Its really simple and pretty clean. Thats a good thing. I think the black on white thumbnails look better than the white on black. I think the idea is cool but it just isnt eye catching. Especially the white on black stuff. For some reason those just look harsh. Im not really sure why.Maybe do something like Dick Figures does. The figures have a little color. Itll be a little more eye catching and defined.,LetsPlayCritiques,cn04vnv,1,t5_30ftr
2646197,0,t3_2q89m1,Hey fellow newbie!I liked your vids a lot for a first time LP. Your commentary was entertaining and I  never really felt that strange awkward vibe that most new people have. I could tell that you really didnt start feeling really comfortable until a little into the part but it wasnt awkward in the slightest. Eventually youll fill up some of the dead space in the beginning of the video as you become more comfortable with LPs in general.Dont be so hard on yourself when you fuck up. It happens. You dont need to say you suck or if youre trying o be funny. convey it in a more goofy way. Fuck ups happen in lets plays all the time. Keep rolling with the punches though.Also dont feel obligated to rush through things. I sensed just a tiny little bit of that. Its ok if you want to keep the audience engaged but dont do it to the point where your ingame performance could be better. But like I said I only sensed that a tiny bit.I think youre already great commentary wise just make your channel more aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Make channel art set up sections for your channel and make your twitter accessible from your front page. Aesthetics can captivate an  audience before they even look at your vids.I dont have much else today because Im new myself but I have a lot of faith in your videos and think you could be a very successful LPer .

It sounded like you were bored playing the game because whenever you exhaled it felt like you were sighing. I liked the blood story because I am in to that kind of stuff it really felt like you were interacting with the view which is a plus in my head. I also saw your most recent Duke Nukem D and I found it entertaining. The only part that was not was when you were struggling to open the door you should have cut that part out and jumped to the next one.Overall I want to keep my videos around  minutes so that new viewers will not feel overwhelmed when they watch my content Which I have no of at the moment But your videos lengths are fine if they work for you.Keep up the good work!,LetsPlayCritiques,cnly2pe,1,t5_30ftr

You might want to go offline when playing the game dunno if you Steam friends would be okay with their own special appearance in your Lets Play when they sign on.. You may want to try and paraphrase your explanations more. You would probably make your videos much shorter if you kept your commentary to the point.. When there is action make sure to focus on that! I liked a lot of your video but there was dull moments which will happen in a Lets Play but I think the whole length could have been reduced.Overall I give it my thumbs up ,LetsPlayCritiques,co4cofa,1,t5_30ftr

3517762,0,t3_30iysr,The opening was a bit too long for my taste I was just sitting here like Any second now... but at like  seconds Ive already gotten impatient. It didnt really feel energized either like hey we do stuff what stuff are we doing? in a flat voice. Something with energy is going to hold me a bit longer. I personally treat my videos like everyone watching them has ADHD but then again I have no intro either just dive right into the game.Speaking of diving right into the game it was over two and a half minutes before we got to see anything besides the copyright screen. Are we playing TMNT or Copyright Enforcement Simulator? If anything I wouldve had it sit on the title screen. I seem to recall that game having a demo mode so if anything you can let it run or loop the title screen. Just give me something other than legalese words to keep my attention.Good job on making a notation of the UK name on the series. However minor it does show youve done a little research. Ive always been a fan of trivia being given.Im typing this up as I go through the video but I wanted to make a specific note that just looking at the video length Im kinda turned off. Maybe set a length and finish the level youre in?  A break will give me a moment to rest my mind since the game is repetitive. You dont necessarily need an outro for each individual video if you split it up and call it a longplay series.Currently at the Technodrome elevator I took note of a few things I wouldve done. You are naming out the bosses which is good but I was bothered that you only referred to Metalhead as M. Head. I know that its what came on the screen there but still. Ive always been a fan of making sure people know what Im against because there are a lot of people watching that maybe only grew up with the  or even the current version and I have a wild hunch that some characters dont make a reappearance in those. But thats just me being nitpicky.Regarding the Rat King discussion there was some research failure there. He wasnt just a homeless guy they started beating up His goal was to return the world to the rats removing humans from power. He also was fairly intelligent being able to make various chemical mixes such as one to turn people into rats..  And yes Splinter had been controlled by him once I think maybe even in the first episode he was introduced. Maybe you addressed that in your podcast I dont know Im just looking over this video.Just started the train level and I dont have anything to say you did wrong. You two have a lot of energy while playing and the jokes are great. Youve shared some of the outside experiences youve had with the series and I love anybody that does that.Finished. That energy I talked about just disappeared after the game ended. It may have come from the weariness of length? The outro seemed to be a bit longer than necessary too.I just wanted to note that the end card gave me a headache from the flickering. That might be something you should consider adjusting especially with regards to viewers with epilepsy.If I remove all of my nitpicks that was a good video. Maybe some tweaks to the audio input. How did you record it? You mentioned running an emulator but you addressed the bit of glare early on I thought it was my new monitor for a moment! but how did you get glare? Were you recording through a camera? If you were using an emulator cart that fits into the SNES and its plugged into a TV and you plan to do this a lot I would consider a capture card. If it was just on your computer theres plenty of recording options. Though I will say if you were recording through a camera you did really well on getting me thinking it was actually via capture!,LetsPlayCritiques,cpt91rk,1,t5_30ftr
3522703,0,t3_30buph,Nice I do like the sound of Cure Well!I didnt know which particular video you wanted feedback on so I chose the latest in your Golden Sun series. You audio all seems to be at a good level some people might be turned off by burping though others love it. Theres very little editing needed for this especially if youre doing a full playthrough but I liked how you fast forwarded and narrated over one of the more repetitive puzzles as this really helps keep the audience engaged. You seem very down to earth and have a sense of humour keep it up! One thing I would say is that you seem to have uploaded ALOT of videos recently for Golden Sun. Schedule your videos if you cant be around to publish one that day or save some of them   a day or at most  a day to let them land and give yourself the opportunity to advertise them.Just my thoughts  Cardinal Smith,LetsPlayCritiques,cpttat7,1,t5_30ftr

Personally Ive always hated those because of the stupid autoplay and I figured most other people are like meAlso can you elaborate on the intro?

4016346,0,t3_36hcpp,It seems like you pointed out the some things that do need to be worked on audio is the biggest one for me. Also the webcam shaking thing was pretty odd and it was kind of distracting sometimes. I would maybe either not use that just so that stops or try using a different program that may not do that.,LetsPlayCritiques,cre3e1l,1,t5_30ftr
4062848,0,t3_372b9j,Well I can say that your audio sounds pretty good and you have a very good speaking voice.

When watching the Call of Duty Ghosts video through the website it displays as if its in d mode but when I click through to YouTube it displays in regular. There are no options that I can see that allow me to turn that off so thats a very interesting phenomenon. Its also the only video in the list that acts like that.

4262208,0,t3_39se7o,Hey DiMartino as a viewer your channel trailer was uhm how do I say this too explosive to the ears like it just blasted sound. I suggest having a fade to it or something plus your reaction cam should use a little filter because the camera looks pale compared to the game which is colorful or whatever depending on the game. More power to your youtube channel DiMartino!  ,LetsPlayCritiques,cs62i87,1,t5_30ftr
4374072,0,t1_csh25ba,Well personally I dont think I would necessarily agree with that.New doesnt have to mean bad on YT.

4546384,0,t1_ct3or65,Fair enough but thank you for the subscription nonetheless. And if there is a game youd like to see me play feel free to leave a comment and it will definitely be considered for either a oneoff video or a challenge video. ,LetsPlayCritiques,ct3p4ac,1,t5_30ftr
4629094,0,t1_ctdeh81,right now Im in the process of making a new channel. My old channel TheGamerTheyCallKeith wasnt all that great. my editing was atrocious my commentary stale and tended to drift off into silence and my artwork for thumbnails and profile were really amateur. The name is also rather generic and doesnt stand out plus a ton of other people have channels with the same or similar name so.... It never really went anywhere or got any views so I decided to make another channel and start fresh.Thanks for the offer tho ,LetsPlayCritiques,cte2gyi,1,t5_30ftr
4776063,0,t3_3g7o5r,Watched the Outlast and Final Fantasy X videos. The editing is really good but a lot of awkward and forced sexual humor. When you were actually commenting on the game itself it was fairly enjoyable so I seriously do think if you dropped some of the forced humor itd be legit. With that said The first  minutes of idea is pretty cool but I feel like it should be poking fun at the gimmicks and goofyness of these games.  ,LetsPlayCritiques,ctwkcrq,1,t5_30ftr
4852592,0,t3_3hclkj,The commentary itself seems good in general so I wont touch that for now. Just some thoughts on other components The intro is very long. Check out the google suggestions regarding content hooking upfront in a video. A long intro can hurt your ability to get people to get to the actual content. I might have missed it but vocally ask people to like and subscribe. Also if you can help them do that in the outro even better! Overall I really like it though. Great job!Cheers.Edit for clarity I watched Titan souls part ,LetsPlayCritiques,cu67egt,2,t5_30ftr
4876058,0,t3_3hlqvs,Excellent commentary. Your channel promo thing earned my subscription. Honestly I love your very short intro and I think the art style is charming but you need to redo it at a higher resolution and use some shadowing to distinguish the boundaries of the faces from everything else. Also simplify it. Start taking features away until its really frikkin easy to draw. For gods sake my mascot is a series of blue lines Again shading around the edges and streamlining those designs will do wonders for you. Also run your overlay through the pencil outline effect a couple times. Then paint bucket it purple again with varying tolerance until it looks right. This gives it a nice border shadow. Aside from that you guys are incredible. Excellent potential. Probably the best duo Ive seen on reddit and Im in a duo. Keep it up.,LetsPlayCritiques,cu95z1g,1,t5_30ftr

4939588,0,t3_3ijs8z,Hey man!First of all I love the choice of music you used. Cowboy Bebop and Bleach soundtracks are great! I used Bleach music in a couple videos myself.Second the intro was nice but I felt that you could have just used the second one since with both of them it took  seconds to get into the actual video.Lastly I felt that you could do with a bit more energy but the laid back style you have going on seems to suit you aswell. Ive left a comment on your video  subs doing well mate. Keep it up ,LetsPlayCritiques,cuh6atp,1,t5_30ftr
4947920,0,t1_cuhlkld,Although your keyboard should not be your biggest worry if you are planning to switch keyboards for lets play I recommend the Cooler Master Novatouch keyboard. It is still a mechanical keyboard but with the topre keys it is a lot quieter and ALMOST has the same feeling. I have it and I use it consistently. If you want to get the quietest keyboard then any membrane keyboard will do.And no this is not a sponsor... Although I wouldnt mind if they did but this is through my own experience and I thought this might give you some ideas if you wanted to change.,LetsPlayCritiques,cui84rk,1,t5_30ftr
5023141,0,t3_3jq9xw,Hey!Right off the bat I think one of the most important parts of any multiplayer LP is to make sure that the audio of the people involved is sort of... equalized. I know that Ive run into problems with this before in my own LPs. Taking a few minutes beforehand to make some test recordings and adjustments will help make sure that everyone has the same mic volume. I cant pinpoint who it is but one of the people in your group seems to be using a headset mic with a crackling issue. Im not sure how to fix that without getting a new one. But either way getting everyone on the same volume and audio quality level will help a lot.I think that youve got a silly approach to gaming and I enjoy it. It seems lighthearted and you certainly arent taking yourself superseriously which is awesome to see! It makes it more friendly and accessible! I think that style is working.I think something that may help keep a running theme in your multiplayer episodes is to make a battle plan. Spitball a few ideas with your friends about what you may want the theme of the episode to be and although forcing it is always a bad idea you can steer towards that theme in conversation and action and then edit it later so that the whole experience seems more unified. If youre taking hours of footage and making it  minutes long that should make it MUCH easier! That way you dont have to make it cohesive in post you have an idea of what clips to hone in on!I think my only other critique is the endcard. You have this light almost s kind of music going on in the background the whole video and then the endcard happens and theres just... silence. And for almost  seconds which is a pretty long endcard to begin with. I think finding some more royaltyfree music to put in there may help end the video with enthusiasm! And putting an annotation around your subscribe message can help make sure people dont think twice and click right into your page!I hope that helped! You earned a sub and like from me! Keep it up!,LetsPlayCritiques,curhaa2,1,t5_30ftr

5139050,0,t3_3lcvn2,I liked it you clearly spent alot of time putting it together and I think your voiceover bit at the start and finish was spot on! Because this is a critique thread Ill leave some critique if you want haha IDK Some of the clips used were a little too quick amp needed some background information on what was happening Ive often made an error like this where I cut too rapidly amp because I know what the buildup is I look at it in that way. Possibly only use clips that are at least  seconds long I felt like those clips were the ones that had a buildup a funny bit and then conclusion. Hope this makes some kind of sense? E.g. There was one bit which was about  seconds long where you just said dicks or something I felt like it didnt fit in at all. But the extended bits I enjoyed amp felt belonged.The audio quality on the mics distorted when people yelled into it for the middle section it might just be poor quality mics that your friends have? Not too sure your narration audio quality was superb.Lastly and this may sound odd... I loved your outro amp it was confident. However the visual part of it please consider subscribing seemed desperate. It would take  seconds to fix it so that it matches your confident voice etc. Dont take this as offence! I know its tough to broach likes comments amp subscribe in a video! pPerhaps instead have Hit subscribe if you enjoyed or something shorter but similar. Its the path Ive taken which avoids desperation but still has a strong call to action that is polite amp sometimes funny. I personally use things such as subscribe your handsome jawline if you enjoyed the video in my audio narration amp am leaning away from any subscribe related text messages. I prefer like message goals at the end of my videos and my outro has a large sub button that is annotated as a hotlink. Just my  cents well done on the trailer! Im impressed amp youve done a great job! Im just trying to help you make it even better so hopefully you understand that mate. People get hella salty on here so its better to describe your intentions with critique or risk a shitstorm haha! D,LetsPlayCritiques,cv5g4tr,1,t5_30ftr
5196716,0,t1_cvcd0wr,Yeah I agree. Got a suggestion above about exactly that. Going to implement it in the next video Btw cant do F because Ive got a  screen setup so everything has to be windowed.,LetsPlayCritiques,cvcebzp,2,t5_30ftr

5233094,0,t3_3modw8,Seems like a hard game to commentate on with Deadpool breaking the fourth wall the whole time he talks more than Spidey!. Entertaining and I liked the editing only negative for me is that it was quite hard to hear your voice over the game sound sometimes.,LetsPlayCritiques,cvgs11v,1,t5_30ftr
5292421,0,t3_3nf944,So I skimmed through your video and the biggest issue I saw as many people have pointed out already is your audio however as it is your first video I do not see it as too much of a setback. Because the very first videos we everyone within my channel had the crappiest audio. But you learn as you go along.My suggestion is that you go and download audacity and use that to exclusively record your commentary audio. The audio withstanding great video!

5478810,0,t1_cwbmk41,Didnt even realize I moved around at the beginning Im not even sure why I did it to be honest. Keyboard thing is gonna have to be worked on. I may try to figure out some form of muffling because I completely agree its so damn loud. but I dont have any other options as far as keyboards right now So I will try to find a towel to either put over my hands or under the keyboard to keep sound from reverberating off my desk. Voice clipping I am trying to work on mainly cause I have a Yeti so Im still trying to find that sweet spot where my audio doesnt clip and I dont sound like a mouse As far as volume is concernedDialogue wise I am trying to not clip as much in my videos mainly because I did that at the beginning of my channel and it formed some really bad habits as far as actually speaking during gameplays so its more like me trying to keep myself engaged with the audience versus just cutting out a bunch of stuff. In other words I agree I was literally trying to keep myself talking the whole time so that when I do long plays I am able to do it properly without  cuts throughout. Thank you so much for taking a look and giving me some much needed feedback man. ,LetsPlayCritiques,cwbyw6v,1,t5_30ftr
5626339,0,t3_3s50pj,Hey good video at its core but theres a lot you can do to make this even better.  First off  minutes is an eternity this should be like  or  episodes worth of time.  Secondly try and cut moments where nothing is really happening or is just not all that interesting.  For example on my videos Ill start with  minutes of footage and end up with an  minute video including my introoutro.  Thirdly do an introoutro with you people arent coming for the game they want to see you and hear you.  So keep the intros sweet and short.  Say hi explain what youre doing in a few sentences transition to the video.  For the outro thank everyone for watching and close the episode however you wish for ex I will see you in the next video buh bye which is what markiplier does.  Do those things and your videos will soar.  By the way if youd like an example of what Im talking about in action just take a look at this  this is my latest happy wheels video and I do introoutro and did a fair job of editing.  Give it a look and good luck with the channel you have a lot of potential.,LetsPlayCritiques,cwui1nr,1,t5_30ftr

Putting a greenscreen would also limit my ability to move around in that room at the moment xD. I am subtly learning to vastly improve on my photoshop knowledge hopefully to get much better at it soon! I will definitely be looking at a major overhaul on my thumbnails as well as my channel art.

5958378,0,t3_3wposx,I was confused ... I think I figured out why.You must have accidentally linked to your Spiders Spikes and Squishy Things video. My critique below was for that. I think you meant to link to this,LetsPlayCritiques,cy0oa1z,2,t5_30ftr
6017814,0,t3_3xrgmp,I always enjoy some fallout so I will try to be unbiased. Try talking more about what is going on where you are going and a little more animation in your voice. Not loud and crazy some people head this way when you say animated. Quality is good audio levels good. Last dont leave pauses longer than a certain time. For me I try keyword try to not have it longer than  seconds. ,LetsPlayCritiques,cy8gm7b,2,t5_30ftr
6142221,0,t3_3zo5d3,I watched roughly to  of the video. Theres quite a few problems. Not to be harsh. Your voice isnt excited which concerning the game makes sense but you dont exactly sound interested either. You sound bored which will make the viewer bored. I dont understand the use of a facecam. It the  minutes I watched it didnt add anything to the game and just seem to obstruct the view. Your commentary is very basic and superficial. Your small little jokes dont feel natural and dont seem to be delivered with any enthusiasm which makes them not really funny and more of an annoyance since it seems like youre saying them just to say them. Its kinda easy to see the kind of guys you were inspired by because you sound more like them than someone with their own style. The commentary about the game itself could be deeper with thoughts on the story and whats going on. You dont react to the game much but just say one or two things about the screen youre on. Which makes it hard to stay interested as well. The game has some goofy moments and tries to be really sad but you dont react to either of those things with the commentary or video. You seem to be just starting out though. Most of these problems plague beginners. So keep at it and youll settle into a style that fits you and become more relaxed and comfortable with the game and getting it to sound more interesting. Just work on some things. And remember that no matter what you can always improve. As a side note it was hard to tell but the video quality of the game seemed to be really low. At least the text looked a little too pixelated but its hard to tell if that was just the game or how you recorded it.  ,LetsPlayCritiques,cynt1dj,1,t5_30ftr
6150999,0,t3_3zstjy,Its actually really good and you two play off each other well. The only problems I can really see are maybe you two taking attention away from the game somewhat which depending on when can be annoying. The two of you not getting super involved in the story may potentially be a problem but its hard to say for sure from what I watched And the two of you being new and having a long video. I think you should keep the long videos but also add in like small gateway videos to the channel. Like quick  or  minute looks at games or gameplays or something just to make it slightly more accessible. Only other thing I would suggest is making a few side videos apart from your main stuff where itd just one of you so your audience can get to know you guys. Saying all that though its pretty minor problems that are easily fixed and everything you did was good and fun to watch. Im not sure how long itll hold peoples attention but it definitely didnt make me want to close out of the video at any point and I was genuinely interested. A little more in the game than you two but thats alright. Its a good video,LetsPlayCritiques,cyosyxx,1,t5_30ftr
6179058,0,t3_405lbz,A few tips. For a post like this its easier if you write a little more so we know what to be looking for. Also you linked your channel not the video so I just looked at your most recent one Undertale Part  I think I skipped around once or twice but only about a minute each and during cutscenes In the video I watched there was only one cut which wasnt noticeable really or obtrusive at all. Until you mentioned it. Saying like a quick sorry for the cut is fine or if you have a story for why the cut thats entertaining thats fine too but saying something about it then sating it because you have a life is a little condescending towards your viewers even if you didnt mean for it to come across that way and makes it very noticiable. Especially when it wasnt beforehand. Your voice acting was something odd too. As in your voice didnt really change when you did it. You added a few quirks but it still wasnt very varied. Which is also fine but again you called attention to it that made me notice it. Also reading the text in a game like this is very polarizing in of itself. Some people like it others dont and some it depends on the quality or if it adds anything. For you at least to me reading the text didnt add much except make me feel like the video was longer because of the pauses you make in your speech. Your general commentary also was a bit off. Like it didnt seem to interesting and you didnt really say too much about the game or reactions to it other than what was happening on the screen. Which is okay sometimes but if done to much can become annoying. I dont think you did it to that level but it was definitely notable. As a whole the video wasnt bad by any means. And I think you did a good job. But it can be improved too and made better and more entertaining. The voice acting either has to go all the way or dial backed on and you have to stop calling out attention to the behind the scenes stuff unless youre gonna actually talk about it. And you need a little more to actually talk about. Just keep that stuff in mind and youll improve quickly. Again it wasnt a bad video at all so keep it up man. ,LetsPlayCritiques,cyrztdd,1,t5_30ftr

6250298,0,t3_416niw,First thing I can think of is pay attention to the sound a little bit more. Use a compressor then lower the gain a little because there were a few times where your voice hit the red in your audio and made it just sound not good.I cant tell if this was scripted. If it was do a few more takes to get rid of some of the instances where you forget what your line is. If youre adlibbing its good but Id still edit it down. Do a whole BUNCH of jokes then clip out the ones that dont work and keep the ones that do.,LetsPlayCritiques,cz03azu,1,t5_30ftr

6575890,0,t3_45m35a,I know this game fairly well and you are currently at stage  am of the game if im not mistaken. Unlike  percent of the people on youtube most doesnt know the game and sometimes a brief introduction on how the game works will prevent confusion for some viewers. I know you are just cutting out the best parts but sometime putting in an explanation run down on how the game works would be quite pleasant for people who has no clue how the game works. Some even do it on each consequtive parts of a games video to have a recap for newer viewers.,LetsPlayCritiques,czzi1sk,1,t5_30ftr

6852039,0,t3_49m1ny,Im very biased against the whole Two Best Friends Play intro style so I cant really judge that properly.  Your commentary seemed pretty consistent earlier on although it seemed to die down considerably by the second stage. You may want to record shorter videos instead of mass recording.  The video cuts off abruptly at the end. It might be a good idea to do a quick outro something like saying See you all next time no need for a fancy outro card.  Your audio had a pretty nice balance so that both you and the game could be heard. Game audio could be a bit lower although its not really a problem.  ,LetsPlayCritiques,d0szj9s,2,t5_30ftr

Face cam up bros!Thumbnails are tricky for any series I find if Im sticking with a series for a while I will make one thumbnail then make small changes depending on the episode.Lastly the commentary felt a little boring and drug out. Make it pop and catchy.Hope this helps.,LetsPlayCritiques,d12cmp7,1,t5_30ftr
6951864,0,t1_d14bb76,The trailer you guys have put up is very heartwarming and Its great to see another married couple doing this. The handdrawn crayon look you have to your banner is very humanizing and easy to relate to. You guys are super recent by the look of it so Im guessing thats why you dont have a logo up in your profile picture yet but be sure to work on that if you arent already.The only real criticism I have is that it isnt immediately clear that you guys are a gaming channel. Im not sure if you have plans for other content but I would work in some more visual cues and verbal hints to clearly state that your channel is primarily for LPs.Hope that helps. Were looking for some feedback too if youve got a spare moment.,LetsPlayCritiques,d14bqy8,1,t5_30ftr

7076068,0,t3_4chs5a,I had to watch this as I am in the middle of recording a series of the original Doom. I noticed that I concentrated so hard while playing the game I couldnt commentary at all with it. I overdubbed after the game play for the first time ever. I havent released the series yet but you may want to. It is too much like watching someone else play the game instead of you doing a commentary on it. Great choice of games though.,LetsPlayCritiques,d1ifpne,2,t5_30ftr

7299760,0,t3_4fd2nu,Video qualitys good. The audios alright youre quiet during loud parts of the game and you do a good job at trying to keep the flow going. Id move the mic a bit closer but thats the audio geek in me.The webcam needs a little work on. Try cropping out some of the dead space on the left side and center yourself more. Also look into some lighting if you have the money.On a personal nitpick Id play with your tags a bit. Theyre not bad but always experiment with them until something clicks.Keep workin hard man youre doing good work!,LetsPlayCritiques,d27xln3,1,t5_30ftr

7533229,0,t3_4i7479,Hey! I really think you should set up some intros and outros to each video. Even though it is a continuation of play that you have recorded have a timer up for  minutes so when you know an episode is going to endstart you could say so while recording. Thats just massively personal for me though I dont like videos that go straight into game play with no intro or anything.I like the annotations made during the gameplay! Its quite funny however you only do it a couple of times?? I think you could do with more annotations for comical effect. Apart from that its a decent lets play iron out that audio and youll be golden D,LetsPlayCritiques,d2yhor8,1,t5_30ftr

7745593,0,t3_4lbtqp,Hope you dont mind me being real harsh. You sound so try hard the whole time I know Im biased cause I much prefer when the jokes are natural but it being the nature of commentary post recording these jokes are just so contrived. The who wants to smell ashes part was real cringy for me benny hill trashcan part was kind of overdone the suh dude cops out to get me n shit kind of talking got real lame but I was digging the small jokes john cena and such.I think the content is going to be far better if you just make commentary as you play it wont sound like youre acting so much if you do all the things that you find funny in the moment. Audio and visuals were good the intro was abrupt I wouldve prefered something of you in the beginning rather than just the game for a minute the outro was nice tho. Just my opinion hope it helps hearing it from this perspective. ,LetsPlayCritiques,d3mm8uq,1,t5_30ftr
7760332,0,t1_d3o8h3j,Huh funny thing. I just noticed the audio levels on my microphone on my OS were at  and the format was at CD quality and not DVD. As for recording Audio in audacity and footage simultaneously in OBS I definitely need to try that it could rectify this entire issue Ive been having.

Fun Fact you can roll through the swampy swampy goo you dont have to quick step though I noticed its slightly faster but itll fuck with your Pyro Build  I dropped a sub you guys got me to chuckle so ill stick around. I dont know if you got it but in the last area theres a second Pyro ring and some other nice stuff chilling out near the crabs. The ring is off the Crab nearest to the Pyro Tome and it does give a pretty decent boost to your pyromancies. The Greencrest shield is also over there and that can be super useful gives stamina regen. Hope these small tips help!,LetsPlayCritiques,d3q6hpl,1,t5_30ftr

Most of my LP episodes tend to run pretty long Especially Gungeon those are often  minutes but with DS I plan on keeping things around  minutes wherever I find a good stopping point.

7894396,0,t3_4nfa70,it seems like your mic and game audio are stuck together. It would be nice to not hear some background audio during scenes with no talking but its not so bad that it would make me close the video. Most of the video feels like youre holding back. Maybe out of apprehension of others hearing you or because of others sleeping. Id much rather hear the full voice with no inhibitions.Other than that jokes were decent. Not  but I found myself genuinely laughing at a couple spots. it almost has a Dunkey feel to it but with way more concern. ,LetsPlayCritiques,d43ejpp,1,t5_30ftr
7894461,0,t3_4ne9ee,American criticism. The mic quality isnt so hot but wind always ruins that. Instruments too.  As well the use of a phonemobile mic means a lack of bass quality. I personally love bass in voices so this is a big detractor for me. The music fit very well though and those parts were well balanced. The video quality is good enough for this kind of vid but a little higher would be cool. The last bit I can think of is maybe check out a thesaurus for different variations on the descriptor of good. You used that word a lot and I think changing it up to great phenomenal exotic amazing tasty...  and other adjectives may help a little. Other than that I liked the view into the foods from a different city. The music fits and the overall vibe stays the same throughout. Good vid D ,LetsPlayCritiques,d43et5a,2,t5_30ftr

You had one for your outro so it would just look normal ,LetsPlayCritiques,d4g7pi3,2,t5_30ftr

If people know about Isaac they will know why the video is so long so I dont think Ill be cutting my videos in segments cause I feel thats just more unbearable with Isaac.

A lot of times one or both of you get kind of mumbly or trail off so its hard to understand what youre saying.You also mentioned raging and slamming controllers. I personally enjoy rage in LPs so it would have been nice to seehear.Overall you guys have good energy and good flow between the two of you. More conversation would be nice but that could be just a personal preference. The best thing is that it sounds like the two of you are having fun. Keep up the good work!,LetsPlayCritiques,d58w5vg,2,t5_30ftr

8336032,0,t3_4tq9us,If your gonna do something like a vlogreview like these you gotta get yourself on camera man. I think this is pretty important as it makes the video much more engaging for the viewer and makes you much more than just a voice.I get that you cut around to show certain points you make and this is not one continuous take for your review. Because this is all post production you could cut between you saying things the game and other things. I just think an editing style where you regularly cut between video is much more entertaining.I dont know if you use a script or not it seems like it but I would also put more work into rehearsing and doing retakes of your lines. Especially since this is a post production voice over on the game. I would prepare a script of what your going to say and then work from there. And for the voice work just do it in segments or sentences. If you dont like how you said anything you could just do it over again.I think this would also help being more succinct with your material. You could easily cut down alot of things you say to short and sweet sentences that nail home your point. There are often pauses or times you take to think about what you say. If you remove these pauses and rehearse every segment of your review I think it would be much better. ,LetsPlayCritiques,d5jk49s,2,t5_30ftr

8415214,0,t1_d5s3vp2,First of all im not sure if it is a good or bad thing that it wasnt a totally blind play through. i played through the first two levels when the game came out.  Secondly I completely agree with you on the channel intro building a brand and having people to know what im all about is something Im going to focus on. Secondly i was trying to say B.A.M.F which is the abbreviation of Bad  Mother  which is something that I should nt have tried to say. Im trying to avoid cursing I do plenty of it in my normal life but its not always necessary to show rage and could isolate people needlessly people who are religiousyoungeror more conservative I might change in the future but for now thats my plan. Thirdly I dont know if I could change your mind about subscribing if I told you that the Volgarr the Viking Videos are only going up while im on vacation. I had just finished my first play through and I needed something to post while I was away. I should be starting a new series sometime next week.Thank you for the great feedback. Reddit is a great environment to learn in because people know what they want to see. Im still experimenting with style  I originally wanted to make longer unedited videos but I think ill wait until my performing ability is good enough.  ,LetsPlayCritiques,d5tg1cx,2,t5_30ftr

Couple things I would suggest but most are completely based on my preferences. Do a small intro  seconds  Id just like to know who you are what youre doing and what game your playing. Maybe look into getting a quieter mouse I heard a lot of clicks I can link you to the mouse I use if youd like its incredibly comfortable and quiet.

8457125,0,t1_d5yn9mx,Thanks for the review! I played the game long enough to not freak out hard when something is happening since I dont want to be overdramatic  overexaggerate Since this is Episode  I just assume that they should go watch Episode  and or it really is for my returning viewers itll be impossible to recap for someone who is just watching  example if someone like you were to see Episode  I wouldnt be surprised if you were a bit lost. Kinda like how you cant start a TV SHOW at Episode  and understand what is going on entirely  And or makes them watch Episode  . Just my opinion but for really confusing moments during the game Ill try to add some commentary to let them know what is going on.

If you want to try and appeal to a larger audience maybe consider doing an intro to runescape sort of video? You might even be able to work the loot unboxing into that too.That said the audio seems to cut out and I dont think it has anything to do with the jump cuts. Overall a solid effort just jumping in.

8991451,0,t3_53f9dh,Ive been seeing a spike in Dark Souls  from smaller YouTubers and like Ive said before its not a bad thing you just have to have something else to bring to the table with it.  Be funny be unique talk about gameplay in a different sense do something different you know?  I like that youre trying to branch off into a ragefunny compilation of sorts but I dont think youve hit that point.You say that its a rage montage but wheres the rage?  Most of the time its you staring silently at the screen and reacting with slightly vulgar language again not a bad thing but repetitive.Your editing skills arent terrible but if youre planning on doing a montage or a compilation youll need to really cut into the deeper parts of a playthrough where you actually have those moments.  This video is a lets play straight forward and to the point and while it isnt necessarily boring its similar to a lot of other Dark Souls  gameplays Ive seen.I realize I came off as harsh here but sometimes to really nit pick at things you have to get down to the bare bones of what the issue is.  The video isnt bad by any sense but beware of what youre labeling or promoting it as.  You have some decent commentary though it seemed like every other word was a curse word and you called every monster Sonsofbitches.As I try to state in every comment I dont want to seem like Im telling you how to run your channel or your videos.  Perhaps your content just isnt for me maybe there are others who enjoy what youre bringing to the table.  Either way keep doing what youre doing to make the content that you want and dont let anyone else tell you that its bad because I hope you havent thought of this as such.,LetsPlayCritiques,d7smtyn,2,t5_30ftr

9263049,0,t3_576sh3,I really liked the video you shared and I like the channel as a whole but I would say you should play some more one off series. Like small indie games or something because it seems the only games you are playing are big games that take multiple parts to finish which I think turns some people off. From my experience most people like to see the small one off games because they dont want to have to have the commitment of watching  episodes of Alan Wake if they just wanted to waste a little time. If youre looking for some small free indie games I would try itch.io Alpha Beta Gamer or Game Jolt just to name a few. Other than that no real problems here!,LetsPlayCritiques,d8q5ovd,2,t5_30ftr

Id probably go for reducing the game over increasing your commentary volume too much just because it sounded like the game was loud over you being quiet. But audio quality was good so no complaints there. I agree with DJNana that it is a difficult game to do commentary over I definitely found that out too. But you should definitely stick with it youre doing well to fit in with the dialogue as you go along and itll probably be something you get more used to as you go along The video length was good wed got to the end before I even realised haha.

9421662,0,t3_59onw7,Okay Ill be as honest as possible. The whole intro part was way too long in my opinion but it was nice. The editing is nice. The commentary is actually pretty entertainingso you guys have that going for you. Game Grumps  Two Best Friends esque but more leaning on the second. So basically overall its pretty good. You just gotta work on your transitions and youre all good. Also I was curious how many subs do you have? Your subs dont show publicly. Anyways dudes goodluck!,LetsPlayCritiques,d9a9e7a,1,t5_30ftr
9439503,0,t3_59ypyu,Getting Spiderman to move straight away is a good strategy for grabbing attention. Im going to have to start using it as well.On the other hand you  talked over Spiderman and then said how great the dialogue is.,LetsPlayCritiques,d9ciux8,2,t5_30ftr
9525385,0,t1_d9aaff9,He does. One of em wiped his most important info his invoices but other info is still there. It aint assuming Gamestop is a priority.,LetsPlayCritiques,d9n7ecr,1,t5_30ftr
9662254,0,t3_5dd197,Maybe  speak less when other characters are talking. I can only speak for myself but Id imagine youd want your viewers to be engaged with what you say and also engaged in the game so that theyll stick around. It gets distracting trying to get into the game and have commentary during the cutscenes,LetsPlayCritiques,da42pnc,1,t5_30ftr
9767325,0,t3_5f1sq6,haha. you know for just starting out your pretty funny man. My big thing is just the length of the video.  minutes is a long time for a brand new audience to hang around for. your a funny dude if you edited out all the boring stuff or the jokes that dont work you would have a really kick ass video. then from there you can work on polishing the content. cleaner video cleaner audio the stuff that lets people know you are in for the long hall. all and all though its good for just starting out. Keep it up man!  ,LetsPlayCritiques,dah1foj,1,t5_30ftr
9812904,0,t1_dam73mi,Thank you for the feedback we are working on improving it I recently bought adobe audition so i can properly edit audio and we bought a decent mic so it should improve in the future im going to post the first episode with the improved audio on here when it comes out so i can see if i did that well,LetsPlayCritiques,damnf5e,1,t5_30ftr
9827963,0,t3_5ebm2c,So its not my type of game but I really liked that you injected your personality into the video. It was personal in a good way and you seem likable. Audio was well mixed and its clear that you enjoy it. Just get a mic stand lol!,LetsPlayCritiques,daolsoh,1,t5_30ftr
9890977,0,t3_5gycvl,I like the format the commentary seems a bit forced which is normal for the starting out phase which Im in as well so I can relate. Audio was good mixed well. And other then that. Keep going itll get more natural. ,LetsPlayCritiques,dawtfpy,1,t5_30ftr
9946969,0,t1_db43dao,Thank you! We dont have money for a new mic but I believe the mic quality has improved in our recent videos with just tweaking nobs. And yeah we are starting to do more facecam in our recent recordings! ,LetsPlayCritiques,db445wp,2,t5_30ftr
10171311,0,t3_5lmzl4,hey  I concur with supervidyabrothers on his critique. I read your description and I understand you made a character up and your channel is based on this character. I would suggest adding at the start of your trailer a quick explanation of your character you are acting as and what kinda of videos you will be making. For the positives of this video you have a great grasp of editing videos and other effects. I hope this helps you make an awesome channel trailer video. keep on keeping on ,LetsPlayCritiques,dbwz2sh,2,t5_30ftr
10380315,0,t1_dckjeao,Thanks the series did pick up later i also found the start slow and the episodes lengthy if anything i found the dungeons too long felt like they are slowing down the series and werent giving me a lot to work with and of course i avoided any other boring activity. The concept seemed good but you are  right i should have told about her on the go.Anything particular wrong with my commentary?,LetsPlayCritiques,dcko8g5,1,t5_30ftr
10476698,0,t1_dcvdrot,In some games it is certainly more noticeable then others. Some games demand  Curse you red orchestra I dont watch blueray or you know movies in general unless they are silent films have two dozen original reels.  ,LetsPlayCritiques,dcvn4wh,1,t5_30ftr
10763838,0,t1_ddpfb3h,Hey Spusk thanks for taking the time to watch and comment on the video itself it really is appreciated!Completely agree on the longer video point! I do try to make my videos no longer than  mins but occasionally I will go over gt.gt In fact Im pretty sure in every part of this game Ive recorded so far Ive mentioned at the end something about not wanting the video length being too long haha so I am aware of the problem even if I cant always negate it! Parts  and  are both under  mins so Im steadily working towards keeping it down!Glad you liked the editing too. When youre playing a game that is mainly still photos without facecam and only a voice to try and create humour I think the edits become pretty vital. Its not really my style because I never believed myself to be very good at it but Im happy you enjoyed them! Subsequent parts follow the same kind of humour as best as possible.Aaah the cursor c as soon as I finished the recording session I looked back at the footage and got annoyed with seeing that cursor so I can only apologise. The next two parts will be equally annoying Im afraid haha but Im recording again tonight and will do my best to remember to get it off the screen as quick as I can! ,LetsPlayCritiques,ddq7kmv,1,t5_30ftr
10764704,0,t1_ddqa356,Yeah this is a blind playthrough. Thats why I jump at every sound lol.  I thought a facecam was pretty much required for horror but I thought it went pretty well. Gonna check out the feedback from the poll and take it from there. Thank you for the feedback,LetsPlayCritiques,ddqasa3,1,t5_30ftr
10815509,0,t3_5unhe9,Nice video hopefully upload consistently and your videos will soon be found out  Sorry if I have some english mistakes,LetsPlayCritiques,ddvjkrp,1,t5_30ftr
10867924,0,t3_5uktbs,Okay first... I thought I was going to be totally turned off by the puppets but honestly it works!  It really had be rollin.  I dont make fun of your... holes... Amazing.  The animations were hysterical.  Feels like hanging out with funny friends I barely watched the gameplay.  Subbed well done!,LetsPlayCritiques,de0y6ji,2,t5_30ftr
10908684,0,t3_5vpbzj,cool video man very entertaining to listen too. The action shots are good. Yea the video may be long for some viewers otherwise keep it up. Youre only going to get better,LetsPlayCritiques,de55j8u,1,t5_30ftr
11033846,0,t3_5xhzg5,Im not here to get in a debate my dude if you wanna down vote me or something go ahead Im sick of the way people act on these forum sites. I took the post down plz leave me alone and stop analyzing everything i say it was a joke sorry if you have a more sophisticated sense of humor than me ,LetsPlayCritiques,deintkc,1,t5_30ftr
11034869,0,t1_de265xz,My deepest apologies  I thought I replied . Yes  I am a dumbass Thank you so much for your comment  these are the type of comments that make my day ! Im happy I gave you that feeling and I hope youll hit the gym again D  Never enough Gym !!!  Thank you so much once again for your feedback and all your compliments .I really appreciate it and sorry again for the late reply  there was so much positive reviews and feedback that I kind of lost track ,LetsPlayCritiques,deis010,1,t5_30ftr
11067109,0,t3_5xz1oc,I loved the quality of the video and the intro. It was all around nice.The commentary is a little lack luster but Im struggling with the same thing. However I would definitely watch another video,LetsPlayCritiques,demg2ux,1,t5_30ftr
11072386,0,t1_delolac,id say no but i do think if you get big enough your subscribers would eventually start asking for a face reveal but look at someone like xcal. ive followed his videos on youtube for years and i cant ever remember him ever doing a face reveal or showing what he looked like.,LetsPlayCritiques,den1m96,2,t5_30ftr
11087963,0,t1_deoso2w,Ill keep that in mind. Thanks much!,LetsPlayCritiques,deot7at,1,t5_30ftr
11303153,0,t3_616nmd,I watched. I think it def coulda had some heavier editing for the parts where you were backtracking and what not. But you were entertaining and chose a really good game. Ive never herd of this one. Was creepy as hell. Glad to see you were creeped out to I dont do well with playing this kind of shit myself lol.,LetsPlayCritiques,dfd71xt,2,t5_30ftr
11305042,0,t3_61bznl,I think commentary is probably the hardest to critique mainly because my commentary is not up to par. I personly dont mine longer videos but most people like the shorter  minute vids. Ill just tell you what I like enjoyed the about your commentary the most.First of all I didnt feel any of your commentary was bad. I just felt some parts were better than others.I liked when you talked about yourself and what games you played made me feel like you were engaging with your audience. I liked when you made jokes and edited accordingly. Thought it was cool when you explained how this game related to other games you played and talked about the beauty of the game.when you changed your voice a bit to read the character voices that was a nice touch. you could really have some fun with that.I liked when you when you talked about the story of the game as well.I do hope this helps at least a little and Im a little sad you killed the moose. ,LetsPlayCritiques,dfder56,1,t5_30ftr
11484041,0,t1_dfxoy4i,You can normally get rid the horizontal letter boxing in your editor. Just using a Zoom in function would work. Doing it along the sides is a real pain to get to work. You need to adjust the raw footage to record in those dimensions. A program that will do that with some formats is Virtual Dub.,LetsPlayCritiques,dfxpq01,2,t5_30ftr
11533232,0,t3_64l84o,First of all I really enjoyed your intro animation. It was really unique and the little tune was memorable and appealing. The same thing goes for your outro animations so good job. Amazing video quality and pretty decent mic quality. Your commentary was good and entertaining with very little dead space. I do think that  minutes is the perfect length for your style of video and will be the best for your channels growth except for if you are ever planning to do a stream or certain types of games like Telltale games in which case longer videos will be necessary. Your thumbnails have a consistent style and are very professional and attractive so nice again. Your channel layout is good for the most part but I would change your recent activity bar to an upload bar just because it looks nicer and then I would definitely add in a channel desctiption. Many people dont realize that channel descriptions play a role in your channels SEO Search engine optimization. I really dont have much to critique other than those couple things and I think that youll probably just get better at things like commentary with practice. Hopefully this helps somehow and Id appreciate it if youd also come check out or subscribe to me and my cohost at www.youtube.comgoldenguildgaming . Good luck!,LetsPlayCritiques,dg3alh4,1,t5_30ftr
11537128,0,t3_64nf9b,It wasnt that funny... I know thats not very constructive but I see funny moments in the title and my expectations go up.  The audio makes you sound like you are in a different room or the like.  Perhaps a new mic?  Also is that an older game?,LetsPlayCritiques,dg3qhuu,1,t5_30ftr
