9787817,0,t1_daj00vt,Like this game a lot has loads of potential. One thing I dont like is when you upgrade ships for a while they are significantly less powerful. Is this something you might address?,Starblastio,dajk7r6,2,t5_3hqjr
9804451,0,t3_5fhyh0,I just want to know  how can I respawn after dying without reloading the page and losing my progress? what is the point of buying more lives if you still have to completely reset each time you die?,Starblastio,dally9b,1,t5_3hqjr
10067137,0,t3_5jvd6q,I want shield interference. I can live without the placebo pro team feature I mentioned with it we got a chat. Now we need the balancing between teams and soloists.,Starblastio,dbjrrnr,1,t5_3hqjr

10209290,0,t3_5m764n,I think  of those kills were survival. The other  was some clanner who thought Lets shoot at the guy with a really big gun and the former leader who thought the same thing except his excuse was My ship is bigger than yoursSadly the match was not nearly as fun as it could have been. Low density ores and Ydefender is a very powerful low tiereffort ship. Never once did I feel I was being hunted or in danger of losing.,Starblastio,dc1a36b,2,t5_3hqjr
10284234,0,t1_dc9kpsa,Not a big fan of reoccurring payments on in game items I think a patron style donation is the way to go. Which is the same thing but I get to keep my items afterwards.,Starblastio,dc9rw4a,2,t5_3hqjr
10503717,0,t1_dcykekb,The reason why I started teaming with you was because I really loved the ship tree you put I found it very useful  thanks D,Starblastio,dcyphoc,3,t5_3hqjr
10512218,0,t3_5q9lel,mattamoreio  pmgliowe would like to create a standalone software edition of Starblast.ioRemember that probably major part of your current and future playerbase will choose to play this game because all they do is just open browser and play without paying a broken cent.Just keep that in mind. If you will decide to make an standalone real game try to give it to some smallmid streamer. Thats how Robocraft playerbase grow from  players to  in one night which was . I was there. The reason it worked was that Robocraft was very fun and fresh back then. ehh all that good memoriesGood luck.,Starblastio,dczo70q,1,t5_3hqjr

10557667,0,t1_dd4sft6,Yeah men the knockback from shooting its a little anoying i had to admit but as every other Pulse ship a strong shot produces a strong recoil and when we talk about the US this one doesnt have just  Blast as the other ships but two instead so it needs an even stronger knockback.,Starblastio,dd4txap,1,t5_3hqjr
10559943,0,t1_dd4fvlm,Teaming is common in every .io Ive played. Except maybe blockor but its possible Ive just never recognized teaming in that game.,Starblastio,dd537ir,1,t5_3hqjr

10776772,0,t1_ddriqz7,I simply wanted to test it out a few times. Now that Ive experienced it I probably will never use it again unless it has some type of buff.,Starblastio,ddrjog7,1,t5_3hqjr
10809778,0,t3_5ulkmh,Fast?.. It didnt feel fast when I tried it.It certainly does a lot of damage perhit though.This thing is tier  so its kinda supposed to beat pulse fighter and compare to side interceptor yet you could still beat it with pulse fighter. Have you tried Usniper shadowX or a tier  against it?,Starblastio,dduyaes,1,t5_3hqjr
10816821,0,t1_ddvmmiu,Fairy Nuff. Perhaps a quick mention in the basic section going more indepth in the intermediate section is a very good plan.Thank you for putting in the effort to do this guide,Starblastio,ddvog6m,1,t5_3hqjr
10823774,0,t1_ddwe4jh,Contrary the people in the tier s may be skilled and have a lot of time in the game,Starblastio,ddwe9v0,1,t5_3hqjr
10851477,0,t1_ddz0qwr,SDF rules have nothing to do with being honorable or otherwise nice. Did you read them? They have to do with being available to fight teams that want to take over the server. They can play just about however they like including as an asshole when theyve not been called on to take out a team. You are welcome to create another clan that abides by the rules you prefer! SDF was created to be a check on dominating teams  thats it. ,Starblastio,ddz94ac,1,t5_3hqjr

10902413,0,t1_de4hzy2,this was a numerical simulation with the numbers taken directly from the source code. Which means it does not take into account things like missing shots travel time between asteroids fights with enemies other inefficiencies etc. Also it does not take into account that you start with a full energy meter. But that should be a very small effect.Besides those this should be exact to a tenth of a second.,Starblastio,de4i8nr,2,t5_3hqjr
10926074,0,t1_de6xwhe,what is this thing of hunting down someone multiple times? you mean go to every dot to check if its you? the only times i do that is to take revenge on a jerk but a guy whos doing that because he have been killed because he was a jerk seriously have a problem IMO..,Starblastio,de6y563,1,t5_3hqjr
11056253,0,t1_dekq13l,No I didnt join the fight. I just watched them fight others. I would take the winner and make him fight another person.Players that didnt comply to my illegal ship fighting battles I would one shot since x is op,Starblastio,del7hpx,1,t5_3hqjr
11058583,0,t3_5xvd1d,I was in that match lol funny thing is I went around attacking people when there was a truce amongst everyone... a lot of people didnt like me ,Starblastio,delh0dt,1,t5_3hqjr
11182680,0,t1_deziuc3,Jesus fucking christ.Learn to read man.I won that game. I was the last survivor. No salt because of that...Do you understand that  ??Also above i write that from  games i play  solo.What part of that dont you get that you suggest me going solo and improve my skills ??Are you a Troll or something like that ???,Starblastio,dezjlfa,1,t5_3hqjr
11243852,0,t3_60gz6t,I see you had bad experiences...sorry for you but pulse fighter isnt that good an y defender can beat easily a pulse fighter.If you max the speed of the t fly you have  speed and the pulse fighter has . You say that you cannot be outrun...trident and deltafighter with maxed speed have   more than the pulse fighter...you can easily escape. Actually you dont know nothing about this game what you said is totally wrong about everything,Starblastio,df6h2pp,0,t5_3hqjr
11245071,0,t1_df6lg7u,One thing I think you overlooked A soloist is already at a huge disadvantage if put against three pulse fighters. allowing him to damage all three pulse fighters at once would even the playing field slightly. Another thing  the lighting wouldnt damage the person who shot. That means that you could charge directly at the team. They would all of course shoot you and firing together theyd of course win as they already do  but theyd also be damaging eachother. While this isnt a perfect solution it would certainly help.,Starblastio,df6m1lw,1,t5_3hqjr
11279154,0,t3_60z7kd,A bit late admittedly but it is finally here! My opinion of the Mercurys tier  variant the HMercury.,Starblastio,dfah4u5,2,t5_3hqjr
11294070,0,t3_6160s7,This issue seems trivial. While annoying experienced it first hand it might be more beneficial to leave the existing mechanism in place. Not many players take advantage of it anyways. ,Starblastio,dfc60en,1,t5_3hqjr
11294988,0,t1_dfc7gvk,I get the reasoning behind using the X for team busting but it means picking them off one at a time. The Pioneer can just barge in wreak havoc pick off one or two and then leave. Granted theres a big chance your master plan fails and you die but what it lacks in elegance it makes up for in efficiency.,Starblastio,dfc9r1n,1,t5_3hqjr
11306048,0,t3_61csc3,Gather a team of your own against them. Sadly this game cant be played all solo. It gives you an immense disadvantage against teams. Sometimes you have to kill fire with fire. But remain honourable disband your team once you are successful. But of course I suggest attempting to at least surprise and kill one or two suddenly by yourself. They cant be that skilled being teamers after all. ,Starblastio,dfdiuxt,3,t5_3hqjr

11511541,0,t3_64b9ep,Meh. Would make it boring real fast everyone loads in as maxed TT and then what? I think the climb is what keeps the competitive side of starblast. Also that would require some type of login or namebinding no? Pretty sure starblast stands where it is due to its simplicity something like this is complicated and just dont see happening.However I wont lie that being able to just join a game of maxed Ts of your choosing would be interesting. No upgrade to T no techs needed. Just a full on maxed vs maxed war. Sounds better as a mode more than an RPGtype system.,Starblastio,dg0u2fw,2,t5_3hqjr
11581711,0,t3_65a8m8,funy how they dont give anyone a reason to seapkn im sure its gonna say  hors even when is not,Starblastio,dg8sl3u,0,t5_3hqjr
11584680,0,t3_65cbzj,Yes please for all of these suggestions but if the Barracuda is removed from team mode I still want it in survival mode. Im really for the adding deposit to the chat as well. Id also like to see hello team and help return to the chat. ,Starblastio,dg94ph3,1,t5_3hqjr
