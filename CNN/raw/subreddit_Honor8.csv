9155868,0,t3_55bd3t,Thanks for the comment! Dont forget to check out the Capture smiles mode within the camera app settings. It automatically takes a picture once a smile is detected. ED,Honor8,d8ckmav,3,t5_3fx5m
9670021,0,t1_da50wgo,Yea I just feel like Im shooting myself in the foot if I dont get the Axon though. Its similarly priced but the specs for it are apparently much better... Depending on what that gift is I might get the best buy one because its the sapphire blue which is just so pretty LOL. Although Im probably gonna be getting a case for it its just nice to look at. Even when I went to try it out at the best buy I automatically went to the sapphire blue model aha.,Honor8,da5170u,1,t5_3fx5m

10397776,0,t3_5ovaf0,I used to get something like that. I broke mine and got a new one. The new one doesnt seem to be that power efficient as the old one,Honor8,dcmnka6,1,t5_3fx5m

11028073,0,t1_dehqj5t,I agree. Stock music app and file manager of EMUI are my favorite stock apps of the phone. Their UI are super slick.,Honor8,dei09jn,1,t5_3fx5m

11154764,0,t1_devi69y,that fact it cant work with custom lock screens is why its a security issue  like i said  massive security hole unless both parts of the software voice command and lock screen where locked down to talk to only each other .off course googles own phone can do it .. id hope so they own all parts of the software stack,Honor8,dewdpvq,1,t5_3fx5m

11528377,0,t1_dg2c8n4,I came originally from the OPO so I wanted to keep a lot of the things I was used to especially double tap to wake size in hand gestures etc. So naturally the T was a good fit for me. I had gotten the Honor  as an interim device. I thought EMUI would be horrible but it wasnt at all especially after the . update to N. On the Honor  speakers sounded good when you wanted them camera didnt disappoint and the speed was impressive. I would highly recommend the Honor . Theres just one thing I didnt like  how slippery it was. But that was easily fixed with a skin. The T itself is a stunner and ultimately I chose it because of the GB capacity among other things.This is just my own experience and theres plenty of YouTube videos that do a better job than I could comparing.TLDR You wont be disappointed either way.,Honor8,dg2qrxr,1,t5_3fx5m
