6369661,0,t3_42tswy,Unfortunately no. The REP available on Gatecoin is backed by their own presale purchase with the promise that they will redeem them for the real thing once they are released. Its been done before with Ether  you could obtain a token called Ethercoin that was created by a nonaffiliated group using their own presale Ether which they later honored once it officially was launched. For now its a case of buyer beware and I suggest that anyone interested should do their due diligence before making up their minds for themselves.That said this subreddit was created as a place to discuss and trade REP so feel free to post an ad. While I cant personally speak for him ujoeykrug has facilitated the transfer of presale accounts where people have wanted to privately sell their entire holdings. I believe this is the only option currently available right now but if anyone wants to correct me please do.,reptrader,czdnsm0,2,t5_3a5vo
