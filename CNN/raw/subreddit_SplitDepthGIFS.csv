2887939,0,t1_cnw36e8,I think youre right.  It needs to naturally move in front otherwise the plane its on stays the same and seems to ruin the illusion or at least not make my brain as stupid.,SplitDepthGIFS,cnwd191,2,t5_2yzq1

2967749,0,t1_co56c56,I think it could be even better if kept at normal speed. The one line definitely works but no real reason to slow it down this much. The main reason I like the original better is due to the speed.,SplitDepthGIFS,co5g5cj,6,t5_2yzq1
2979950,0,t3_2uazll,Really great. I wish a few more on the right side would have stayed behind the bar while the others went over it.,SplitDepthGIFS,co6u3qe,7,t5_2yzq1
3002428,0,t3_2uizxq,This is bad ass.Is it me or do the trees already kind of add that depth?Curious to see what a difference the lines would make. ,SplitDepthGIFS,co9772g,5,t5_2yzq1
3010972,0,t3_2undje,This is a very clean gif great job!Out of curiosity though did you try this with thicker lines? I just think the effect would be more pronounced if you had  someone can correct me if Im wrong.,SplitDepthGIFS,coa3342,2,t5_2yzq1

4286538,0,t1_cs8p3lc,And then when it rolls in front of the right line the rock it is on the behind the line when they are both at the same depth. ,SplitDepthGIFS,cs8tb0c,3,t5_2yzq1

5209539,0,t1_cvdxu5r,Yeah something like that. The bars grant a perspective and make it seem like the car is coming forward.So have the bar on the right stay in front of the car but have the car drift around the bar on the left.,SplitDepthGIFS,cvdxxgu,3,t5_2yzq1
