So if the second time its twins... no big deal but I want a singleton first.  Is that weird?  Secondly... twins would be a career killer for me.  The cost of daycare in the bay area is astounding and two babies in day care would basically cost everything I make in a month.

2274520,0,t3_2l9uf0,The short LP is definitely crushing. Just remember that YOU didnt fail. You are not your body or your hormones and you cannot control them. Just as people dont choose to have diseases you are not choosing for this to be hard. You should be proud that you are doing everything you can and fighting for it  some people just sit back and are scared to ask for the next step.I know the stress it puts on a relationship. Fights about sex about moral support about what ifs. My guilt about not being able to give him a baby that he wants so badly. Its probably the most trying thing you will go through in your marriage but remember youre going through this time strictly because you love each other enough to want to make a family together. Set times that you wont talk about TTC or start a new hobby together where you can be distracted completely from it. Talk to a counselor lean on your friends and family. Remember that people make it through this and come out on the other side and you guys will too. Good luck to you.,stilltrying,clsull3,1,t5_32ktv

2386626,0,t3_2mpphv,Hi I had similar news a couple months ago.  HSG showed one tube was fine and open and the other the dye failed to go through at all.  I was bummed.  The next month I saw an RE.  He did a repeat HSG as he thought he might be able to open the tube but we never even got that far.  The second time the dye flowed through both tubes just fine.  The RE said that sometimes there can be a temporary blockage or the tube can be in spasm during the test.Also even if its not temporary I dont believe a hydrosalpinx is the only possible cause.  Endometriosis might also cause a distal blockage.  That was really my only theory of what could have caused mine.  My husband and I are a closed system have only had intercourse with each other so I dont think pelvic inflammatory disease is a possibility thats what causes hydrosalpinx typically.,stilltrying,cm6p16s,2,t5_32ktv

10567894,0,t1_dd5iao6,I guess I thought that the only way to test was the dpo progesterone check. From talking with my doctor and so many other people here it doesnt seem like the plan of attack would change much even if you had low progesterone or something else in many cases they can narrow it down quickly to a problem with ovulation. Theyre going to give you some meds most likely clomid or Femara to grow big fat follicles they will probably want you to do a trigger and timed intercourse or IUI. Then they might give you progesterone for the luteal phase. Thats where we are starting. Our Doctor didnt do much testing because it ultimately wont change the plan because Ive had an HSG and know my tubes are clear and we are using donor sperm so know that it is good. Things that would make a difference for you could be blocked tubes male factor or if you didnt respond well to meds. ,stilltrying,dd5zntq,1,t5_32ktv

Being that Im in HR my email didnt exactly out me but Im sure the director could have assumed it was for my personal benefit. I just sent a short emailgt I know were going through a lot of changes related to benefits and vendors right now so I thought this might be a good opportunity to talk about infertility coverage. Of course its not something that is currently offered on our plan but it could be a huge help to some of our employees and I hope you consider the coverage options for the next plan year.gtThanks!  Part of me wanted to say that it was for myself for that personalized touch. But I figured it wasnt really necessary at this point.

Id been solidly in Id really like to have two maybe three territory. Our compromise was lets start with one then see how we feel and maybe try for a second.

My OB thinks that maybe my right tube had some narrowing for some reason and that all of my early losses were ectopic and that my body just took care of them on its own.

11066508,0,t1_dem6pvk,Thats what I read too  we left the coast Saturday morning and I found them Monday morning though so pretty sure they had time unfortunately. They are the tiny ticks so you cant even really see them until they are engorged and I smashed a few trying to get them off. Evidently you can expose yourself to any bacteria in their bodies if you smash them which is why its important to try to get them off clean. I did use tweezers but alas....still smashed some ticks. I used to live in a really ticky place and never worried about it but my dog has big red welts under where I removed the ticks and thats what got me worried. Maybe shes just sensitive but female deer ticks are the primary carrier for Lyme and thats what these were. Anyway despite feeling a bit ridiculous about it I took her to the vet and they gave her antibiotics. Fingers crossed I washed all the gross tick juice off my hands and have nothing to worry about myself. ,stilltrying,demdmka,2,t5_32ktv

11080644,0,t3_5y6xi2,I finished my prescribed course of Provera two days ago and started a light spotting last night. I had a bit more light spotting this morning. Side Note is there a term for when you have spotting but its nothing on your panty liner and only when you wipe? I feel like there should be a medical term for this lol.Got a little too eager and called the nurse at my REs office today. I asked if I was supposed to wait to call until I was at a full bleed and she said yes but shed go ahead a make an appointment for me tomorrow at am. If Im not at a full bleed by tomorrow then I just have to call to reschedule. The nurse explained Id be getting a vaginal ultrasound and some bloodwork done to check my hormone levels. After that Id be put on BC and get a hysteroscopy. Then it would be the Femara. Has anyone else gone this route? What should I expect with the vaginal ultrasound and hysteroscopy? I had a HSG done a few months ago which was clear and not that pleasant to undergo but nothing I couldnt bare to go through again I suppose. ,stilltrying,denzbuk,1,t5_32ktv

If you arent comfortable being that open about it you could always get sick that day I find a migraine is a good fake illness as it can come and go with minimal buildup.

Youre already pretty emotional. Maybe you need to tell them that and have them skip that part. Oh mom....And then husband and I talked. We looked over the paperwork and discussed how this could play out with a deployment. I think hes going to try to hold off from volunteering until the end of this year which would mean hed leave around next summerfall.

11723031,0,t3_677xrd,Finally in the TWW of my first Clomid cycle. I ovulated some time over the weekend....I havent been temping the past few months because my CM and cervical positionfeel was enough of a clear indicator of my ovulation pattern that I knew what was going on but of course the Clomid threw that out of whack so I dont know for sure. Friday I finally started seeing signs of impending O as I had a lot of EWCM and my cervix was finally HSO. Usually I have a few days of this before actually ovulating but the EWCM pretty much dried up over the weekend due to the Clomid and I was dehydrated which definitely didnt help so I am not too optimistic this worked. By today my cervix was HFC which usually happens  days after O day for me so Im confident it happened sometime between Friday and yesterday. We had sex Thursday Friday and Sunday so I know our bases are covered as well as they can be. My boyfriend has been coming down with something and today feels REALLY sick so Im glad we got it all out of the way before he got sick and we missed our chance for this month. Now I just wait I guess. Im trying hard not too put too much on this cycle as its my first medicated cycle. The stakes are higher and its going to suck if it didnt work but I cant let myself go crazy. Honestly I would have expected to feel really optimistic and more sure this month that I am pregnant because of the Clomid but I feel the opposite I feel more pessimistic than normal and like of course it didnt work.
