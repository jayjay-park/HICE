This means you can have Netflix not use the VPN Netflix doesnt allow VPN. Not sure if openvpn for Android works on Android TV though Ill have to try it later.With that being said I find the shield a lot better then the nexus player.

7208383,0,t3_4e6vdw,Ive never been thrilled with how torrent clients work on Android  Im probably doing it wrong  but the lack of keyboard support via app is a really PITA with the SHIELD TV. Roku and even the Fire TV Stick have apps which allow you to type on the screen but the SHIELD is strictly tedious input via onscreen entry. Ive got long passwords and it sucks. Correction I see theres an app from Google which should do this but it appears to be broken judging from he reviews.Rather than torrenting especially if youre just deleting after watching why not use Kodi to stream on demand and call it a day? Some of the channel extensions are interesting I watched The Expanse and it appears to have been pulling from SyFy.com and it was p quality. Very nice.Im using mine for YouTube Starz Play Showtime Anytime HBO Go Netflix and several others see below but no thanks to Amazons continuing jihad against Google I need to use my TVs app to access that. Im also using the Gamestream feature to play PC games on my rig over on the couch.What sucks about Android TV compared to Roku is the lack of comprehensive app support. As I mentioned Amazon is a pain but there is no VUDU app so I cant watch my Ultraviolet movies and some others Starz Play snuck ATV support in just recently just dont have ATV support. I had to add VUDU on my Vizio K sets apps which also provides K Netflix and Amazon but the  Vizios are doing away with apps to have GoogleCast and with no Amazon Im not sure how thats going to work.Also if youre running your SHIELD through an AVR if it doesnt have HDCP . support you cant get K. My Sony AVR is just a couple of years old and lists K passthru but because its HDCP . Im hosed. Connecting the SHIELD to the TV and running audio back via ARC sucks because its only ..

Or there is some crazy Mysql thing that runs kodi on server too iirc.Lastly as kodi does not use Android TV native player there is no support in it to adjust refresh rate. or even resolution in ideal case,ShieldAndroidTV,dcfkkmj,0,t5_38b73
