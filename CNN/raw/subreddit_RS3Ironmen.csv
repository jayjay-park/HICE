9492743,0,t3_5atll1,Repost from a rrunescape post that I made a while back but decided it was worth it since this is a newer subreddit D Heres a comment I made on the other post that has more information about arhatsSome text from the Imgur post incase someone only checked the imageUnique Drops  Visages  Seiryus Claw Enough memes from Visage broadcasts to last a lifetime.Also the  Air Orbs are unpowered orbs I got as drops but when the Wildy Tasks came out I tested out the shortcut so I actually have  Unpowered OrbsAlso. This was obtained on Episode  of my Ironman Completion Series which can be found here I went from  Magic  Invention and gained around m hp xp during this grind and I used magic for  of my kills with the last little bit being with range.Chimes didnt start dropping from Arhats until around  kc  so you could expect a little bit more chimes from the Arhats.My Killshr were something around hr but with afking out of boredom I probably averged hr and I used about  Spirit Dragon Charmshr a lot of this is rng though. ,RS3Ironmen,d9j6mdf,4,t5_3h8j4

9727916,0,t1_dabo7uv,xp gained whilst capping is greatly nerfed for ironmen. therefor very few ironmen bother with citadel. Iron Elites used to have a... I think it was t citadel? but people lost interest in the citadel so it decayed. Im not sure if any ironman clan has a decent citadel at the moment.edit just read somewhere that feonix works on their citadel. ,RS3Ironmen,dac6fy3,1,t5_3h8j4

10427097,0,t3_5ob8wg,As others have said spiritual magi will still be around and a potentially better source at high levels is ganodermic beasts with  crafting to make visors that alch for k each. And then onyx bolts e from various bosses and onyxes from rax. Hopefully theyll replace rune drops with coins though.  ,RS3Ironmen,dcpzalx,1,t5_3h8j4
10474122,0,t3_5q0ml6,I dont have numbers but Im fairly certain that this the the most common untrimmed cape for ironmen. You shouldnt really be training combat with anything other than slayerbossing.,RS3Ironmen,dcvcm25,2,t5_3h8j4

11077048,0,t1_den3mgg,Have you considered using superior spined helmetlegs? T power would be a small upgrade over what youre currently using. Alternatively you could augment the Karils skirt and just put some relevant perks on it if you dont have ArmadylAnima etc.   You might also want to invest in a higher tier aura t sharpshooter and a scrimshaw of cruelty once you have the required Fletching level. ,RS3Ironmen,denknfi,3,t5_3h8j4

11305125,0,t3_61bdib,Youre a little behind we have a picture which appears to be you cading beforehand and we have a video which appears to be papper walking out with full hp after everyone else has died.All the evidence at the moment points towards it being intentional if it wasnt upload the video. If it was intentional lying about this and drawing it out for even longer is just going to make things worse for yourself.,RS3Ironmen,dfdf3cb,7,t5_3h8j4

11626176,0,t1_dgd2ys8,Hey zpoonI havent been a part of this moderation team for very long and was only brought on as a rd mod to help keep posts clean. Since then both of the main moderators have become incredibly inactive and its really just been me casually keeping things going and I dont have much knowledge on the matters of things like css.However despite me being unaware of these  issues it doesnt mean Im not responsible to fix them. If you want to send me some messages to help put credit for the css I have no qualms doing that and when I did first come to this subreddit it did seem odd things looked almost if not exactly the same. Why that attribution would have been removed doesnt really make sense to me.In terms of mods or even other users spamming posts or in comments about our small ironman community here what would be the best way to go about it? I mentioned in a comment to another user here about asking to have rsironmen in the sidebar somehow maybe that could be arranged.Regardless thanks for answering,RS3Ironmen,dgdu7y2,3,t5_3h8j4
