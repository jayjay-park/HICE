8832417,0,t3_515rs2,This should give you an idea of what bats will move in Since most bats that we know will occupy bat houses are found throughout much of the United States the biggest regional differences are in what color to paint them darker colors further north to keep them warmer,batty,d79j6s9,2,t5_3571i

10644168,0,t3_5sbpol,Being able to handle large pieces of fruit is an important skill for young fruit bats. In the wild they need to be able to fly in to a tree among competing bats grab a piece of fruit and fly off to a quieter spot to eat in peace.,batty,dddv4fc,7,t5_3571i

11740620,0,t1_dgqp49t,Interesting! I dont think Ill get as personal as Merlin did. Out of curiousity do you think that the bats naturally care or do not care at all about light? I know they dont use their eyes much and use sound but do they avoid light? I guess Ill be finding out but wanted to ask! BTW I will probably do the fishing line method you mentioned ,batty,dgqtuyp,2,t5_3571i
