He had a video running because its like a cop cars dashcam...only its on all the time.  Hes driving in a HMMWV also know as a humvee. The sound is muffled and the explosion taken out because of censoring.  His breathing does pick up at points he had his adrenalin pumping.

Normally this process is all done using a powered machine to control the speed of the chain being dropped. However since this was for training they had to learn to do it manually using the brake wheel. The crewman working the wheel let the chain pick up too much speed and lost control. No matter how tight they cranked the break wheel it wouldnt stop. When the chain finally reaches the end there is so much weight on it that it simply snaps.,CatastrophicFailure,ctfwy4j,10,t5_38tab

With nitrogen you kill the fire absorb heat reduce the pressure and possibly displace the smoke. As soon as the building reaches  atmosphere rapidly pressurize it with standard atmosphere and clear the building in case you knocked someone unconscious. If you find someone resuscitate them. That gives them fairly good chance IMO. As for being sued fuck that. People die on firefighters watch all the time. Its the nature of the job. People will die. In this case theres a chance that their actions might directly kill someone but if they have to resort to N then theres a good chance the person would have died anyways. Stuff like this is all about a calculated risk. If I had a better chance of survival but I had to risk suffocation as part of option B then Id go with option B.

It looks like the pour bucket was filling a container and then the bucket moved and spilled molten steel on the floor.EDIT According to uBadSarcgtI worked in steel for about a year... My guess would be the initial ladle that they were pouring the steel into became full or unstable in some way. Once a ladle like the one attached to the crane has been tapped there is no way to shut it off. If none of the nearby ladles had been preheated or otherwise readied to receive steel pouring a long shallow line of steel onto the ground would allow it to cool rapidly and control the flow reducing the potential damage mess and danger.

Some ex drillers have a bit of a chip on their shoulder due to us doing things the way we were trained to do it. The fact that most of the ex drill guys have either had some nasty injury in the past of know of at least  colleague who was killed at work speaks volumes. Ive worked with a lot of ex RN and RFA guys and they tend to know their stuff inside out. Our mooring systems on the floating rigs are very much automated. During winch operations there will be one guy in the winch control box  box controls the three winches on that corner.  boxes in total. There will be a crane op driving the crane plus a Bosun and  ABs on deck. They are only really required to stow or release the anchor chain pennants or when connecting or disconnecting the anchor while its on the anchor handlers deck.

Trusting the quality is something you cant leave to faith or luck.Building without proper foundations either by design or by scrimping on cost in execution is also common for the same reasons.

They do have the explosive force to shred a car like the SUV in the video but that is certainly not the type of tire mounted on that Land Rover. It more than likely has passenger rated tires or perhaps light truck rated tires. They can cause damage when they fail but they arent going to rip the rocker panels off with a ball smoke and fire like that. In the dyno test video the smoke and damage you see are from the carcass of the ruptured tire flailing around inside the wheel well at high speeds. The Land Rover was moving at relatively low speeds yet it still suffered more damage and created a more spectacular explosion than the high speed dyno failure. Furthermore brake fluid is not that volatile. Putting it in a sealed container and heating it till it explodes does not really prove much.I cant say what exactly is happening in the original video but I can certainly say its more than a simple blowout.Edited for grammar and typos.,CatastrophicFailure,d8j9km6,18,t5_38tab

9448313,0,t3_59yu3s,this shouldnt be labeled as en Engineering Failure the accident was caused when the mechanic grabbed bolds that were half a millimeter I think I actually saw this video a LONG time ago so I dont really remember too small when he decided to eyeball the size rather than go through the trouble of finding properly labelled bolts of the right size.Edit I gave this in a response to another comment but its relevant here as wellAlso an institutional failure. IIRC the reason the mechanic didnt want to go find properly sized bolts was because doing so required referencing various manuals and going through other procedures that were lengthy and difficult and he wasnt trained to know just how essential even the tiniest difference in the parts makes. When he found the other bolts he used he held them against the ones he just took out and they were indistinguishable. IIRC the difference in diameter was a fraction of a millimeter too small to be seen even side by side.If he had been given more proper training if the bolts were more easily labelled then the accident never would have happened.In the field of flight crash investigations its easy to point the finger and say oh the mechanic used the wrong bolts. Thats the problem case closed and leave it at that. But the problem with doing that is such an investigation wouldnt change anything. It doesnt avoid the next crash. When investigators look at disasters like this they cant just look for who caused the problem they have to look which policies or design features caused the problem and then give recommendations to change those designspolicies such that the next accident doesnt happen.,CatastrophicFailure,d9dn1o6,1,t5_38tab

10996832,0,t1_decx1ln,I  agree with you that societies dont evolve conventions that they find to be wrong but there are plenty of conventions that have no particular moral weight.  There are societal conventions of conviction dont kill people and societal conventions of convenience drive on the right side of the street.  I follow both conventions religiously but while I have no trouble respecting the British who choose to drive on the left side of the street I would have more trouble respecting a society where murder was casually undertaken.  Im suggesting that the societal proscription on speaking ill of the dead is more of the former than the latter.  I dont agree that a societal more against speaking ill of the dead implies that you can say whatever you want about the living.  Rather I think the idea we shouldnt criticize the dead arises directly from the societal value of not speaking ill of anyone who cannot rebut the criticism.  I dont speak ill of the dead for the same reason I dont talk shit behind peoples backs or mock retarded children.  And the greater my conviction that one of those acts is wrong the greater my conviction the other is wrong as well.I am aware that people commit suicide and it is often blamed by themselves or others on being bullied.  If your thesis is we shouldnt speak ill of the living I can agree with that.  If your thesis is that speaking ill of the dead makes us more likely to be kind to the living OR conversely speaking well of the dead makes us more likely to speak ill of the living I think that is almost  incorrect.  Kindness and decency beget kindness and decency.Lastly I agree that the world would be a better place if people were more consistently kind to each other.  But I think it would also be a better place if people werent unkind to the dead.  If I may return to the necrophilia metaphorthe harm you do with your criticisms or sexual attention is not to the object itself but to those who value the object and...perhaps more crucially...to yourself as a moral actor.Another classic example is the streetlight.  We feel very strongly it is important to stop ones car for the red light and drive on for the green.  But nobody feels this convention is good or evil.  If one person violates the convention we are outraged but if we as a people were to decide heylets reverse the colors or stop for a blue light and go for an orangewe would not demean ourselves.  ,CatastrophicFailure,deegguv,1,t5_38tab

11421628,0,t1_dffim02,Let me put it out in no uncertain terms theres no way for an escalator to be overloaded just by people standing on it. Escalators are vastly overdesigned and a properly maintained one will not fail like that. It speeds up because both the drive system and the brake system failed unlikely or the connection between the tread and the drivebrake section failed open. It happens only because of poor maintenance and because of cutting costs on maintenance personnel and training.,CatastrophicFailure,dfqmouh,1,t5_38tab
