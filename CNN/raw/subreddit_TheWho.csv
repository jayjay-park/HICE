5143521,0,t3_3lfskb,From Wikipedia on viral meningitisViral meningitistypically only requires supportive therapy most viruses responsible for causing meningitis are not amenable to specific treatment. Viral meningitis tends to run a more benign course than bacterial meningitis.Herpes simplex virusandvaricella zoster virusmay respond to treatment with antiviral drugs such asaciclovir but there are no clinical trials that have specifically addressed whether this treatment is effective.Mild cases of viral meningitis can be treated at home with conservative measures such as fluid bedrest and analgesics.This reassures me that Roger should make a full recovery. He is a very healthy looking geezer!,TheWho,cv5zjcj,3,t5_2tjqb
