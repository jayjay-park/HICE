4420363,0,t1_csntnpc,Different translators tend to understand this point quite differently so its probably a good thing to be confused about.My translator Giles thinks the Moral Law is about the soldiers preparedness and conditioning which seems to conflate it with the Commander like you said since hes responsible for their conditioning.But there are  points in the section that seem to be at odds with this. First you arent asked to be in accord with your commander but your ruler i.e. King. And second this accord seems like the most important word. Soldiers must be in moral accord or agreement with their King or maybe in a modern context country cause or whatever it is youre fighting for or else they arent going to fight very hard. They have to think theyre fighting for something worth fighting for.At least thats how Ive understood the section but theres certainly room for other interpretations.,nonfictionbookclub,csnwrj6,1,t5_38sv3
6203920,0,t3_3zgfor,Chapter  really got me thinking about all these elected officials being murdered in Mexico and other south American countries as well as the bus full of kids. A lot of people dont know or hear about these stories. Why not? I also wonder about all these elections in the middle east that we as a country have been encouraged or discouraged about. Did Afghanistan have a democratic election or not? I dont know based on these standards. Does Jimmy Carter go as a official for the state or as an independent observer I wonder?Im left with more questions then answers. I do feel this chapter was lengthier than it needed to be but maybe I just cant appreciate the distinctions Chomsky is drawing between Nicaragua and Guatemala.,nonfictionbookclub,cyutiql,1,t5_38sv3

And certainly he doesnt seem satisfied with this living meanly like ants mostly.,nonfictionbookclub,d5p4j8t,3,t5_38sv3
