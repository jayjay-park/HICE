11415275,0,t3_62wkhn,I need to relisten to it all again but I think youre probably right about the spending all his money before his death thing. Obviously he spent a ton of money during his life the house the maze his mother the tattoos so he had a bunch to begin with maybe from the clock business but that had to run out at some point since it really didnt seem like he was doing anything to earn an income anymore. Man depression is a bitch. Glad to hear youre doing better these days. ,stownpodcast,dfpwru1,2,t5_3jiuj

11440428,0,t1_dfsa26j,I dont think its deceitful. In a lot of ways this podcast IS like Serial. The main difference is that murder isnt the focus. I think if it had been marketed as Serial Season   then maybe this criticism would carry more weight for me.I think the connection to Serial besides the team behind it is a theme of mysteries  some solved some not with lots of questions left unanswered. The mini mystery of the boys murder. The mystery of what happened to John  what drove him to suicide? His sexuality? Loneliness? Mercury poisoning? Why did he change so much in those last few years? What happened to his will? Was there gold or wasnt there? How did he get all his money? Is Tyler a con man or a goodhearted kid who keeps making dumb mistakes? Are the cousins really vultures who came to cash in on their cousins death? Why didnt Faye call the people on the list? What happened to the gold in the freezer? Was there gold in the freezer?Looking at all these threads and people are debating back and forth and offering theories  the same kind of thing happened after Serial. Its fine if people like the OP dont think the mysteries are very mysterious or interesting  thats subjective and perfectly acceptable I personally disagree. I also happen to disagree that the advertisements before TAL portrayed this as a murder mystery  I certainly didnt get that impression but I do think that its what many people will be expecting. ,stownpodcast,dfsrfu6,5,t5_3jiuj

11473708,0,t3_63qnpe,I agree with you about John B. Hes definitely not someone Id care to know based on how hes portrayed in this podcast especially when Brian Reed went into depth about his sexistracist streaks  but that didnt stop me from enjoying stown or feeling compassion for his mental illness. I cant relate to any of the stars of this podcast and I find most of them to be deeply flawed mostly unlikable people but I did find the podcast compelling and I definitely enjoyed listening to it. I think for a lot of people stown is compelling similarly to how a TV show like breaking bad is compelling  breaking bad is full of mostly terrible people and awful situations but a deep look into a life thats radically different from my own presented in a human way. Stown is about complex people and scenarios and I really enjoyed listening to the same event from multiple perspectives. I think stown is just masterful storytelling on NPRBrian Reeds part as well  the actual events of stown could easily be a podcast that most people wouldnt take a second look at but the pacing and the presentation really elevates it to the blockbuster level its at now. ,stownpodcast,dfwjg6t,12,t5_3jiuj
11475154,0,t1_dfwnnu3,So as someone who just finished the podcast I also only just found out that all episodes were dropped at once and i didnt come in halfway through... I agree with you on a lot of this. I dont think there needs to be a big happy ending or everything needs to be spelled out I just think the first  episodes sold me on a different type of show than the resolution accommodated. I think in terms of story flowstructure its weird to end on a decrescendo considering the thrills of the first few episodes. I think it rode the line pretty well between not spelling things out but also not making the audience WORK to find the answers i just think a rise in energy or focus towards the end was owed to deliver on the promises of the first half.EDIT im talking about in terms of editing information. This was a tediously manicured podcast i just felt the flow dipped towards the end.,stownpodcast,dfwpd28,7,t5_3jiuj

11483151,0,t1_dfxc29h,I dont recall that but I wouldnt be surprised if his writing contained all manner of topics especially if he wrote in a manic state. I have no idea if John B. was bipolar but he did describe having periods of depression and mania sometimes blended together. Hypergraphia can be a symptom of mania and manic writing can be all over the place often blending a bunch of disparate topics together in a stream of consciousness style. ,stownpodcast,dfxm31l,1,t5_3jiuj

11509873,0,t1_dg0im00,Thats fine.  We can agree to disagree.  Its not that I want to see John B. as having Aspergers thats just the way he struck me.

From what we heard John B. appeared superarticulate in a way I dont think would point to aspergers. Definately a unique mind but more in the way that Steve Jobs had a unique mind I think.,stownpodcast,dg12k2r,2,t5_3jiuj

11622172,0,t1_dg25992,I think this is actually the issue behind the disconnect behind Johns apparent intentions and what Tyler was actually entitled to. I take it that the promise was a presumption that Mary Grace would pre decease John but John took his own life before she died and his apparent intentions could not be met.Its another tragic conciquence of Tyler calling Johns bluff no not going round to talk John down from his last suicide threat as ultimately it removed any claim he had to the estate hidden gold notwithstanding,stownpodcast,dgddua8,2,t5_3jiuj
11632526,0,t3_65w4q3,Ive listened to it almost x now once casually a second time bc I didnt pay great attn the first goround and eps again so my friend could hear it on a road trip and I had the same thought after the first listen. On relistens tho I wondered if maybe Brian had more material for those storylines  more interviews people hours quality and went that direction for practical reasons legal reasons sometimes too. Also more easily put aside the unsettling experience of the loose ends in subsequent listens prob cause I knew it was coming and was able to enjoy the humanity of the drama more. Especially found it funny when Rita started sounding more like JBM in her line of thought. Thats irony gold!,stownpodcast,dgek59p,6,t5_3jiuj
11638054,0,t3_65cgim,Ive been wondering if John was upset with Tyler when he killed himself. Few people described his mood that day and it seemed that he was in distress when he did it.

11670866,0,t1_dgg03ik,gt John used the idea of the gold to keep Tyler coming around. John was so insecure so lonely that he believed Tyler would only come for work and money and the promise of future gain. This is what Im starting to think as well more and more.  Tyler was young and broke.  Sounds like John used the urban legend of him having all this gold to manipulate Tyler.  Especially after listening to the descriptions of church.  Tyler was essentially prostituting himself in return for current and implied future monetary gain.,stownpodcast,dgiwprz,3,t5_3jiuj

But Reed said he did get a chance to interview Mary Grace on the record after Reta and Charlie brought him to see her. I saw where she was staying and she did seem to be doing well he said. She was in pretty good spirits. Shes very quickwitted despite her clear dementia and funny and kind of biting sometimes.gtReed ultimately chose not to use any of his recorded interviews with Mary Grace in the podcast. It didnt seem to fit into the story he said choosing his words carefully. It wasnt the mosther faculties are not there in terms of an interview. He did however use some of what he learned from Mary Grace. For instance the detail I include in the last chapter about her rubbing her stomach and praying for a genius he said. I had heard that story from someone else she had told it to but then she told me that multiple times on the record. As far as Reed knows Mary Grace is still staying with family friends.
