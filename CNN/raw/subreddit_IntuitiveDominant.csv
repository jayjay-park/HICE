3431293,0,t3_2yrtv1,I connect A to B B to C C to D and then D to E. This is usually why Im talking about E while Im staring at A. Happens all the time and people think Im being an idiot. However when I find a way to throw more hints about B C and D into the observation people who catch on quickly tend to think Im hilarious and clever. You just have to be aware of what connections youve made and leave that trail of bread crumbs for other people.If you forget a step youve made along the way and think A B C F G its probably best not to open your mouth. D and E were probably very logical steps in your conclusion with G but if you cant remember them and you need to show your work youre going to fail at explaining it.,IntuitiveDominant,cpje67x,2,t5_3783m
3469507,0,t3_2zytrx,I find this whole dynamic fascinating. I mean out there in reality sensors are the majority and intuitives are the defensive ones. But here in this cyber reality mbti community its backwards. Its fun to think about what that means about human nature.On the other hand the drama is tiring. I need my conflict to have a clear focused purpose. Why was this sub even created? Just as a response to the sensor sub? We should take advantage of this forum to talk about things nonintuitives would find uninteresting rather than perpetuating the conflict. Badmouthing people is boring and so is dwelling on being badmouthed. Lets discuss ideas!,IntuitiveDominant,cpnqyrf,8,t5_3783m

4806557,0,t3_3g8m7j,Weirdly I find the INFJ redditers more legit than the facebook INFJs or personality cafe INFJs. Although this might because most of the people on reddit are male and males are less likely to pretend they are INFJs meanwhile most of the other INFJ communities are crawling with a load of INFP and ISFJ women claiming to be INFJs. ,IntuitiveDominant,cu0emqi,2,t5_3783m
6542323,0,t3_44wvpk,Engage in activities that primarily use the Se function and force you to be aware of your surroundings in the present moment.Personally I ride a motorcycle practice mindfulness meditation and play intense competitive video games that require quick decisions and reaction speed as opposed to something more slow paced and strategic when Im relaxing. I suppose you could also take up some kind of sport or physical activity that requires you to concentrate. Yoga and Martial Arts seem pretty Nidom friendly team sports arent usually our thing.,IntuitiveDominant,czw127o,3,t5_3783m
