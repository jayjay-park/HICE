433127,0,t1_cfpn76d,He pretty clearly says at the Council of Elrond that he didnt know about Isildurs account of the Ring until he found it in the archives at Minas Tirith.I do agree that his suspicions about the Ring were greatly increased by Bilbos behavior on this occasion. But at the time he didnt know it was the One. Id imagine if hed known then that Isildur had referred to the One as precious hed have been quite alarmed even earlier when he learned that Gollum had called his ring that as well.,lordoftherings,cfpnpm4,1,t5_2rnel

2368620,0,t3_2md7ve,I love these books and movies just so so dearly. Id bet I had read each book five times my senior year of High School but read The Two Towers probably ten time. The characters the stories the values all represented reality with just enough likeness to make it seem as if I was born in the wrong alternate universe or something. But I digress.I ended up studying classics at university and some of the few things that got me going like LOTR was greek mythology. I saw more things in Tolkiens work and for that matter in everyday human life through greek myth. If you can find a good teacher you can relate to and most are also astoundingly brilliant the lessons are literally priceless and truly quite rewarding. Translating a profound latin phrase is like uncovering a priceless treasure fewer and fewer can enjoy. Furthermore its a fun thing to study and is always in one of the top five majors that get accepted to law or medical programs and you get to study the foundations of our culture that fills in the gaps of our educational system. So I think you might be most happy and let the end prove to be just another beginning. ,lordoftherings,cm4gxfm,2,t5_2rnel

4525583,0,t1_ct0cqdd,Exactly.  I think the horn whoever blew it in the movie was a good choice for two reasons.  First we get to see a cool connection to the Hammerhand story as his character is all about second windslast stands.  Second this being a film it gives us a very tangible sense of inspiration since we cant delve into the characters minds the way you can in a book.Motivation in combat is a lot more than oh Im inspired here Ill fight a little harder.  It can actually turn the tide of battle or at least enable you to take a significant amount of bad guys with you.These guys are on their last leg.  Theyre hurt exhausted and will probably be dead in minutes.  It would be easy to throw in the towel and just let the inevitable happen and Thoden is ready to do just that.  Sure people like Aragorn will fight tooth and nail regardless of inspiration but most people arent Aragorn.  Most people with broken bodies and spirit would just want it to be over.Then the sun starts rising and someone blows the horn.  That earth shaking resounding horn of your home and people.  Maybe its not time to die... no.  Not quite yet.Its not die time... its last stand time.  Were going to take out as many of these assholes as we can.  Were going to go on a rampage the likes of which Helms Deep hasnt seen since Helm himself heard the horn and started slaying fools.Lets do this.This kind of mentality can easily quadrouple the amount of assholes they take with them even if Gandalf wasnt coming to save their asses.IMO its fitting that Gimli is the one who blows the horn.  Sure he wouldnt look as badass on a horse but as I understand it Helm was homies with the dwarves.  I think they gave him a mithril hammer.  Another cool connection.,lordoftherings,ct136c3,15,t5_2rnel

6311635,0,t3_40ds2v,I always attribute my dislike of The Hobbit films to having read the book first not to having seen the other trilogy. I actually really enjoyed parts of the films but the book is very special to me.Although the Tauriel addition displeased me I was much more disappointed in things the movie left out like most of the songs especially after including the dwarf song and getting my hopes up! And little things that were important and meaningful to me in the book like Bilbo climbing up the tree and seeing the butterflies that didnt carry the same emotions in the film.Theres a ton of stuff I dislike about the Lord of the Rings films as well but imo The Hobbit tends to drag on a lot more in places. They both have their pros and cons but I have never been able to sit through a repeat of any of The Hobbit movies without getting bored which is probably the ultimate issue I have with them.,lordoftherings,cz729c2,1,t5_2rnel
