4816498,0,t3_3foahf,I prefer heavy Pomfen for training it gets the muscles sore D but perform better with light ones.Different question Do you prefer Pompfen that can bend or Pomfen that are mostly stiff?We build a new set of Pompfen with fiberglass tubes not long ago. Compared to the olde ones fiberglass rods they are quite more rigid. I am not sure my self yet which i prefer.,Jugger,cu1nqde,1,t5_2uj9z
