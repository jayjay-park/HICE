5120165,0,t1_cv31tp3,Youve got to play differently depending on who youre playing up against. For fox and falcon djc isnt used as an approach always. Youve got to use it as the punish because these characters also have similar neutral problemseasily punished for being overly agro. Grabs shouldnt be made easier to get when theyre one of Nesss strongest combo starters. Grabs should be gained through a mixup a read or after pk fire,20PSI,cv367hq,1,t5_39xmi
5137137,0,t3_3l0v3x,On another note letting the yoyo hang off the edge is a good way to kill unsuspecting spacies and other characters that have to sweet spot. Also works with dsmash,20PSI,cv57tap,1,t5_39xmi
5325772,0,t1_cvs43iw,The test was about finding a safer way to use double jump land. I think starting a dair everytime you want to do something on a platform is only marginally better than just wavelanding and is more prone to be flubbed ...,20PSI,cvsfgkm,1,t5_39xmi
5916993,0,t3_3w1rjx,I think it comes down to throwing more pk fires than like playing neutral like other bad matchups. Its hard to make this adjustment but spacing against these bigger characters is hard and youre just better off throwing more pk fires than like spacing out bairs or whatever.,20PSI,cxv8z8k,1,t5_39xmi
6012655,0,t3_3xtbdr,My first thought is that on platformheavy stages you cans till techchase onto platforms with up throw. If they tech on a platform Ness has a pretty long waveland that you can react to their tech with to get a regrab pretty easily and keep comboing from there. Would be interested to hear downthrow timings though.,20PSI,cy7sd7z,1,t5_39xmi
6136019,0,t1_cymv69o,Yeah that one. At least we have mag to turn us around so its not too bad.,20PSI,cyn3n1e,1,t5_39xmi
6165560,0,t1_cyqgdyk,I only use LJC currently to wavedash onto the stage so I use a strange timing ,20PSI,cyqglcc,2,t5_39xmi

6519550,0,t1_cztnqjx,I think Nair out of d throw is an amazing kill option at like ish cause most people will continue to di down and away and that makes Nair that much more deadly. But what do you mean it can be sdid? Which direction? Back or front?,20PSI,czto7xv,1,t5_39xmi
6702242,0,t1_d0c8a0t,I dont think so. Im not completely sure but I think they are put into more lag than normal landings.,20PSI,d0ckiu7,2,t5_39xmi
6788459,0,t1_d0l4ycy,Never do grounded pk fire in neutral. Ike has the same kind of thing that ganon and falcon have where they can cover the entire distance of grounded pk fire in one vault and hit you hard with a fair. Pk fire is okay in this matchup but be careful to keep your distance.Ike is not slow I dont know what the youre talking about. Sure QD is a commitment but Ness doesnt have like falco lasers to stop him from charging it. And his dash speed is almost on par with ours so flat out running away from him you often will still get clipped by the burst movement of his dash attack. Also thats not true about ike having to do a move he can simply jump at you and react to your punish. There is pretty much nothing we can do to stop him from charging QD on the other side of the stage then coming in flying at us. We cant really keep him out the best we can do is bait out an option by dash dancing. Watch out for QD wavedash forwardback f tilt. F tilt is a crazy good spacing move and covers a lot of area that is relatively hard to punish. Overall your gameplan is to dash dance then punish an option out of QD with a djc bair back most of the time a grap. Watch out for that back air cause that move comes out sooo fast and hits like a truck. You really gotta respect him in neutral its not too easy.,20PSI,d0lrda2,2,t5_39xmi

7899113,0,t1_d40kdwz,This is going to be the thing that will make you hate life. You cannot approach eachother without overcommitting and we both have ways of stuffing out eachothers approaches. So its going to be a complete camp fest. DD camping all day and try to look for those grab opportunities.,20PSI,d43xn3w,1,t5_39xmi
8424357,0,t1_d5j6xg3,I can sometimes catch people at the ledge with this move. If they dont tech the strong hit or DI it upwards theyre dead. Not the best option for edgeguarding but its there.,20PSI,d5ul46c,1,t5_39xmi
8616987,0,t1_d6c4u7n,  Not a particularly great OoS option because of its startup time but you can catch some unsafe moves with a DJC Bair OoS.  BairgtJabFoot hitbox is an ok frame trap for when you Bair your opponents shield. You can mix that in uadelrune and uflash s ideas for some shield pressure options.,20PSI,d6iq098,1,t5_39xmi
