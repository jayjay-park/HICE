9609382,0,t3_5c9ooq,Ive run into a... strange issue with the Bandit HordeSeems that in my invading of the Bandit Horde some other faction had a similar idea and has started butchering the corpses of the already dead!Basically the Horde is listed as defeated in the attack screen but they are still holding lands even though no ones left and then some. Im guessing other factions are still raiding them and wont stop until all their lands are gone. ,WarsimRpg,d9xjwl8,2,t5_3d0y8
