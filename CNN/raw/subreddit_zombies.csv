It would put an automatic clock on the game with some kind of objective to reach like saving someone or getting information somewhere before your inevitable doom.  It would be a real feeling of hopelessness on you which some of the movies convey while also making what you do an amazing act of selfsacrifice.Zombies at this point are still dangerous but in a different way.

I like the Walking Dead.  It took a while for them to get it together.  I was about ready to quit after episode  or .  Other than the original Romero pair my favorites are Return of the Living Dead Fido  Days Later and Sean of the Dead.  I did like the remake of the Dawn of the Dead though they cheated and used Johnny Cash with their top notch opening. Thanks for the lead on a zed flick that I havent seen.  I watched Dead Snow  recently while a very bad film was pretty fun.  Could have been a little shorter.  ,zombies,crpppc4,2,t5_2qi0e

4214990,0,t3_392sez,Spray on Bed liner and duct tape in different areas. No need to armor up the chest just any area that can take a bite.Human bite isnt that big of a deal dont have the teeth to back it up. Get a finger in between the jaws and it wont feel good but yer not gonna loose that finger.No way a human bite goes through a couple of layers of duct tape. Harder to protect the face and neck with every day clothes and while a hockey helmet or motorcycle helmet works in theory absolute pain in the ass to hike all day with a helmet on your head.  A . round will not go though a tire tread wont go through a car windshield not the plastic layer on the front.. side and rear no problem. It will go through about two inches of wood.It doesnt work like a needle its a tiny little hunk of lead like  grains of lead. It deforms almost on impact it moves pretty quick but it is so light there is almost no energy transfer after impact. Now a .  swift . they move with purpose and have a little weight behind em so they rely more on hydrostatic shock rather than tissue damage. So there is no bounce around inside you.. skull rib cage etc. A head shot at  yards will kill you dead cant say I know any numbers past that. The bullet really starts to get wonky past  yards people do it.. but in a zombie scenario if they are that far away.. leave em alone... less its target practice.I would love to see myth busters do some hardcore testing on the best weapons and not that silly nerf and paint ball gun thing they did a while back. That was just silly.,zombies,cs0oyoj,1,t5_2qi0e
4227500,0,t3_39bkra,I respect George Romero a lot.  I believe he deserves his title as Father of the modern zombie.  But I also dont think he is solely responsible.  He grew up in a culture that I believe would have developed this concept eventually with or without him.  And as all ideas zombie will continue to evolve along with the culture that is actually the cause of the phenomenon.  George Romero gave us a good start.  But it is us the fans who made it popular. If you look at most zombie films including his it is not really the zombies that represent the worst threat.  It is other humans that do.  That to me is the most basic essence of the zombie story.  This continues to be the case in the Walking Dead.,zombies,cs240rl,25,t5_2qi0e

Being a Walking Dead series it will likely be squandered but its at least there.Alicia and Chris also had a very brief moment when they were goofing around in the neighbors house.

Text my wife  see if she is able to get home and what her situation is.  If the panic hasnt really set in yet I should be able to drive home.  Ill grab a few things from my desk a cup that Ill fill with water cuponoodles etc.  Ill head to the car via the snackroom grabbing some bottled water and highdensity foods.Ill take off driving keeping my briefcase in the front seat in case I have to bail and get home.  Im banking on getting the car home as it is only a couple miles.  Depending on the level of panic I might try to stop at a store on the way  theres a grocery Home Depot and a couple others probably not though.Once home the first focus is water fill the tub and any bucket I can find.  While that is going tune into local news sources and improvise weapons  havent purchased any firearms yet.  Determine if I should stay or go staying is safer but I may need to run if things get bad.

11777768,0,t3_680l07,Thanks for the heads up! Ill add this one to my list to check out.Ill return the favor. The Dead series by T.W. Brown was really good on Audio Book. It starts off feeling a little disjointed in the first book as you get to know brief spurts of a whole bunch of characters just before the zombie outbreak happens... and then the wholesale slaughter happens just like in the beginning of most of my favorite zombie movies. You start to get into the different characters and groups as the books  go on there are a lot of them. The series takes off from there. The things that hooked me on the series were There are no taboos. Just about anything that you think might happen with no more rule of law and life being relatively cheap happens at some point and there arent always happy endings. No one is safe. There is no Rick or Darryl in this series. It makes the tense moments that much more tense knowing that anyone can go down. There are not a lot of those movieesque last second improbable rescues. Sometimes mundane every day shit happens just like in real life that sends everything to hell. Because the series is long running it ends up covering the very beginning of the outbreak and thoroughly exploring every phase thereafter. Personally I love the beginning of the outbreaks and the first couple of years after for most of my zombie fiction but a lot of people like seeing how life might progress afterward and I have to admit it was interesting.For me this series is up there in quality with WWZ. Its a very different style of book but theyre in my top reads.,zombies,dgv1pte,3,t5_2qi0e
