4045319,0,t1_crhbadz,Im not a master talon main but I want to give my input if Im wrong someone else correct me.Now the only reason youre going for the inefficient combo is to make use of your passive right? Well in that case I think going w from range gt e gt aa gt q is better but still wastes your es amplification.The thing is w does not cancel the auto attack timer so while your w is travelling you are waiting for your auto attack to be ready again which gives time for the enemy to just run away from you while you almost have nothing you can use to catch them and unleash your aa gt q damage.If you really need maximum damage why not just w after your e gt aa gt q then run them down with passive enhanced auto attacks? Dont forget that it does not benefit from anything other than the base damage of the auto attacks. So only normal damage or its crits get amplified not qs bonus damage and sheen for example. And if you dont need maximum damage then still the fasted combo is better.Another reason would be that landing poing blank w when youre right behind them is very hard they might run to their tower or stay in their place you never know. But after you had aad and qd them you can see where theyre going for an easy w.,Talonmains,crheak4,1,t5_32ntp

6946488,0,t1_d13ngfb,Tiamat can be good in certain situations but after the loss of  AD in PBE its not good in ALL situations. If you buy  or  longswords and then start upgrading towards ghostblade components you get enough AD to one shot casters and if the melee minions are hurt enough you can clear an entire wave with maybe a random minion or cannon being missed. This way the wave is pushed towards them so you can roam or they push the lane back and you w again until they overstep and your jungle is nearby. Obviously building full AD isnt optimal for killing but armor pen is worthless vs minions and in laning phase against a good Mage thats what you should be focusing on until at least . The best part is that you can build all of your normal items right out of the longswords once you get out of laning phase so youre not hurting yourself at all just itemizing in a better order for what you need to be doing. ,Talonmains,d13pr3d,1,t5_32ntp

That way you could use two more abilities and still chunk peoples health way depending on the stage of the game and not on how hard he snowballs because of items.  Hed be more passive reliant than item reliant and those items would only promote build diversity to utilize his passive.,Talonmains,d248whd,1,t5_32ntp
7295502,0,t3_4evpz4,In my opinion you MUST start Krugs and Q or else you will die if you have to start top to do this having a top laner thats willing to tank for you is even better. Then you skip red do birds then scuttle then you smite red. A lot of people dont know this because the tooltip doesnt say it but red buff actually give you health regen so its actually better to start red side imo. after this you are probably still low so you should back and pick up the other half of your jungle item. After this you shouldnt have too much of a problem clearing you just need to power farm to try to hit  and look for ganks if the enemy is pushed up.,Talonmains,d27g6ai,2,t5_32ntp
7312862,0,t1_d29dy1c,Im thinking about matchups such as Pantheon mid where your mostly stuck with just poking that last hit can be quite rough to get off. Alternatively if theres a situation where you think youre more likely to play Talon as an AoE bomb instead of single target assasin e.g. they pick a Urgot or Graves as ADC DFT will outdmg TLD EXTREMELY quickly in any extended fight a single spell that hits  targets means DFT will have already done more overall damage than TLD.

Also remember that you dont have to kill your lane opponent. Yes its nice but bot lane is a better place to get kills especially with your ult.

8570144,0,t3_4syvod,I start looking for kill opportunities at level . You wont be able to kill them in one combo but thats okay if you just look for times when your enemy laner is vulnerable e.g when they use a core damagemobility skill to slowly build up an advantage and potentially get a kill.Also just keep spamming Talon and going all in until you understand his damage out put without fear of dying. It might take you a while to get a feel for his damage output but play with an odd mix of strict calculation and reckless abandon.,Talonmains,d6culaj,1,t5_32ntp
8601050,0,t1_d6gpr74,I think it is going to be more of a nerf to his overall power but will change his biggest weakness only one shotting.Talon is a really strong champion because he can snowball faster and more efficiently than any other due to his instantaneous burst. However despite what most people think his numbers arent that big throughout most of the game. What this means is if you dont snowball you do not enough damage in a burst rotation. This means you are effectively useless as you cant do anything else in the fight due to your long cooldownssquishiness and lack of survivability.In this rework he will be losing all of those strengths due to the increase of the burst window remove the AoE which isnt as important is the instakill and lose the blink. This means Talon is going to be much much slower and more predictable losing his snowball quickly ability. However because they are extending his burst window and removing this they are opening options for possible DPS and also more damage meaning he isnt useless if he loses.We dont know how much damage he will do or what tools he will he have so it is hard to say how good he will be but it seems like he will be losing his individuality in that game pattern of snowballing which will go to Rengar most likely with his new trophy system and will be getting the new niche of being able to roam the best hopefully which could go anywhere.TLDR Talon will be less snowbally and fast burst but be able to roam a lot more and will probably have better options for damage.This is just speculation but as for what his new mobility tech will be I would assume his passive will add to it but his E is probably going to be a fast dash that resets when you use it over terrain. He probably gets enhanced damage on next attack after using it too. This would make him most mobile in the jungle and Talon jungle might be a thing I would prefer him to stay in lane.,Talonmains,d6gq3n5,2,t5_32ntp
8620196,0,t1_d6j3tlt,We know this is not gonna happen because this kit has the blink on his E and it is confirmed that he will not keep it.Either way the silence on this kit is a lot shorter and his burst is slower too so its not like it was when they removed it.,Talonmains,d6j4ie0,2,t5_32ntp
8648101,0,t1_d6mlx90,That is the highest amount of damage combo. It is very predictable though and easily counterable. I usually use that in lane to trade or kill when I know the enemy cant kill me. Another issue with it is that since you are now usually between the enemy and his turret throwing your w at him risks missing the backswing as he walks towards his tower.There are alsoThe safe combogt E gt R gt W gt AA gt Q gt TiamatThis ensures the enemy cant counterattack unless they have a pink ward or red trinket. The reliable combogt W gt E gt AA gt Q gt Tiamat gt R gt AA gt QThis one is great for when you have a lot of time for example when you gank bot lane and the enemy laner is far from their turret and you come up from the side. Delaying the use of e allows for them to use flashother mobility spells before you gapclose.Keep in mind that your ult is an incredible tool for getting away. Dont use it if you dont need to. There are a lot of situations where you should delay its use. Especially against Zed waiting for him to use his ult first is absolutely key in order to beat him v because it lets you wait out the bonus damage window.General tipsI recommend you learn early how to control waves. If you can roam while also only losing a couple of creeps youll gain a massive advantage. Even if you only scared the enemy laners it can give a lot of breathing room to your other lanes.Remember that you will be less useful as the game goes to ultralategame. Competent supports and skilled carries will be able to prevent your burst so try to win as early as possible. That means never play to get kills play to get objectives. Your first objective should be to get the three outer turrets down. Bot tower is a prime target for that because killing both bot laners usually means a downed turret. This is especially important now with the new gold bonus. If you manage that first dragon is usually also yours. Every now and then run back to your lane and grab the accumulated minions then roam again.Always look at the map and try to find out where the enemy jungler is. If he is top grabbing his golems he isnt gonna be able to prevent your bot dive. If he is a his gromp you might be looking at a v under their turret. That is not favourable. Information is key so get a blue trinket in order to scout ahead and learn the standard jungle paths.If I think of more Ill write it down.,Talonmains,d6mmhoq,1,t5_32ntp

This assuming he wants to work aloneWhile its true that he falls off as time goes on a decent Shaco will never attempt to solo someone unless extremely far ahead Shacos strength lies on opponents thinking they are fighting on a  v  situation while in truth they are disvantaged with them realizing only after they lost half health from Shaco burst. This without even talking about all the utility his skills bring as wellObviously bad Shacos bring almost nothing to their teams but that goes for any champion especially with those that have both strong abilities and skill requirements I dont think anyone does not know as an example about the infamous bad Lee Sins Yasuo and Bards that can both stomp or fuck up depending on the player. If the matter is however only about good Shacos and bad Shacos that does not change the fact that his kit brings an immense lvl  kill potential burst good build versatility utility and skills that can be used in multiple waysThe only factor that balances him is most probably the skill you need to play him but if you master him you took a good amount of counterplay away from him,Talonmains,d8w8k8k,1,t5_32ntp

11335104,0,t3_61rvo4,Im only S but heres what I do in TF matchups  Pay attention to Gold Card CD. Zone and either harass or look for all in when its down. Hes pretty mana heavy early if he uses Q a lot. Pose forward if he uses Blue Card to sustain.  I get QSS after GB. Activate GB. Walk forward W instant cleanse the gold Card QRAA for kill.  Pay attention to pushed lanes. Always be walking into the river after you push your lane so you can get a head start to match TFs rotation or take a trade and gank the opposite lane.  Factor in the seekers and early cloth armors in allins. This actually messes me up in a lot of lanes because I think I can kill them just to realize they have two cloth armor lulIm gonna take cleanse next time and see how that feels early game. ,Talonmains,dfgtbnu,5,t5_32ntp
11379214,0,t3_627abt,Depends on what part of the game you want to win.  Early game fizz can handle talon very well  but overtime talon gets an edge outside of team fights. In my experience someone well versed in how talon works can win the Akali V Talon matchup. You have a decent bit more v and skirmish potential later on if you can win lane,Talonmains,dfltce0,1,t5_32ntp

11630002,0,t3_65pxlr,damn no and frankly i doubt most dedicated Talon players want him reverted at this point. The only overall possible negative that can be gleamed from the rework is that he got changes. Its pretty hard in the grand scheme of things to argue that they werent for the better both in terms of game health and funskill expression.,Talonmains,dge9ujf,1,t5_32ntp
