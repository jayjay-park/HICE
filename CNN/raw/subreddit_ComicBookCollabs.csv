Stuff such as colours style and angles could be left for the artist although you can suggest ideas too if it will help start things off.

I tend to agree. Most of the time its best to contain a page to  panels. In this case I was using the smaller panels and more of them to rack up the tension. You know like how shorter terser sentences can heighten action in writing eg The door opens. A knife scrapes along the wall. I hold my breath and pray. vs Hiding in the closet I hear the door open and a knife scrape along the wall. I hold my breath praying the murderer wont find me.Thoughts?,ComicBookCollabs,culr0u2,1,t5_2t6p2

8666423,0,t1_d6mh1xj,Thanks so much for the detailed feedback! Really appreciate you taking time to read the script and give me some critique. Im always of the opinion the more the merrier when it comes to feedback so no need to apologise for length!  In regards to your commentsPages  Completely agree with you reCreed. To be honest the reference was pretty self indulgent.  Pages  Amma isnt a massive character  but she is there to ground Rose and be a sounding board for Roses troubles working at ValUBuger. Amma will also have a brief story line which will start in issue two where she tries to catch one of the hudufolk which will play into the main arc. That said I completely agree with your comments regarding the length of the scene definitely feel like I can make it leaner and more to the point. I think it probably meanders a bit too much currently. Page  Glad you liked the descriptions! Hoping to try and pack in background jokes they some of my favourite parts of shows like The Simpsons or comics like chew. Also regarding Fran saying the line twice that was totally a mistake thanks for the pick up have now fixed it. Unfortunately despite my best efforts I am not a great editor!Page  Great point about the overuse of dialogue. I definitely need to make sure Im letting the pictures do the heavy lifting in terms of the comedy.Also a great point about Nathans introduction. Jim Zub wrote a great bit on his blog about how the weirdest part of writing Skull kickers was explaining the joke in the descriptions to the artist but how it was crucial. Definitely need to make sure Im explaining my gags in the script where I can so its clear for the artist.Page  Havent seen Birdman but regardless thats a really good point and illustration. Just comes back to me needing to let the pictures carry more of the comedy instead of using redundant dialogue.   amp To answer your question in short yes! Although the outline is constantly evolving and I am planning on rewriting the entire  issue outline before diving into the second draft lol. For a more itemised response I had written about a page and a half of outlines and I also broke down the issue into scenes noting how many pages each scene should take and the purpose function of each scene happy to send you the google doc if you are interested in process stuff. That said despite all this outline I still rewrote the the first part of the script around  or  times before I was happy with it.Thanks again for your detailed feedback. I cant stress how helpful it is. Would love to get you to look at the second draft if your interested  when I write it which could be a little while and please feel free to dm me if you have anything you would like me to take a look at and provide feedback for on.

9472350,0,t3_5ahgu1,Frank Millers Wolverine series is st person. As for TV shows Scrubs was st person. Im not sure I understand the problem either. st or rd person in comics is just the narrator unless you are worried about being able to visually see your lead characternarrator. So if the worry is we would see the comic literally from the narrators eyes so we dont see the main character that could still work unless you want to see the character in action. That reminds me of an old Mash episode where we never saw the patient and everything was from his point of view. Could work but the noteworthy part is that the patient wasnt one of the main characters so it functioned like rd person narration. For comics written in st person the art is still drawn as if in rd person. ,ComicBookCollabs,d9go77w,1,t5_2t6p2

10268766,0,t3_5mtkt9,Good post!I think someone should also make a tips for artists looking for writers too!  They fall into an entirely different set of traps and although it is hypothetically easier for them to get partners I think a lot of them may end up with the wrong ones due to misrepresenting their projects.,ComicBookCollabs,dc80rgl,-2,t5_2t6p2

10414996,0,t3_5mtkt9,Good points. I would like to add that if you are just starting as a writer you will not have much luck getting someone to draw your  page epic in the hopes of profit later. You will have more luck with  to  page stories since the time investment is smaller. Plan to do some anthology submissions the exposure is better for the artist and writer than just putting out an ongoing with no user base.I would also develop your social media presence. Not that Im a Twitter snob but if you only have  followers it is questionable whether you will be able to promote and get the collab in front of eyeballs.,ComicBookCollabs,dcolw0p,2,t5_2t6p2

11318234,0,t3_61ifyp,Congratulations on taking the first step!But you should have something to offer the artist working on your passion project or atleast give tangible reasons why they should have confidence in you.  Sometimes the best way is just to practice writing short comic scripts  pages and then show them as examples.  Eventually you might get a bite from a beginner artist.  If you have little experience passion projects generally come a little later after you have built up some skills in writing.  Although everyone can do it writing is a skill and not everyone is skilled in writing especially script writing.   You would inspire confidence in others by practicing and showing examples.,ComicBookCollabs,dfewiv0,3,t5_2t6p2
