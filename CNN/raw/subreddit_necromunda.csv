307962,0,t3_1xlrft,Well I had just watched the Matrix when I went to create my first gang so black delaques lead by Morpheus were the name of the game. I just loved the trenchcoats so much.,necromunda,cfcos0t,3,t5_2t8ja
4852135,0,t3_3hbzi9,Probably not... Tho it is quite a lot of kit for a new gang. Also bolt weapons dont have great ammo rolls so you might want your second weapon to be something more reliable like a laspistol close combat weapons mean  attacks in close combat. Dont think a pistol would count though... Could be wrongYou can definitely shoot at down and pinned fighters! There is a rule about having to select any standing enemies in line of sight as a target above a pinned fighter even if closer. I like to forget that rule sometimes tho!Pretty sure thats all correct. Sure someone else will be able to confirm,necromunda,cu65bub,2,t5_2t8ja
6561147,0,t1_czxtmkx,Hmm OK.  A mix of the two would be cool... maybe paint the edges red to represent a cut through wall like you see with cutaway diagrams even include some portions of the wall where it would not block had access.  Other places have some wide open atriums..  Hmm may have to work something up...,necromunda,czxz6rf,2,t5_2t8ja

9781381,0,t3_5f89ph,The gang I want is the Spyrers. Those models have not aged well.From the initial box set its got to be escher. Have you seen some of the Toughest Girls in the Galaxy models in the Jailbirds range. Thats what Id be hoping for. Pretty much the perfect look but updated. ,necromunda,dairpqj,3,t5_2t8ja
