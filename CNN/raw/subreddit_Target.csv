What is the process you use to maintain them or who do I need to have my higherups email to get the printer heads cleaned? It seems a quarter of the truck was picked with unscannable labels and typing in that many DPCIs is annoying when you shouldnt have to do so.Also as a TM who has sent hundreds of sweep trailers is there anything that I may be doing wrong or could do to make your job easier?

Not providing a resume might hurt you even though as others have stated its not really necessary for an entry level jobBut think about what it says if you do decide to make it.it shows that youre considerate professional and willing to put in extra work beyond whats required youll stand out.it gives you an opportunity to present information that you want to get across but might forget to mention in the somewhat stressful interview setting. When youre put on the spot its easy for important things to slip your mind but spending a few hours thinking about the wording of a resume gives you total control and leaves nothing to chance!Im glad to see youre turning  soon and therefor have a chance at backroom.

7431786,0,t3_4h2art,I like to push the debit card more. If they say no and I see theyre using a debit card to pay I just chime in and say something like Not to be pushy but just in case you didnt know Target also offers a debit version of our Redcard. It works just like your bank card and you save  right from your checking account.Often theyll be surprised and say that they didnt know that and ask me more about it. Then you can ask if they happen to have their checkbook on them and if they do bam! Easy redcard. Most guests dont know theres a debit option they just think its a credit card and say no because of that.Worst case scenario theyll usually smile halfway and say that they did know but thank me anyways. Ive found tossing the not to be pushy in first helps wonders for people getting annoyed. Ultimately though its just a lot of luck unless you happen to be extremely good at persuasion. Dont let them make you feel bad for low redcard numbers because chances are most of the front end has similar numbers. Target has extremely high goals for redcards. I used to feel really bad only getting  redcards a week until I peeked at the stats for the front end and saw that most of the cashiers had either none or less than  cards that week. Only  cashiers had over .Youre never going to be hitting the goal they set unless you get extremely lucky or like I said youre very skilled at persuading people. Id have to get  redcards every shift to reach that goal. Thats just ridiculous and never going to consistently happen.,Target,d2my3ie,5,t5_2s7xv

As a member of the team who also owns a good bit of TGT stock in my K I like to come at this as an investor as well. Some thoughts Our margin is way too small to be Googleextreme workplacequality example. Bloodthirsty competitors closing in from all sides and the biggest threat is digital. I think that as a company stiving to build a system with easily replaceable cogs is of extreme value... A question though does thorough and dedicated work sell that much more more than OK work? Today its so much more about having the right products instantaneously available. The first half of that process requires the right balance of experience and brilliance the second half requires a pulseexaggerating. So to my eye it would seem financially irresponsible to maintain expensive employees. If it can be done more cheaply and if the difference at the margin is negligible then the market will dictate that we either do it or risk our solvency.

Being hardlines you arent going to have as much interaction with guests in my opinion. If youre introverted cashiering is going to be a nightmare especially going into the holidays. Cashiering requires that you sign someone up for a target credit or debit card every shift so you are required to be very friendly and outgoing and push these cards on every single person you ring up. Hardlines is essentially a salesperson. You assist guests when they ask for help stock the shelves and work out carts of items that have been returned or found randomly in the store to their correct location. After you become experienced you may be given projects to work on. And you will get paid minimum wage for cashier hardlines and softlines because theyre all starting positions. ,Target,d9z2j8m,6,t5_2s7xv

10536598,0,t3_5qjt4s,I work at the FDC in Denton TX.  Ive trained several guys this past year who were hired during October through December as seasonal workers.  Out of the  seasonals I trained  of them are now fulltime.  Id say out of those  the average time they transitioned from seasonal to fulltime was less than  days.  The pay increase to fulltime also applies when youre offered that position.The Denton FDC is a little weird in how they change someone over from season to fulltime.  Theyll look at how well a new hire is doing the first few weeks and make a decision to keep them as a seasonal worker or offer them a fulltime position.  Ill also add that this was the first year we started offering seasonal positions.  I think they were scared people would just quit if they realized how much work theyd be doing for less pay.  So they would quickly hand out fulltime job offers once they were there for a few weeks.  Hope this answers your question.,Target,dd2fufd,1,t5_2s7xv
