817267,0,t3_23hq5j,Its hard to know how to give feedback without knowing all the details about you and your Sir so take this with that grain of salt!I would say breathe. Breathe deep and slow and relax. We all make false assumptions sometimes Sirs and subs alike. You can take this time to care for yourself andor you can ask for your Sir to give you some TLC. Subbing takes up SO MUCH of our endorphins that sometimes for a day orseveral days afterward were incredibly susceptible to stress and negativity! You will likely feel differently soon.As for hesitating to say your safeword remember that you were doing that because you wanted to please him and only after the fact did you learn that he approves more of people saying no when they need to... Youre not a mind reader all you can do is learn eagerly how to better please your Sir  Can you relish this difficult time as an extreme learning opportunity and beg your Sir to teach you? ,SubSanctuary,cgx6cp2,2,t5_2wojc

1139615,0,t3_273nv4,My dom and I both have visual cues for when either of us is interested. Its helped us both out for figuring out howwhen to initiate to be honest. Were not  and him figuring out when its appropriate to approach has been just as difficult as me asking for what I want.When Im feeling subby I disrobe and kneel for him. Even if hes not immediately interested in doing a scene he at least knows thats how Im feeling and is a bit more attentive. For him its taking off his belt and leaving it on the bed. A little thing but it helps me know when its okay to approach.Other times are a bit more direct and I try to verbally initiate. We might snuggle on the couch and hell stroke my hair. I might move my face a bit so hes stroking my cheek and Ill throw out something like You could slap me if it pleases you. Its open ended enough that he doesnt have to move past that if he doesnt desire it and I dont feel rejected if he doesnt. I try to frame that kind of thing as I could be interested in x if you want it rather than You should do this thing because I say so.  It might seem small but it really helps set up the dynamic.,SubSanctuary,chxtg07,2,t5_2wojc
1170137,0,t3_27g2ye,I can totally understand. Most people dont actually fit the role for me but if they do its very sub thought inducing. Above everything else make sure your health and your heart is safe. Think of public as a place were your safeword still works. Say it in your head and end the scene if things are getting overwhelming then get yourself out of the situation and to somewhere were you can collect your thoughts.,SubSanctuary,ci19ecs,4,t5_2wojc

1702596,0,t1_cjtpifx,gt That said whats not normal is having a partner who tells you one thing he also said.....he wouldnt sleep with her and then does it anyways.When I asked about that he said it was before he realized she changed as a person and had some interest in kink.  I can kind of understand that as people do change but it hurt to be told one thing and then have the complete opposite happen.  He hid from me that he was talking to her that way and I only found out because I accidentally saw a message on his phone  and then after the first time they slept together he didnt tell me until almost a week later.  When we talked about it he understood why I got so upset he hid it from me I like to know about things when they happen but he was trying not to stress me out before my nursing exam.  Like I said Ive been stressed and depressed lately he knows and I feel like Im being treated like a ticking bomb thats going to go off at the next shake.  I get that he doesnt want to upset me.  I just dont really understand why I have to have things hidden from me because it stresses me out more guessing whats going on.Ive not been the best about communicating on my end either and on making my wantsneeds clear but Im trying to be better.  I just dont really know how to do it without feeling like Im repeating myself and just getting the same reassurance over and over.  I feel like its emotionally exhausting being around me sometimes.  Ive been told it isnt the case when I brought it up but now with this whole thing I feel like hes saying that to try to keep me calm.Sorry if Im rambling its just nice having someone to talk to about this that isnt him.  I dont really have any kinky friends lol           ,SubSanctuary,cjtrw7v,1,t5_2wojc

2036511,0,t3_2hpsbh,I have not commented in this sub and created this account to speak here.  If I am out of line Mods please delete.  I am just starting to explore the Ds roles and read here to get insight into my subs world.  OP first Im truly sorry you went through this it is no way to start a relationship.  I am saying this is an example of the macho BS that pisses me off.  From your statements you clearly stated your preferences and desires with this idiot for  months and then he basically rapes you the first time out with you not putting a stop to it.  I am NOT saying you are at fault it is difficult for a submissive personality to object.  I am saying dump this jerk and continue to search for the loving Dom you deserve.This fool revels in your continued contact and belief he owns you.  I remind you you can only justly submit to the man who loves you enough to truly seek to fulfill your needs.  Anything else is just letting them use you.    These are perhaps harsh words and I am not your D so you do not need to listen.  Also the fact his aftercare was  minutes of cuddling just reinforces my macho jerk opinion.As your other subs have said cut the communication and get out.  You deserve much better. ,SubSanctuary,ckyoove,5,t5_2wojc

3736385,0,t1_cqhvdgy,Thanks for your reply!gt even use some sort of chastity deviceYou know I never thought of this. It could be nice to kind of make it more official and kinky that I cant orgasm as opposed to the situation now where I wont orgasm. gtBeing chained up having your leash held and being told to do yourself is more interesting.I could also talk about this with him. I like the idea of it but performing tends to provoke selfconscious feelings. Perhaps we could try it though. gtIf you like spanking etc then a good finish might be to be tied up with one in position and then spanked etc. Alternatively you could be tied on your back with the option of ice cubes...Hes mentioned ice cubes but not like that. I will mention the idea to him to see what he thinks.Thanks again!,SubSanctuary,cqi680l,3,t5_2wojc

6905612,0,t3_4a1oom,The first few times I played with Sir I didnt need aftercare.  We would just talk a bit after and it would be fine. The first time I felt the need for aftercare coming on I mentioned it during play. I said  I am going to need aftercare after this play. Once we were finished I told him what I needed and he helped me and guided me through it. You need to tell him exactly how you feel about that. You said he cares for you then he will want to know how you feel. I am sure that if he knew how you feel after he would change that! Tell him you need a bit of time with him after play time that doesnt involve play at all that you need him to help you come down. After play I like to debrief. Its nice to go over what went well what I really enjoyed and what I enjoyed less or what was more difficult for me. If he doesnt understand your need for aftercare which would be surprising and also disturbing. If you want to Dom and play you have to understand that aftercare is important and a big part of it then broach it with him by telling him you want to debrief about your play. Also a good transition for me after play is when he stops using my play names slut or whore  and he starts using my cutesy name like princess or sweetie. One last thing sorry for the long answer its longer than I expected! Tell him in advance what you think you will need. Since you are longdistance its harder to provide aftercare. For him to be able to guide you involves him in the process. I know that if I was to be really out of it at some point having him telling me exactly what to do and in what order and to verify with me that I did it would be a great help.Good luck. I hope this helps!,SubSanctuary,d0z2jxd,2,t5_2wojc

I literally hate feeling angry. It is the most uncomfortable feeling. Im not sure if I have suggestions.

10716059,0,t3_5t7p2n,Okay I just took a glance at your original post in BDSM community and I have to agree with uWillDonJay Complacency is a huge issue in a lot of relationships. Spanking is my Daddy and my goto punishment even hard spankings turn it into funishment but that literally is something we enjoy. You may want to talk to your Daddy to reinforce that you dont want to just have spankings for punishment. If he wants it to be a funishment then he should communicate that. There are so many other forms of punishment kneeling writing lines deep cleaning ... at least in my opinion. that spankings shouldnt be a goto for actual punishment.Start back with holding something to drop or a bell to ring because safewords are there for a reason. Even if you think theyre for pussies I think thats mostly due to the idea that if a sub says or does the safeword thing then they are weak or disappointing their dom. Guilt and disappointment is much better than longterm physical or emotional repair. ,SubSanctuary,ddla5wt,3,t5_2wojc
