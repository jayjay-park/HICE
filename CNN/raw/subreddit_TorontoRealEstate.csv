I would never leave something that has so much risk to it should be alright.A couple ideas...  find another lawyer seriously a closing is pretty basic law if they cant handle it find someone that can. if they want to move in request a massive deposit like . That way if they dont close you have the deposit to reduce hardship. make them buy all the appliances asis upfront upon movein for x.xx credit them the amount on the sale price.There are ways to reduce the risk so ultimately it will be up to you to decide what you are comfortable with. You could just refuse to do anything and force them to close on the contracted date that was set out in the agreement of purchase and sale you DONT have to move the date. If they want to walk over that you are entitled to the deposit or at the very least a portion of it your realtor isnt going to tell you that because they only get paid if the deal closes. And the Toronto market is pretty strong for sellers so you have the upper hand here.Best of luck!,TorontoRealEstate,cqs0afn,1,t5_2s8hg

Fixing a roof or inspecting common areas seems like a legitimate reason to me.  Why would they not let them in?,TorontoRealEstate,d3smpzi,1,t5_2s8hg
11170132,0,t1_dexxl71,Just went through only my nd bidding experience. What a waste of time and money. The seller had no home inspection no condo status report etc. but of course we had to put in a firm offer without any conditions because we dont want them to disregard our bid if the price is close to someone elses who has no conditions. I made the mistake of actually scheduling and paying for a home inspection on the first place I bid for costing  then losing out on a bidding war...Im looking for a townhouse in Toronto. Budget is k with only  down.First place was listed for k agent said based on comparables and  annual price rises a fair price is k. We bid k to try to get to round . We lost on the opening blind to someone who paid k k over asking!. Great now thats the new baseline price in the areaOk... So maybe what realtor.ca is showing as k is actually selling for k.. so I need to drop my list price filter for on realtor.ca by like k to find something thats actually in my price range. Boom found a decent place about an hour further out of town than the first one. List price is k. We bid k k over list and k over what the next door townhouse sold for last month... Itself an all time high. Nope lost again. No idea what the winning bid was but our agent said its probably over k. Wtf a townhouse out there is now going k over asking?? Since we have only a  down payment well only qualify for a mortgage for what that CMHC assessed value is. If they think we overpaid by k wed have to somehow come up with that k on our own.Cant these assholes sellers and listing agents ask a fair price theyd like to receive directly??? If its too high and no one buys then drop the list price. What if keep paying for home inspections only lose out over and over again. What if I bid too high then am fucked? I qualify for a certain mortgage based on my income and down payment... Id like to be able to use that to actually buy a place instead of being a pawn in their bidding war game.,TorontoRealEstate,dey4fcu,5,t5_2s8hg
