3667237,0,t1_cqa9mvo,Rushs presence was nonexistent that game I really hope he can show up hard this next one and bring the team back in.,teamimpulse,cqaafxs,1,t5_35lwo

4901860,0,t1_cucermn,True the Malphite pick didnt make much sense to me especially with the EliseLuluJanna who dont have reliable engage. There would have been no followup like the casters said.Anyway Tip was already guaranteed to be going to the gauntlet and imo if they really deserve to go to worlds they should be able to win whether its one bo or two.If they dont somehow turn it around roster changes for next season seem pretty likely.,teamimpulse,cucf1qq,2,t5_35lwo
4973067,0,t1_cule18n,Its a bonus to be honest. But apollo is still relatively new to the scene and if he plays one role well why change it? Dont change what isnt broken yknow. Even Piglet Doublelift Sneaky have their off days and honestly the level of adcs in NA went up with the addition of piglet along with doublelift sneaky even altec is considered a very good adc,teamimpulse,cule4m9,1,t5_35lwo
5687244,0,t3_3t0nzc,Theres rumors that Apollo is going to Dignitas and Rush to C...I dont even like C and I dont care for Dignitas ,teamimpulse,cx2238x,2,t5_35lwo
6105422,0,t1_cyjjpj9,They probably tried to sell the spot and then got stuck with this. Looking at the other rosters in NA itll be a miracle if this roster avoids autorelegation or wins a game. Gotta give them a chance though. Maybe one of the new teams will implode and Impulse will overachieve. ,teamimpulse,cyjmhag,1,t5_35lwo
