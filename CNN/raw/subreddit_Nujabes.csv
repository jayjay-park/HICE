4056760,0,t3_36zx44,Luvsic pt.  will be  nujabes song if i had to choose just one. I have probably listened to this song over  times for the past  years since i first discovered it when i was downloading random japanese songs from megaupload. I have listened to it countless times during all my college years especially when i have been struggling emotionally and academically. The beat and the rhythm of the song just calms my nerves and emotions down just as if i were meditating. The piano sounds  the scratch noise synchronizes very well to the mood it wants to deliver to the listeners. The lyrics although i feel that the words dont really have a solid meaning or theme i feel it speaks about how life with music can help to enjoy life in the most simple way that life does not have to be so complicated. Either way im listening to this song while typing this and i still feel fresh by the sound of it. ,Nujabes,crip8t2,3,t5_2skx3
