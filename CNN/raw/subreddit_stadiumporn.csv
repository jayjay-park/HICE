118946,0,t1_ceryrzb,Yeah the seats were terrible. Couldnt see any of the game stats  time gameclock down score... Sadly the Coliseum is not a great stadium for good seats. Even front row seats are quite far from the action. The upper level seats are in a different zip code.,stadiumporn,cerz4th,6,t5_2sx4d
