1988473,0,t1_cksrchl,Oh man give me action scenes! Actually I dont care for the physical endurance comps so much either unless there is a fun aspect to it. I dont prefer comp beasts either but mostly because I like players who realize that winning comps is not the only way to win the game. Which I guess would basically boil down to schemers who know the value of a good social game. They definitely make for a better game in my opinion.I think making advertising more on the main BB sub would help a lot. Im really glad I stumbled on a comment for it today or I would have had no idea it exists. Especially getting comments in when people talk about rewatching episodes or seasons. I will definitely help spread the word. What options are there for doing the poll? Would it just be a self post where we updown vote our favorite ideas? Or an actual poll that we go to? The first option seems like it would be a lot easier but an actual poll would be more fun especially getting some stats about everyones favorite seasons and players. Would they be ok with posting the poll or a link to it over at the main sub? Thank you for asking my opinion on this. It is very exciting to see the start of a new subreddit like this. I am very hopeful that it takes off!,BBrewatch,ckst8b3,3,t5_2xub9
2107624,0,t3_2j20e5,I would love to see a similar HOH comp in the first week again. I think this cast is obviously a lot tamer than newer ones. I can see a comp like that really firing people up.,BBrewatch,cl7q3d2,3,t5_2xub9
