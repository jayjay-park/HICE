1238258,0,t3_289i0w,If you can afford it I would recommend joining Us fan club now before the album comes out.  They offer advanced ticket sales to members and you get priority depending on how long you have been a member.  The shows tend to sell out in a matter of minutes so being a fan club member can be an invaluable tool for getting tickets.  Ive done it for the past  tours and its been great.  They also send you cool swag like free CDs of rare material and books.  ,U2Band,ci8x548,3,t5_2uivf

1937523,0,t1_ckmiukv,Yeah those extremes Angel.. angel or devil are typical of the internet and a small but very vocal minority where comments feed articles and articles feed comments. There is a pretty good thread on the front page critiquing an article with the title How U became the most hated band and most people see it as ridiculous hyperbole and the discussion is pretty rational and restrained. The old argument All publicity is good publicity may well apply here because its got Us name out there again big time with everyone discussing their music and where they stand in the music Parthenon. I wouldnt put it past some sneaky PR person to have concocted this whole thing. ,U2Band,ckmnw3g,2,t5_2uivf

8867277,0,t1_d7djhef,The fulllength Gimme Some More Dignity Remix is just so so brilliant. Honestly I really miss the adventurous ambitious side they showed from  to about . I feel like POPs reception still haunts them. Just off the top of my head you had A million remixes of Even Better Than The Real Thing that were explicitly produced and put out there as drag queen anthems in a time when AIDS and homosexuality were seriously frowned upon and well the most fucking perfect wordplay ever Touring with Rage Against the Machine and Run DMC Those soulcrushing conversations with the guy in Sarajevo midconcert for ZooTV Video Confessions Getting the jump on the critique of numbness through mass media by like  years Passengers.  Pavarotti.  NUMB for Gods sake.And yes that Dennis Hopper POP special was the worst thing ever made by anyone since Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings poetry recitals. And yes their reaction to POPs bad reception and stressful releasetour was a lot of great safe albums. And their stage designs are ever more spectacular. But they just are not pushing limits like that anymore and at this point I doubt they will again. So its not surprising that anyone under the age of  only knows them as the Beautiful Day band perhaps as another flavor of Coldplay. Thats not a bad thing but neither is it a great thing. ,U2Band,d7dq0iz,9,t5_2uivf

11075403,0,t3_5xdzd1,I am a huge Pop fan.  U in the s were adventurous delivering perhaps the most exciting trio of studio albums for a stadium rock band with Achtung Baby Zooropa amp Pop.  Sadly since Pop was not as well received as they hoped they regressed into the s and things were never quite the same.  There are songs I like from the posts but that boldness is missing.  Songs of Innocences back half was pretty strong and shows the band is still up for it if they want it.  Pop is just incredible.  A side of U weve never quite seen sexy.  If You Wear the Velvet Dress is unlike any other U song and quite the seductive track.  Mofo is a banger so groovy.  Then youve got Do You Feel Loved Discotheque Please Gone Staring at the Sun If God Will Send His Angels Wake Up Dead Man.  This is some of Bonos most personal and direct songwriting with some truly brilliant lyrics.  Edge was inventive as ever here.   Even the clunkers Miami and The Playboy Mansion I like.   I think Miami has a creepy bizarre vibe to it  like a perverts alternateuniverse travel advertisement for southern Florida found that online somewhere sounds apt which I really adore.  Not to mention Edges guitar work on it is killer.  The Playboy Mansion has a chill vibe to it with dated lyrics but I still can get milage out of it.  The not so great tracks here top the awful tracks on their posts albums.  Its hard to pick a favorite U album but Pop could be it certainly in my top  as Im a huge s U fan.  Their work in this decade including the stellar Passengers album is undoubtedly special.  ,U2Band,dendxvl,5,t5_2uivf
