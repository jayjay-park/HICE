4274714,0,t1_cs67mlw,Yeah I agree. My only wish was that they had grinded the game before XGames. I feel like they couldve easily gotten a medal had they not lost out on those  days of practice right before XGames. As much as I like Kap and Chris I feel like they could definitely get two better players to take their place. Comparing Kap amp Chris to the players on OG or even FaZe I feel like they kind of lose that match up most of the time. As long as Denial doesnt pick up Haggy I think I will be able to deal with whoever Clay amp Attach choose to team with. ,Clayster,cs7h8gg,2,t5_32uon
