984702,0,t3_25dphm,. Get the best adviser you can as soon as you can. I had a shit adviser early on and it contributed to me having to attend an extra year.. Be extremely active and dont procrastinate. Join clubs relating to the career field youre going into as soon as you can. It will help you meet people and SHOW youre interested in your field. Talk to all the teachers you can within your department and find research opportunities. Youve got to ask around for research opportunities  WKU does a shit job at emphasizing this IMO.. If youre someone who parties make sure that is absolutely secondary to everything else. If you dont youll be looking back and saying Damn I wish I didnt fuck up early on but it will be too late to change it. . I personally never joined any fraternities and have not noticed advantages in doing so. Theyre more of a social thing IMO and not to be prioritized. If they dont distract you from your classes and your club meetings join it if you want or dont.. I dont recall when you can apply to move into the dorms but stay the hell away from PFT. Its by far the worst dorm.. Dont plan on taking a year or semester off. People who do this rarely come back.. Ask the professors as many questions as you can to make sure you understand the material . Youre not stupid if you ask them youre stupid if you dont.All that said good luck. Im graduating now with a decent GPA . but because I didnt join a lot of clubs didnt ask around about research opportunities and had a shitty adviser who just told me to look at the curriculum for your major instead of taking an active interest in helping me Im regretting it. ,WKU,chg7vfi,6,t5_2s3w3

3857744,0,t1_cqw0bok,I dont THINK its likely to be mulch. Mulch can stink and all but this smell is pretty distinct. I was actually beginning to get concerned that one of my older neighbors might have passed away or something until I smelled the same smell on the other side of town. Im used to Hills smelling pretty awful but its usually a cat fooddog food kind of smell not straight up dead animal. Unless theyre doing something new its not that. ,WKU,cqw0nym,1,t5_2s3w3
4995875,0,t1_cunuuia,Hmm not so sure about the reward potential as my reward is generally just a campsite at the end of a trail.  If you make the drive up stop by the visitor center and pick up a map.  There will probably also be someone there who can share more about day hike kind of stuff.,WKU,cuo6tie,1,t5_2s3w3
10366779,0,t3_5od6bd,I just finished a winter course in Statistics Econ  with Alexander Lebedinsky spelling? and it was incredibly easy. All of the practice quizzes were exactly like the exams. I got a  on the first two exams with little to no effort because I recognized all of the answers from the practice quizzes. ,WKU,dcj4xij,2,t5_2s3w3
