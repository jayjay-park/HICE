3719386,0,t1_cqg88il,Then were left with a bunch of bastards who know fuck all about cheese and are unlikely to branch out and try new kinds because theyve been coddle with mozzarella their whole lives. Every other cheese now offends them in every way because theyre so used to tasting chewy plastic that any other flavour is raping their mouths.And there are no cheese stores here. Our dairy industry is run by the mob.Because I like my food either in my mouth or on my plate not in the air vaguely between me and the rest of what Im eating.Is it argument time again?,RPBleach,cqg8ixk,1,t5_2z7eh
