252923,0,t1_cf6yggw,Yes I remember that episode pretty well. I always saw it as more about the character of Ginsberg as an artist. Not someone mentally ill but someone with a creative mind and a troubled past. The martian monologue is more about his inability to believe that he was born in a concentration camp and that hes more comfortable with a story about him being an alien than the truth. I guess Im reading into it but I think Season  is primarily about the lies we tell ourselves and others in order to get along in our lives. A Little Kiss reveals a lot about Don and Megans relationship behind the scenes while showing us their public persona as husband and wife and I feel like the season follows this theme of what is realfake. I didnt take it literally more as a metaphor for his scatterbrained sensibility.Think about Rogers arc in this episode there are a lot of talks about truth and reality when hes with the aciddropping intellectuals. Then he takes the acid and sees things that arent there but in that mess of hallucinations he and Jane discover the deeper truth of their marriage and the pain theyre both in. I think I tend to see that and equate the episode with metaphor and artifice simply because that seems to be the theme. As Pete Campbell says to Trudy Its all about what it looks like,madmen,cf6yxf8,14,t5_2r7l7

Later in the season we will hear about Watergate and Nixons subsequent resignation.  Last season may have given us some foreshadowing to this event when Joan tried to fire Scarlett for lying about ditching work early without clocking out and then attempting to cover up her lie.

If the theory is correct then the show telegraphed its intentions too much and the joy of discovery is lost. If the theory is incorrect then people get angry that the show inserted a host of perceived red herrings to throw them off the trail.

I couldnt tell you if CocaCola hires one agency to do their marketingresearch and then hire a different agency to run the campaign but its done that way too.

Hes old but hes dabbling in the things young people enjoy. Hes an antiquated being stuck between being obsolete and adapting to new eras.Hes a drastic change from ginsberg who couldnt cope with the emerging times and was finally triggered into going full Schizobipolar. It further illustrates Dons conversation with the computer man. and how he doesnt need a campaign. The computer man isnt selling computers. Hes selling the future. Hes selling hope. Don understands that everyone buys into that it doesnt need a slogan or catchphrase.

1449615,0,t3_2apufe,The show is very true to life and in life few people find happiness. I dont expect the show to end with a happy Don but characters like Roger and Sally will probably end up with more upbeat endings. Happiness is just... satisfaction with what youre doing with your life. I think some characters are able to find that and some arent.I mean the conceit of stories is that they end. Whereas real life never ends until you die. So any happy ending is going to be artificial in nature. And I dont expect Weiner to go overboard with it.I do have a theory that Don will forget all his highfalutin ambitions and just focus on doing good creative work and connecting with the people around him maybe for the first time in his life... but its hard to say if thats the direction Weiner wants to take it or if even that would make Don happy.,madmen,cixzgqx,4,t5_2r7l7

2151378,0,t1_cld8qyh,I think he had it down perfectly. Playing Don is and always was playing  people the exterior veneer of the glib ad man that is an absentee father that he puts up and the broken person inside that doesnt know how or why anybody could or would want to love him. And just like a comedian who mines his own depression for jokes Don mines the feelings he wants in his own life to sell products i.e. The Carousel and Hersheys pitches are the clearest examples of him selling the feelings he wishes he had and they conveniently serve as emotional bookends for his character as well.He may not have needed to show both sides of Don in the pilot but between his interactions with Rachel Menken Adam and the Carousel pitch we see beneath the veneer.

3446498,0,t3_2zoarq,gt When Jim learns of Coopers death he immediately launched into damagecontrol mode trying to gain leverage and control over the direction of the company. He lacked compassion in the situationNot unlike how Bert handled Rogers heart attack in S by coercing him to come in and meet with Lucky Strike thus suffering another episode and reassuring LS behind Rogers back that Don is still in place and everything is OK. With the exception of Teds reaction to Gleasons death I think Cutlers response to Bert is on par with how everyone in the agency responds to death very businesslike. I dont know that the show is trying to show a right or wrong way to handle death just a wide range of responses between people and within people. Its hard to say how Don ultimately feels but I think we can accurately say that like everything his personal feelings and his business feelings are different so were seeing those conflicting feelings on his face. I dont think well know for sure how he completely feels about Bert until the show returns. ,madmen,cpl4kvs,1,t5_2r7l7
3446828,0,t1_cpl3gte,I honestly felt that season  had a more ominous quality on the whole and it was sometimes hard to commit to the descent in  because the show took pauses from it which is fine and a very Mad Men thing to do but I honestly think that if you started the season after The Doorway you would have lost nothing except some cool scenes even without changing a word in the following episodes. The season made more sense to me conceptually on the latest rewatch  for example Betty helping Sallys friend established the theme of being a parent to others kids which paid off when Don wanted to help save Teds kids in the finale  but there were things there that felt a bit less inspired than what came before and after it. Petes moms death for example even though I loved most of the Bob Benson arc was a really outlandish moment that didnt even serve the story much as the news arrived via telegram and lead to a comedic moment between Pete and his brother that interrupted the feeling I got from Don confessingbeing firedshowing the house to the kids and that was in what is probably my favorite season finale overall. I like the darkness of it but The Crash was one of the only episodes that went ballsout with the confusion and craziness of the year the season purported to reflect. Dont get me wrong its a fantastic season of television but parts of it felt like slightly lesser Mad Men even in terms of performances and directing. There were several brilliant episodes that were on the level of the best of the series but also moments where it felt a bit like wed been there before and moments that stretched the level of believability Im accustomed to from the series. So far season  is nailing it though ,madmen,cpl5xnl,8,t5_2r7l7
3450750,0,t3_2zmy47,I think Dantes Inferno is a giant flashing sign hey guys get ready Don is making the journey. Hes been in hell for a long time and at the end of Season  he makes full confession. This gets him to Season A Purgatory. What do people do in Dantes Purgatory? They are in an interim place where they get hassled by millions of lesser demons. If they stay the course and keep climbing they eventually get to Heaven. Don finally gave up his secrets at the end of S willingly began the ascent back up. He isnt going to die hes going to find some way to live with himself. And side note I dont know if I agree that Joans independence as a woman is a schtick as you put it that would imply shes putting on an act. I think she really is independent and especially now that shes a single mother she is independent out of necessity. ,madmen,cplm1wf,3,t5_2r7l7

3745267,0,t1_cqj2u4q,And that I generally agree with as well. Though I think how deeply Don was cut may also be up for debate. For one hes kind of a remote schizoid so the extra detachment might have softened the blow. For two hes a pretty smart guy who already knows everything is a facade perhaps he knows this includes himself. For three hes not even himself any serious flaws in the character of Don Draper can be dissociated from and Don might even be able to step out of the role and fix them.I think this only serves to draw more parallels between Don and Joan though as it gives him just as many defenses as she does.  And yet the blow still hurts.I also think this strikes on a primary reason why I think Don and Joan are the couple that always should have been yet never will be. Although Dons waters run very deep his choices in relationships have always had an element of superficiality to them. Betty was a model Megan became an actress. Don is just the handsome sort of guy who attracts very handsome women. And he has been dissatisfied because there has been nothing deeper to tie him to these women than sex and the ideal that is marriage.  Joan is one of the only women on the show who meets Dons standards of attractiveness but unlike Betty and Megan has just as much depth to her character as he does. Shes very selfactualized has a career is intelligent has control over her emotions and desires. Shes in fact somewhere in between Betty and Megan all the control and poise of Betty with all the fun and ambition of Megan. And despite all that she could have been happy as a simple housewife once upon a time.  But now they arent on the best of terms anymore in part due to Joans ambition and Dons personal issues. They both are rich enough now to just run away with each other but I think on top of interpersonal issues both of them are too disillusioned with marriage.  And at any rate Joan has only become more busy with work and Don has only become more distracted by personal issues.This post was mostly kept in isolation from other women Don may have been destined to be with.  I think Rachel Menken and Betty have also displayed many qualities of the woman who got away.  But Don also had the opportunity to be with those women which leaves something wanting when compared to the woman he never had.,madmen,cqj6opm,5,t5_2r7l7

3755475,0,t3_33f0y0,I think Don will get to a point where he realizes he is in a loop of making the same mistakes over and over in his life.

He visits his childhood whorehouse home there in PA the one he took his kids to see in the S finale and enlists his realtors help to buy it.

3804030,0,t3_33zmxn,I think the most significant theme for me was the loss of control.We have seen the partners do this beforeas mentioned this looked like it was shaping up to be Shut the Door Have a Seat pt . Except this time the partners were completely shut down. Sure they got Secor thanks to Pete softening them up sorry but after all of their efforts they essentially got a pat on the head from McCann for passing the test. They were never in control.This is clear when Don starts the pitch. As soon as he got to the head of the conference table I basically held my breath waiting for the classic Draper pitchbut he barely got a few sentences in. He was actually cut off which I dont think has ever happened and was told to sit downand he SAT DOWN! I was shocked! It seems like a small thing but Ive never seen Don relinquish control of a room like that. Except this time he didnt have a choice.And of course at the end the five partners cant hold the room. The rumblings start immediately. Obviously Harry Crane cant reassure everyone to be expected but when people arent even listening to Roger the son of the original founder its a big sign the order of things is changing and leaving the partners behind.This is the beginning of something not the end... Yeah its the beginning of a new era for Sterling Cooper one in which the partners have little say. Seeing all of the workers leaving the partners standing alone left me with a terribly empty feeling. It was thematically the exact opposite of the shot with the five partners Bert instead of Ted in this shot of a new beginning this is the end despite what Don says.So many empty rooms in these past few episodes. I cant say exactly what this means but I definitely think its worth exploring.,madmen,cqpw1u1,43,t5_2r7l7

Now Don has to sit and take notes while someone else does the talking.At McCann Jim says to Don that he wants Don to bring things up a notch but then before the meeting Don hears that the same was said to Ted.Don isnt special anymore there are other people who are doing things just as well as he can so thats why I think he goes looking for something more as you say. ,madmen,cr02o6g,10,t5_2r7l7

4028952,0,t1_crfitjm,Oh yeah that was definitely a good scene! As was the little chat between Roger and Shirley where he was forced to acknowledge that no matter how wellintentioned he was that racism in the industry was incredibly pervasive. Its a quiet little moment but I thought it landed well. Also when Joan tried to hug Dawn the day that Martin Luther King died and it was weird for everyone involved. Notwithstanding the blackface at Rogers wedding most of the white characters on Mad Men dont actively try to be racist but their prejudices are not so easy to shake... And even more tellingly those pregnant pauses are still very recognizable to us in this day and age.There really could have been a lot more moments like that is basically all Im saying.

4167975,0,t1_crv6ftv,Ill admit its poorly worded. I wasnt trying to say that these women are necessarily ably handling their problems though I would say that Joan and Peggy at least seem to have struck a balance. All of them except Joan have run away to one extent or another. But my point is that each is confronting the fact that theyve run away.Its clear from Margrets conversations with her parents that shes very cleareyed about what shes doing. Peggy is moving on but still very much owns the decision she made. Joan is sublimating a bit but handles her frustrations with the different directions shes pulled in. Stephanie wants to hear the truth even if its painful. And Diana like Stephanie immediately rejects the suggestion to turn away from the hurt shes feeling.This all contrasts with Don whose philosophy about bad things in the past is pretend they never happened. And when he starts to feel remorse or shame or guilt or struggles with those issues his philosophy is pretend its not happening and distract yourself with sex or booze or some other palliative. All these women in Season  are running away from problems but theyre facing their feelings about that headon while Don tries to ignore them.,madmen,crvcv1o,4,t5_2r7l7

4243136,0,t3_39bhj9,I didnt like it or really any of the Season  flashbacks. Sorry. I think it was just done to kind of exemplify why Don had such problems relating to and especially maintaining relationships with women. But this had already been driven home time and time again by the fact that Don only had  woman in his life during his formative years and she was abusive if not downright crazy. I think that this scene was trying to show that for Don all the affection any Woman ever showed him eventually culminated in sex. So having sex with someone he barely knew was kinda like a shortcut to intimacy and therefore some kind of validation. This is why Betty before her death declares that Bobby and Gene need a woman in their life. She knows what happens to people who dont from firsthand experience with Don.But I also think that by Season  we really didnt need that information. It was just a waste of screentime. We know Don has issues with Women since the initial Season  flashbacks,madmen,cs3wpkw,3,t5_2r7l7

4333431,0,t3_3amcy5,gt Jon Hamm is hopelessly typecast now just as Gandolfini was after The Sopranos.I sort of agree but I think Hamm has a few advantages Gandolfini didnt. Hes a much more conventionally attractive man than Gandolfini was he looks like an oldschool movie star which will still limit him in some ways but that can certainly be an advantage as well. Being typecast as guy who looks a movie star is not such a bad thing to be typecast as. The problem is that he isnt a movie star hes been in movies but he hasnt had a breakout film yet.Hamm has also showed especially in his collaborations with Tina Fey that hes a very good comic actor which is not true of all dramatic actors if he ended up as a regular on a sitcom I would watch in a heartbeat.I think that with the right role he could easily transition to film success he just hasnt really been in any great movies yet.

7421117,0,t3_4g7ukw,Im coming late to the party but from what I remember of Matt Weiners commentary on that episode Pima was the embodiment of creativecommercial success in the s. He said something along the lines of To get ahead in a creative field back then you had to hustle but also get a reputation as a bit of an eccentric. Hence the pantsuit and screwing people in the workplace I guess.Matt Weiner also said that he was thrilled to work with Mimi Rogers I got the impression that the role was written for her which may explain why the character Pima Ryan seemed like an addendum.,madmen,d2lqdy5,2,t5_2r7l7
7459884,0,t1_d2puo45,Don gets punished a lot. Hence the falling down a skyscraper in the credits. Don was punished for his identity theft by Bert getting to blackmail him into a contract handing over three years of his life. Betty punished him for the identity theft and the affairs and poor treatment by divorcing him and making it clear that hes the wrong party. Megan punished him with divorce too and then he punished himself to go along with her requests for a financial punishment with a million bucks. Joan punished him for shagging Allison with Miss Blankenship. Betty punished Don by naming their child Gene it was partly a homage to her dad but it also served as a punishment for Don. Peggy holds a threeyear grudge against him for her perceived unjust treatment from him where she makes sure to tell him in almost every interaction in S S to The Strategy that she hates him. The partners make a huge scene out of yelling him after The Letter and firing Jaguar. Bert was unusually discreet and mild about Don stepping out of line because Bert thought Don was a softie and gave Lane a bonus which is a little more forgivable and Don promised that hed take care of it which Don did by covering the money that Lane stole out of his own pocket so that solved it for everyone. However even then I think Lanes choice to commit suicide in the office with a boilerplate resignation letter was an effort to punish Don and Rebecca scolded Don alone. Sally punishes Don with boycotts against visiting him after The Beautiful Girls and Favors through A Days Work. Sally and Betty denying his wishes to have his kids live with him after Betty dies is them punishing him. These are all retributive actions where Don did something wrong and then he was punished for hit by someone. Sometimes proportional to the punishment sometimes its emphatically not but it all feels retributive. As for the shenanigans with clients Don gets away with a bunch of it because its the right business move to make and it gets clients or allows them to win their goals. Not because people are out to be nice to him on account of his jawline. With Joan and Peggy they experience bad treatment but its not retributive. The bad treatment tends to come out of the blue instead of as a direct result of their behavior and then you can evaluate whether it was proportional or disproportional. Contrast the partners making a big scene of yelling at Don for The Letter or firing Jaguar or the Hershey and no one coming to his defense against them versus only Harry being a pig about Joans prostitution and EVERY PARTNER standing up for Joan and then BertRoger calling Harry in to give him a bonus but also to make their contempt clear for him as well as Joan carrying a grudge against Harry till the end of time.  Harry didnt really undermine Joans authority. No one respected Harry for what he did. I actually think most men would be angry both ways. Most people were expecting Pete to be pissed that Peggy gave his baby away. Not because Pete wanted to leave Trudy and raise his child with Peggy everyone believed hed be pissy at that too. However people especially early Pete like feeling their selfrighteous anger. Pete being vulnerable to Peggy and expressing his love for her when it could be the end of the world and Peggy saying that she could have had him but she didnt want him case in point I had your baby and I gave it away would be something many men would angry about even if they didnt want to be a dad to a bastard kid. ,madmen,d2q54tg,2,t5_2r7l7

On an unrelated note this episode reminded me how much I hated the way Henry treated Don. Its just so disrespectful.

8025555,0,t1_d4i4jy1,I can forgive some of the poor decision in GOT making to an extent but most of the time it is a result of plot contrivance to advance the action rather than to flesh out a character. Spoilers Take Jon abandoning their plan to get Rickon. Logically very stupid but at least serves a point about his character he is stupidly noble. This works at least on some thematic level. But Sansa not telling Jon they have another  or so troops on the way and basically letting him and the rest of their army die or not giving Wun Wun any armor or a weapon or Rickon not running straight or Ramsay shooting Wun Wun in the eye instead of killing Jon or Arya walking around in broad daylight avoiding an assassin who can wear other peoples faces and then talking to a stranger or her doing parkour with a  inch deep stab wound these things had to happen in order for the plot to move forward in the way the showrunners wanted which mostly includes sweet action. Arya running around Wun Wun looking like  a pincushion ripping people apart with his hands Riders of Rohan etc. it is spectacle made possible by these previous bad decision.  It is less a fatal character flaw and more just inconsistent writing.Compare that with Don taking mystery pills from hitchhikers or telling Hershey execs about his childhood or Peggy fucking Pete or Roger marrying Dons secretary. These mistakes represent selfdestructive behavior for its own sake as a way of trying to discover the motivations behind them. ,madmen,d4i5bsp,9,t5_2r7l7

He didnt cheat on her and he didnt lie to her but he generally treated her like shit nonetheless. To start off how he initiated their relationship was creepy as fuck hitting on a monthspregnant married woman. Once married he treats her like a little girl who must follow Daddys orders or suffer the consequences yelling at her belittling her or giving her the cold shoulder. He shows petty jealousy about Don rather than trying to understand that he will always be in Bettys life as the father of her children. Even after the cancer diagnosis hes still barking at her giving orders. But that one little show of emotion seemed to change a lot of viewers minds about him that he was such a great guy. ,madmen,dah1q21,3,t5_2r7l7

It shows just how little Megan knows Don  she invited his fucking accountant with frumpy wife for gods sake in spite of Don being super vain. Of course Don was all class about it. Then she invited his underlings who she didnt consider might begrudge all the times he shit on them. She invited Roger with whom Don was having problems with at the time and based Rogs wife whom NOBODY likes. To top it all off she invites her own friends people Don doesnt know reserved conservative Don people who are a stripe apart from Don the negro homosexual they refer to  oh and Harry goddamned Crane who nobody likes either. She invites Joan last minute on the pretense of tension with Rogers child bride but doesnt consider that there could be similar tensions between others present at the party like Don and his underlings. And then the centerpiece of it all Zou Bisou. Its a chance for Megan to perform disguised as a gift for Don. Its not just that she doesnt know Don well enough to know hed be embarrassed by it its that she does it under pretense of doing a good deed and its a fucking charade for her to get attention from everyone Don knows and her little liberal arts buddies. Really its not only embarrassing to Don  shes embarrassing herself. Recall the episode Betty had to throw a party. Did she do anything other than present herself as a consummate housewife and host? She did it so well and properly that Don got the accolades for it. Don will always compare his marriage with Megan to his marriage with Betty so he knows what not to do to mess it up and Megan messes it up for him. Remember when she moves to LA? Party after party embarrassing her agent with her antics sucking off Dons teat and then not even having the decency to properly end things with him  over the phone after an awkward silence. Ive gotten text message break ups that went more smoothly than that. Megan was an immature shallow young woman who jumped at the chance to marry her boss after passing a kid test and then later on considering them a burden on her marriage and her social life. Did her and Betty ever interact alone together? I dont think they did and I would pay cash money to see Betty shit all over her and cut her down to size. Megan is the fucking worst.,madmen,dee5bf7,10,t5_2r7l7
11001125,0,t3_5wt39r,Boardwalk Empire streaming on HBO is a great show with super interesting characters plus its a period piece.Rectify streaming on Netflix also has mesmerizing characters and a subtle slow burning drama.

Don worked very hard to cultivate a specific image and he was damn good at it. They were probably incredibly uncomfortable and confused seeing him that vulnerable.,madmen,dezdts2,18,t5_2r7l7

11338148,0,t3_61rlkb,Idc if its down voted I completely agree. Peggy as a character has always been very bitter amp pissed off even when she has it good. Of course she sometimes had cause to be so but others...I am not a Don fan so I do not care when people knock him down a peg or show their contempt for him in fact I enjoy it. But Peggys attitude towards him in S amp early S was baffling to me. Don did an awful lot for her she didnt need to be indebted for life or anything but she couldnt muster even a little respect for him. And that Ted was the final straw? Married with kids Ted? She was that selfish amp entitled that she resented Don for giving him a chance to fix his life amp for calling out their relationship? And for assuming every little decision he made was about her or to spite her or mess with her... Idk. Peggy has so many negative qualities amp so many low points attitude amp behavior wise which is fine because on this show who doesnt. But Ive noticed she gets a pass from fans in ways that other characters dont that so many of these moments are celebrated as a great Peggy moment than seen for what they are ,madmen,dfh5qwr,8,t5_2r7l7

11503899,0,t1_dfzf24l,Haha. It brings back memories for me. I was born in the s and my grandmother LOVED to make those god awful jello salads with things in them. My mothers family loved to experiment with jello and marshmallows and odd combinations barely fit for human consumption.My father and I would just about die at some of the things presented on various occasions. We could not bring ourselves to eat it.About jello my grandmother born  who was super weight conscious used jello as a dessert often. I think it might have been part of the have a dessert that is not too fattening thinking. I have never looked at the history of the ads for the product but I would not be surprised if that was part of the marketing to housewives. ,madmen,dfzyu0k,5,t5_2r7l7

11730768,0,t3_67dv7k,I was thinking about this the other day.Had Duck not set up the deal he did Sterling Copper would have still been a good agency but not just as rich.Sterling Coppers hope for growth in the international market was never there because they were seen as a short term play to sell to someone like McCann.I may be remembering wrong but I always found it funny in the first few episodes they said something to the effect of how Sterling Cooper ha to pass on Firestone due to conflicts. Then later Don gives his speech about not wanting Mohawk Airlines etc and wanting Firestone.I always got the feeling had Sterling Cooper never sold out they would be poised to never always be fighting from behind,madmen,dgppogs,14,t5_2r7l7

11742272,0,t1_dgqxasx,Yeah I actually liked this scene. I remember in another unrelated scene Rogers daughter is visiting the office and he says Aw I liked your ponytail squirt. It makes you look young. I think given that context ponytails were generally seen as a youthfulchildish hair style. I think what Joan said was just a piece of advice that eventually formed a whole idea that pushed Peggy into presenting herself more maturely  revamping her appearance was part of that. She wanted to be taken seriously around the office but she was still acting and dressing like a young secretary.,madmen,dgr0lom,6,t5_2r7l7
11760194,0,t1_dgt0eg7,She also voices her disapproval of Peggy moving out of the house by saying Youre gonna end up getting raped.

11760514,0,t1_dgqs34l,I think you might be right about it being largely down to circumstances during Mad Men.
