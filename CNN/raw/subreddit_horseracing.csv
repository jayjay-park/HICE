1758925,0,t3_2em74r,This doesnt sound to me like it would be a profitable strategy. If there really were a post position bias at Saratoga like at Yonkers then it would be factored perhaps even overfactored into the final odds. The absolute best piece of advice I can give on harness racing is to read and study the lessons provided by Steve M. In my early years as a handicapping student I stumbled upon a page written by Steve M who was then the track capper at The Meadowlands. He wrote a series of posts which basically illustrated how to pick winners. The posts range the gamut from betting discipline to psychology to fractional analysis. I cannot stress how effective these lessons were. They are hands down the best piece of anything ive read on handicapping ever. Right now I am in Chile and dont have access to my computer but if you send me a PM Ill send you the link when I get back to my computer next week. If I remember correctly they were hosted on kimstarr.org and were written by Steve M. so maybe you can Google and find the page if not wait until next week and Ill send you the link. The night before I left for Chile I found a horse at Mohawk who was on my list who went off at  who won by open lengths. . He was selected largely due to the principles I learned while studying Steve Ms lessons. ,horseracing,ck0vbpo,4,t5_2qqz7
1959978,0,t1_ckozecy,We need a system similar to harness that rewards horses racing til at least  years old. Currently horses that race at  and are successful almost never race past . Win a major three year old race and most likely you head off to the shed. Its sad the sport is about racing not breeding. You could solve this over night by excluding horses who were sired by horses younger than  currently grandfather in horses already at stud.

I think a good test for the legitimacy of a great yr old is that he or she can take on older horses. To exclude a yr old from the BC Classic maybe too much to ask.  NYRA wouldnt love the exclusion of the JCGC either. The JCGC used to be the race to win to earn year end honors before there was a BC Classic. And the Pacific Classic has since its first running in  been influential on the west coast.  To keep a yr old out of any of those would be too much to ask especially the BC Classic.

American Pharaoh as well hasnt been challenged too much with a bad break but has the speed and stamina to beat anyone. I really like Materiality and Frosted in this race. Materiality didnt even leave the gate until all the horses were gone probably had the worst break in the Derby and ended up in th with a strong finish. Frosted meanwhile had a horrible break and ran the furthest distance and managed to get fourth. Like both of them hitting the Trifecta with American Pharoah.

4816677,0,t3_3fwajk,IMO this is the future of horseracing. Stories like this create excitement and connect with the newer generation.  Summary of the article  yo trainer gets his first nongraded stakes win with a yo. Trainers dad is the breeder and owner. Jockey is yo selftaught apprentice Wilmer Garcia. Forget all the talk of Baffert Pletcher Zayat Stables the Ramseys Castellano and Smith... There are others that are hungry for a piece of racing history. Is it still a tough sport? Absolutely. But there is big money involved even at the lower levels.... Still a yo trainer with his first nongraded stakes win may now look at the gradedstakes Iroquois at Churchill Downs for his next race.... So whats the big deal??? Winning the Iroquois will  give him points for the  Kentucky Derby.... and  give him an autoentry into the  million  Juvenile Breeders Cup race.Im willing to bet there are other young trainersownersjockeys out there looking for their first big win their breakthru season. This kid has a shot at greatness and would be  of only  horses with a chance when the Iroquois goes off. For racing to grow it needs new fans. Fans with an interest and appreciation. Just like music theres always a new act to follow. These new acts need support to stay with a grueling lifestyle. Their success is the future of horse racing.  ,horseracing,cu1ojlr,1,t5_2qqz7

I know why hes  on the ML and hes earned that. I just think he can be beaten. The problem is I will probably key him on top of my exotics and he will get beat. ,horseracing,cweivco,1,t5_2qqz7

8520212,0,t1_d65yynv,Also agree. To me it is all about the frequency more than anything else. With the exception of the top few trainers most trainers will not want their horses to show everything they have in them until race day. Also workouts are not  accurate because the clocker is often timing several horses at the same timehave been known to start timer late or early Some days there are  horses working in a  hour period and that is not counting the ones out for a routine gallop. I just noticed in the equibase PP that today there is a horse running that ran his last  of a milegoing   min  seconds flat which would put him about  lengths of the fastest horse ever. And he was running in a small stakes. Two others that faced better going in the same race took  seconds to run their last  which should be about right. Just sayin.,horseracing,d66l5fk,1,t5_2qqz7
8575786,0,t3_4x62ua,I think the bottom line is to do develop habits that are comfortable for you when it comes to a horses form.  For me I look at pace before anything else.  Before class connections workouts pedigree race record etc.  I truly believe that pace makes the race every time.  I divide the runners into four categories lead horses stalkers pack and closers.  I literally diagram this myself on the pps.  This helps me visualize the race and who will be where.  Then I  look at how horses generally finish races according to the splits in any given race.  Any horses formrunning line can be deceiving unless you look at the splits.  By the time Ive mapped out how the race will be run I tend to look and see which horses have the most favorable advantage due to pace.  Then Ill see if that horse is also going to benefit from any track bias.  By the time I have all that figured out thats when I go back through the pps to look at connections workouts pedigree etc.  Those things only help me push a horse over the edge or get rid of horses I might be on the fence with.  Keep in mind this kind of handicapping generally is good with horses and races with a good amount of consistency and data at good tracks.  I wouldnt do this to predict lower level horse racing or horses that havent run much.  Too many other factors play into that type of racing.  I think the best advice is to create a consistent platform for betting your races and a routine that helps you answer questions.  If you look at each race as trying to answer questions as to how the race will be won then youve got a head start.  I dont bet turf any differently than dirt except to look at how any given turf course is playing.  Everyone will and should have a different opinion on your question.  Thats what make sour sport great!  Good luck.  ,horseracing,d6dk18r,2,t5_2qqz7

One of the things that does stand out is how he uses his body even in the warmup and jogging to the gate he really curls and uses his loin muscles in a way Im not used to seeing a racehorse do. ,horseracing,dd1dj88,2,t5_2qqz7

11046603,0,t1_dek3efz,Absolutely but it takes years to figure it out on your own and many mistakes if no one points it out. I simply am trying to help others realize the game of horse racing is real and can be profitable for all who are serious. And we all will come to different conclusions a majority of the time but it is always more enjoyable when you reach that decision using your knowledge not someone who charges you for their opinion!,horseracing,dek439h,2,t5_2qqz7
11048282,0,t1_deka0oa,I think he is a good horse who has a bright future ahead of him if they can get him healthy again. But I also think we have not seen any horse that has produce their best run thus far this year which we will begin to see in the next few weeks. These next  months will determine the real contenders for the big prize and it will include several horses that has not shown much as a  YO yet at least that is what I believe. Gunnerva proved to me yesterday that he is a contender but will need to retain his fitness for another two months against better than he has raced against so far. He is bred to get the classic distance and is currently the one everyone will have to beat on the first Saturday in May.,horseracing,dekay3z,1,t5_2qqz7
11109675,0,t1_der6355,Not a stupid question at all because a majority of handicappers do not how to find them. Have you ever been on equibase website. When on their home page you will see a line of headers that will give you information on all aspects of horse racing. .Find the results header and hover over it and it will produce a drop down box of catergories available. Click on summary results and it will take you to a page that lists all thoroughbred and quarter horses tracks and date that they ran in the last month in the U.S. and includes Woodbine in Canada. Find the track you are looking for and click on the date you are wanting to find results for. It will take you to a page that lists all of that track races on the date you clicked on. Click on the squared box below to category that says charts and click on the race you are wanting to review. It list the order of finish of every horse their running lines at every call and the lengths they finishedare in front of the horse behind them. Scroll a little further down and you see another chart for the same race. This chart is exactly like the first chart but list horses their running lines and lengths behind the leader at every call. I find this chart more helpful than the first one. At the bottom comments are made by the trackman andor equibase official describing the running of the race. While on occasion this can be helpful I find scanning the chart itself will often give me clues that these comments tends to leave out.Edit I probably should have noted that this is free. You can get the full charts for every race day but equibase charges a small fee that will become expensive if you use it a lot. You also can scroll through daily workouts at all tracks or find entries into upcoming races and cards once the home tracks post them which are also free.,horseracing,der9sxq,2,t5_2qqz7

11312957,0,t3_618ruw,Wow. I know arrogate is the story deservedly so but can we get a round of applause for Gun Runner? That was an impressive performance as well.  ,horseracing,dfeb0uc,1,t5_2qqz7
11628144,0,t1_dge00rr,I like those most likelys... The top finishers in those big preps tend to do well. With regards to handicapping have you tweaked any methods or incorporated additional leverage from breeding info? Looking for ideas where to improve to get out of this slump. Thx!,horseracing,dge29hj,1,t5_2qqz7
11653096,0,t1_dggs9kc,Apparently Vegas agrees with you!I appreciate the objective opinion  Im relatively high on him since hes never regressed. Never had a bad trip and he seems to like the CD surface.I guess seeing him as low as Malagacy and practical joke was surprising.  Id expect to see him closer to the top.,horseracing,dggw5ki,2,t5_2qqz7
11668846,0,t1_dgin4ut,The trend towards lighter race horses did start before the points system. And I think that is what has hurt the derby more than anything else. You used to could look at each horse and know you have seen their best race somewhere in their past performance and make an educated bet. Today it is more about guessing if one will improve and if they will all stay the same. Nyquist Orb and California Chrome all disappear after the triple crown races of their year and only Chrome returned to form but it was a year and  later before he got back to the topand he was the most experience of the bunch heading into the derby. Actually most horses disappear after the TC races and is never heard from again even as a stallion. I believe that is caused more by the stress they are put through during the TC and the use of lasix by most horses.,horseracing,dgiogs4,2,t5_2qqz7
