Things like responsibilities for repairs maintenance rent amount utilities security deposits notice of termination... Those all should be included.

5443973,0,t3_3mhwx1,It is almost certainly a scam. There are two suggestions I would make. Call your county and find out the real owners name and address and then use that to try to get their phone number. Contact them and see if they are really renting the place out. You said the owners name checks out but how can you be sure the person youre talking to is the owner? Get on skype and have them show their ID next to their face. Or better yet independently contact the real owner if you can. Since it was just on the market until a month ago maybe you can find a listing that includes the realtors name and that realtor will contact the owners for you. Also never pay any money until someone with keys shows you the house in person never wire any money use a check only and never pay several months in advance. A legitimate rental will ask for the deposit and first months rent not twelve postdated checks or some other scam.I cant think of any legit reason they would charge under market value no. They would be better off hiring a property manager and charging market rent.,Landlord,cw7iqbx,1,t5_2qpqt

6760456,0,t1_d0ikxtm,The point of the  days is obviously to give you a bit more time to find people. But yes I understand your concern about not finding people in the winter.Since they are asking you to give them a concession and shorten the lease you have every right and expectation to ask for more money. Its hard for me to say how much more that should be.At some point I think what you need to do is come up with a raised rent figure in your head which says if they will rent for this amount then I am willing to take the risk and if they wont rent for this amount then I need to move on to a new tenant.In the end you might just need to tell your tenants that as much as you like them you cannot take the risk of having them move out and have the house vacant.  If its a nice enough house you shouldnt feel like youll have trouble finding annother good renter during peaking rent season.Also after you tell them your conditions for them getting a month to month or  day notice lease you might also find out that they suddenly are OK to just stay in the house and sign another year lease.,Landlord,d0il677,3,t5_2qpqt
6760645,0,t1_d0ilbds,Yes I was thinking this was option .  A yearly lease but prepare up front for a possible situation where they want to move out.

Which may be lost and that would be bad. My advice is dont. Paying early doesnt make rent cheaper and increases the chance of a problem.

9320119,0,t3_584hhn,Im not sure why youre posting each thing individually for what appears to be the same apartment but perhaps reviewing California deposit law will help. I personally would not charge them for the light bulbs as this would  could be considered normal wear and tear since the bulbs reached the end of their intended life span and there are no damages incurred. If the bulbs are more than you want to eat in the future maybe consider changing fixtures to ones that are less expensive to maintain and are easier for tenants to access.  those who disagree CA is very tenant friendly state. This depends on your agreement the judge move inmove out checklists the type of fixture the bulb was in and your willingness to go to court over it. It is better to install fixtures with inexpensive bulbs that are easy for a tenant to change as opposed trying to charge a tenant  per bulb because they failed to change a fancy bulb in a recessed fixture on a vaulted ceiling. When it comes to cleaning clean is clean and you can charge the tenant  for the time and money you spent returning a surface to the state of cleanliness it was in when the tenants rented it. You should have a move in checklist and photos to show the state of unit at the time the tenants accepted it and an itemized accounting of what needed to be cleaned after they moved out. Wear and damages are a bit different though you can only charge for the lost life of an item. So you would need to prorate the lost life of the blind slats the dog ate and charge the tenant what you lost. Since blind slats are so inexpensive it makes much more sense to just eat it as a cost of doing business.For the toilet you can charge them  for the plumber service if the issue was due to their improper use. However if the actual toilet needs to be replaced you can only charge them for the lost life of that fixture.I hope that helps.,Landlord,d8xe636,3,t5_2qpqt

9472621,0,t3_5adh1u,IANAL nor a landlord in Washington but...gtHowever during my research I also discovered that my landlord should have provided me with a written checklist of the condition of the home signed by himself and me and providing a copy to me upon moving in.Be careful how you interpret what you read.  As I read it a checklist was not required.  From my reading of that link you provided it says a written checklist or statement.  My lease calls out that the condition of the property is good and there are no damages unless noted on the condition sheet my condition sheet is a checklist.  Basically my lease states that everything is good unless it is specifically called out.  Youll need to see how the law interprets this in your locality.  Does a clause in the lease if yours has one stating the property is in good condition and the tenant accepts it fulfill the requirement Washington has? Does your lease have a clause like that?Then again I also dont agree with the useful life depreciation theory of valuing a current item.  I depreciate my entire rental property over . years.  Does that mean if a tenant burns it down in year  I am owed nothing because it is fully depreciated or past its useful life by tax standards?  No I dont think so.  To me items within my rental are akin to a car.  If you damage the fender on my  Yugo you will need to pay to repair it back to the condition it was in.  It doesnt matter that it is old that the car is no longer in production etc.  What matters is that the fender you jut dinged had  dings in it before so you need to get it repaired repainted and back to the condition it was in prior to your damage.  Tax status or depreciation have nothing to do with that.  For me if the linoleum was in excellent condition before moving in I expect it to be returned to me in excellent condition.  It doesnt matter how old it is.  Condition is key.  A linoleum floor that is cared for can go  to  years easily.  If the linoleum was in excellent condition a tenant would be paying most of the cost for replacement as I only had to cover the cost from excellent to new and the tenant had to cover the cost to replace an excellent quality product.My replied to your statement would begt . Submit a request that the landlord only charge me some portion of the linoleum replacement or none because it is  years old but concede to be willing to pay the other small damages in the home.Youll be paying X for replacement since it was physically in Y condition when you moved in.  Useful life doesnt apply as my damages are based on actual condition.gt . Request a full deposit refund because I was never given a written condition checklist upon move in.As I said in my lease I state that the condition is good except where noted elsewhere in the lease.  Id be willing to let a judge decide this one.  gt. Request a full deposit refund because I was never given a written condition checklist upon move in PLUS  in charges for his unauthorized entry into the house without  hour notice  x  Violations as allowable by Washington stateId tell you that for us the best route is court as we cannot see eye to eye on a solution and Ill be happy to let a judge decide the case.

There are certain requirements by building and fire code.  The primary one is the requirement for two points of egress this mean escape or entryexit.  Unless the basement has a window which can be opened and allows a Tenant to escape if there is a fire it is illegal to use such space as a separate livable space.  It is also illegal to place keyed locks on bedroom doors or basement doors.This is probably why your basement space is illegal.  Many people do rent out their basement but its rarely caught.

Shes relying on professionals three different ones so far  to fix a problem and they arent doing it. Its not her fault. No shows are not her fault. It happens with contractors all the time. They make an appointment and get busy with something else or have to take care of an emergency and dont show and dont tell you. It has nothing to do with your landlord.Sometimes roof leaks arent easy to find. The leak isnt necessarily coming from the spot right above where its coming into your ceiling. So they find a spot where they think the water is coming in try to fix it and then have to wait and see if it leaks again. The only way around that is to replace the entire roof but if the rest of it is sound thats not a reasonable expectation. I would talk to her and find out why she is calling plumbers for this job. If thats even what shes doing. Maybe you just dont know.It sounds like you have laminate flooring. If you have a basement crawl space or apartment under you then what is under the flooring is a subfloor. If you are on a slab then it is concrete. The current floor may be covering old flooring. Either way it IS a cosmetic issue. Its definitely something that needs repairing but is no more a reason to get out of your lease than if you needed a new carpet.The thing is if you broke your lease and she took you to court over it she would be able to show that shes been making good faith attempts to resolve your issues and you could possibly be on the hook for the remainder of the lease.,Landlord,dbx5knl,3,t5_2qpqt

10740694,0,t3_5tm2yf,Weve used them on a few properties and so far they have worked out well.The pros  Easier access if needed no longer have to keep a rack of keys for different units we keep one code for landlord access and add others for tenants as needed we do change our  landlord code every so often No more I lost my key or having to go let someone in in the middle of a blizzard because they accidentally locked themselves outside while wearing nothing but shorts. No need to change locks with different tenants no need to worry about who might have or have made a copy of the key you just wipe the old codes. Cons Batteries they die. Not a big problem if you make sure to change them out once a year or so just to be sure. We have some that have lasted a couple of years no problem. some of the keypads have worn rather quickly mostly the ones with more rubbery buttons.  More points of failure you not only have to potential for something in the lock mechanism to break but also the electronics. We have only had maybe one issue between a dozen or so locks though.,Landlord,ddntl2l,2,t5_2qpqt
