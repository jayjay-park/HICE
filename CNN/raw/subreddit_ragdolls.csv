885635,0,t3_248utd,aw so cute!!! I am pretty jealous the breeder I got my ragdoll from didnt allow us to take our cat home until she was  weeks old. I understand her reasons but I feel like I missed out on most of the kitten stage.  Ah well enjoy my friend!!  ,ragdolls,ch4y7er,1,t5_2vgxd
1757831,0,t1_ck0kmpo,I have a two year old raggie mix. Even nowadays if his poop isnt super firm hell get clingons. I also cant imagine its very pleasant for them to clean up back there with their tongues.... I simply trim away some of the fur around his caboose so theres less possibility of anything sticking back there. ,ragdolls,ck0qclz,3,t5_2vgxd

7826753,0,t1_d3vdegd,Congrats on your new addition. Does she have her own room? I gave my big boy the whole living room although a larger bathroomlaundry roon is enough space for the adjustment period. As long as theres enough room for their food water and litter but also a good hiding place or two theyll be happy. It also helps to just sit on the floor and let them meet you on their own terms. I would just lay on the carpet and play on my phone until hed come out for petting. After he was comfortable with that Id sit up on the couch and wait for him to jump up and sit with me. When they start sleeping out in the open or even next to you you will know theyre very close to being fully adjusted. If theyre at that point Id suggest letting them have free roam of your home when youre there while still keeping them in their own room when youre goneasleep. Being a Ragdoll they will start to follow you around the house whenever you move around at that point youre fairly safe to assume theyve adjustedbonded. Try a night of having them loose in the whole house if they have a chosen sleeping spot you can move partall of it to your bedroom as they love to sleep near you. Both of mine have chosen spots onnear my bed.As for the nails Id definitely wait until shes completely comfortable before flipping her upside down for clipping. Once shes adjusted it will be a breeze to do as they love being cradled like babies and dont really seem to mind paw holding. In the meantime Id just make sure to have scratch posts around. My little one loves sisal and my big guy loves his carpet tower but yours might be a fan of corrugated board so give each a shot.About the skittishness theres a good chance that will stick around as both of mine are super comfortable but still love running away at the slightest noise. It becomes more about play at that point though rather than being genuinely scared.My big scaredy cat is now a bigger cuddlebug than my baby so I can promise that if you take the  weeks to help them adjust they will. ,ragdolls,d3vskt9,1,t5_2vgxd

8956137,0,t3_52uvh6,Your kitty may mellow out as she grows and as she gets used to you. In my experience kittens are often too busy to be into cuddles and petting but they often grow into love bugs. I think your method of rewarding with treats and getting her used to you touching you is going to work well. My ragdoll learned pretty fast that claw trimming wasnt so bad because she got tasty tuna treats afterwards. She also realized that brushing feels awesome and now goes crazy when she sees me pick up the comb.  When I first got my ragdoll  year old she was very anxious. It took her about a month to relax. She is very chatty and trills and meows at me lots but for the first month the anxious loud meowing was nonstop. She is not a cuddler but she likes being near me. If I sit on the sofa she lies on the back of the sofa behind me. At night she stretches out by my feet. She loves to supervise me and keep me company even when Im having a bath. She was initially nervous of guests so I decided she hadnt been socialized enough and started inviting people over more often. Shes OK with visitors now but I dont think shell ever be gregarious.  I had to teach my cat how to fetch and now she loves it. She ignores laser pointers but is super into those tiny cheap toy mice you can buy at grocery stores. She also likes bendy straws and the ring from milk caps. I had to stop putting out toilet paper because she was bringing the entire roll into the bed in the middle of the night and trying to get me to play with it. I even caught her trying to take the paper towel roll off of the holder. Just give it time! ,ragdolls,d7oe6e8,3,t5_2vgxd
