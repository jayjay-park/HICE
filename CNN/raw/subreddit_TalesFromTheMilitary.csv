2459374,0,t3_2nlvgf,A couple of things Ive wondered about since doing this series.. Do we have any other MARS station operators here? It would be a blast to reminise with somebody who heck I may have talked to on the radio over there.. re the comment by Scubahana asking about my perforated eardrum.. The diagnosis was about  years ago when I had a large wax buildup in the ear. I saw the dr again about  years ago and he says its still perforated.. In fact I have to protect it from getting water in it even when I shower..  Id be a bit more upset about being unable to dive IF I still lived in San Diego but here in Las Vegas all we have is the shrinking Lake Mead for a diving location.. Despite that there is at least one dive shop here I have no idea how much business it does....,TalesFromTheMilitary,cmfoi89,3,t5_31qv7
2530610,0,t3_2on4bd,Back in  I was undertaking  months of French language training when I was in the military.  The base also happens to be the recruit school for the CF.  Sitting on the patio at the Officers Mess one day the group of us witnessed one recruit jump out a th floor window onto the roof of the nd floor below.The group of us stood standing there stunned at what wed just seen...The first person to break the silence was me at the back of the group...Ooo...Thats MOTRIN pain.The collective headturning in my direction accompanied with openmouths and wide eyes at my reflexive insensitivity was pretty astounding...,TalesFromTheMilitary,cmovy4d,4,t5_31qv7
