6207765,0,t3_40kzp4,Probably the Order  brainchip arc with Tup and Fives. Seeing Tup living out the last few days of his life like a dementia patient who gets euthanized and seeing Fives fight to prove Tup wasnt in control of his actions only to be silenced by a blaster was pretty tough since you get to know them so well. Like you op mentioned there are a surprising amount of tragic arcs and episodes but that takes the cake for me.,clonewars,cyv98bx,13,t5_2ruwd
