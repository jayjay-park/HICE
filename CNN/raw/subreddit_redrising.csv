2846395,0,t1_cnrfrs8,Yeah I was just thinking that. Im not sure exactly how they did it in cap but itd likely work here too. I dont know off the top of my head what young dude actor is gritty enough for Darrow.Question about the actual representation of the characters though do you guys picture t the different colours as being totally their colours? Like a red has red hair eyes skin? I think the book said reds are basically gingers if I remember correctly so do purples have white skin and purple hair eyes? In my head they always had purple tinged skin too... Also think theres any merit to having different races play different colours? Black guys being Obsidians etc?,redrising,cnrmuo3,2,t5_309qi

6539547,0,t3_4517or,Glad to have you back brotherman. Following your pew pew bullet format too. Ragnars death scene actually dehydrated me. The book should come with Visine. Their slogan incidentally is Gets the Red Out. Roques death while nowhere near as obliterating as Ragnars also moved me deeply.  Unlike most astute readers I didnt see the betrayal coming at the end of GS because Roque was one of my favorite characters.  Like Darrow I actually hoped thered be a reconciliation.   The Jackals death.  I loved how it was written.  Other characters have longer more detailed death scenes but his was so beautiful and succinct. And also heartbreaking in that final moment with Mustang. Bye Felicia.  Because Victra is as OG as Ice Cube. Straight outta Mars. Victra proposing to Sevro and him almost taking her name. I want a spinoff on their married life. And as parents. Those kids will surely be hellions.EDIT And the funniest moment for me while reading at the start waiting wondering when Mustang will finally make an appearance. Darrow says But it isnt just Coppers and Silvers at the table.  I immediately get that spinetingling sensation its going to be Mustang and I say out loud to nobody OH SHIT.  And the next sentence?  Victra saying Oh shit.  ,redrising,czvqqjt,8,t5_309qi

6781480,0,t1_d0kcudb,You need to give a lot of thought to the feel you want people to get from the combat. If you want the player character to feel like an underdog who survives direct fights by the skin of his teeth then following the Batman and Shadow of Mordor model of combat isnt a great idea. They make you feel almost invincible. Any sense of real vulnerability would go straight out the window if you saw the PC bouncing back and forth through the room parrying and dismembering obsidians like theyre nothing more than wet paper.And as much as I like Arkham or Dark Souls and Bloodborne I just dont see an RR game being a straightup hack and slashbeat em up. In the RR world you cant just afford to enter a gladiator fight against a whole lurcher squad of elite Grays and Obsidians and maybe a couple Golds and expect not to get blasted to shreds. To stay true to the spirit of the books the game would have to be geared more towards stealth and covert action. Straight up facetoface combat being a last resort only.Id model the combat mainly after Far Cry and Dishonored which make you feel more like a proper glass cannon. You can dish out a whole lot of damage in a short period of time thanks to badass weaponry underhanded tricks and sneaky tactics but you cant take a much of it. And thats the ideal Id incorporate into the protagonist of an RR videogame. Speed and extreme prejudice in Darrows own words. Kill or neutralize enemies before they even realize whats happening. If youre discovered and theres too many enemies to fight directly then run hide and pick them off one by one.I cant imagine a dozen enemies surrounding the protagonist all politely waiting for their turn to strike like in Arkham and Assassins Creed. Not in the RR world where a blast of a pulseFist would end the fight then and there. What I can imagine is a Howler hiding on a vantage point with an activated Ghostcloak. Then jumping down to do an aerial assassination on one of the Grays below and initiating a chain takedown like the ones from Far Cry. As you stab the last guy in the chain takedown you steal a pulseGrenade from his belt and lob it towards a cluster of enemies. Whip out a scorcher and shoot the two last stragglers just as theyre realizing shit has hit the fan. Then zip back to a hiding place with a gravBoot dash like Dishonoreds blinking before reinforcements arrive.,redrising,d0kyrt5,1,t5_309qi

6854859,0,t1_d0t49yp,I beg to differ. Syfys done a great job of adapting the expanse and their pockets are nowhere near as deep as HBOs are. And you kind of miss one of my points entirely. An Rrated Red Rising series would not happen even with how well Deadpool has gone. Deadpool had a small budget relatively speaking and a production like Red Rising would require a significant budgetlike higher than  a hundred million which would be a gamble too far for most studios. Given the backlash The Hobbit suffered from stretching one book into three I dont see  movies coming from  books which stands to be  books fewer than the series would require at this point with the Iron Gold continuation being written being a good thing that fans or casual audiences would stand for. ,redrising,d0tb1l6,1,t5_309qi

9098100,0,t3_54r547,I was just very happy Servo was alive because he is my favorite character. It did seem that ruse was just in there to fool the reader and not part of Darrow telling the story himself otherwise we would have read about them discussing the plan after Cassius saw his family murdered. Antonia was the one they really faked Servos death for and the reader. In that sense it seems kind of silly because they couldve just flew into capture together and had servo play dead just before they got there but having Antonia and Cassius capture them would have looked more real to the sovereign rather that Cassius rounding up all three of them. I agree Servo not actually being dead and wearing that fake chest and using Holidays concoction was definitely jumping the shark but personally I loved it. Also I wish we couldve learned more about holiday and trig who we learned most about in the very beginning before Aja kills Trig. They seem like cool characters grey bother and sister that could take on gold with crazy weapons and guns. Would have enjoyed to hear more about them.,redrising,d85g0vb,3,t5_309qi
