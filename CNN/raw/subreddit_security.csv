38821,0,t1_ceissyu,The EMV Chip  Pin cards have been available for many years and are commonly used in Europe.   US companies have made the calculation that its cheaper to absorb the fraud than to upgrade the cards as theyve renewedreissued and slowly upgrade the POS terminals over several years.   They can just pass on the fraud expenses as credit card fees.Its all just part of the short term profitsnow mentality.

2445929,0,t3_2nh0w3,So password theft is really only an issue when the password needs to be accessed. I can cook up something that impenetrably stores passwords with ten lines of code. However the mechanism for the user to utilize the password always has varying levels of vulnerability  this is where the attacks will be. For example identity thieves cant get our PINs or passwords by prying their way into our brains  where they are stored. They get them from when we access them at terminals using cameras pressuresensitive overlays on the keypads and fooling us into putting them into fake webpages sigh.That said chances are that no innovative attacks will be needed against the system. Their uncrackable system still has to work with  the REST of the infrastructure to make it useful for financial transactions or other authenticated actions.Right now they are banking on the fact that no one has the specs on their proprietary hardware and software. If their technology rolls out to the overall infrastructure it will be commonplace and attackers hackers and others will discover its secrets crack their system and then we are all back to square one. Building fancy new crypto  even building it from the ground upward  doesnt help if you are just shoehorning it into an infrastructure that is already vulnerable to attacks on the infrastructures procedures.,security,cme0rsy,1,t5_2qhvw

I then put the phone in the tin and put the lid on.  A coworker called my phone and we heard nothing he even left a VM.So then I opened the tin and immediately hit the button on the front of the Galaxy S and swiped down to get the settings menu.

Even if you generate a complex password for the user and do not allow them to set their own they can still memorize your complex password and use it also for another unrelated service.However it seems like it would be a good serverside endeavor at least in a large organization that can afford it to have someone run a bruteforcing cluster parttime always trying to crack users passwords using the latest techniques. This way weak passwords could be discovered and weeded out by locking out users automatically and requiring them to change their password if the cluster is able to crack it.The cost might not be that much in enterprise terms  all you need is a GPU cluster and it might be a fun parttime job for someone. ,security,d62yy2o,1,t5_2qhvw

10367287,0,t1_dciah18,lets address this one first gtYep the US is lying reporters just didnt use the large amount of time to notice the other domestic issues in the documents and we are just going to ignore the foreign stuff that they did release. Come on...Admittedly a stupid thing to say on my part. As for the u.s. lying lying about what? Saying the u.s. doesnt lie is as naive as thinking Russias interference with the election is ok and they just want to be friends. But as to the semi declassified full report and number of documents he stole? Yeah skimming the full report now its filled with inconsistencies and contradictory statements. This ones a real gem.  As of August   press outlets had published or referencedlt. x  x  documentstaken by Snowden.  This represents less than onetenth of one percent of the nearly . million documents the IC assesses Snowden removed. seriously its claiming only  documents have been published or referenced by the press? Thats absurd! The wapo ran an article referencing k docs! The report doesnt even cite wapo once!  I really dont understand how you can give any credence to a report with such blatant falsehoods. gtThe main point is that by any estimate what he stole was almost all non domestic.Using the k documents that the nsa said theyre certain he took and that theyre certain he provided to journalists. k docs from a single fisa cache was sent to wapo. Admittedly the docs included foreign communications but itd also be disingenuous to simply designate the docs w american communications as domestic and the docs w foreigners as non domestic. Had the cache been curated to only show americans itd have given a false narrative of abuse by the nsa. Curating the it by snowden would have also made determining a lot of important ratios amp numbers impossible such as the ratio of u.s. targets vs foreign targets or the amount of incidental collection etc. so I mean by that estimate most of the docs he was certain of taking dealt with domestic issues. He also told wapo not to publish the full cache and asked them to consult with the govt to ensure no ongoing operational data was compromised which they did.gtYeah americans could talk to anyone it is impossible to ensure they are absolutely filtered out. Even with something as targeted as bugging someones residence.There are rather stark differences between capturing data as a result of americans communicating with individual targets vs capturing data as a result of full upstream packet capture of entire countries. gtthere is no way leaking those details will ever be pardonable. It is just espionage to take such info.and if he had raised it internally which he has claimed but stated his complaints were ignored? The NSA lied about this and it was revealed through foia requests. gtI think not realizing these actions are necessary is naive just as naive as thinking Russias interference with the election is ok and they just want to be friends. All nations are striving to get advantages over other nations and if we dont then we will fall behind and be at a disadvantageid argue the opposite unless its a fantasy world where their actions exist in a vacuum and blowback never ever happens. How is full upstream packet capture necessary? Capturing everything means understanding nothing. Its searching for needles in an exponentially growing haystack. The discovery of Stuxnet and Flame led to the creation of Irans cyber army. The theft of Microsofts certificate undermined the very trust thats needed for the internet to work.  Tapping into the cables between Googles datacenters led to hostilities from tech companies and an increase in corporate encryption. Subverting rsa and nist standards undermines our security and leads to public security nihilism i.e. the recent bs over wa.  Hows about heartbleed or the numerous other exploits that are stashed away? I sure hope the shadow brokers not politics only care money equation group bid equation group win  equation group keep secret. But cmon it was never criminals after money its ris or another state actor. Considering the entire u.s. economy is built on intellectual property actively undermining the security and faith of that ip for the sake of foreign intelligence seems rather myopic. The methods used in our attempt to stay ahead is assisting our falling behind. gtIf you think any spying whatsoever is wrong then you have a very alternate view on the matter that conflicts with most people.I dont think any spying whatsoever is wrong. But when its done indiscriminately with no accountability and allowed under secret courts and secret laws I view it as wrong. I view subverting encryption as wrong. Targeted surveillance? Got a thumps up from me. gtThough I did find the joke Golden Gate pretty funny.As did I but this raises another question. Are you be okay with the unofficial leaking of intelligence about him? Dont get me wrong Id rather a literal monkey be president but hes not going to be impeached. A video of him and putin having sex could surface and he wouldnt get impeached. Itd be political suicide for too many rural republicans their base just doesnt care. With that in mind its difficult to imagine how the leaks do anything but help us fall behind and be at a disadvantage. Would you be fine with those leakers being prosecuted under the espionage act and forbidding the leakers to explain their reasoning to a jury consisting entirely of st generation Russian Americans with families back in Russia? Thats rather analogous to the type of trial Mr. Snowden would get due to forum shopping and the draconian espionage act. ,security,dcj7041,1,t5_2qhvw

At the same time I would agree that most people with a CISSP would not be considered hackers as he states.The CISSP as an example is not to say you are a Security GOD but rather to show that you have  years of Security experience and a broad understanding of the Security foundations.   CISA and CISM are the same for the Compliance world.  All of these require peer sign off by someone who has them and knows you I think the CISM also still requires a letter not just a form completed but it has been a while on that one.I have known people with the CISSP that I would never hire as they were great test takers but at the same time I know many who have it that got it like I did due to the salary perks and to get jobs that require it due to Compliance mandates or Federal requirements.   These requirements are there so that you . Get someone who has some proof that they have  years of experience. . Have a general knowledge of the foundations needed . Are committed to getting continuing education each year to improve their knowledge.For me the CISSP gets me moved to the top of the interview pile.  From there I sell my knowledge and experience.  When I interview people for my teams I look to see if they have a cert then ask them about it what they think about its meaning and see if they have the understanding of it.

Hell I can write an internet scanner to find all vulnerable mysqlpostgresmongoredis instances then publish a blog post about how  of the internet is stupid. If I take that and drop it in a evilblackhat.example.org forum and say here guys have fun youll probably get targeted by LEO.Its allll about how and why and what you do with it. We see a lot of grey area when people do light pentesting against public webapps without permission not vuln scanning but like XSS stuff. If you say hey I made a POST request with name ltscriptgt...ltscriptgt and I got it to execute on this one web page of yours they could try to sue and get you arrested if they really wanted.I think the best way around all this is to get some sort of official sec research position and just say research! when people ask why. If you look like the good guys you get a free pass to do a lot of what might incriminate others.,security,dgujhlv,1,t5_2qhvw
