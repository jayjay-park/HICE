5797405,0,t1_cxfor36,They can. The technology is getting quite dated and X is prone to interference more than more modern counterparts.At minimum you would need a transceiver and a remote Or alternatively you could use a serial interface and control devices from a computer with a serial port.Explore the site they have lots of options if youre interested.However as mentioned it has a fair number of limitations. For one X doesnt easily cross between the two electrical splitphases in your home. Meaning if the transceiver is on one phase and a device is on the other phase you might have issues getting the device to respond.Large noisy devices plugged into your house can throw a lot of electrical noise into your system causing both false positives devices turning on when no command was sent and false negatives devices failing to turn on when you want them to. Ive had laser printers cause issues before also things with big motors can cause trouble.Ive upgraded my house to Insteon and am very pleased with the results.

5946365,0,t1_cxz30v7,No. Stop. Take a step back.First That switch is rated for v and v only. The power coming out of your outlet is v. See the issue here? You cannot do it this way.Lets say that the wires from that power supply are red and black they arent I can see that in the picture. Red being hot black being negative. In reality  theres most likely writing or a stripe on one wire. This is USUALLY negative but there is no rule specifying it.Now first off....if you want the switch to be lit then cut the black wires and connect all three together one from power supplywall wart one from switch one to lights. Now cut the red wire. The side from the power supply goes to the red on the switch. Blue goes from the switch to the lights.If this is a LED then polarity matters. If not then it doesnt matter. To verify polarity you will need a multimeter.And lastly do not EVER modify an electrical cord or work on household voltages. You are not qualified and Id hate to see you hurt yourself or someone else.,electrical,cxz3k43,1,t5_2sa2d

6335442,0,t3_42bqd0,Your guess about the interference sounds spot on. Sounds to me like either the internal fixture wiring within the fan that feeds power to those bulbs is picking up an induced voltage or like you said something within the bulbs themselves. Either way there are ways to reinforce or enhance the shielding so as to send the carrier waves to ground potential rather than to the bulb if youre interested in spending some time fiddling. If it were me Id start by using a meter in one of the sockets with the bulbs removed and the fan running. See if you get a voltage reading and if you do then turn off the fan to see if the voltage fades like you described. If it does then you should look into adding extra shielding to the internal wiring of the fan maybe some tubular braided wire that you can put over the wiring inside and land directly to the metal within the enclosure. If the problem turns out to be inside the bulb it may be harder to tackle but the principle is the same. You have magnetic waves flowing toward those bulbs and you need to put something in the way that goes to ground thats all. Best of luck friend! ,electrical,cz9rqfx,1,t5_2sa2d
