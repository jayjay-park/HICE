53783,0,t1_cejq85w,thats part of what makes Lovecraft difficult to read sometimes. Its easy to decide that his work is SO cliche. But you have to remind yourself that HE wrote most of it first and its everyone else who ripped HIM off.,Lovecraft,cekjxdd,2,t5_2qjt4
54404,0,t1_cekkxxb,gt it just wont happen without justifiable reason in this monetarybased economyAnd I wasnt arguing with you about the monetary issue. Im in agreement about that. In a perfect world I could see blowing  million to film on location and create the most authentic experience possible but in reality it isnt necessary. I took issue with rating comment. The movies ratings board believe they improve movies by holding film hostage with an undesirable rating and giving suggestions on how the movie can be improved to get the desired rating. So to say that there is no reason for a At the Mountains of Madness film to be rated R I have to stop and ask by what standard? I could easily see it getting a R rating because it reached the magical number of curse words that the ratings board didnt like in that particular year month or day. gt What does it have to do with it being british?Being British meant that it had more freedom artistically and didnt have to pander to the American general audience first. Not being a slave to the Hollywood system is a very liberating situation for film makers. gt I never said quality independent films based on Lovecrafts work couldnt be made or shouldnt be madeI didnt say that you did and Im sorry if I gave the impression. This goes back to my point that we probably should have established what types of movie you were referring to when at the start. Hollywood indie and foreign films are entirely different things with different issues and hold ups. I was working under the impression that you were referring to just Hollywood movies which is typically was people mean when they just say movies but you have conveyed that you mean all films. That changes the conversation drastically and frankly I think we can just leave Hollywood out of it. If you dont need it to be a Hollywood film then I would gladly not go back into that quagmire of depressing politics and nonsense.  gt I havent heard of Carpenters or Raimis attempts to adapt a Lovecraft workDespite The Thing  technically being based on the John W. Campbell Jr. book Who Goes There?  or that it was green lit by the studio as a remake of The Thing from Another World  it really his attempt at making a At The Mountains of Madness film. That become apparent after he made In the Mouth of Madness  He so desperately wanted to make a Lovecraft film but the best he could do was his Apocalypse Trilogy The Thing The Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness. Raimi is just in love with Lovecraft to the point that he owes his career to the Necronomicon. Give him the opportunity to do a Lovecraft film and he would do it for free. gt Im sure Carpenter couldve made a Lovecraft adaptation for the same price tagAgain I dont take issue with the price tag. I see it more as a indie vs. Hollywood thing then low budget vs. high budget thing. But like I said we can take Hollywoods hang ups out of this. gt I just think we need to wait for someone to come along and do these great stories justice.And thats what I was trying to get at with the in the next  years comment. It will happen. It will most likely be a low budget film like Monsters that isnt part of Hollywood system. EDIT Sorry about the wall of text,Lovecraft,cekmgvi,1,t5_2qjt4

1919697,0,t1_ckjw5zl,My main issue is that even in the context of fun campy bmovies this movie isnt all that fun. If you know noir you will be bored because youve seen it all done before and betterliterally nothing in terms of noir tropes is new or even played with. If you havent the tropes seem very out of place. The writing isnt fun and goofy but just bad. The boring unrealistic and not at all clever kind of bad too not the enjoyable schlocky kind. The plot makes no sense and has no direction. The characters are inconsistent and flat arent bmovies meant to have colorful characters? to the point that you cant care about them because you have no idea what their wants and motivations are.I can enjoy genre flicks but they need to hit at least one item on this list fun characters interesting characters believable writing cleverfunfunny writing visual splendor or creative narrative ideas. Check out the review for The Unnamable linked in this article for an example of how forgiving I can be in that list of criteria. I can honestly say that even entering CaDS with the criterion that one of those items get hit I was still disappointed because none of them were.Of course I know some of this is subjective.

His views were largely colored by Orientalist fantasy literature and his interaction with immigrants in New York City but he also spoke out favorably for Middle Eastern peoples in some of his letters at least from a historical and comparative standpoint.,Lovecraft,crr1fmu,18,t5_2qjt4
4185323,0,t1_crxaj49,I give him credit for bringing to comics the type of stories that has been in mainstream paperback writing for a very long time.Hes not cutting new ground in story telling and thats my problem people give him credit for things done in novels for a long long time. Like I said there are a few of his works which I love but others that got way more attention then they deserve for their edge and story telling.Its not unlike the current fascination with Game of Thrones a middle of the road author at best got a TV deal the TV show has spent a lot of time and effort cleaning up his work and making it much much better and now hes getting credit for this image of incredible story telling and edginess but anyone whos read more then three books knows that hes rehashing better work and adding in murder and rape to make it feel edgy and fresh. ,Lovecraft,crxbv4y,1,t5_2qjt4

5718231,0,t1_cx5whke,H.P. Lovecrafts Literary Supernatural Horror in Visual CultureAuthor Wallace Nathaniel R.Abstract H.P. Lovecraft an early twentiethcentury author of supernatural horror was a materialist who believed that science had diminished the mysteries that previously existed in everyday life. To counteract this development he felt that the arts could be a viable platform where reality especially the dimensions of time and space might be disrupted. His literary approach in achieving this effect was to introduce phenomena to the audience that were complex and vast in scope potentially creating a sense of the sublime. Two particular elements that characterize such disruptive phenomena are repetition and symmetry. This dissertation considers Lovecrafts aesthetic theories and his larger body of work in order to establish a theoretical framework concerning disruption which can be applied to visual culture. As a selfdescribed visually minded author Lovecrafts literary approach bears a close relationship to visual culture since he often appropriated existing artistic works and incorporated them through description within his literature. To further connect Lovecrafts literature and visual culture this dissertation designates certain disruptive tropes within Lovecrafts oeuvre that may be found in later visual adaptations. Intersecting the dimensions of time and space with elements of repetition and symmetry this analysis establishes four disruptive tropes repetition in time montage symmetry in time ideograms repetition in space polyocularity and symmetry in space nonVitruvian architecture. The elements of repetition and symmetry work within each respective disruptive trope to undermine anthropocentric notions of time and space. In chapter  this analysis establishes the dynamic between firstperson point of view the inside and the outside which characterizes the disruptive tropes discussed in subsequent chapters. In chapter  Lovecrafts short story Pickmans Model is analyzed to demonstrate how temporal repetition can result in a fragmentation of the unity of the present. In chapter  the inclusion of ideograms in Lovecrafts work as a means of creating asymmetrical relationships in time is discussed particularly as it applies to the novella At the Mountains of Madness and the film Prometheus. Concerning the repetition of form in space Chapter  focuses on Lovecrafts polyocular fictional bodies and the manner in which multiple focal points within space create anxiety for the audience. Finally Chapter  addresses the asymmetrical relationship between the human body and alien nonVitruvian architecture described in Lovecrafts work.Links Subject Art history Literature Film studiesClassification  Art history  Literature  Film studiesIdentifier  keyword Language literature and linguistics Communication and the arts Lovecraft h.p.

He was not a saint and he definitely wasnt as liberal as some of his friends and correspondents like James F. Morton J.

I havent read this story in years so it was nice to go back and reread it. I love the look at the family history and how a small mistake can follow a family for generations. The idea that an obsession with an ancient artifact could lead to a families destruction generations down the road is quite interesting. I also love the idea of undiscovered civilizations in remote areas of the world. Also the ties to one of my favorite childhood movies Congo is nice too haha.,Lovecraft,d71h06g,3,t5_2qjt4

9652102,0,t3_5d8rkg,I have long thought that this was rather a debate that HPL had with himself in The Unnameable. More often than not he chose to not show the monster but to describe the setting and the effect that that has on the protagonist and then when the monster does show it is only marginally described physically but great lengths are gone to to show again the effect of this visitation on the protagonist. Steven King wrote a bit about this in Danse Macabre I believe he brought up a  carrot or something and he gave high points to not showing the monster as being more frightening at times as our fears are personal and the more we allow the reader to fill in the blanks with what they think is scary the more scary they will find it. We have become quite accustomed to seeing this in movies and television. The monster is often only shadows until the final reveal and in many cases the final reveal is a bit disappointing. We find that the shadows were more terrifying than the reality. One of the principle ways in which Hollywood drives tension and creates fear is through the use of musical scoring. The music works on us both consciously and subconsciously to create emotion. While at times especially during crescendos we are quite aware of the music there are other times it simply sits in the background undigested by the front parts of our mind while controlling our moods and feelings from the rear.I find that HPL uses the adjectives of fame in his writings to serve the same function as the score of a film. The article that OP posted pointed out that these adjectives can dominate paragraphs and then pages and many find this very offputting. I think that part of the problem that people have is not necessarily the amount of adjectives used but the words themselves that he chooses. Many are archaic gibbous many are somewhat technical squamous and a few as far as I have been able to discover he may have simply made up. Reading all of this page after page tends to have a somewhat hypnotic effect if one allows it to work in that manner. Where readers become frustrated is places where they are bothered by the fact that they have no real idea what many of the terms even mean. They stop and fixate on a word perhaps even pausing to look up a meaning. When this happens the magic dissolves the music goes away. I think it best if one simply let the words flow by like music and dont worry if you dont really understand pieces of it just let it do its job. One may not know that squamous means scaly but even without definition the word itself has a slimy and unwholesome feel about it.My advise to anyone new to the mans works or like the writer of the article someone trying it again that didnt get it the first time is this Just read it dont worry if there are words that you dont understand and dont stress that there seem to simply be far to many words used to describe something. The words especially the adjectives are the musical score. Let them act on you subconsciously. It is perfectly fine if your eyes seem to cross a bit at times this is by intent. Just let it wash over you let the words become music.Tekelili indeed.  ,Lovecraft,da2tlcu,9,t5_2qjt4

9846905,0,t3_5ganzc,A resort town in the mountains centered around a ski resort opened a few years ago and tourist development around the lake. Artists and remote workers have settled in and now theres a population of about  in a town that did not exist more than a decade ago. The ski resort owners brother was recently hired as high school principal he rubbed some students and parents the wrong way with his abrasive strict and at times odd mannerisms  but lately has seemed to settle in as more of a cultural fit. Theres occasional debate about whether he has really changed or that hes learned how to project a better demeanor in public. But the new new principal is viewed more favorably now.Saturday morning a motley crew of students begin serving an allday detention in the library sounds familiar. Basketball forward girls emo straightedge boy vice captain of debate team a flutist and the yearbook photgrapher. All different offenses. They know each other mainly by reputation as they hang out in different groups.The principal lays down the law and offers a choice stay in the library and study no talking stay seated  or help him clean out some clutter in the south wing of the school.The south wing whats that? Vaughn will only show them if theyre on board. It sounds more interesting than the library so they go along. The south wing he explains as he unlocks some doors inside a utility room is the original part of the school. The new school opened two years ago and no one knows of the smaller school that had been there long before. Oh yes this towns much older than you think but it was abandoned for a long long time. In fact the south wing is now mostly underground. He leads them down a wide dusty staircase lined with varnished wooden handrails. The architecture looks to be at least  years old.As the lights flicker on the hallway appears frozen in time. Lockers line the walls and a faded poster announces a graduation dance for the class of . The students are a little freaked out but curious.He opens the door to a science classroom. Lab equipment is still out chemical formulae are barely readable on a standing blackboard. Basic organic chemistry. Looks like they left in a hurry whatever happened. The yearbook photographer takes pics with her phone. Thought I said no phones says the principal but he doesnt make her put it away.Other classrooms are opened English literature art calculus. Each one seems a little more weird with details that just escape the eye or that none feel like remarking on. Social studies has a poster of ancient Malay script which no one recognizes with Romanization same and partial English translation. Biology has some rather large specimen jars with grey ribbony things still drifting inside and a series of naturalist watercolor depictions of things that are neither wholly jellyfish nor insect.The flutist asks what they are supposed to clean up getting some glares from the others. Im actually looking for something says the principal and Im not sure what it looks like. I should know it when I see it.You havent been down here before says the debate team guy.Once. By myself. I wanted to bring some others to see if they saw the same things I did. I mean this place shouldnt even be here. And when the new school opened it wasnt.Huh.History is pieced together about what happened to the original town and why and how the principal convinced his brother to open the ski resort and how he had to patiently wait for the time to move forward on his quest the goal of which until the shocking end is never even clear. Even more each of those students is there for a reason and their unique personal traits will help get them into and back out of cosmic peril.Much handwavey stuff not done yet to tie it all together.,Lovecraft,dar2oza,9,t5_2qjt4

Smiths book is very broad very shallow very incomplete but a starting point  most books about Lovecraft dont go into the games at all  Covalitos book is better researched but more focused on the UFOology connections.

His height could not have been less than six feet. The narrator notices that the house is full of antique books exotic artifacts and Victorian furniture. The old man is apparently harmless and ignorant but shows a disquieting fascination for an engraving in a rare old book Regnum Congo and admits to the narrator who becomes increasingly nervous and frightened during the mans story that it made him hunger fer victuals I couldnt raise nor buy presumably human flesh. It is suggested that the old man in the house was murdering men who stumbled upon the shack to satisfy his craving and that the old man has extended his life preternaturally through cannibalism. The narrator realizes the old man has been alive from at least the early eighteenth century to the year  when the story takes place. The old man denies that he ever acted on his desire but then a red drop of blood falls from the ceiling clearly coming from the floor above and splashes a page in the book. The narrator then looks up to see a spreading red stain on the ceiling this belies the old mans statement. At that moment a bolt of lightning destroys the house. However the narrator manages to escape from the house.,Lovecraft,dd4i2x9,1,t5_2qjt4
