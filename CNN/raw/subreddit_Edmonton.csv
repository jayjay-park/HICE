269490,0,t1_cf8exno,In other cities such as North York street parking is banned for durations of  hours or more. That means that apartment complexes tend to charge for parking and that if there isnt enough people pay for parking elsewhere. In other cities having a car take up space on the road is not a right and often not even allowed unless you pay. So just because something is the way it is here doesnt mean thats how it has to be or thats how other cities deal with this issue. If street parking especially residental street parking was far more limited in Edmonton I bet we could get streets plowed and clear a lot faster which I assume is one of the reasons for the city wide ban in North York.In other communities like say KitchenerWaterloo there are neighborhood rules about street parking. Neighborhoods near the uptown dont have street parking. Often residents will pay for parking spaces on other properties.So while street parking is a given in Edmonton plenty of smaller and larger communities handle this issue differently.,Edmonton,cf8oybv,-1,t5_2raht

582763,0,t3_20s2iq,David Staples the author is an Opinion Columnist and is also the one that posted a column a few weeks back about the change from the  to kmh buffer. David Staples writes opinion columns.This column is unfortunately dressed up like real news but doesnt actually have any information in it. This quote from City homicide detective Bill Clark is presented as factgt There is no doubt photo radar is a cash cow. They have lowered the speeds they issue the summonses at to increase revenue no matter what they say.But it never goes on to indicate why Bill Clark a homicide detective is a person of authority in this situation.The next paragraph contains a direct quote and an indirect quote from Jim Howse former city police officergt ...says hes alarmed to hear city traffic authorities now saying you can get a ticket for going as little as  kmh over the limit. Can you envisage a situation where every driver afraid of being charged drove under the posted speed limit? Massive road rage.Nowhere in the column does David mention or quote anyone from the city traffic authorities supporting that people are going to get ticketed for  kmh over the limit. Additionally there is also a baseless correlation between the average speed and road rage.Later on there is an indirect quote from Gerry Shimko reportedly in charge of the Traffic Safety department about his priority. The author then goes on to make a leap implying that because accidents are going down then there should be no reason to penalize people for speeding. The column ends with a definitive statement about the lack compelling evidence Im sure he looked real hard for the current policies in place.The whole column comes across as a personal axe the author is grinding because he isnt getting away with skirting the rules anymore. The speed limits are in place for a reason and if you dont agree with them there are more appropriate ways to go about getting them reevaluated than a silent protest by ignoring them.The implication that photo radar doesnt deter all speeding and therefore should not be used is irrelevant. I think the photo radar can be a good deterrent for people that arent aware they are speeding or for those that dont like getting needless fines. I assume there is a subsection of drivers for whom photo radar tickets are a cost of driving and they dont think twice when getting multiple a monthyear those people need a manual intervention.You can discuss about the morals and appropriateness of speeding but right now it is against the law. The issue here is how it should be enforced and that comes down to budget. Selectively enforcing crimes require a judgement call which we cant program into a photo radar machine which is why the kmh buffer exists but youll have a hard time convincing me and likely others how hard youve got it because you cant do kmh over the limit any longer.,Edmonton,cg6ij1c,9,t5_2raht

Port numbers are an arbitrary software construct  they just make sure that packets heading to a particular IP go to the appropriate service at the destination.  ISPs have their reasons for blocking common ports      theyll probably tell you its for users own security since most directed attacks assume the various protocols are running on their default ports  but its also to keep businesses paying for business plans.,Edmonton,ch28ih8,1,t5_2raht

1017999,0,t1_chhnqg7,The MagnoPlug will work with cycling power systems with negligible effect on the life of electronic components. So use it freely at your work and at home. As with any item left unattended there is always the potential for theft and that applies just as well to standard extension cords as to MagnoPlug. However there is one notable advantage that MagnoPlug has in this regard. The car component is very easy to attach to your grill but not as easy to remove. But both components are required and one cannot be used without the other. That means a thief would have to get behind your grill and break off the zipties to get the whole package. Thieves are generally not that ambitious  especially when its   outside.  And lastly once the car component is attached to your cars grill you use the extension cord side just like you would a regular old extension cord.

Let me draw your attention to what I said a little more closely gt human beings are not physiologically equipped to pilot a ton of metal at such high speeds in close proximity to other vehicles or large stationary objects. There are a notable lack of large stationary objects or other nearby vehicles in airspace.  The skys famous for its lack of large and massive objects actually.  One has a great deal more space and time to react when theres nothing within tens to hundreds of kms plus an extra dimension to maneuver within.  Adds more weight to my argument than yours actually especially when you consider how tightly constrained control is around congested areas like airports and all the supporting equipment and people just for guidance.Whether or not in some instances raising the speed limit reduces crashes or not is tangential to the point Im making.,Edmonton,chny9q4,1,t5_2raht

First of all I would recommend posting this on rmensrights folks over there are very helpful and are quite savvy with these situations many of them have gone through this so they can share their experiences with you. Second  scout for lawyers. They are the ones who write the damn law so they are the ones the most familiar with it. Third  study up on your rights yourself. If push comes to shove you might be the one representing yourself in court so it helps to have your facts straightened out before you get in there.I hope you will be able to find some form of resolution of your problem but unfortunately like uphaedrus said if you do not have a vagina you are at a severe disadvantage in legal custody battles.

So thats why it cant be somewhere like downtown plus something like that might be a little too large scale for that area anyway it basically needs to be at one end of the bridge or another.

2002540,0,t1_ckufrw7,No mental deficiency. I see a problem I take steps to correct it. Some methods work better than others. Since I cant physically force someone how to learn to drive properly usually inconveniencing them the way theyve inconvenienced the rest of us will hopefully get the job done.Letting the air out of a persons tire isnt worse than a bad park job. Because a flat tire only burdens the bad parker not anyone else. Where as the shitty parking job they did is annoying to everyone else who knows and understands proper vehicle operation and this small thing called common courtesy and decency.As far as your remarkable vehicle it seems like a hydraulic lifter issue. But youve properly already heard this. Im not sure how mechanically inclined you are or how much money youve got to spare for service calls. Id flush the engine complete with an oil change possibly even remove the headers and top case to check the gaskets and rings.After a quick google search the Cayenne seems to have a fairly common problem regarding the noise in your video. From the results Ive seen it sounds like damaged cylinders. Either from improper installation or just lack of proper routine maintenance. Im assuming youve found this out already though.Incase you want to cross reference a couple other videos that share the same type of sound as yours.Reference One  Reference Two  Reference ThreeVideo  is from a mechanics shop that fixed the problem sounded similar to yours and determined it to be a problem with the cylinderspistons.Video  is from another cayenne owner who posted in the comment section saying he thought it was a lifter issue but turned out to be a cylinderpiston problem.Video  is just a similar type sound no mention of what the issue is. However given the amount of smoke from the exhaust Burning oil Id imagine the problem is the same poor seal from the damaged cylinder heads allowing oil through into the engine.As a vehicle lover I truly hope this is not the case with your vehicle because from google  youtube searching its like a  grand fix minimum. I hope you figure it out and that its something minor.Just park your fancy car properly and well all get along P,Edmonton,ckui70d,1,t5_2raht

2144951,0,t1_clcdr2i,Probably sounded like a psychopath. I just think if someone stabs someone like this guy did thats an attempted murder. You cant control that shit. Apparently the victim is in critical condition. Whether he dies or not is irrelevant in my opinion to the nature of the crime itself. Its attempted murder at that point and it might as well be murder. If the guy is hanging on by a thread then why should the attacker get off easier because the doctors and nurses worked their asses off to make sure the guy didnt die? If you physically assault someone in a way that almost nearly ensures death then treat it like murder regardless of the outcome.Im going to go ahead and make a blanketstatement that the type of person to stab a guy over a small argument and then flee is not the type of person who is a contributing member to society. They probably will never be. In my opinion probably an extremist one I think someone like that has forfeit their right to live. Its so senseless and random and cruel and infinitely selfish.But then again we dont know exactly what happened.

2207024,0,t3_2kbc4n,Another wall of text for you.  I havent spent much time in Calgary but Ive lived in both Toronto and Edmonton so can comment from that perspective.I grew up here so maybe I am biased but I am one of those who finds the winter cold here easier to deal with.  In TO especially close to the lake the wet cold gets into you.  Maybe I just know how to dress for the dry cold but not the wet cold?One thing that not a lot of people think about wrt our winters is just how short the days get the flip side of our beautiful long summer days.  Were pretty far north.  If you workstudy indoors  theres like a good month where you pretty much dont see the sun.  Some people just arent bothered by this some are bothered and dont do anything about it but I know plenty of people who compensate with things like special lights andor vitamin D supplements.  When I moved back after several years in TO I was surprised by it and got hit with some bad midwinter lethargy.One of the bigger differences Ive noticed is quality of service it often sucks here.  Im talking about things like barrestaurant staff retail basically any service job.  I attribute this to the oil economy these jobs arent seen as viable careers the way they are in Toronto since its really not hard to get into something much more lucrative.  So as a general rule they are filled by high school and university students just collecting a paycheck while preparing themselves for a real job or people who to put it politely have made poor life choices.  Theres the occasional exception of course but Im not at all surprised when I am served by someone who is either bitter doesnt care is incompetent or some combination of the above.About the nightlife yeah the scene is smaller obviously.  Theres probably some niche stuff you can find in Toronto that you cant find here.  Obvious examples Im not aware of any sex clubs or pot lounges haha.  Or things that theres just less of like if you pick a genre of music where theres live shows a couple nights a week in Toronto youll probably find a just few good events a month here instead.An interesting observation that may or may not have broader implications about culture Toronto has people in their s to s with big artsy tattoos they got in their s when that was more of a thing while tattooed somethings seem to be hitting a peak here in Edmonton now.About outdoor activities As others have pointed out river valley is great for biking hiking snowshoeing crosscountry skiing.  People also canoe the river quite a bit in the summer.  Theres some places upriver that if you coordinate right with vehicles you can put in a canoe and spend a whole day going downstream and end up back in the city.  For snowboarding there are a few places innear the city that are comparable to anything you might be used to near Toronto but really you need to hit the mountains a couple times once youre living out here.On transit yeah its harder to get to many parts of the city compared to Toronto.  Our urban design has a lot of neighbourhoods that have limited options to get inout of and a lot of meandering roads within.  Makes a pretty picture on a map but not so great to design public transit around.  That and a lot of retail and restaurants are set up as the typical suburban Giant Parking Lot With A Bunch Of Big Box Stores and these are really not served well by public transit.  Contrast to Toronto with continuous straight major roads going both northsouth and eastwest at regular intervals most retail in malls with connected transit or streetlevel retail along these arterial roads.  So yeah our transit suffers from this design.  Service is less frequent some areas with no service outside of peak hours and no service late at night after .  The good news students get a transit pass at a greatly reduced rate and it is very possible to find a place to live with good transit access to campus.  Just... in the winter when weve gotten a big dump of snow overnight while we dont go to pieces like Toronto does there is still major transit disruption prepare to wait extra long in the cold in terms of how youre dressed and giving yourself time to get to your destination.,Edmonton,clkd7im,1,t5_2raht

2452061,0,t1_cmeln8q,gtI thought answers were in the act not the contract since the contract can easily be changed at any moment where as the act is a lead weight.If policy wordings change at any time...the change will only effect you when your policy renews and a new contract term starts.A good example of this is lets say you have a policy that renews December . .  And then in March your insurance company changes a coverage...Coverage X is no longer complimentary to your policy but now comes with a  charge.  They can not charge you that until December  .  They have the honour the contract as it was written on your renewal date as that is what you effectively are agreeing to.gtThe act in the end is only for those who want to bitch when they think they should be able to get out of a contract they signedNo it is the law!  It stipulates what you can and not do in regards to insurance.  It lays out the responsiblities of the insurer and consumers and agents there of.gtThe act is only paper.The Act is not only paper...it is the law.

Specifically Edmonton from  increased by over  compared to Quebec City by  over the same time period. Additionally on this subject most of Quebec Citys increase occurred  by merging with surrounding communities.

3717035,0,t1_cqfukj8,I wasnt talking about legal or constitutional status but of the opinions of Canadians and Edmontonians.  The previous commenter was claiming that religious identification was directly translatable to support for the citys prayer activities and I was refuting that.  I thought that was pretty clear and as such your comment is pretty much an irrelevant straw man.But I do have a response to that straw man.  In short what people can do within the limits of the law and what people think really should be done are not at all the same thing.  There are a lot of things that are legal but that the majority of people find objectionable.  One recent example Best Buy closes all the Future Shop stores reopening some of them as Best Buy stores but requiring former employees of those same stores to apply and compete for their same old jobs.  Totally legal but people still think its shitty.  There are also things that are illegal but that most people do not find objectionable.  The easy example there is pot or maybe in this city speeding within  or so of the posted limit.Back to the point there are people even people who adhere to various religious faiths who hold the opinion that state functions should be explicitly secular.I happen to agree with that stance mostly.  If the city wants to celebrate religious diversity thats great.  Start another festival or set aside some kind of special day or days for this.  Bring in local religious leaders make it the best celebration of religious diversity ever!  But as for the day to day meeting of council I dont think that this kind of ritual has a place.  Even if it is done in accordance with the constitution.tldr Law ! opinion.,Edmonton,cqfyviw,4,t5_2raht

Even . is complete crap. I was not speeding and I wont be be scared into not making my case because someone tells me Ill make an ass of myself by doing so.  And guess what  I dont give  shits if the judge tears me a new one  its my right to state my case. This whole system is based on making people just pay the ticket because its easier  and Im not going to do that. I surely hope that the  fine will cover the time of everyone in that room  because I will make my case. Im not wasting taxpayers money  if they want to pursue this for  bucks  the crown can make that decision. Im in a situation where I wont lose any money or personal time by fighting it  so I will. They cant increase my fine for stating my case  so I will. I can take the judge telling me the same thing you just did  that their system is perfect and Im wrong for questioning it  so I will. I wont be scared into not stating my case. EDIT There must be a margin of error in these systems no matter how minute which means that there is a group of people who receive tickets for speeding when they were not. What would YOU have these people do? Not defend themselves because you think theyll look foolish? Not defend themselves because the Judge in our system will have already made up their mind? Not defend themselves because someone on reddit told them not to?Seriosuly whats the worst that will happen Ill lose? Oh then what... I guess I gotta pay the ticket. Sounds to me that the only downside is that according to how you think that using a public service system just the justice system is something I should feel guilty about using when I genuinely feel that Ive been wronged.Im not doing this because Im sick of paying tickets Im doing this because I dont feel Im guilty  in this country were allowed to defend ourselves.

Look at this look at that thats amazing!The first thing that i want to see wich is also the thing that definetly got me hooked is the Muttart Conservatory. I dont know why but botanical gardens are magical places for me.While her started with among other things wooh there is one of the biggest Mall in the world! again  other things like finding out that there is a Japanese Izakaya and other cool place to eat and A LOT of museums and things to do.Lastly but not last i have an huge weakspot about big parks and as soon i zoomed out in google maps i saw both JasperBanffothers National Parks and the Wood Buffalo and i immediatly thoght I need to see at least one of those parks and thats why the first days we will do a little roadtrip passing through banffjasper in order to see the Park since i imagine that winter comes quite early in that reason...if it will not be already arrived....

They do use the words potentially to talk about the increase risk in collision numerous times but they didnt use it in this exact context.I still dont see this but its fine as its not really important.gt I dont think it is a magical fix. I dont actually disagree with all of the citys points. I think some are overstated. Possibly this new idea the city has could be used in conjunction with a kmh speed limit in the future.Why do you think kph would help even if in conjunction with this new advisory? None of the data or conclusions in this study youve linked support that idea. The point of the advisory itself is to tell people to drive slower when there are high volumes of traffic as they believe a steadier flow would decrease congestion. In the future if the road gets some serious work done on it  kph could be feasible though still probably not at peak hours.gt First out of all the collision stats I cant find anything that says if service roads are included. Im guessing they are since they are part of the road.This would be interesting data to include and compare but Im not sure its significant or important to make a distinction. I cant see a realistic scenario where this additional data would support the idea of increasing the speed limit.gt They compare whitemud to yellowhead and the henday.  different collision stats and conclude that whitemud is more dangerous then similar roads. Yellowhead would be similar with more interchanges I guess. this is page  Then go on to say that on page  to say the mean speed in in the  zone is  and that if the speed limit was increased to  or  the mean speed would be  or  respectively. In the next page they calculate the mean speed for a kmh speed limit in a different way.The comparison to Henday is pretty much useless but Id say Yellowhead is relevant as theyre both major urban roads running EW through Edmonton. Yellowhead has a higher density of intersections but a lower collision rate though theyre both kind of bad.Youve misunderstood the graph figure  on page . The top one is for Whitemud PSL   kph mean  . kph and the bottom one is for Yellowhead PSL  kph mean  . kph.This is getting kind of long so I hope its not coming off as annoying or dickish.

Its nice to see a little city crackdown on the distracted driver but this one time fine is no better than a speeding ticket.

Like you I think this interchange works just fine and kind of wish they had just agreed to leave it alone. Then again its probably because it favored eastwest traffic from River Valley Rd to Groat Rd and vice versa which is the route I drive most often. I suppose this proposal makes pedestrian crossing a bit safer at the signal lights and helps the traffic turning onto and from River Valley Rd as you mentioned.,Edmonton,cu77nls,2,t5_2raht

Overall trip time not including my walk was mins this included transfer time and got me there fairly early for the meetup.From what I remember taking ETS it was like .hrs to get to West Edmonton Mall from my house in Namao.

They dont allow more ports to be activated if they dont have the capacity for it otherwise Optik TV wouldnt work properly. So its essentially dedicated. Ive been a technician for both companies and Im currently at Telus. I can honestly tell you that I have never seen less than full speeds on a Telus line when the copper or fibre is in good working condition  if there is a problem I can have it fixed. I have never once had a speed issue related to network congestion in the Edmonton area. Completely nonexistent here.

5278544,0,t3_3n9wkr,This was largely my experience too trying to move from Telus to TS.  Because they are still relying on the other ISPs techs they dont have complete control of the installation experience.  If nothing goes wrong this shouldnt be a problem however if something does go wrong there is no efficient mechanism to escalate the service request.  If they need to escalate a service request with the lastmile team you have as much if not more leverage as a direct customer of that ISP Telus  Shaw than they do as a wholesaler of services to rectify installation issues. Like you the initial installation appointment was missed and I had already ended my existing service.  To TSs credit they did mail day out an access point after I my existing ISP was cancelled and well before they had a reinstallation date however the unit was DOA.At that point I was done. I was able to book and have installed an equivalent package directly from Shaw before TS had even heard back from their Shaw contacts about rescheduling.

Now its nearly a daily occurrence. That behavior changed fast.The other biggest change Ive seen happen is when making a turn onto a multilane roadway turning into the far lane of traffic instead of turning into the close lane and signalling over. Ive witnessed accidents as two vehicles are turning onto the same multilane road from opposite directions and one person is expecting their lane to be free but the other vehicle turns into their lane. It also creates some backlogs because some folks will wait forever to turn into the far lane instead of taking an empty close lane immediately and then signalling over.

Apparently studies show the brain needs to be more engaged to maintain a conversation on the phone than talking to a person who is present.  The explanationreason for this is something about lack of certain cues.  So talking on the phone takes more attention away from the road as compared to conversation in the vehicle.I personally cant even really converse in the car at least when there is even minorly tense stuff happening on the road so I get what youre saying about driving taking priority in the moment.,Edmonton,cxcqmcu,1,t5_2raht

Build your own sequence but still like a guided practice or use the beginner sequences.A great way to start is to do some beginner sequences while being gentle with yourself no pain!. Then spend the time and browse to learn modifications for your bodys sizeshapeneeds.All that being said i agree with the other redditors and cordially invite you to visit some local classes. I understand that you are shy. I still get a bit nervous going to a new studio practicing with a new teacher or learning a new sequence.

Bimodal distribution though with a second peak at Lkm which is likely either from predominantly city drivers or the .L engine vs the .L.  Like the other reply to you showed the Prius is right around Lkm so about . to x more efficient than your model.  In case you think thats a small change thats as if someone were comparing a model doing Lkm to your car and saying that theres no real difference in fuel economy. You might be right that the hassle isnt worth the cost but be real with the numbers.  Youre probably right that the difference is small if the person is doing mostly highway driving if the person is driving mostly in the city though a Prius is significantly more efficient.  ,Edmonton,cykngwi,1,t5_2raht

6317596,0,t3_41p7je,This is a bit of a stretch from your original question but I thought I would throw it out there to maybe help.  As I mention at the bottom if anyone feels Im incorrect in any of this or would like to add please feel free to do so.  Safety!  Always disconnect the negative cable first and connect the negative cable last when replacing a battery on modern vehicles.  The entire body is connected to ground so if you hook up the positive and the negative is already connected if you mistakenly hit any metal on your car you risk shorting the battery and possibly exploding the battery.  I want to throw that out there .  Dont tip the battery of course.  Most car batteries are vented unlike ATVMotorcycle not all batteries being sealed. Cold Cranking Amps CCA  As mentioned earlier you might want more cold cranking amps when you replace the battery.  Quite often aftermarket batteries are a bit higher rated than factory anyways.  I wont buy a battery from a dealership usually because usually the CCAs are lower than what Id like for Edmonton.  I cant recall the exact numbers but you lose a significant amount of cranking power on a fully charged battery at freezing temperatures. Many times the batteries arent fully charged when you purchase them new.  Some places Battery world  Ive purchased from there will offer to fully charge them up for you.  If theyre not fully charged and especially at colder temperatures you might notice things like your lights blip when you hit the brake pedal or other funny voltage dips.  You should either charge it up or take it for a good drive.  Most new cars dont really charge a lot at idle especially with all of the electronics on new ones.  The newer cars have smart alternators which the PCMECM controls the output on now to be more efficient for fuel mileage keeping the battery temperature down etc. A battery is about  water but when it discharges the chemical reaction with the plates converts it further to water.  This increases the chances of your battery freezing resulting in bulging and more issues of course.  Its important to keep it charged up.  Im not a chemistry expert but theres a lot of sites that can detail his for you ex.    Remote starters  alarms or other aftermarket accessories light on an iPhone charger in the cigarette lighter socket  Ive installed many remote starters and Ive found the higher way draw more power on the vehicle when its sitting off.  Most likely due to transmission at further distances.  It doesnt sound like a lot but a Compustar way Ive measured to draw mA.  The PCMECMTCM etc computers Ive found to usually draw around mA but many of them go into sleep.  Anyways when you do the math mA x  hours  .A x  days  A.  If you leave your vehicle parked for lengths of time and you have any additional aftermarket addons that draw power such as a remote starter you should either get a trickle charger smart charger Canadian Tire has these on sale for  often or even those solar panels also on sale at Canadian Tire often work fairly well.  I left my one vehicle for  weeks at the airport and it was so dead I couldnt get a single indicator to light up.  The battery shops can provide better advice but try to avoid draining your battery by mistake of course.  For several reasons  freezing as mentioned earlier high rate charges can kill a battery quickly and the obvious youre stranded.  Im putting this one out there because of my remote startaftermarket accessories comment they do add draw to a cars system while parked and off.  I know thats an obvious but every time you jumpstart it youre basically shortening the life of the battery.  This is usually due to the high charge rate from the alternator. Dualbatteries diesels without an isolator  always replace both together. Ensure your battery posts are cleantight.  Ive seen loose ground negative connections create all sorts of interesting issues.  The most often is the vehicle wont start clicks  if a starter is bad sometimes you can bump it  different topic someone opens the hood or shakes the vehicle and suddenly it starts. Badpoor batteries can shorten the life on your alternator if you keep using them as the alternator is continually trying to charge the battery.  It never hurts to check your alternator voltage should be .. volts while vehicle is running.  Ive purchased batteries at Battery World and Interstate.  Ive had very good luck with both.  I had one from Canadian Tire I wasnt too satisfied with but they warrantied it.  Ive never tried Costco batteries but Im sure theyre fine.  I had one battery in my last truck last  years but the key thing was I always ensured it was topped up.  I park my vehicle for periods of time so I usually put it on a smart charger.Please feel free to correct me or add me if Im wrong on any of these statements.,Edmonton,cz7qnka,1,t5_2raht

6465468,0,t3_447e7z,At least present the Enlightened in a fair manner and maybe learn about the story behind your own side first too For anyone who looks at this heres the REAL motivations behind the factions.The Resistance believe in the selfsufficiency of humanity and want to utilize one of the mechanics in the game universe exotic matter to defend humanity from the potential enslavement of an outside influence known as Shapers via increasing our technological prowess. Unfortunately for that path using the exotic matter in this manner has allowed the external otherdimensional species known as the NZeer to gain influence over humanity. In addition the Resistanceallied Artificial Intelligence known as A.D.A. has unknown motivations of her own that may or may not include humanitys survival.The Enlightened seek to use that same mechanic exotic matter to evolve humanity to a higher level particularly biologically. Unfortunately use of the exotic matter in this way has the side effect of increasing the influence of otherdimensional beings known as Shapers. Thus far there is little evidence that Shapers have any intention of enslaving humanity but the potential is there and there is no way to know for sure if they are able to enslave us without our knowledge. Additionally the formerlyhuman entity known as Roland Jarvis or simply Jarvis who has been inducted into the portal network and is potentially an example of the end result of the Enlightened evolution has unknown motivations of his own that may or may not include humanitys survival.This is really really simplified there is FAR more to the conflict than this not to mention many canonical subfactions on both sides that cover a whole spectrum of motivations plus all the other entities like Magnus and AntiMagnus and the three neutral XMbased companies that play into the canonical storyline. Both A.D.A. and Jarvis have tried to kill each other at some point during the storyline and failed since theyre both essentially immortal both of them have killed multiple other less or notimportant characters...its a tangled mess.Having said that you can boil the motivations of the factions down to the following Resistance are for technological innovation using XM while Enlightened are for biological evolution using XM again this is really simplified and the truth is definitely more complex. Both factions have an otherdimensional ally in a multimillenniaold conflict that may have begun before humanity existed indeed may have been the reason behind humanitys sapience in the first place as both species the Shapers and the NZeer sought to wield humanity as a tool against the other. Both factions have figureheads A.D.A. and Jarvis whos intentions may or may not actually align with the best interests of humanity.Theres a lot of good and bad on both sides. Thats what makes the story irrelevant but still fun to track. Its a game and both sides must be equal in order for the game to be fun.,Edmonton,czo2ov0,7,t5_2raht

Its just slightly off centre but not in a way that really evokes any reason or feeling. It just comes off as sloppy. It could have been really cool like a horizon shot that makes you wonder what youre looking at. Instead it just feels like you looked up at a random building and snapped it with your iPhone. This bit is just personal because I like abstract stuff but I think having the focus right up front doesnt help either. Playing with that depth would make it more interesting to absorb. Maybe having stood a touch closer could have helped too. It reminds me of your tilted bridge picture in that it could have turned out better and its less than the sum of its parts due to a lack of attention to detail. All in all its subjective.

7090506,0,t3_4cod83,It sounds like there is some confusion the way you explained it is a bit off but yea someone could originally be an employee and then choose to incorporate but still work for the same company....CRA doesnt really like it but there are tens of thousands of business like this in Alberta alone.  Note if you dont plan on giving the business revenue there is no point to this.This is done more than you think.  Someone incorporates then is paid as a contractor rather than an employee....so the business that they work for pays the newly incorporated business directly rather than the individual.  This opens up the door for claiming additional tax deductions that regular employees cant claim.  This strategy also allows for income splitting or tax deferral strategies.  Its pretty common for someone who makes year to easily save   year in taxes by incorporating.  Depending on available expenses and income splitting opportunities the savings could be greater.There are definitely risks and disadvantages to incorporating so this isnt appropriate for everyone.The cost to incorporate is more than .

This hasnt been much of an issue for me because the jerky gets eaten long before it has a chance to spoil.  Plus fatty meat can get pretty messy as you are cookingdrying it.  Around December I got a Nesco dehydrator with jerky kit and a cheap meat slicer.  Ive been making a batch about once a week on average.  The jerky kit is basically a calking gun for making strips out of ground meat.  Ive used all sorts of different meat...usually I get the cheapest that I can find.  Pork is usually cheaper than beef so I look for pork loin.  NoFrills had a bunch on sale last month.  Ground chicken or turkey works well in a jerky gun.  If you know any hunters deer or moose is usually pretty lean and makes for good jerky.  Superstore has frozen ground meat.  Its  lb tubes in a bag for .  I bought the chicken....and I wouldnt call it ground...more like mashed.  The meat was sticky and felt like paste.....but damn if it didnt turn into nice chewy jerky.

Taking more cars off of the road needs to become a bigger priority if we want to seriously address issues around fossil fuel and pollution. Because it is easier and cheaper is a horrible excuse when there are alternatives that arent prohibitively expensive. Additionally you are only coming up with one reason as to why it wouldnt work for you. Please keep in mind you exist in a community with many other people with many other priorities and needs that do not match your own. Additional competition between transit service providers will likely increase service quality and or lower cost. Last already pay for VIA but get little to no service over east.

7948814,0,t3_4o4bd4, The XBone is a good system but it doesnt have as much trade value as the PS youre gonna need to offer something else with it.     The trade value is going to drop even more when the Xbox OneS comes out.  And people who are interested might be holding out for Scorpio. Its essentially Xbox  but backwards compatible fully with XBox One and possibly .On top of that its very likely to the point of being nearly confirmed that it will support the Oculus Rift out of the box.Like Vsreal said try Kiji but have something in addition to the system.

Your first action should have been to slow down and then try to change lanes. Slowing down guarantees everyones safety in the event your changing lanes gets blocked.Slow down good now youre not a huge danger to the cop. Can you now change lanes to get further away from them?

I provided free mini chocolate bars to my riders and some would just toss the wrappers on the floor. Nice. It just so happened that my VERY LAST rider decided to vomit all up on herself and on my car. She was probably  years old and couldnt hold her alcohol. She didnt feel the need to speak up and ask me to stop so that kind of pissed me off  albeit I was kind to her yet.I continued to drive her and her two friends home then took photos of the vomit and they got charged  clean up fee. I cleaned the vomit with products I already owned so I gained  out of it. Id rather it never happen again but because of the additional  I wasnt TOO mad about it.Anyway all in all its a lovely job.

I would have expected burnco and the like to know what type would be best to use but find out the differences in the materials. For example washed sand will have no organic material and be pure sand anything under mm will have been washed away. This would make for great drainage properties but wouldnt hold together very well when compacted and may not keep the turf very level over time.

8414298,0,t3_4uvyd3,Its a nice area.  Lots of large old trees on the residential streets.  Parks and schools etc.  Most of the houses are getting on in age and thus rather small....but thats more of an issue for people looking to buy a house in the area.Transportation is great because its a bit of a cross roads.  Straight west takes you through Old Strathcona bars amp youth culture and further to the U of A.    Going east will quickly get you to the major ring roads and thus anywhere around the city.Bonnie Doon is relatively close to the river valley which is probably one of Edmontons best assets.  Right across the river is downtown so that is certainly withing easy commuting distance.Its also on what most would consider the South Side of the city which has all the shopping amp retail you could want except for the giant mall which is way out on the west end.  As for crime it does seem to be a little worse than similar neighborhoods around it but Id say that that is because of the mall and being a transportation hub.    For example you could look at areas like Kenilworth or Hollyrood.  They likely have less people moving through so less crime but transportation wouldnt be quite as easy.  ,Edmonton,d5tbx63,5,t5_2raht

Again unlikely but just giving you some potential outcomes.,Edmonton,d5ysj6y,1,t5_2raht

8564426,1,t1_d6c3rzb,Child Services amp Child Maintenance Enforcement are mostly run by women. When I had to deal with Child Services because of my ex girlfriends lack of normal parenting skills in  I had a caseworker that was going through a divorce and the antiman bias was thick. It was an awful experience and her misandry almost negatively affected my daughters life amp future. Child Services had to reopen many of her cases to reevaluate her former decisions once she was fired.This occurs all the time towards men. But because were just men were told to suck it up and man up. Theres some serious societal double standards at play but if you bring it up then youre a misogynist.

8621246,0,t1_d6i0oom,Maybe I dont want mps? I just want netflix.  is fine for that.When I recommend an ISP to someone I recommend it on  things. Total minimal cost to get them what they need typically  netflix stream with maybe one or two more on a smaller device. Thus download caps are very dangerous. Very few people know how to monitor nor do they want to stop watching crap for the last week of the month or something stupid. The other is flexibility. A contract in this day and age is just customer abuse as it a download cap. Cable is a non issue as even the baby boomers I know have cut the cord. Ping time download speed beyond netflix and any other tech feature is meaningless. I am a creator of high availability mission critical networked solutions and even I find  fine most of the time. My main complaint about TechSavvy is that in the evenings it turns to crap. My neighbors who were with shaw but switched to TechSavvy on my advice were also getting crap in the evenings but now they are getting crap for far less. So to me mps would be technically better than  but not for double the price. Plus I like how you divided the higher price into two years. Am I cutting the internet off next year? No that higher price is for years to come. Thus it should be looked at more like  years out of the next  at the higher price plus  at the lower price. Then it is  per month or double what I pay now.I hope that shaw and the family that run it burn in hell.,Edmonton,d6j9973,1,t5_2raht

9124964,1,t1_d88mith,Yes I am aware that this is the typical example of OMG ARENT FREE MARKETS TERRIBLE!? having heard some variation of it a million times over.However it ignores the fact that. Vehicles are recalled all the time often for rare defects.  Manufacturers tend to err on the side of extreme caution and riskaversion.. Car manufacturers are very sensitive to public image and perception given the array of competition in the market.  Youll recall that Toyota took a huge hit after one person died due to a stuck accelerator pedal not even caused by Toyota but by an aftermarket product a floor mat..  Vehicles today are safer and more advanced than at any point in history while fatalities have shown a longterm trend downwards.. Criminal negligence is still a thing.  Willfully ignoring engineering advice would be rooted out quickly given the scale of this conspiracy and prosecuted accordingly.  .  Out of court settlements can get awfully pricey.

I mean if I was having conversations with someone online and she seemed nice and one time made a joke about being underage I might show up. But then Id pick some place nice and public so I could figure out what the real story is before anything else. Thats why the police and Dateline would get someone into a house to prove intent. All the creep catchers prove is that someone was interested enough to want to know what was going on.

9300038,0,t1_d8uqaw4,The job market sucks its why I moved out here in the first place. But it really depends on what your profession is. All of my family back home are gainfully employed maybe a few teenage cousins make minimum wage? Theres a large service industry along with shipping obvious reasons military and government jobs. Healthcare is a booming business back home but just not as lucrative. But keep in mind cost of living is slightly less so wage is also. Taxes are higher its an  Harmonized Sales Tax. If you have a car you have to get it inspected every year. Kind of shitty but less death traps on the road. You dont see many abandoned cars like you do here.   NS has excellent healthcare but for things like the ER there are wait times same as here. Its more about people going for stupid reasons rather than lack of services. The biggest difference is theres no private lab services Dynalife so bloodwork is all done through outpatients at the hospitals of which there are many. Most major things you have to go into the city for but thats no different again. Its not a ghetto place to live by any stretch there are sketchy parts of town but you get that everywhere. Violent crime is far less than it is here for sure. There is crime and drugs but if youre not into crime and drugs youre not likely to be exposed to it. Food is the same as here. I talk to my mom weekly we compare food prices on the regular lol! Beef is more expensive dairy is cheaper. Everything is readily available seafood is far cheaper and better there. They have things like The Organic Box theres tons of local produce around. I think people are more conservative here actually. I just feel like back home people are friendlier overall and dont really care about the colour of your skin or your sexual orientation. But keep in mind I was raised by hippies who were in the musicarts scene so that could just be my experience. Theres tons of things to do in the summer  beaches festivals outdoor concerts. The Buskers on the waterfront international food festivals. Theres the Public Gardens Citadel Hill and Point Pleasant Park to explore  all in the city! Lots of cool little restaurants and cafs independent shops all over. Still all the big box stores as well though. Transit system functions no LRT they have a ferry that goes across the harbour instead. Although I cant say much for New Brunswick your family friend is absolutely exaggerating. Comparing NB to NS is like AB and SK similar but not the same. I know my SO came here because of the job market and he isnt particularly fond of his hometown but he grew up in the middle of nowhere jobs were scarce when it was good. Plus his entire family is out here now. If you go get a good job research the market. Stay out of shitty neighbourhoods youll be fine.

If they refuse or tell you it will take a while state that you understand and dont have any problem waiting until one is free. If they ask you to move aside so they can help someone else politely decline. Restate calmly you are prepared to wait for a supervisor. If they threaten you with the police advise them you understand but that if the police are called you will have to call the media and a lawyer. They will likely get a supervisor. Remain calm polite and write everything down. If they follow up with the threat of police do try to call local media. They love a good story. If the police arrive before media remain calm polite and explain your situation. If the police ask you to step off of Epcor properly you must obey. However make sure you have the chance to fill out a witness statement form and get an event number. This can help you if it does go the legal route. Hopefully the media will show up.

10277691,0,t1_dc8wxcs,gt What happens if ...?So lets assume theres no way to make the system perfect or nearperfect. Lets assume that a certain number of people end up donating organs who didnt want to in life.What does happen? Yeah its disrespectful and I wouldnt advocate taking organs from corpses whose previous inhabitants didnt want to donate. But what is the worstcase scenario here? gt Then theres the discussion if we take ownership of peoples organs in the name of saving lives why not their entire bodies. We could use cadavers to test new procedures that could help save more lives in the future?Well yeah. Thats already an option the medical research thing  for specific organs as well as the whole cadaver. Its not really a separate argument  if one is optout or even optin then the other could be as well.Edit to addgt Where does it stop?Well it stops where someone indicates theyre absolutely against their organs being donated. If that happens its unintentional  a bug not a feature. I guess the possibility that someone somewhere someday might die and accidentally end up as a donor when they didnt want to be just isnt a dealbreaker for me.Beyond this conversation it could stop at the point of there being no legitimate medical reason to acquire the organs or tissues. Say if we have a situation where we have plenty of donated tissue to work with we wouldnt commandeer bodies to use as Halloween decorations. Another easy line to draw is while the person is alive  obviously. At a very bare minimum no ones coming for your kidneys as long as youre using them and opting in or out of the organ donor program doesnt open the door to that in any way whatsoever.

Obviously some roles do not lend themselves to a change in gender or ethnicity but where possible they audition people and the best actor for the role wins regardless of genderethnicity.  There is currently a production of Henry V up with a woman lead and recently a showing of  angry men where  of the jurors were women.

Those dont often sit on councils and a technical aptitude is certainly lacking. Sure council is just providing direction but without a knowledge of the capabilities of todays technology how can council steer the ship correctly?Ill give an example Lawn maintenance. Just this year the city began to innovate  performing field maintenance around the city was a standard Travelling Salesman Problem I credit Ivesons leadership on pushing the Open Data program forward on this  once good data became available on the locations of maintainance yards and the locations of the grass that needed cutting it was almost immediate for an employee with a software background to spot the Travelling Salesman and write a Python script to better optimize routing. It led to around a  increase in efficiency. Basically for free.These are the kinds of things that will radically change our city and allow us to offer better services at lower cost. But we need strong leadership on the technology file to get there.Unique solutions come from having people with a variety of backgrounds look at the issues.

11017522,0,t1_deg6wwc,gt Maybe thats the problem. I just dont see the viewpoint of abstinence over contraceptive being as shitty a societal viewpoint as  being homophobic or racist. I kind of do because honestly it speaks to a certain attitude. Having a man tell me that he wont prescribe me a medical service because he doesnt believe in it would make me feel like he feels towards women the way most racists feel towards whatever race they dislike. I would feel incredibly disrespected and dismissed. My doctor and I have had discussions around her concerns with prescribing the birth control pill  she wasnt comfortable with me taking it because my blood pressure is a bit high. Thats fine and acceptable. She also worked with me to find an alternative to the pill she didnt just flat out say nope not today. Thats how a professional should handle it and how someone with respect would handle it. The way that OPs doctor handled it was really disrespectful if he was going to change his practices after  years he should have been fully prepared to go into that room say I can no longer provide this service heres a referral end of story. He didnt though and I think thats where the problem is and why people are feeling outraged over the situation. ,Edmonton,degt09e,3,t5_2raht

This is teamdependent but most managers dont care if you leave early and finish the last hour or two of you work in the evening from home.  They just care that your deadlines are met. Can work up to an extra . hours a month then take a day off the next month in lieu. Noquestionsasked time off for appointments.  Theyll let you take a few hours off with pay in case you have an appointment during work hours.  Im sure theyll ask for proof if they suspect youre abusing it but nobody does AFAIK. The entire basement is a gym.  Workout studio cardio machines weight machines no free weights! change rooms and showers. They have fitness classes before work during lunch and after work.There was a fouryear period when the IT staff were expected to work  hours with OT pay to finish a major project.  Now that that project is finished and were back to . hours it just feels like were coasting TBH.

11274822,0,t3_60w2l0,The arena was built for the NHL team. Forget about the taxes theyre gone... Katz took you for a ride. The main argument here is that most owners who are able to pay for the arena themselves have  or  major sports teams using the facility so theres double or triple the revenue in places like LA and New York versus up here in Northern Alberta. If he was going to build one himself why not go to a place like Seattle where it can host maybe an NBA and NHL team simultaneously. Katz did commit like  million to the project.Additionally some of the more important upgrades are in areas you dont see. Its a facility where multimillionaire hockey players will actually want to hang out to train practice and rehab. Rexall place was in the ghetto with facilities well below the NHL average. The best thing about it was that it was right near the highway so you could get away from the area lickity split. The team is playing great right now but I think some of that credit is in part due to the new facility. Its been beneficial for team spirit and Im not quite sure wed have the same results if we were still in Rexall.As far as the premium seats go. I for one prefer to pay the extra for the experience. I could have afforded season seats in the upper bowl but instead paid like a third of that to get  games in one of the lounges. I get served free food waitresses bring drinks straight to my seat I got a little more leg room and a comfy padded seat with a cup holder. Is it worth paying double the price of a regular upper bowl seat? I dunno but they suckered me into it I guess. Most other arenas have similar offerings. When I went to a game in Montreal  or  years ago I got free food with my ticket we were in a segregated area as well and the experience was great well above Rexall place I never saw Rexall quite in the same light after that.Its supposed to be a toptier arena for a the best league in the world.

11724450,0,t3_67a3n4,Welcome to geocaching!  Ive been doing it in Edmonton since around  and its a fun hobby.  The local community is friendly too.yegnoobs advice is great.  When youre new Id suggest avoiding MIST or anything micro in a wooded area.  Its just too frustrating to search for a long time and come away empty handed especially when searching an evergreen when every single branch is a potential hiding spot.My favourite caches are the small sneaky downtown hides.  Instead of bruteforce searching a tree you can usually stand back and think about where it could be hidden and then search a small number of spots.  The downside is that then you have to be stealthy and time your search to not get spotted by nongeocachers.  And youll feel awkward feeling around underneath park benches by yourself.  BTW pretending to tie your shoe is a good excuse...My biggest advice  go with a friend.  Searching will go more than twice as fast and if you are somewhere public like downtown you wont feel nearly as awkward.I almost always just search to sign the logbook without taking and leaving something from the cache.  But I always carry a few things to trade in my geocaching bag just in case.For equipment youll want a pen and a pair of tweezers.  Often nano caches are just a pencileraser sized magnetic cylinder with a scroll of paper hidden inside.  So youll need your own pen to sign it and tweezers can help to remove the paper without damaging it.I think my last bit of advice is that its going to be a mess for the next few weeks while the ground is soggy.  So maybe wait until things dry out and then give it a try through the summer.  Hope you have fun!,Edmonton,dgozw7t,4,t5_2raht

But thats about it.And really you dont enforce it by sending harsh letters to parents. You just treat it like boogers and poop jokes  this isnt appropriate to class time please talk about something else.,Edmonton,dgvkeco,4,t5_2raht
