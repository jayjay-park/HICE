I know ToD was similar as well though but it wasnt until ACiT came along that we finally got Clank gameplay that was on par with with other kinds of gameplay. Commanding things is novel at first but it gets old quickly. If were talking about the small variations like the hammerbots and bridgebots in GC and the Skrunchbanana stuff in UYA then  I generally dont consider that enough of a variation to make it a different type of clank gameplay.,RatchetAndClank,csnij7s,3,t5_2tqfx

Some genres are dependent on some form of storytelling to make things work correctly RPGs and survival horror but platformers and shooters arent ones that need stories.Let me put out a HUGE disclaimer and say that I enjoy games with enjoyable stories more than those without and I do indeed think that video games are a valuable storytelling medium.  However Ratchet amp Clank is not a game where the story is important.  It stands on fun gameplay and slick humor.  Not impressive storytelling.  I think RampC has fun and enjoyable storytelling but I really dont think its the selling point.  Like at all.,RatchetAndClank,cvf6nyw,1,t5_2tqfx

7185867,0,t3_4bvm1v,The original trilogy is perfect and doesnt need a remake imo but whole reimagining of the original trilogy would be fantastic but they should stick to first  games only with future remakes and keep it at that. Part of me thinks they would ruin the tone with a remake of GC. Hear me out. GC had a much more sinister dark tone to it and the Bogon Galaxy felt much more hostile. Whilst a reimagined version of the original may be cool it is ultimately linked to a film and it looks as if it will be a light hearted and friendly game film. For me one of the reasons GC stood out was because of the hostile atmosphere. I get the feeling that a GC reimagining wouldnt have that tone that made it so good because they would make it light hearted.,RatchetAndClank,d1uyyh3,2,t5_2tqfx
