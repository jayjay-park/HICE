When you eat the candy the bacteria stay inside.Your teeth are white just like glucose because theyre practically made of the stuff. When you eat the bacteria filled candy they jump into your teeth and start tearing away at them! Why do you think some people have false teeth? Well Calvin its usually only old people because toothpaste wasnt invented back then. Why do you know why old people have such brittle bones?

In his frustration he summons a group of children intending to create child soldiers thinking that this will cause the aliens to hesitate when faced with killing an infant of the species.As seen in the show his plan worked exceedingly well  all of the aliens showed their hesitation to hurt children and the power rangers exploited this to quickly destroy their opposition Zordon even designed their belts to inject them with LSD methamphetamine and cocaine so that the children showed no hesitation and responded to every situation with violence.The Power Rangers actually ripped most of their opponents apart with shanks and sometimes teeth.
