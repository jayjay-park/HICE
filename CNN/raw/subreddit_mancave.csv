414294,0,t3_1ysz0c,I used an Expedite cabinet from Ikea. I made a back panel out if  plywood the hide the wires and painted it. It worked out great except that I didnt measure for my cable box which doesnt fit in the cabinet. I wired up some LED lights in it and it really gave it a completed look. It was pretty easy overall. Here is a what it looks like  Really the only DIY part about it was back panel. Cut it to fit drill   i think holes to run cables through and paint it. Nailed it on with a finish nailer. Took longer to run all the wires than it did to assemble everything.,mancave,cfnpgvo,7,t5_2s6gt

5160287,0,t3_3los42,Take it to a local sign or large format print shop. They would print it in panels with a matte laminate finish. Image should size up ok and maintain a decent resolution especially in low light. I highly recommend any local FASTSIGNS center if available.,mancave,cv808px,4,t5_2s6gt

11342534,0,t1_dfhjvmt,Fan in the bathroom? No.I have Lutron Caseta wireless switches on three circuits. The area with the pool table amp stair case into the basement. The theater area proper. The kitchenette areaIn the bathroom and the office I just have Lutron motion sensors. The fan is on a traditional switch in the bathroomOne problem with the shower. Its got a solid awesome frameless glass door and enclosure. Its water tight for all intents and purposes and steams up instantly if the fan isnt on. I dont like fan noise so I hate turning on the fan. The steam blocks the motion sensor and if you shower for more then  minutes you are now in the dark. You have to open the door and wave frantically to get it to come back on. I want to take the motion sensor off in my office since I realize I like the dark at work proper I am in a basement and never turn the office lights on unless people are coming to talk to me so I am thinking adding either a Lutron Caseta switch or replacing the bulbs with Hue bulbs... and adding a Hue strip to the desk and as accents to the work area maybe ... got to fit in with the rest of the Battlestationers right?,mancave,dfhnn7b,1,t5_2s6gt
