I would probably agree that theres not a whole lot of impressive character development with Raoden and Sarene... But I dont think a story needs character development to be good. I thoroughly enjoyed the two of them just being themselves and working through the problems they encounter.,thelegendarium,dfh15kf,3,t5_3jisk
11431041,0,t3_6343hd,Watch out for book title hints in the prophecies at the startfinish of each book. Not all of the titles come from these but I think most of them do.The Shadow Rising  The Shadow shall rise across the world and darken every land even to the smallest corner and there shall be neither Light nor safety. And he who shall be born of the Dawn born if the Maiden according to Prophecy he shall stretch forth his hands to catch the Shadow and the world shall scream in the pain of salvation. All Glory be to the Creator and to the Light and to he who shall be born again. May the Light save us from him. The Fires of Heaven  With his coming are the dread fires born again. The hills burn and the land turns sere. The tides of men run out and the hours dwindle. The wall is pierced and the veil of parting raised. Storms rumble beyond the horizon and the fires of heaven purge the earth. There is no salvation without destruction no hope this side of death.,thelegendarium,dfrp34b,8,t5_3jisk
