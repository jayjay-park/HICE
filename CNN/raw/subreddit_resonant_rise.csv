3037047,0,t1_cocj6hm,Like MrOffline said Metallurgy gives you the best tools possible with Tinkers Construct while you have ExtraTiC. Tartarite fantasy alloy gives you a  durability simple tool and a x multiplier on tool rods. I have a tartarite pickaxe with over  durability a . stonebound bonus with Ardite and a resonant capacitor to keep the durability at  and the bonus at maximum without losing the tool.Quicksilver axes and shovels are very durable and fast and celengil and desichalkos are fairly high overall on stats good for lumber axes and hammers and excavators.I would mention Abstracters but those arent in metallurgy  in Met  they were used to break down metals into experience.And finally you can make very pretty bricks with  ingots p,resonant_rise,cocsf3k,1,t5_317tt

3601598,0,t1_cq2sq8u,Im not sure how to delete TileEntities but having deleted TileTicks and Entities  in the region around the PRC not every base it still gives the same error.I might just try making a new world with the same seed and copying regions across slowly and see what happens when I get home from work tonight.Thanks for trying to help me though ,resonant_rise,cq2t36g,1,t5_317tt

I go through phases of play and I seem to be gearing up for another long season of Minecraft fun. Ive had some experience with Resonant Rise and a bunch of the mods within modded minecraft has been a godsend for the game introducing a bunch of new concepts. I enjoy tightknit communities and this seems to be a good one. My in game name is the same as it is here Seamros. Hope to hear from you guys.,resonant_rise,cq3eeos,2,t5_317tt
