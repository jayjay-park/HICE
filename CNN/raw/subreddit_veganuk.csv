5881737,0,t3_3vpaoy,Hey Im former user snoozyvegan I started the sub because I felt that there was a need for it but have zero technical knowledge. I deleted my old account and forgot to set a new mod. Im really glad someone has taken it over and can give it the attention it needs! ,veganuk,cxqmmy7,1,t5_33xgk

7081231,0,t3_4ckkci,Its still giving money to a company which raises chickens in awful environments just so they can be sold cheaply. As a vegan I avoid Nandos for this reason. ,veganuk,d1j0tm6,3,t5_33xgk

7148578,0,t1_d1qinb6,Haha I do disregard people where I can but this was someone in my girlfriends family so it must be dealt with accordingly!I wasnt in any way concerned or doubting my dietary choice. In the two years Ive been vegan I went from Omni to vegan overnight I have never felt better! Just interested to see what people thought.I am obviously of the opinion that a vegan diet is overwhelmingly better for you and any negatives that may exist such as the need to decrease omega intake in this instance are outweighed by the benefits. In the telegraph article at the bottom it also mentions that you may lower fertility by consuming more pesticides. Dont get me wrong I know that they are feeding the crops to the animals etc so I am not worried relative to being Omni but rather from an objective viewpoint I would like to cut down on pesticides.,veganuk,d1qpxqa,1,t5_33xgk

9006610,0,t3_53jgoi,The Hazelnut Chocolate looks incredible. Ive almost finished a tub of Almond Dream Salted Caramel so this looks like an ideal replacement for that spot in the freezer!,veganuk,d7ugc9x,2,t5_33xgk
9794185,0,t1_daiv9vu,No probs. Its a very solid machine I just needed something more powerful in the end mainly for frozen banana ice cream.  It served me well for  years and is the perfect introductory machine for everyone.  Cleaning under the seal though....man after  years I got super sick of that.  But it was worth it for such a good value powerful little gadget.,veganuk,dakcfyu,2,t5_33xgk
10183682,0,t1_dbycwzd,This seems to be a repeat of a post Ive seen going around Facebook today where somebody says that they purchased them at Waitrose and they were listed at . on the shelf and scanned through at .. ,veganuk,dbydkkv,2,t5_33xgk
