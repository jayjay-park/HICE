4583114,0,t3_3dsmik,First off calm down. Anything thats bad has already happened. Take a deep breath. in and out Okay. This is almost definitely a scam. But dont worry. You will figure it all out. To deal with the site get off of it and the pop up. The longer you are on it the worse it is for you. Secondly dealing with the computer try running both malware protection services. If you still have issues then you need to wipe your computer completely clean. In windows . you can do this by searching msconfig.exe and then checking the box that says something about safe mode. Restart your computer. Then you need to delete any suspicious looking recently installed software LINK . Once you do that search msconfig.exe again and uncheck safe mode. Restart your computer again.Thirdly cancel all of your credit cards. Im not kidding. Cancel anything you can that you gave to the hacker. Change every login possible to a more secure password. By the way an easy way to make secure passwords is to come up with a phrase and remember it. For instance I love reddit because it is super duper awesome for everyone could become ILRbiiSDAe that is a very secure  digit passcode right there! Plus you can remember it yours should be more than  characters long and have at least  number. You should also consider having a security professional stop by and talk to your family about viruses and how to prevent them. You could look online instead but I like real people better.Think of things that look suspicious. A person wouldnt need more than  credit card number and they sure as hell dont need the whole thing. They just need the last  digits and the expiration date. I can help more when I have more time but I dont at the moment so all I can do is wish you the best with this new knowledge.ALSO Make sure to change your router password and IP addresses. Ask your internet service provider on how to do that.Good luck and if you have ANY QUESTIONS AT ALL no question is stupid ask meuRaddudLink  ,malwarecheck,ct8axjr,1,t5_38ul5
