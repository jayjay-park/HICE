768313,0,t3_22vu0g,Maglev seems to have an extraordinary high track cost. Construction costs of  billion USD for  Kilometers are  times more expansive than a high speed rail line given the construction costs of LGV Est Europeenne  Mio. USD per Km. ,highspeedrail,cgrm1jz,1,t5_2shvt
905624,0,t3_24eonk,Whats going to happen to these trains?If the Milwaukee HSR project has been cancelled whats stopping Talgo from selling them to Amtrak? It just seems a huge waste to have two brand new trains sitting unused for a year.,highspeedrail,ch783zd,2,t5_2shvt

6813075,0,t1_d0oc2va,That mockup is not from CAHSR. Its from Siemens the company that wants to build their high speed trains for the system. The train was designed years ago. Its just waiting for the tracks. Alstom Bombardier and other high speed train manufacturers want to build them for us too.But it does make sense for Siemens to build them since they would be expanding their Sacramento plant to do it. Thats not just more American jobs but more California jobs.,highspeedrail,d0ok57g,1,t5_2shvt
6982546,0,t1_d17cflt,I have ridden that line. It runs along the coast so it is never particularly straight but it is fairly flat. There are many tunnels. The difference between high season fares and low season is  yen so Im not sure where youre getting your numbers,highspeedrail,d17t6zm,1,t5_2shvt
7043494,0,t1_d1eq60t,From what I read the plan allows for San Joaquin to run on it provisionally. Basically making use of the track laid till HSR trains start. I cannot find the source for that right now busy on an essay and I admit I could very well be wrong. But I would love to see San Joaquin benefit from it or for Amtrak to introduce a proper highspeed train out here pending no private or sucky service starts. ,highspeedrail,d1eqk17,1,t5_2shvt
7046025,0,t1_d1f0jbi,Commuters within the valley? I havent seen the numbers but I can imagine no scenario where theres going to be more than an infinitesimal number of people commuting by train between two sprawling car dependent cities in the Central Valley.  Neither the employment nor residential geographies of Fresno or Bakersfield or Madera or anywhere else support such behavior by more than a negligible number of people. With respect to StocktonOakland that falls squarely under the heading of better ways to serve them and those ways arent recognizably similar to the current San Joaquin.  ,highspeedrail,d1f0woi,1,t5_2shvt
7454422,0,t3_4h9l3f,Fallacious reasoning writ large  a make overbroad assertions b claim why they are true.Why are trains outside of the Northeast so unbelievably awful?  They are?  Been to Michigan or Illinois?  Passenger service could certainly be better... but Kalamazoo has multiple daily departures in both directions for trains that travel   mph and have  ontime performance.   Passenger rail service in some parts of Illinois borders on abundant.Washington DC to Pittsburgh  miles away  Pair picking a common strategy.  What about Chicago to Holland MI?  Yes not only car competitive  but competitive with air travel!  Same for Chicago to Kalamazoo.  See I can pairpick too.   Time between Chicago and various nearby pairs is pretty good for travel time  how about St. Louis?The problem with most city pairs is frequency not speed.  So waving the highcost of true highspeed rail is a boogey man argument.  Very few city pairs currently connected by rail are connected by rail traveling at the maximum speed for conventional rail  an upgrade with a very reasonable price. And an upgrade that would result in competitiveness with doortodoor trip times against airtravel.,highspeedrail,d2piqx2,3,t5_2shvt

10758566,0,t3_5tmqiy,As excited as I am and remain about CHSR it is somewhat depressing to think that Japan will have a maglev train connecting two of their three biggest cities before California will even have the first segment completed. ,highspeedrail,ddpo02v,2,t5_2shvt
