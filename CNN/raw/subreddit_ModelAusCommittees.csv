4921182,0,t1_cueqr22,Mr Chair I thank the Deputy Chair for moving an amendment for streamlined committees. However there are some further concerns I would raise.i On EAR I have no further advice it seems to achieve all aims with no obvious issues.ii On EEITR it is of course reasonable to include Industry. However as there is no Minister for Industry or Science I would suggest that it might be best placed in the committee of the Prime Minister not the Treasurer. Dealing with industry regulation intellectual property laws whistleblower protections and statutory bodies like the CSIRO amp ANSTO all fall on the legal side after all.iii On EHIASP I would suggest changing Social Policy to Society. This will align it precisely with the Minister for Society. Social Policy is usually much broader and in particular it includes immigration employment income taxation GST etc so is perhaps best shared among the committees. Further the Culture portfolio may best be moved to another committee see below rather than being subsumed by Social Policy and Indigenous Affairs.iv On TIC I have no further advice.v On ATI previously TAC I would suggest it is wholly out of alignment to including Immigration in the Arts committee. These policies often involve quite disparate issues and expertise and in any case there is a Joint committee for Immigration. I would suggest that Arts and Tourism align better with Culture than Immigration hence my TAC recommendation.vi On CPLA previously CLIP please see my advice on EEITR.Thank you again.jndau Secretary of the Committee on Procedure and Clerk of the House,ModelAusCommittees,cueuqh9,2,t5_38hol
