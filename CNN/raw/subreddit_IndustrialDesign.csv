7219281,0,t3_4e7wcz,Great looking design and a clever reuse of materials.If youre aiming to create them quicker and easier there is a specific area of design called DFM Design for manufacture which would ease the process.You could start by reducing the number of unique parts making the top and bottom rings the same and if youre willing changing your mechanism to be equal in length above and below the pivot point. From this you could buy some time on a plasmawater jet table and have a batch of pivots cut for you. The rings likewise could be made in batches from tubing using a circular saw with metal blade and stop block.A jig would be well advised for welding the final piece helping with speed repeatability and acting as a heatsink to reduce warpage.Remember your time is valuable and the aim is the make your product in the smartest yet dumbest way possible.,IndustrialDesign,d1yrz8b,2,t5_2qiv5

7353061,0,t1_d2a96em,Well the loans part is null for me so to me its really a question of how much Im losing by not having those  years of experience. Im afraid that since my portfolio is mostly school projects its not as focused as Id like on things like high tech products and UIUX and Im not sure if having both a degree researching those topics as well as working with companies in those fields during the masters might help bridge the gap to get a job in that market.vs just applying with my current somewhat scattered portfolio and hoping for the best...or working at a design place that is more related to my portfolio but less to those topics.I guess as an employer in design do they see all experience as equally valuable or only if its in the domain of things they want to do? For example is a masters student doing studies on data analytics in wearables more valuable to Google than a  year designer in furniture say? Hypothetically speaking I mean. I guess my dilemma is Im afraid that Im not specific enough for some companies and idk if a masters would help me get specific or if Im better just getting whatever design experience I can and hope thats good enough.,IndustrialDesign,d2dzr24,1,t5_2qiv5

This really sux when the owner signs with Walmart Amazon Rakuten theyre moving millions via reseller no direct sales.They often include time limitations and reference to acquisition cancelling any and all outstanding licence fees.The company employing a designer on a royalty basis generally sees the designer as owner of that aspect of the project. Work and time demands can be oncall and very unpredictable they come back from China vendor trip and contact you for a lot of updates with new and bizarre technical requirements. Without clear contract wording expect to take on this work in perpetuity.Anecdote timeFriend designed a famous office task chair on royalty basis.  years later he saw first cheque for . He earned quite a bit more later then all those obscure limiting conditions kicked in. He estimated he earned a few  more than if hed billed hours for the design job but again  years to payment.I visited very well known US ID company on a shared project. President did the get to know us speech and tour showing shelves of high profile client work and pointed out their one royalty based project for large Japanese electronics company. ID president said his company would not take on another royalty project fatal last words we simply have no way of auditing their sales goodwill only.Lastly to be positive I have heard a few anecdotes from other designers that have successfully licensed product designs all furniture or bike accessories.

Is it connected to metal?If your product has a relatively short lifespan UV may be a nonissue. Generally speaking its often cheaper to cover the carbon fibre part with a covering for arguments sake paint than it is to use UV resistant chemical coatings depending on the lifespan and other properties needed. Theres also the issue of the products end of the life. Then theres the case of what your using it for. Take into account that certain materials are not a good fit for the certain tasks material properties but still go into commerical use. Carbon fibre arrow shafts are a good example.
