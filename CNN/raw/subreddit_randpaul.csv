4410787,1,t3_3bjywr,Its not conclusive at all.  Global warming is a fraud. Do you realize how many factors come into play when it comes to global warming?  The climate is always changing nobody is denying that.  The factors contributing to climate and temperature are so deep that any scientist that claims there is conclusive evidence of global warming is a fraud.  There is no possible way scientists can measure all of the millions of factors that go into global temperatures.  The sun moon and solar system are even at play not just Earth oceans and atmosphere.  There is a biological aspect to is as well.  Plants and animals have a symbiotic relationship and we live in a very complicated biosphere. I can sympathize becasue I used to be somewhat brainwashed on the issue as well.  You have to realize there are a lot of special interests that benefit from the global warming narrative.  Energy companies are often pushing the narrative like GE.  You have to ask yoruself why?  Its because they want energy artificially scarce so they can charge more.  Also they want regulations that make it hard for any competitors to compete in the energy market while they gain monopoliesoligopolies.  A lot of the reason for the wars in Iraq and other places are because special interests like oil companies pushed for it.  They didnt like that Saddam Hussein was pumping too much oil and reducing the market prices.  They wanted to control the oil to create artificial scarcity so they can charge more.,randpaul,csmtwn3,-2,t5_2rbpp

I understand where Rand and his followers are coming from when they say that excessive taxing hurts the economy too much and that that is a bigger issue than GW but thats easy to refute. Global Warming already is and will continue to cost us billions of dollars in damages which we will pay for by raising taxes our only choice. There was some discussion about it being over exaggerated recently but the scientific community has proved that wrong with more recent studies.  The fact is that Global Warming is still a huge issue one that already has costed us a lot of money due to it making weather patters more extreme take hurricane sandy for example which caused billions in damages that resulted in significant tax increases on everyone. Besides damages and increased taxes coming from the change in weather patterns due to GC our oceans are still rising and will flood coastal areas. Yes it is horrible that we have to tax companies like BP for what they do but it is surely worth it in the long term. And I actually agree with you that taxing isnt the only way that we should combat this threat we could also use big government infrastructure projects to bring many cities and town to use renewable sources but I doubt that Rand being a small government Tea Party member would like that idea. All I know is that the destruction of coastal cities and infrastructure costs of more severe weather patterns and destruction of sea life will surely make our economy less competitive than taxing nonrenewable energy companies more than renewable energy ones. ,randpaul,cvfbfb7,2,t5_2rbpp

5827572,0,t1_cxjifhp,The rich have cheated the game? The reason people make a lot of money is because of their skills and the value that they produce to others whether you work hard or not. Big companies and the elite which is a very tiny minority are the ones that can influence government officials. That is not the fault of the rich is it? Its because government is so big that it can be bought you shrink government you shrink its influence. Bernie Sanders is pandering to his base by blaming the . He wants them to pay their fair share. All you ever hear is Fair Share but doesnt go on how he will implement it. The fact is that most people that have money is not because they cheated the system but because they worked hard. Only a tiny minority have abused the system but that should not be a generalization for everybody else who earned it.  A flat tax is not only fair but eliminates loopholes. People will complain that it is regressive and that the government will lose revenue the truth is the government is just spending too much. ,randpaul,cxjiqkq,1,t5_2rbpp

But it still doesnt come anywhere near the amount that corporations get away with.

6473801,0,t3_447oc0,There is definitely something to say about the medias contribution to Rands campaign.  One example minutes before the latest debate Bill OReilly on his show on Foxnews says Oh Rand Paul he hasnt got a chance as his only comment on the man.  They cut him from a debate he probably qualified for hard to say with their arbitrary rules for it etc.A lot of people also think that Bernie and Trump really stole a lot of his potential voters.  It was just kind of a perfect storm in that regard.  Some people just like antiestablishment candidates and Bernies free stuff won over a lot of selfdelusional millenials and Trump won over the more conservative of the bunch who are primarily antiimmigration.As far as his funding for Israel even though he supports Israel I believe he has stated that it would be better for relationships between us and for Israel and the rest of the world if we no longer provided funding. Israel should selfdeterminate without us asking for things in exchange for our financial support.  A lot of Americans do want to see Israel successful and see money as a way to help with that so its a hard sell.I think the biggest problem that anyone has in the western world with Israel is the PalestinianGaza issue.  I understand that this is a twosided issue but to many it appears that Israel holds all the cards and the Palestinians react as they do because they were pushed out of their homes and disenfranchised.  I understand why Israel reacts the way that it does especially the Jewish population. There is an extreme sense of Never Again understandable that I think causes Israel to over secure itself and respond very harshly to any potential Palestinian threat.I know its a delicate situation but I think it is the most important situation for Israel to resolve by far.Just a Christian Americans random sleepy ramblings on Israel.,randpaul,czoxqmn,1,t5_2rbpp

7037075,0,t1_d1ds8tr,That article does not say that. It is discussing babies not fetuses and is using a definition of consciousness much more strict than mine which would argue that babies do not develop consciousness for some months after birth. To your other points I dont see brain activity of any sort as being enough after all even a single brain cell would have activity of some sort going on but it must be brain activity of a nature that demonstrates selfperception. This characteristic does not exist in sleep and while fetuses do experience REM how can they dream if they have not experienced anything to dream about?Based on the inspiration from this discussion I did some research and what I found seems to support my view. You can read a detailed journal article on the subject here Here is one very relevant sectiongt The fetus is mainly asleep although it shows vigorous continual activity including breathing eye openings and facial expression . Yet most of these preprogrammed movements are from subcortical origin. Attempts to wake up the fetal sheep by noxious stimuli such as pinching cause inhibition instead of arousal . Furthermore the fetus is sedated by the low oxygen tension of the fetal blood and the neurosteroid anesthetics pregnanolone and the sleepinducing prostaglandin D provided by the placenta . The most parsimonious yet challenging interpretation of these data are that in utero the fetus is mostly in a state of unconsciousness.gtUpon delivery the newborn baby arouses and stays awake for approximately  h. The eyes are wide open with usually large pupils and it may cry. After a couple of hours it usually falls asleep again being awake the following days for only short periods of time . The delivery from the mothers womb thus causes arousal from a resting sleeping state in utero. After birth electrophysiological signs on EEG scalp recordings indicate an intense flow of novel sensory stimuli after birth . In addition arousal is enhanced by the release from endogenous analgesia possibly caused by removal of the mentioned placental suppressors which in utero selectively inhibit neural activity of the fetus . The catecholamine surge triggered by vaginal delivery may also be critical for the arousal at birth . In the rat fetus a  to fold increase of noradrenaline turnover has been demonstrated in the newborn rat brain probably mainly reflecting the activation of the locus coeruleus at birth .,randpaul,d1e0bw3,0,t5_2rbpp

7413331,0,t1_d2ktzgj,Im not overly knowledgeable on economics but yeah he seems to be one of the very few candidates who actually seem honest. To say the truth even Rand with his necessary? nutright pandering seemed less honest compared to him.gtPretty much anything about Bernie and antiHillary is a winwin on rpolitics these days. Yeah but the game started changing a bit after yesterday. Its Go Trump! there now at least in the comment section. Saw the sticky? Now the mods have woken up.. Anyways lets hope Rand does good at the Senate. As an Indian his stance against selling Fs to Pakistan was heartening to see . But alas the sale went through. ,randpaul,d2kui9y,2,t5_2rbpp
7414557,1,t1_d2kz0q1,Youve been trolling on this sub for weeks.. who are you? I am not some Trump lover or anything but there is no question he is the best chance at a noninterventionist foreign policy and a few more big time issues that I take very seriously. Rand Paul could do some serious damage in the Senate under a Trump presidency... A Hillary one? Forget about it.,randpaul,d2kzjc8,-5,t5_2rbpp

Libertarianism is based off the NonAggression Principle and coming from the perspective that Life begins at conception abortion is a violation of said principle. Being ProLife and a Libertarian is completely a consistent reasonable position to take. ,randpaul,d3veic3,1,t5_2rbpp
