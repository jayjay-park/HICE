I want something was the underlying message that every one had. Damon just had to decide if what they wanted was equal to that vassals worth to the crown. A tireless game. Nathaniel had no paitence for it.The door in the back of the hall open silently as a courtier slips silently into the room. Most of those in attendance dont notice the intrusion but Nathaniels years as head of Jamess household guard had taught him to constantly scan the room a habit that he had been unable to drop so far. The courtier slipped around the side of the room until he reached the foot of the throne where the small council members stood. He hastily slipped a note into the hand of Loren Lannister and with a nervous look on his face retreated quickly. The Hand scanned the note and with a disgusted look handed the note to Nathaniel. Lord Hand Loren LannisterPrincess Sarella Martells envoy to the small counil has arrived. Moreo Nymeros Martell the Princesss uncle is at the docks riding towards the Red Keep now.Nathaniel looked up from the note with a frown on his face. So the snake shows its face. The name was unknown to Nathaniel but it mattered not. Someone should go greet him. He is an official envoy. After the next lord had been dealt with Nathaniel spoke up. Your Grace.

She was tired of feeling neglected and put out because of the woman in red that stood before her glowering down at her.

However she was not so sure that she felt ready to be left alone with Alicent and it was only as she pushed open the door to her sisters bedroom that she realized this.

Alyssa had also decided to change into another of her dresses after dinner wanting to impress her sister. This one was lighter and less delicate colored only silver. It seemed appropriate at the time but wearing it now she felt rather foolish. Why would Alicent care what I wear? She thought.

A fleeting moment of guilt washed through him he had just cheated this woman out of a wine and sex but all she would know is that she had an amazing night. What was it that gave him the desire to shut this woman down. She had done nothing to him but look at Daario in a way lots of women did. But it was different here different in the reach. These women could take him away from Azor they could break his loyalty and steal him from Azor. Then where would he be? Left in the reach friendless on an adventure made for two on his own.What was it that he craved so on this adventure? Was it knowledge? Or the time with Daario. Azor lost himself in the thoughts as he lay in the wooden bed that creaked every time he moved. He had undressed only out of his armour. Fearing that if he removed his clothing completely he would be subject to some sort of bug or disease. This room gave off no natural light there was no sense of time in here. Time was endless. Time had stopped. Daario could have been downstairs for days by now. Or he could have only just been left alone.This barefoot wine it seemed gave Azor some sort of introspective look at himself that he neither wanted nor enjoyed. Azor stood up groggily and left the room. He walked down the hallway passing other rooms hearing various sounds moans. Arguments even. The further he went the hotter it got. A window at the end of the hallway was his only saving grace. If he could get to it and open it the rush of wind would be enough to cool him down. This was crazy how could the reach be hotter than Dorne? But that wasnt the only crazy thing about this tavern. The longer he walked down this hallway the further and further away the window seemed to get it sat upon the wall taunting him with the prospect of relief but gave him none of it. Azor picked up the pace his feet moving faster than his legs the stumbling of a drunken man was no strange sound to the halls of an inn no one paid attention when he fell into their doors. Doors. There were so many of them here. This tavern must be the size of Oldtown itself. Then the thought hit him like a stone wall erected to stop an army. Was he still in the tavern? There was air here now he felt it. The window he was looking at had changed slightly. It now seemed brighter on the outside of it. But that was impossible for it was night. How could the outside be brighter than the inside unless... unless he was outside looking in. Suddenly all in one motion the window came crashing towards Azor the hallway shrank in size and there he stood. Opposite himself. Only he stood behind the window. Azor reached out to the version of himself that stood outside the figure reached out as well. Both of them yearning for what the other had. Outside Azor looked down and it was at this moment when Azor realized that he was no longer standing on any floor here he stood standing in the air. The floor had gone from beneath him and yet still he stood. Azor? A familiar voice from behind him said. What are you doing out here?Azor turned and met his friends gaze with his own.Wings. Azor said.What?You have wings Daario. Azor said with a smile before collapsing in his friends arms.,GameofThronesRP,crzflcf,3,t5_2zkud

He would let the King view for a certain amount of time to discuss whith what he assumed were him council and then declare which one he wished to purches.With the nod of the Kings head Luthor turned his own to look at the beasts. Ah yes they are. If you wish to see how they ride your Grace I have hired a few riders for such a request.,GameofThronesRP,d4jwgyx,6,t5_2zkud

She looked around wondering what to talk about.She let out a small cough and looked around nervously hoping Walys was around somewhere to jump in and save her. Sadly she saw the brother she did not need in this situation. Artys walk up to the two and bowed for Lord Sloane. I have seen you have met my sister.He said with a smile. The young man looked much like Elys but with a more masculine jaw line and much darker hair. Artys had the same plans as her father for her but he was much smarter and more charming than her father. Elys looked defeated and Artys ignored her. Their people needed food and Elys wishes were out weighed by that. ,GameofThronesRP,d5z0l2m,1,t5_2zkud
8597132,0,t1_d6g7a96,Lucos face became solemn. You idiot he thought to himself. He tried to think of words to say but his mind was steadily becoming hazy. Finally he squeezed her hand with a slight firmness and managed a small smile Im sorry for that my Lady. It may sound odd but perhaps this is best then? Im sure your father will smile from the heavens to see his daughter dance once more. The dance of this song was an interesting one. There was lots of nimble footwork to it much like when one engages in the dance of steel. The music and movements were secondary to him though his full attention was locked onto his partner. The way she moved how he curls cut through the air. Her body. Lucos was ashamed to think it though he couldnt help with either. When he took her to spin her in the air he took her from the small of her back and lower abdomen as the dance requires. The feeling of her slender frame made him forget his surroundings. ,GameofThronesRP,d6g8eqa,3,t5_2zkud

Beron you and I will be training in here. It may start rumors but no one can know I am training with concealed weapons. She swallowed and wished with her entire being her brother was here to help control this situation.  We will begin in the morning. Tonight with will all eat in our own rooms and I will get a dress together where I can hide weapons. She smiled a sad small smile at both of them. ,GameofThronesRP,d7bp94o,1,t5_2zkud

He replied his jaw working in slow circles. They left the docks behind swiftly sails billowing with a pleasant gust of wind off Blackwater Bay.The sun was high in the sky and the King had rolled up his sleeves. Seagulls floated above them crying loudly as they searched for food. Already the boat rocked unsteadily with the tide. The scene was as alien to Nathaniel as a Pentoshi whorehouse.,GameofThronesRP,dd65t0i,4,t5_2zkud

The air around her was thick with the stirrings brought about by her mounts wings so much so that shed wrapped her cloak around her head covering her nose and mouth. Stay close she whispered to Persion running a gloved hand along his long neck. The gates creaked open before her. How long has it been?The last time shed been within those walls shed been a child. An exile with the dust of an ancient city on her heels returning home to Westeros on the promises of a rebellious Princess just come into her own. They hadnt been mothers yet both were unwed. Yet the pact that formed the night before Sarellas wedding had altered the course of the entire continent. She lowered the cloak from her head and tied it once again to hang behind her. The three headed dragon snarled like the one at her side. The open gates revealed a crowd kneeling before her though Danaes eyes scanned the crowd for only one head in particular. ,GameofThronesRP,ddoc8th,3,t5_2zkud

Lyarra was rapidly growing too large to be held but she was liable to crawl off if left unsupervised. Ba ba ba ba ba she rambled nonsensically grabbing at her mothers hair. The clothes they would be needing had been neatly packed into a trunk and placed within the carriage. Talisa was grateful their trek wouldnt be on horseback.
