8334282,0,t1_d5g93wl,Heres some Useful Notes on Ayn Rand. The tldr is Reality is independent of observers. Prefer empirical knowledge. Go and find out trumps reason from first principles. Atheism. Goodness is what serves life. The role of government which should be small is to defend obligations of which there are few. Total sovereignty of property whats yours is yours absolutely from wealth to land to ideas. Altruism selfsacrifice or acting for any sake other than your own is destructive and evil.Note that only the first point and the special cases of the second point that can be derived from the first are what Id call objectivism. I always have to stipulate that I dont mean Rand when I talk about objectivism because hers is the popular definition of the word.Which is nonsense.The game Bioshock is largely about Rands philosophy and its results.,TheVeryMask,d5jc9cg,1,t5_2z5p5
