4676120,0,t3_3evtb7,Not Street BBoys. Nibbles and Israeli have been crap all through. BBoys are always crap at choreography but what is worse is choreographers keep placing them in front doing windmills cause they dont know what to do with them. ,sytycd,ctjz3i8,6,t5_2u17c
4741526,0,t1_cts3ymk,Huh. So he doesgtDB Do you have formal dance training?gtJD Absolutely from the root of dancing. Ive done ballet Ive studied tap for years Ive done jazz dance hiphop. I was a professional hiphop dancer for a couple years as well. Dancing is my thing.Maybe its just that Ive been overlooking some of his comments but I dont remember any of his comments for the stage performances being that constructivetechnical hence why it seemed to me he was mostly street focused due to his music career.,sytycd,cts7pfw,1,t5_2u17c

5057083,0,t3_3jpopr,I am definitely sensitive to this shows awkwardness around LGBTQ issues and sexuality more generally. However I can generally predict during a routine when the judges are going to pick on someone for having a bad connection or chemistry so theres certainly something there to be picked up on. I actually think it has more to do with maturity. These dancers are often teenagers or barely into their twenties. I suspect the chemistryconnection critique for the guys is the equivalent of the make the sexuality more grounded and tongueincheek critique for the girls. They are developing as performers but most yearolds no matter how technically skilled are just simply not going to have the maturity and depth of experience to quickly access and project an adult connection with a partner who theyve only worked with for a few hours.With all that said I do expect a great dancer to pull that abstract quality together regardless of age and orientation. The bench dance wouldnt be a classic if we were all thinking about Travis as a gay man rather than as his character in that routine. ,sytycd,cuvkiev,3,t5_2u17c
5061877,0,t3_3k8idj,I agree my wife and I have said the same thing. The choreography just isnt there this year. Theyre not pushing the dancers to their full potential like they have in previous years. Im not saying that dancers like Jaja havent come a long way you can definitely see it. But the choreographers need to step it up.As far as NappyTabs I thought I saw another redditer post in another thread that theyre working on Americas Best Dance Crew.,sytycd,cuw5blg,3,t5_2u17c
5061988,0,t3_3k8idj,Sorry but I have to say this. I think it is because they are reworking the show to focus more on the street dancers. This seems to be an overall strategy to try to raise the ratings that have kept going downhill over the past few seasons by trying to bring in the kind of fans that watch Americas best dance crew.Ive noticed that they generally praise the street dancers and trash the stage dancers. This seems to affect the choreography as well as it is dumbed down to help the street dancers who generally have less training.,sytycd,cuw5sy1,5,t5_2u17c

5111589,0,t1_cv1z4x4,I almost laughed out loud in one of the Team Street group dances when Asaf and Burim dance themselves off the stage and then dont come back until the last  or  counts. Theres a choreographer who ran out of patience....Edit it was the NappyTabs one around ,sytycd,cv24z54,20,t5_2u17c
