4060432,0,t3_3719mg,I just got into the Doctorate of Physical Therapy program there. Im from Chicago born and raised but decided to go on a campus tour. Dude. Any unsureness or apprehension I had about the school was dissolved inmediately. Its amazing the people were all super nice and had great senses of humor. A lot of people werent from Florida either so its not like you and I would be the only ones. The campus is amazing and the whole area is great. I wish I had taken my undergrad there. Do yourself a favor and at least take a tour itll give you a reason to take a little vacation and you can visit the school while keeping in mind can I see myself living here?. ,fgcu,crj4az8,5,t5_2r1v1
