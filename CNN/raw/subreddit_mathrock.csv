The Fall of Troy actually has a few songs that you can play in standard tuning. There are some truly awesome videos of Thomas Erak playing isolated guitar lines from a lot of their songs my favorite is Mouths Like Sidewinder Missiles Ive been trying to learn that song for a year or two and its pretty tough. Maybe try to program some drums on Reason or Guitar Pro or something that switches between time signatures to get the gears turning. Ive tried to write some stuff in that genre and its pretty dang tough especially without a drummer. But Im sure some practice will get you closer. ,mathrock,cmcpgyz,2,t5_2rqnu

For being brand new at the time its probably the most solid Fender I ever laid my hands on as well. I mostly played second hand guitars before that so I just know what you mean with the mojo being different  it doesnt feel like a guitar of my own if it was preowned in a way but you kind of lay an irreplaceable mark on your own guitars.Looks like youve got a thing for the Pawn Shop series too. Its a little too hit and miss for my tastes but the  is straight out kickass. Even without a tone knob the clean tone cuts over everything and can be used in so much more than math rock.Which pickup werent you keen on by the way?

7385096,0,t3_4ggy59,Real intense polyrhythmspolymeter where every voice in the music is playing in a different signature is kinda rare. Sure the real noisy or jazz influenced bands tend to push this farther than most. What I mainly hear is when a melody is in some odd meter and the drums will play in .  against  is very common  against  and  against  are common as well. Its an easy way for a complex melody to sound a bit more straightforward. ,mathrock,d2hmvhx,3,t5_2rqnu

Lots of math rock bands I like dont even have weird time signatures half the time like Orchards Good Old War Maps amp Atlases etc. It just needs that tappy sparkly guitar with a staccato startstop rhythm and at least an experimental beat.But this is cool nonetheless so thanks for sharing!,mathrock,dcpl6e2,4,t5_2rqnu
