24022,0,t3_1ue4z6,This is the reason why I am adamant that people join the military after . I joined at  and had a very well established career in IT. I joined d cav scout in combat arms. I did my tour and served. When I processed out I didnt acab or training. I got right back into my IT field and have been successful ever since. Being a veteran helped with preference but my skills from my career is what got my jobs. These kids go into the military with the promise of a good job after and are lied to by recruiters saying those job skills mean anything in the real world. They dont. Its a shame and I have to agree with the article on some levels. I wouldnt hire a vet whose sole job has been in a single line of work being told what to do and wash rinse repeat everyday. It doesnt match innovation and it isnt really good for businesses. It sounds pretentious but Ive seen and lived both worlds. ,Veterans,ceh6207,10,t5_2rc75

I called  times and each time the person said I was fine but after some protest they said there might be an issue and theyll get back to me. So I opened an inquiry and I then get a letter that said my inquiry is closed because of a system outage or something so I go on ebenefits and it shows a new compensation claim that Ive never opened.

3587366,0,t1_cq1285t,I know absolutely nothing about all of this so take it with a grain of salt. These are all assumptions on my part. st assumption is that the cost of healthcare using an private insurance program would be astronomically high. We all know that the cost of healthcare in the US is ridiculously high. The cost of healthcare for a veteran from the time that they sign up for benefits to the time of death would be astronomical. Hell I was diagnosed with a heart condition after getting out and had to use private insurance to cover the cost.  days in the ICU  more days in a heart hospital plus the ablations and numerous tests they ran would have cost over . That is for only  days for  veteran. I do not remember how much the insurance settled for but I am sure it was a pretty penny. nd assumption is that the initial cost of building and setting up hospitals has already been paid. At this point it is just maintaining and repairing buildings and equipment. If new equipment is needed for purchase it would be cheaper to to buy individual equipment that they can then use for hundreds of not thousands of veterans instead of paying at hospital rates for others to perform those same testsscansetc. rd assumption is that the VA is paying all of their employees at a government GS rate that they can then use at an hourlysalary rate where they can serve multiple veterans per hour. Again it is assumed that this would be cheaper than that same rate for  veteran percentage of a veteran  veteran at a multiplied cost than the GS rate.th assumption the VA has different ratings. At  a veteran is completely taken care of whereas a veteran with lesser ratings are only covered for service connected disabilities. If the VA sent everyone private the tracking of service connected versus nonSC and payments to private hospitals would be very difficult to track. They could just do a blanket coverage for all veterans but then again the cost from the st assumption would be astronomically higher than it was when we first covered it because now instead of only  vets we are now covering all vets. If the VA operates the way they currently operate they are only required to cover service connected disabilities. Being  I am not sure how the whole means test or nonSC disabilities being treated works.TLDR The government is and always will be a servicepartetc at the lowest rate. By having hospitals even substandard that are able to do the least amount possible to take care of veterans at the lowest possible rate they do not have to pay others to perform the same and more services at a much higher rate. Plus private hospitals have the customer patient and their opinions to worry about whereas the VA is only REQUIRED to keep the veteran more or less healthy though the employees in some cases do actually try like here in New Mexico. I am not saying that all VA hospitals suck. There are quite a few that are very good.Edit didnt mean to seem like an ass. Just thought I would put in my thoughts. ,Veterans,cq16rls,2,t5_2rc75

3824861,0,t1_cqs6ft3,gt If someone runs the police are supposed to chase them not open fire.gtThe problem is when the police use overwheleming force to deal with usI know theres been a lot of incidents in the news lately but lets talk for a second specifically about this incident.  Im interested in what they come up with here in Baltimore.They chased him and tackled him and had to wrestle with him as he was giving resistance and they used a pretzel hold their term not mine.  From some of what was on scene theyve got him pinned and one guys got a knee in his back again to get him restrained as he put up some resistance.Its entirely possible that that was the major cause of the back trauma.  Rough ride or not maybe just the further jostling in a shitty van ie nonrough ride along with the trauma from the tackle did it.I mentioned in a baltimore thread I live in MD so Ive been awarefollowing this since his arrest that there is some question about whether or not chasing when someone runs on spotting the police with no other provocation should be considered legal by the SC letter it is  spirit...maybe not so much.So three officers chasing a suspect who doesnt want to go quietly in this instance did they use appropriate force?  No taser no gun no baton no punches.  Entirely possible that from the tackle and the scuffle because he was giving what Id say was minor resistance.Even if it was the rough ride in combination that did it...Id have to point out that theres no overwhelming force in this case nor even a loose connection to the militarization of the police.  Either he was so roughed up on the ground he was fucked or they did some illegal shit on that drive.  Either way I dont think that the militarization of police can be blamed for this one For some of the other recent ones though for sure.,Veterans,cqs9m8l,3,t5_2rc75

Although Im confused if Sinise actually said there is a growing divide or the news article just decided to use that as a headline. For example he cites a poll where a growing number of Veterans believe the public doesnt understand our problems. This at least to me is a VERY poorly worded question. No one is asking for them to understand because unless they go through the experience themselves they really wont. As far as public awareness of our issues Im not really concerned about that.

4517308,0,t1_ct012eg,Yes if you owe FAFSA money back you have to pay this. No one else is going to there is no way around this.Under the old Law Schools could certify and report TF charges months prior to the start of a semester and if a student got a Scholarship or tuition waiver it was ignored by VA and that money was refunded to the school  but Congress realized that they were paying Post  GI Bill funds and Dept of Education FAFSA funds for the same classs under certain conditions and that other agencies were also paying for the same class that Post  GI Bill funds were paying for.. Under the current new Law which is not that new  Law was changed in  VA must be the last payer of TF charges so School now have to deduct out ScholarshipsTuition WaiversGrants that can only be used to pay Tuition and or Fees Pell Grants and Student Loans are exempt from this. So what many of the schools elected to do was to start doing is a double certification. So we certify students but report zero tuitionfee charges  then after the dropadd full refund date and acknowledgement that Financial Aid office has received the majority of the ScholarshipsTuition WaiversGrants and posted them to the students accounts We submit a second certification to report the TF. Some schools have chosen to wait to do the st certification until after the dropadd full refund period  the Law doesnt require the Schools to do this either way. My School and many others want our students get their Book Stipend paid to the students two weeks prior to st day of school and for VA to have their monthly Housing Allowance set up so we do the double Certification. This makes for a more successful student. How far in advance of the st day of class did you enroll?  Did you immediately do paperwork with that Schools VA office?  Had you applied prior to school starting for your Certificate of Eligibility? Did you receive your Book Stipend prior to st day of classs?Also I wasnt trying to rat out your School but this New procedurelaw was changed in . So Im thinking your School has just recently changed how they are doing business. With the large population of students using VA Education benefits at my IHL we check daily for changes to VA processing requirements and follow every Bill submitted to Congress to change anything dealing with VA Education Programs.

Some of the questions were very poignant and sensitive but I think I handled them pretty well. Some of the others were funny and strange. One kid just had question after question.Do you get rid of bombs by shooting them with grenades?No not really Zack.Oooh oooh oooh were your trucks called Warthogs?No bud we usually road around in  tons or Humvees.After awhile one of the other kids finally explained to me that Zack was an avid Halo fan and all these questions came from the game. Anyhow all the kids had to line up to go to lunch but Zack had to get in one more question.Do you have a jet pack?No but I want one.Anyhow not that great of a story but I just wanted to tell any of you reading this to help this guy out if you can. I was very intimidated by the whole prospect and it ended up being a very rewarding experience. I did get asked one of the dreaded questions Were any of your friends killed? Luckily I had talked to of all people my Mom about this beforehand and I replied with her wisdom in mind. War is very dangerous and very sad.

If I hadnt been an E and at  years I would have had to find a crappy paying job...but after applying and searching I have realised it is more who you know than what you know. At least where I live. All I can say is keep on improving yourself. I have been told by one of my counselors that there is a bias against hiring veterans locally. People feel that vets come here and feel they are owed something. People think because vets have a pension they do not deserve a good paying job. This is a mind set of folks that has taken years to develop. I am just hoping when I finish my degree which is graphic design that I will be able to find a job another reason I chose the degree is because jobs can be found online freelance working from home. Making advertisements websites that sort of thing.Ultimately it is a choice to adapt and find your path. The TAPS program is a tool to help prepare vets for the outside world. But it has its limits I did find the resources they gave me did help me find the degree choice I made.  My job in the AF was transportation and I did search for jobs in that field.

Do some research on ptsd cures. The science out right now is amazing. They are doing great research in fear and even being able to go back remember the event and introduce new elements to it slowly changing the memory itself. Well not the specifics but what feelings are associated with it. There are now albit slowly using marijuana to treat ptsd. If you are new to marijuana considering how tight you are wound i would suggest indica dark green CBD based not sativa light green THC based. The difference is indica will chill you out and give you couch lock allow you to relax while the sativa is more of a mental stimulant. If you do try it do your research! the sci is still kinda new on it but from personal experience it can be a little addictive. like giving up caffeine or sugar. They have even started using LSDKetamineMDMA in some studies with some positive results but the sci on this is way to new. I would suggest following it but not trying it until you had solid data and even professional guidance. The last thing i would suggest is meditation. It sounded stupid and I feel a little silly every time I start but just taking fifteen minutes a day to get yourself in check can help a lot. ,Veterans,d2wj4x7,1,t5_2rc75

What you can do is get the Patient Advocate on your team. The rules for paying your bill would fall under regulation   but nonthing means they will process it in a timely matter which doesnt do you good if it goes to collections. The Patient Advocate would be the one to squeeze the NonVA Care office to process it quicker.  doesnt matter where your residing or where your registered.  I believe the bill would be the responsibility of the VA Hospital that would have covered you if you went there insteadOrlando. I work at the VAMidwest paying for Ambulances amp ER visits for veterans so Im pretty well versed. I dont want your PII but if you dont mind I can PM you some more specific info. TLDR Pay the ER Bill if you can dont let it hurt your credit. Call the Orlando VA Patient Advocate  Keep hounding the NONVA Care office aka FeeBasis to process your bill.

I am one of those who was diagnosed when most people nonvets feel my service doesnt warrant it.  Life fell apart and accusations of exaggerating my symptoms were very hard to deal with.  He may have PTSD but feels like he shouldnt based on his experiences.  That may lead to him manufacturing reasons to explain his symptoms to ease any cognitive dissonance.Maybe ask his wife if hes talked to the VA about it and find out whether hes received a diagnosis.  If he has then he could go right back to being his normal self after recovery.  If not then she should work on convincing him to go.  However dont forget that hes not your responsibility.  Offering support and giving his wife information is one thing she needs to take the lead on getting him help as his wife.On the other hand if hes either making it up or exaggerating the severity then its time for you to start making a decision about his value to your life.

How about the time where we shot a civi guard in a village because he ran up on us in the dead of night with one of the  AKs they were allowed to have. How about that time when mortars came from the sky and killed  civilians because they were off a few degrees and it should have been you? How is this stuff not caused by the enemy? They were  of it. How are these mental wounds not inflicted by the enemy?

8900151,0,t3_525v75,You do not have to take medication if you dont want to. You as a patient as a person have rights. Just state you dont want to try pillsmeds and you want to stick to therapy. Ive been in therapy with the VA for  years now. State you dont want to try meds and if they push it on you be firm. Ive only had one person try to push meds on me after I said no but they were just doing my intake survey or whatever it is so I got paired with a psychologist who actually respected my decision after that. Worse comes to worst you get them prescribed and just dont take them. Therapy is going to feel like its not helping for a while. But it does. Its been a long road but now I cant remember the last time I thought of suicide. Before it was a weekly sometimes daily thing. The fact that you want help is a huge step. Dont get scared and run off now. More frequent sessions are better... When I first started I was doing therapy every single week. I did that for the first  months.  Now I only see the therapist once every  months. It really does get better. Good luck.EDIT What they will ask you. Basically the first part will be a really unemotional survey where they ask how long youve been depressed last time you thought of suicide do you have a plan access to a gun etc. Make sure that you answer in a way where you are not a current danger to yourself or others. Also it would be safe to say that even though you have suicidal thoughts you do not want to act on them. Now I dont want to advise totally lying about things. But if the person feels you are currently a danger to yourself i.e. you have a plan and means to kill yourself and youre also currently suicidal at the time you take the survey then you will probably be put on suicide watch. I will save you the details and just state that unless you fully believe you are incapable of controlling yourself when you are suicidal then you do not want to end up on suicide watch.Outside this survey the last half is just a therapy session where they ask you to talk and you just talk about stuff. You talk about whatever you want. Every meeting after the first one is just a therapy session.,Veterans,d7ho5h1,9,t5_2rc75

There are no other way to extend your benefits past the  year date VA has given you which is per federal law.As others have all ready stated  if you have a VA disability rating you should apply for Voc Rehab the requirement is you must apply within  years of the VA rating or  years from an increase in the rating.MGIB has the same law except a  year limit  veterans must use up their  months within  years of last date on active duty.Others are guessing and giving different answers than what I am telling you  but I do this for a living as a School Certifying Official. I also have remaining unused months of Post  GI Bill and I only have until  to use that  months or it will be gone  forever. I have had many Veterans in your same exact situation and know the federal law on this  the exception I listed above is it.

But if you get dropped due to attendance or lack thereof you will be responsible for paying back the money. I understand kind of what youre going through and it sucks. The only advice I really have is to at least attend class. I had to pay back  classes because of being dropped due to attendance all in the same semester. Fortunately if you do end up getting dropped or not completing classes you can petition the VA to waive your repayment. Its a fairly simple process. Just fill out the form from the VA website sorry I dont remember the name of the form and submit it to them with a written statement on why you would like the repayments waived. They didnt waive mine but did work with me on a payment plan I could afford they took a portion from my disability every month until it was paid off. Best of luck brother.

I didnt even know. I was still am a mess and I never even knew why. Its really too late for me but there are so many others.
