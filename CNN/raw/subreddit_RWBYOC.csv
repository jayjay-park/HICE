461629,0,t3_1zdi04,Ok... Make it double bladed the blades parallel to one another. The handle is short and thick able to split to let one of the blades fall down and doublehandle length now with a blade on each end. As this is clearly a shortrange weapon make there be a shotgun in each handlehalf meaning when the blades are together youd have a doublebarrel and a very fast paced weapon that would be used very similarly to a bladed Sunstaff when apart. Each blade can straighten out to a glaivedoubleglaive form and be able to split to dual wieldsimilar to a pair of shotgunkhopesh. Now for more diversity cause I love improbable weapons have vambraces that the the handles can attach to so now have shotgunclaws which would be nasty if you manage to impale someone able to unload blast after blast directly into them.,RWBYOC,cfsqkat,4,t5_2yu61
1925568,0,t3_2gomht,The problem with the halberdgun is that there is no actual luck involved. The wielders skill is the essential part here and a skilled fighter will usually win out against a lucky one. If you really want the Semblance to be a key part of the character maybe change the weapon to a deck of cards dice or incorporating a kind of Russian Roulette into the gun and making this a key aspect of the fighting style. But hey as long as her fortune isnt Sakuralevel it should be fine in terms of MarySue,RWBYOC,ckl7tpo,1,t5_2yu61
2074664,0,t1_cl3exit,Yeah! Sanguine . Optimistic and positive especially in dificult situations . Bloodthirsty.Ah I hadnt thought about Deadman Wonderland despite having read the majority of it.

2254032,0,t1_clqbbni,Ren sat on his throne in the middle of the cavern when Jaune came to him. Sir! We have located the Harem. They are located inside the ruins of Beacon.Why are they there. They are the ones who killed Ozpin and Oobleck. Port and Goodwitch. They blew the place up looking for recruits for their Queen. Vale was destroyed in that battle have they no shame. Get Adam. The White Fang needs to get ready.,RWBYOC,clqbjrv,2,t5_2yu61
2307177,0,t1_clwvmjq,Well have to do this fast now. Get in take the weapon get out.Mercury shrugged casually further angering his partner. Fast huh? Just how I like it.The two ran down corridors dispatching the rather useless guards and the slightly less useless guard robots by the droves. They came to a stop before room .Emerald pulled out her hairpin but put it away when Mercury took a few steps back to build momentum. He was just about to kick the door but it suddenly opened from inside.,RWBYOC,clwvtnx,1,t5_2yu61

2623301,0,t3_2pxo07,For OC creation it starts with an idea that runs through my head. My first one started with the idea of infusing dust into people. That progressed over time and joined the idea of a character based off of myself. For story inspirationmotivation music helps while writing. For getting into a general mood reading other fan fics is really good. Additionally I rarely sit myself down and force myself to write because that results in something undeveloped. Instead I come up with an idea for what I want and think it over until its something more than just a skeleton.,RWBYOC,cn103x9,3,t5_2yu61
2851675,0,t1_cns7mzg,Blade  is supposed to be part of a wingpack type of weapon that folds in half.The axe I have no memory of what I was trying to aim for. The guns were all types of revolvers had a multidrum functionality so they could swap ammo types on the go without removing any parts.The blue knight sword was going to be a sword within a sword still no progress on how that was going to work along with a railgun type of firing mechanism.The red keyblade type is actually two halves combined to be a hoverboard. The thing above it was a robot arm that turned into a Dust gun.,RWBYOC,cns8hnw,1,t5_2yu61

2947793,0,t3_2txe0j,This is Coal My first RWBY OC I did a shit animation a while back with the old version of this rig i spent the last  days redoing the entire thing i tore it down to the base model removed unnecessary geometry built tore down and rebuilt the skeleton  times re made the hand controls and fixed an issue i had with the feet.    Not only that but i made some changes to his weapons Tion and Palindel they used to have big block blades that looked like trash so i removed them and added in holo blades.Next step... Building the mech which should be considerably easier then I have to build the set and then i can finaly start animating the Trailer Vupdate   Mech is done Working on the set now,RWBYOC,co36fbb,1,t5_2yu61

4029980,0,t3_36o8vr,HOLY FUCK YOURE BACK!! Alright the thread isnt up on rRWBY so Im commenting here. Definitely glad to see this back! But Im not going to lie it did feel a bit rough. And I can understand that after a couple months off youre going to be rusty. Its a good restart back into things and an even better bridge for the next chapter. Im glad to see Ren went turbo badass again. Really refreshing. What was up with those snipers though? And Roman? Oi what a cock. Ah Weiss no matter what you do you cant keep her levelheaded can you? Thats ok neither can I! Theres no way in hell she went out like that though. Nah thats not youre style.  Like I said it was rough but Im not holding that against you. It takes a while to get back in the game and you need some practice. Slow and steady wins the race. You write when you get the chance and congrats on the new job! Hopefully its better than your last.  Glad to see you back! If you need help with anything in the near future let me know! Ill be glad to lend my support when needed.,RWBYOC,crfncts,2,t5_2yu61
4555783,0,t1_ct4ufhp,Heres hoping they dont touch either one then! I guess now its a matter of which is more popular between fanfiction or archiveofourown.,RWBYOC,ct4vkxg,2,t5_2yu61
4722714,0,t3_3fjx31,Okay I havent been keeping up on your characters because Ive been busy but holy crap that semblance. Someone whose personality is literally overridden by the person she kills? Wouldnt that cause an immense sense of guilt?Dont get me wrong its awesome. Im just trying to wrap my head around how this would effect her going forward. Her morals and ideals would be in constant flux every time she used it not to mention that the first use would signal the end of her original personality. Unless there is a way to reverse the changes or perhaps a bleed effect where her original personality is merely suppressed and the new personality is slowly lost over time?I mean anyway you cut it its interesting I say well done. Dunno how you would manage to write such a character but nonetheless.. Very interesting.,RWBYOC,ctpu5py,3,t5_2yu61

6092210,0,t3_3yw6do,Ill admit Ive been toying around with the idea of a Faunus with insectiod features. Ive also had the idea of one with a scorpions tail on his back but Im not so sure if itd fit with the general Faunus population. I have a snowfox Faunus as well whose hair color changes depending on the weather.,RWBYOC,cyi4djj,2,t5_2yu61
6487445,0,t1_czqapgj,Thanks! Its part of this layered idea I have going on. When the sword isnt in use The blade will disappear and only the hilt will remain. At the start of combat the pieces of the blade will appear and join together.,RWBYOC,czqclxt,2,t5_2yu61
6678090,0,t1_d09v8re,i just think it would be super funny. like these guys were hoping and praying that they would end up with teammates who actually have useful semblances but nope they all suck lmao. on the other hand they are very skilled fighters and can use their weapons and dust well and since they dont use their semblances as much as other people their aura levels tend to be pretty good.,RWBYOC,d0a2mvh,3,t5_2yu61

8386083,0,t3_4uhu8h,thats a cool idea! just make sure you note how heavy that would be. a standard kevlar vest is about six pounds but the cloak would likely be doubled because of the overall size difference between it and a vest. this could prove cumbersome if they are a character meant to be more nimble and quick. heat would also be a component of the design though less important. itd be less of a problem in atlas and vale and than vacuo and mistral. just worth noting!as for the other questions im not really a writer and think this is a pretty sound design idea if none the aforementioned details present themselves as a problem. good luck!!  o ,RWBYOC,d5pt41j,2,t5_2yu61

11657078,0,t3_66bolw,I made a big list of color words and went through it looking for ones I could abbreviate to  letters and then looked through the same list to find names that worked well with the different team names. Some of the names took precedence though because I liked the names before coming up with the team names. For instance I really wanted a character with a name that started with a C so teams with that letter were more heavily considered,RWBYOC,dghcekz,3,t5_2yu61
