1745,0,t1_cedzeb2,I had a chance to check some of the content from ZealotFor Luke the answer lies in a census. In those days he writes there came a decree from Caesar Augustus that the entire Roman world should be registered. This was the first registration to take place while Quirinius was governor of Syria. Everyone went to his own town to be registered. Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea to Bethlehem the city of David. Then in case his readers may have missed the point Luke adds because Joseph belonged to the house and the lineage of David Luke .            Luke is right about one thing and one thing only. Ten years after the death of Herod the Great in the year  C.E. when Judea officially became a Roman province the Syrian governor Quirinius did call for a census to be taken of all the people property and slaves in Judea and Idumeanot the entire Roman world as Luke claims and definitely not Galilee where Jesuss family lived Luke is also wrong to associate Quiriniuss census in  C.E. with the birth of Jesus which most scholars place closer to  B.C.E. the year given in the gospel of Matthew. However because the sole purpose of a census was taxation Roman law assessed an individuals property in the place of residence not in the place of ones birth. There is nothing written in any Roman document of the time and the Romans were quite adept at documentation particularly when it came to taxation to indicate otherwise. Lukes suggestion that the entire Roman economy would periodically be placed on hold as every Roman subject was forced to uproot himself and his entire family in order to travel great distances to the place of his fathers          birth and then wait there patiently perhaps for months for an official to take stock of his family and his possessions which in any case he would have left behind in his place of residence is in a word preposterous.,exjw,ceemxz4,2,t5_2qp5l

57612,0,t1_cekmp39,Let me offer you a compromise. Do with it as you will.  There are two ways of looking at this.  You can either attack the structure or you can argue the details.  Jehovahs Witnesses want you to argue the latter the details because they will go round and round until youre dizzy... point by point switching from subject to subject endlessly.  When finished neither person makes any headway.  They win not because they are correct but because you didnt succeed.I prefer if you attack the structure.  First would be the validity of the bible not the NWT the BIBLE.  Do some research on the history and compilation of the bible.  Check out Babylonian myths that are scary in their similarities to stories in the scriptures.  Watch the History Channel if you need to cheat.  Heres the point  When you find out and appreciate the bible from a historical standpoint and not a religious standpoint you will understand that HOW the Witnesses use the scripture is wrong  the content of their beliefs is irreverent when the method of extraction is perverse.  Second you can apply this tactic to ONE other area   The cornerstone of their belief.  Look up Studies of the Scriptures Im sure you can find a link somewhere on here or on JWN and see how CT Russell used Egyptology and the Great Pyramids to calculate the date.  You cant miss it... theres a pictograph illustration on page one.  Everything else since then as the world failed to end in   again has been explanations to cover that up excuse it.  Again its not the content but HOW they use the content  in this case telling people an unprovable  Jesus sat on his throne  from a guy who used wrong history dates and an inch per a year measurement off the pyramids of Giza.Once you understand how the religion uses its resources is wrong and seeing how  and taking the bible literally is unwise there is nothing more to argue.  The religion is wrong  you can argue about it all day the religion isnt going to get... more wrong you know?  Doctrine is not something that should be argued anyway... it should be something demonstrated.  Those who argue do so out of pride.... so dont fall into that trap.  ,exjw,cekzmwc,2,t5_2qp5l

So he scraped the honey out into his hands and ate it as he walked along. When he rejoined his father and mother he gave them some to eat. But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey out of the carcass of a lion.He did what now?Then he makes up a riddle about the honey in the lion and when his friends solve the riddle...Jehovahs spirit empowered him and he went down to Ashkelon and struck down  of their men and took their clothing and gave the outfits to those who had answered the riddle. He was furious as he went back up to his fathers house.  Samsons wife was then given to one of his groomsmen who had accompanied him.  What?!,exjw,cfg3o5a,1,t5_2qp5l

Although the affluent and educated ones will have more access these are not the ones most influenced by religion.  In poor countries this is the trend due to the fact that there is no existing infrastructure for landlines so they are never run and instead towers are constructed quickly and cheaply.  The only option for the general public is a cell phone.  Sadly it will be eons if true advancement meets the rest of the world if ever.

I was on the fast track to fading when I decided that I really dont care about what these people think so what started out as harmless participation in celebrating false religious holidays and posting said pics and happy Birthdays on facebook turned into phone calls by the elders asking if this were true.  I neither denied or confirmed anything.  Then a few days later I received a lettercertified that I was invited to a judicial hearing.  I of course did not attend.  Then... about a week later I received another certified letter stating that the judicial committee had decided to disfellowship me for reasons mentioned above.  This was this week actually.  So it sounds like they are rolling out the red carpet to put a stop to all of us Apostates.  At first I was a little disappointed that I got dfed for just that but someone told me that I should be proud that I got dfed for just plain old apostasy because it really shows how ridiculous this org. is.  So suffice to say I wear my A for apostasy proudly.,exjw,cfwsh1p,2,t5_2qp5l

539357,0,t3_20a3il,I have been with my wife for  years now. She is the only reason I did not kill myself in my s. I have a tendency to wander a lot since I have no roots. If someone says Hey wanna go to Japan? Its only  bucks! Im in! Ill go anywhere live anywhere do anything because I have no roots to go home too no people to miss me while Im gone. Ive traveled Europe Thailand Japan and Brazil.  Ive seen every state in the United States and lived in  of them.When my wife met me I told her I was on my way to South Florida from Colorado and that I was moving in about  weeks. When she asked why I told her Colorado was boring me. We spent  weeks in Colorado as friends and I invited her to go to Miami with me under the premise that whenever she was ready to come home Id buy her a ticket. When I met her she was  years old and I had just turned .  She never went home. Since then she has followed me wherever I want to go. She is loyal she is kind and she is smart. She is the Betty to my Incredible Hulk.  She keeps me calm she makes me think and when I start to flip my shit she soothes me. Shes never scared of me and she always calls me on my shit. I respect that. I am one UGLY son of a bitch. I literally look like the WWE wrestler The Big Shows little brother. Im a great big dude.  built like a linebacker barrel chest full tattoo sleeves including the word Villain in  inch block letters down my forearm and the word Apostate over my heart. Im bald have a  inch beard and in general am a Harley riding multiple handgun carrying mountain of a redneck. Imagine a linebacker with a liberal dose of outlaw biker if that bikers father was an escaped grizzly bear from a zoo in the Midwest. Thats me. Usually people dont give me shit they say excuse me sir and avoid eye contact. My wife however literally gives  fucks. Shes not scared and I like that.All that being said I got lucky as fuck. My wife is so beautiful she makes traffic stop. When we walk in public and people see us together they will literally stop and ask me how the fuck I pulled that off. Im not even kidding Ive had people ask me How did you get her and does she have a sister? If I had to describe her for you to envision I can only tell you she looks like Linda Carter in her Wonder Woman years with a body so hard it deserves a photographer. She loves me shes loyal and she is literally so sweet and nice that she counterbalances all my demons. She is the nicest person Ive ever known. For all the evil in the world her goodness may just balance it all out.Once I got to know her I felt this overwhelming need to protect her from all that evil shit that I chose to wallow thru and it made me clean up my life a lot. There is good in my story and she is the prize.I won her heart because the JWs taught me to not be scared of standing on a stage in front of an audience and that confidence made me the man I am today fucked up and flawed as I am.She is my positive. Because of her even though I have all this loneliness and pain I am not completely alone. Without her I would have committed suicide a decade ago. After all when she met me that was the plan go back to Florida spend a week on my beach and then end it.Thanks Jessica. I love you boo.,exjw,cg1ky72,6,t5_2qp5l

569557,0,t3_20jwwq,I was a born in. Got married at  to a worldly guy and had a son by . Found out he was a total douche bag and crawled back to my parents begging for forgiveness. At that point I decided I screwed my life up because I wasnt living it to Jehovahs standards. So I went back hardcore. Seven years later I met my husband and we got married. He had a bitchcrazy ex wife but  we decided that Jehovah would only test us as far as we could bear that scripture became our mantra as well as we are building up treasures in heaven. We worked hard in the congregation and eventually he became a MS and I was a regular pioneer. I started having doubts in pioneer school but umobiussp got laid off and i became distracted. His ex wife was reinstated shortly thereafter and thats when things got really bad. She would go off on us at assemblies and conventons to the point we wouldnt attend if we thought she would be there and if we saw her there we would leave. We kept asking for assistance but the elders did jack shit we were slandered through out the circuit they would both verbally abuse us and we were always asked what did you do that escalated the situation? why cant the crazy bitch have custody of their daughter she goes to all the meeting? Wont you do this for the peace of the congregation?This caused me all sorts of guilt depression and severe anxiety. Obviously I was the one who wasnt doing the right thing we were in the wrong because we refused to follow the elders suggestions. It was hell. I couldnt get out of bed I was scared all the time I was on high dose depression meds. I would have panic attacks. In the midst of this the bitch and her husband were constantly threatening to send social services to our door they still do telling us how bad we are how we are bad parents and abusive. I knew none of it was true but when you are in you are indoctrinated to believe you are never good enough you start to believe it on some level.umobiussp was out before me and started pointing things out weird inconsistencies. He would wonder how the org was protecting this bitch? How if this was the truth they cant see what is being done. The Org loves to say how being a part of it is a protection but it sure as fuck wasnt protecting me or my family! It was actually hurting us. And I will do anything to protect my family. umobiussp and I both stepped down as neither of us wanted the positions. It took another two years or so after that to get me out I really wanted to believe I hadnt wasted a large portion of my life. It was finally the exwife that got me out. One day I realized there was no way in hell I was going to live forever with that crazy bitch and Jah would have to drastically alter my personality to get me to the point that I could forgive her for what she has done to my family. So I started researching and reading up on jwfacts and jwsurvey. Oh wow was I pissed! Its still an ongoing process sometimes I still have to be reminded why I left but I will say I am happier and my family is happier. I am so much stronger as a person now then I ever was in.TLDR married a douche bag divorced married a cool guy and his ex was the reason I found out TTAT.,exjw,cg50i75,1,t5_2qp5l

576349,0,t1_cg5ra07,Brainwashed is a good term. They all consume and regurgitate the same ideas at different levels they all keep each other in check they think of this as helping your spiritually weak brothers and sisters. Though they dont encourage this type of behavior for the most part. For the most part.The problem is in how theyre likely to handle it. If she were hypothetically a fullon child abuser she wouldnt be sat down or anything until two witnesses to the crime were able to come forward. Depending on how strict the local elders are or arent it could be two witnesses from different points in time or it might have to be two witnesses at the same time to the same act.Its a rule that inadvertently protects child abusers in their midst and makes it difficult to successfully see one out of the flock.Few cases have seen small justice in the form of the accused losing their privileges. I say small justice because where realworld laws prohibit sexual offenders from working in places involving children and will see to it that they are officially listed the JW inhouse court system doesnt. It encourages forgiveness of the sin often times pushes the they can recuperate lines of drivel and does not report the crime to outside authorities. Many times the abusers wind up gaining privileges in the long run and even become Elders themselves.The one thing you might be able to take heart in is that there is a strong idea that one should not be alone in the same room with someone of the opposite gender you know to avoid having sex at every opportunity cos teens are raging sexaholics and adults cant control themselves. So if shes drunk that much koolaid so far maybe shes also taking that seriously. And if that kid has any kind of brain he probably wont go for her.,exjw,cg5sa6i,3,t5_2qp5l

Watch the elders scramble to bridge the gap out of their own pockets while the sheep get scolded for not digging deeply enough or for failing to keep their vows.Dont any of then think it strange that a divinely directed work must be financed by entirely human means? Couldnt God just direct the faithful slave to a rich vein of gold or a deposit of diamonds? Jesus told the apostles exactly where to cast their nets and they caught so many fish the boat was in danger of tipping.Everything about how the society runs looks exactly like you would expect if it was entirely a manmade organization run without any divine direction whatsoever.,exjw,cgrer4h,12,t5_2qp5l

915221,0,t1_ch86m1n,I wasnt referring to the bible but only referring to teachings of jesus which I rate with that of Buddha and others. I dont believe in the infallibility of the bible as we do not have an original error less version to read and make a judgment on. The writers and those that made copies were people of their time molding god to suit their circumstances. A tsunami can become a flood and earthquakes that cause a city to fall or meteorites smashing  ancient cities suddenly become the work of god. There is enough evidence for me that both men existed and where the writings agree on the words of both jesus or buddha there seems to be a lot of wisdom to take away rather than dismissing it with a blanket argument.You need to do a bit more research from both sides of the picture. There is secular evidence that someone like jesus existed and still enough belief    years later that people were painting pictures of him in the catacombs. Many of the early images are of a chubby asexual looking person with curly blonde hair and sometimes using a wand.The view people have of jesus today is probably nothing like the man they have based their assumptions on. None of the actual sayings attributed to either men have anything hateful in them only telling people to stop serving god as they had with all the hurtful rules and crazy regulations instead take control of yourself stop judging others stop causing harm and to help and love those around you.Its religion that is the issue especially organised religion and cults that twist the words to gain control over others. You can get angry at me for believing there is truth in the golden rule if you like I wont judge you as I dont know your circumstances but i would really appreciate it if you dont put words in my mouth or make false statements about what I believe.I myself dont believe god is a person but the father being referred to by jesus is actually the invisible force of love this means the only worship is to make sacrifices to help people around you.When people sacrifice time and energy in loving and generous ways then what some people think of as miracles occur....Hungry people get fed homes get rebuilt after tragedies people are saved by others risking their life.....

D  the book was compiled from different authors written presumably by the guy himself up to Isaiah  and the later chapters were written by others centuries later. From chapter  onward it starts talking about Israel Jerusalem and Cyrus designated role.,exjw,chq7yha,6,t5_2qp5l

1083962,0,t1_chrc2wl,Sorry I was speaking cult speak to you and I forget you dont know what Im saying because you dont speak JW Cult.  To a JW going to school for a PhD would be considered going out into the world kind of like an Amish kid wandering out of his village to see whats out there beyond the beards and buggies. When I said went back it is a common JW cult term that means when she left the worldly system and came back into the congregation fold and made herself right with Jehovah. While she was out in school in the secular world she was basically considered out amongst The Worldly. The Amish separate themselves by callingThe World something else The English. sorry Im Dutch Amish are a staple where I grew up. Google it if you dont understand. Its the same thing though when you go out into the world you become part of the world and when you put worldly matters behind you and focus on Jehovah you come back to the fold. Get it? Its hard to make clear to someone who hasnt lived it. I meant girlfriend like homegirl not chick Im trying to bang. You where pretty clear you werent sleeping with her. I got that.When you reach out to her to find out how she is doing know that in the cult there are  kinds of worldly people and yes you are  of them possible cult recruits and stupid ignorant and vile pieces of shit who have heard Jehovahs message and turned away from it. If you are not a possible convert your dead your bad association and your a possible threat to the cult members spirituality.You will find that when she speaks to you there will always be an underlying invitation to come join her in bible study. Once it becomes apparent that you will never ever convert to her religion all communication will stop especially if you talk down about the religion and point out its cult status.Good luck and enjoy the crazy ride. Dont be surprised when it turns out your friend pitys you because your a sad dumb moron who doesnt realize that the whole reason for his existence is to worship the God JWs invented. After all to her the JW version of the rapture is almost here and your going to die because your worldly. Afterwards Jehovah is going to have the crows eat your flesh quickly so that her and JWs just like here can move into your now abandoned house and live in it like its their own.YES they actually believe this. They also believe God will make all the animals vegetarian and that little kids will be able to handle cobras without fear. Im not even kidding.,exjw,chrhyqt,2,t5_2qp5l

I spent like  hours a day for a few weeks doing this  best decision of my life easily. Ive watched other people struggle free or met others that left with no assistance and the difference between my mind set and their is black and white...

However having a twitch response or as they say on the internet these days being triggered by a word or phrase isnt the same as being bitter. Its an unwanted response to something something left over after youve done the majority of your healing. Id also counter the idea of deprogramming as being the ideal endgame. Sometimes removal of the thing isnt the whole answer. Acceptance of something thats a part of you even if you dont completely like it at times is sometimes necessary and even if that comes with a bitter taste it doesnt need to make you a bitter person.Put another way black and white division good and wicked thoughts sheep and goat thinking is what Im personally always trying to move away from.

Its one thing if a family does it on its own free will but its another when they are indoctrinated and made guilty if they dont shun.  These groups should lose tax free status and be fined.  cult leadership should be charged with crimes against humanity.  honestly if the power to shun was taken away from groups like watchtower who really cares what nonsense they believe.  Obviously there are limits but if they want to believe the end is around the corner so what.  If people can leave without fear of losing family and friends they have freedom to do so others can stay and believe.There is no one thing that will help a cult member to leave or wake up to the con.

To prove their case they made a circle in front of journalists a cereologist advocate of paranormal explanations of crop circles Pat Delgado examined the circle and declared it authentic before it was revealed that it was a hoax. Inspired by Australian crop circle accounts from  Doug and Dave claimed to be responsible for all circles made prior to  and for more than  crop circles in  with  other circles not being made by them. After their announcement the two men demonstrated making a crop circle. According to Professor Richard Taylor the pictographs they created inspired a second wave of crop artists. Far from fizzling out crop circles have evolved into an international phenomenon with hundreds of sophisticated pictographs now appearing annually around the globe.Now I suppose they could only be claiming to have started the whole crop circle phenomenon but thats still an explanation orders of magnitude more plausible than aliens like to come down to earth for the sole purpose of making marks in our crops and nothing else.,exjw,ck0zqx2,2,t5_2qp5l

1817853,0,t3_2fd00w,The one thing that the religion taught me for the long run is that your belief system should be the most important thing in your life. They shoehorn that into making other peoples beliefs their business but that really isnt a basic tenet. Its always about putting god first. So now youve lost god. Thats fine he wasnt doing much for you anyway. But whats there instead? If your emotions are still so tied up in that religion that your daily mindstate is suffering its still the most important thing in your life youre just on the other side of the fence. Find something else to believe in positively. Think God is real but the JWs are way offbase about him? Cool! Buy in and get into it. Think lifes probably more of a Buddhist angle? Dive in and namaste and shit. Flying spaghetti monster? Yum! I personally think that the Christian mindset that the entire gigantic ridiculous infinite universe was created FOR US and US ALONE is terrifying beyond comprehension and now that I dont HAVE to believe that life just makes more sense.The JWs have this aura of selfimportance built in because of that mentality of being the reason for the universe. When you step back and look at them from an outside perspective? Theyre a smaller group of people than the state of New Jersey. How often do you ever think about New Jersey? If you happen to live in New Jersey think Virginia instead. Yeah you have family there and it sucks but thats where they are and theyre not moving so all you can do is avoid it and check out the ENTIRE REST OF THE PLANET. Until now they wouldnt even let you cross the border. Turnpike. Whatever. This analogy is falling off its wheels. The point is youre still letting them run your life.

1832541,0,t3_2fjv4c,Since I no longer read the bible as literal but figurative I understand Satan representing negative thought. Or conscienceness used to achieve negative results. And god as positive thought. Both are a result of conscienceness existing in humans and both necessary for evolution of man. This helped me understand Armageddon when viewed in this way. Armageddon is also figurative battle within each individual of negative and positive thought that will occur for all conscience beings either at death and for some prior to death. Discussing the meaning of biblical things when considered to be figurative is very interesting when you have only been taught to interpret things literally. Obviously anyone who reads the bible with a literall interpretation will think what I said is ludicrous and will miss a lot of the underlying value in the message. ,exjw,cka0k5d,3,t5_2qp5l

1852494,0,t1_cka8mam,Hey Buddha sorry I wasnt able to get back to you until today.  I went back and investigated this a bit more and youre right.  Paul doesnt specifically identify the serpent as satan but merely touches on it.  Maybe what I should have said was you can thank the authors of John John and Revelation. gtJohn You belong to your father the devil and you want to carry out your fathers desires. He was a murderer from the beginning not holding to the truth for there is no truth in him. When he lies he speaks his native language for he is a liar and the father of lies.gt John The one who does what is sinful is of the devil because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devils work.gtRevelation The great dragon was hurled downthat ancient serpent called the devil or Satan who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth and his angels with him.gtRevelation He seized the dragon that ancient serpent who is the devil or Satan and bound him for a thousand years.However its not far off to think that Paul first introduced the idea of the serpent being Satan since his writings are the first and oldest of the New Testament preceding the gospels Johns letters and apocalypse.  ,exjw,ckcf5pt,1,t5_2qp5l

LOL hes never going to put one foot in front of the other and actually MOVE.  He spends so much fucking time talking about progress he doesnt have time to actually progress.  We all know people like that... big talkers who explain more than they do.Yeah... theyre liars and unnecessary.In an irrational behavior course I took it was taught that in our minds we are all model people in the future.  In the future we loose weight we save money we change our dating habits.  In the future we are debt free and living comfortably.  But as the time moves forward we fall into our comfortable behavior.  We stay in place.  So I bring this up because having a plan of attack like yours is great.  Your moms tears are your moms problem... your movement is your problem.  Keep in mind that unless you progress past the point of simple reddit postings youre no better than the Jehovahs Witnesses who sit around talking about how wonderful things will be in the New System so they dont have to lift a finger now.  I actually like your plan of attack on the situation rather  I like the way you wrote it out.  Support groups are everything so join.

If you would like to listen to their worldview for self betterment or just general knowledge then that is your option but you have no obligation to do so if you dont want to and you have no obligation to tolerate disrespect from them.Its one thing to have an interesting discussion with someone who has a viewpoint that you may not agree with but if they cant express their viewpoint in a way that is respectful then they dont deserve your time and attention.,exjw,clhm3z3,5,t5_2qp5l

2213203,0,t3_2kgust,Hey Everyone! I havent been active on here for a while but something came to my mind today regarding the show Community and I thought I would share. Most of you already know that the character Troy was raised as a JW and loosely follows some of the rules but is pretty lax regarding others. In the episode Remedial Chaos Theory Pierce terrorizes Troy with a creepy troll doll. Although it is not your conventional s troll doll I was wondering if the writers intentionally included this weird fear many JWsexJWs may still have due to these demonic dolls! Again it could just be a coincidence since the writers dont seem keen on being particularly accurate with JW theology.

2306790,0,t1_clwic03,The majority of fundamentalist Christianity believe the nephelim to be translated as giants and they roamed the earth as offspring of demons.  Many religions especially  with a more fucked ethos like Mormons may assign additional elements to it but the premise is the same.Its impossible to be accurate about the issue because part of the Dead Sea Scrolls call them sons of angels and other parts of the Dead Sea Scrolls call them children of Seth.  Orthodox Jews I think choose the latter as they have no concept of demons in the Christian sense.  Those who take the bible literally choose the former typically.Realize this a very outofplace addition to the narrative to bridge this story of Universal Moral Law starting with Cain and Abel to this adapted Sumerian flood tale of Ziusudra.  People were NOT destroyed in the flood because of worshiping the wrong god.  In fact the general idea in the first part of Genesis is that every nation will worship their own god or gods according to their own will.  It was only the Israelites who where required to worship their god.  The story seems to pose the nephelim to represent general acts of overwhelming acts of oppression from conquering nations with other gods for example in which God would intervene. ,exjw,clwu3m5,2,t5_2qp5l

He would ask me questions in a way that sounded like he was genuinely curious such as birthdays ancient technology extraterrestrials nephilim just to broadly name a few. More specificly though was what anyone would do in an actual Armageddon scenario. I remember telling him that most would rely on their god to take care of them. JW would sit back and let shit happen while thinking that they are going to magically be saved from the doom and destruction around them. I said that they are mistaken. It doesnt just happen that way people have always had to take care of themselves before they would claim that their god saved them.It wasnt until we were away from all of the usual crap that would always bring me right back down to the borg that he went full force with his plan to wake me up. I say that in a completely positive way He had mentioned something about Rutherford and it caught me off guard because I had always viewed that Rutherford as a good man. Boy was a sorely mistaken! Hubby provided me with all sorts of sources on Rutherfords behavior and before I knew it I was looking up stuff for myself. During that awayness I learned about the coverups of the child abuse and molestation cases and the protection of child molesters. I was furious to say the least. I had decided that I did not want to be associated with that sort of thing and that I was never going to step foot into another Dingdumb Hall I know its immature.

2764791,0,t1_cnia7tw,You are partially correct but the doctor mentions another reason to put the note into the fileIf you are incapacitated and cannot make your wishes known your next of kin then becomes your legal guardian even as an adult and can make medical decisions on your behalf because it is assumed they have your best interests and your personal beliefs at heart. If your next of kin is a JW therefore they can refuse a blood transfusion or any treatment they dont like on your behalf even if you have taken the previous bloodless directive out of your file. The medical staff doesnt necessarily have to give you blood anyway.Saving the medical personnel is a side benefit and you are correct that it will save the medical staff some hassle. The primary purpose of making a reverse medical directive its not really a reverse directive just simply a new one which supersedes the old one is to protect your interests against those of your next of kin should your views on things conflict one another. This gives the doctor and nursing staff a platform on which to be able to refuse the requestsdemands of your next of kin therefore and to follow your own wishes on the subject.Here in Florida we had a case in which this would have helped tremendously and it was between people who were not JWs. In this case a young woman named Terry Schiavo was involved in a car accident and put into a coma. She was brain dead with no reasonable chance of recovery. There was a huge and longstanding legal battle between her husband and her family over her treatment and her alleged desire to not be hooked into life support if there was no chance of recovery. Her family was able to block her husband and medical staff from removing her feeding tube for years through court cases and injunctions even though she would never recover. The case was eventually resolved she was finally allowed to die physically the husband and medical staff were finally exonerated she had almost no brain material left any activity on her part was a result of reflexive behavior from randomly firing neurons. This could all have been avoided with a clearly worded medical directive on her wishes but who among us really thinks about these things?TLDR  Medical directives are a legal method of making your wishes known about certain treatments in the case of incapacitation and protects you against conflicting beliefs of family members.,exjw,cnicgmd,4,t5_2qp5l

There is obviously a difference in the Watchtowers application of Dispencing of Existence which is an implied threat rather than a literal act. Either way it provokes the drive to seek security from a perceived threat of death which helps drive people through the conversion process and helps keep people in line once theyre in. gtThe Dispensing of ExistencegtThe totalist environment draws a sharp line between those whose right to existence can be recognized and those who possess no such right. Are not men presumtuous to appoint themselves the dispensers of human existence? Surely this is a flagrant expression of what the Greeks called hubris of arrogant man making himself God. Yet one underlying assumption makes this arrogance mandatory the conviction that there is just one path to true existence just one valid mode of being and that all others are perforce invalid and false. Totalists thus feel themselves compelled to destroy all possibilities of false existence as a means of furthering the great plan of true existence to which they are committed. gtFor the individual the polar emotional conflict is the ultimate existential one of being versus nothingness. He is likely to be drawn to a conversion experience which he sees as the only means of attaining a path of existence for the future. The totalist environment  even when it does not resort to physical abuse  thus stimulates in everyone a fear of extinction or annihilation. A person can overcome this fear and find in Martin Bubers term confirmation not in his individual relationships but only from the fount of all existence the totalist organization. Existence comes to depend upon creed I believe therefore I am upon submission I obey therefore I am and beyond these upon a sense of total merger with the ideological movement. Ultimately of course one compromises and combines the totalist confirmation with independent elements of personal identity but one is ever made aware that should he stray too far along this erroneous path his right to existence may be withdrawn.,exjw,co2tux5,3,t5_2qp5l

The moral  if it wasnt painfully obvious  was that Jahs organisation is a protection and anyone heading out into the wicked world is gunna come an absolute cropper! What happened to the gunman? Thats not part of the story so I dont know. There is too much remorse for a fallen brother to give that much thought. Finally the person I was with heard this story and almost jumped for joy.

However being raised in a religiously strict household where the woman is subservient or growing up in a community where women are generally looked at as housewivesbaby factories can cause some mental and emotional tendencies in both men and women that any cultish religion can exacerbate.  For women that can manifest itself in overapologizing.Here is an article about the subject including a pretty poignant commercial from Panteen.  Also there is this article from Levo that includes the justification that apologizing is simply a way of being polite.Finally this article from Psychology Today makes an interesting statement how at a certain point people view the apology as insincere because of the volume of usage  similar would be overusing to word awesome until the actual meaning is diluted.In my own experience there was one case where I would jokingly say I dont believe you after a female workmate kept apologizing for everything... causing them to face the issue in a humorous manner and work to correct it on their own with laughter and absurdity.  In another case I could tell the overapologizing was due to a severe inferiority complex so I simply worked to boost the womans ego and ignored the overapologizing completely since drawing attention to it would only increase her sense of inferiority.  Neither of these women were Jehovahs Witnesses and neither had any substantial religious background.   ,exjw,cod9loe,3,t5_2qp5l

My father had the literature of my great uncle. One day I was so bored. There was some reason we did not visit the library. I picked up one of the old books. When I saw it I just screeched and screeched my head off. My mom came running.I pointed to the pyramid and the cross in a crown. My firs thought was we were under demon attack. Rather than beat me she assured me it was all right. She said the WT had been different. They used a cross and crown. Pyramids were essential. I read some of the lit and thought it was garbage. I thought the present work was garbage too. Ray Franz or some historian had a section on . I grew up in the NYC area in NJ. One unfulfilled date was blamed on a railroad train schedule. The distance and time to NY from Pittsburgh were key. A WT writer explained that there was an unmarked spar the choo choo train had to transit. The time table was incorrect. New dates were set once the spurs length was calculated. My mom told me she visited Bethel and there was a Christmas tree. I also heard about celibate marriages. The bro leading the morning prayer at Bethel suggested that WT lit made excellent Christmas gifts. I wanted Christmas so badly as a child. My mom also told me how excited she was to meet the Princes of the Old Testament such as David and Solomon. The WT built a house where they could life after resurrection. She was an older teen so she spent a lot of money on a special outfit to greet King David Noah etc. at the next convention. Her sisters also made special greeting outfits. She told me about the fabric and pattern. The entire family could not wait. Rutherford explained that they arrived invisibly. She was mighty annoyed. I had tears from laughing so hard. They knew zealous Witnesses who sold all their assets. When no Armageddon arrived they were bankrupt. I heard all these cautionary tales from both parents. ,exjw,cpe8ayc,1,t5_2qp5l

I also enjoy post apocalyptic genres especially the retrofuturism of the Fallout games cant wait to move out and play them but this mainly stems from my love of survival as a genre and topic probably comes from having to mentally survive this cult lol.  I dont really think the Armageddon prophecies of the jw cult have really influenced that since Armageddon was always supposed to be a time when everyone else was killed and all the jw cultists were safe.  Never a question of if you could do anything differently other than cower in a corner and wait for gawud to decide everything gaaah the memories of mine own stupidity   I like survival more because its like a raw test of the self. You have nothing but that big human brain and the wits it gives you.  Survival breaks you down to the core physically and mentally and ultimately reaffirms your strength as an individual while building you up even stronger for the next time you face such a challenge. To me survival is like the True Test of the self.  Its how we began and its where we always go back to when the unthinkable happens.,exjw,cpgvp9s,2,t5_2qp5l

This would have been back in the late s or early s. Cosplay as we know it today didnt really exist back then. My parents helped organized the party. It was hosted at the home of a well respected pioneer. People dressed as characters from Star Trek Star Wars Indiana Jones. A few hard core JWs showed up as Bible characters. Ive heard of other JWs in other congregations having costume parties.For sure JW life is full of ironies. JWs dont celebrate birthdays yet they celebrate anniversaries. JWs criticize mainstream Christians for idolizing the cross yet they stamp JW.org on everything. JWs dont celebrate Halloween due to its pagan roots yet they still wear wedding rings.

You might be able to shoe horn it in there some places but in other things it would just not work at all and the harder to tried the more you could convince yourself it all makes perfect sense and that anyone who doesnt do the same is crazy.I really wish I could just jump forward another  thousand years to see what humanity is like. We have allowed ideas and beliefs to become so deep rooted in human culture that its a struggle to remove them even when it is obviously parasitic.

3775921,0,t3_33nmkb,The only problem I had was the assumption that atheists dismiss the idea of god which makes it seem that we took in the idea and then after further thought dismissed it for something simpler.That is not always the case.  Many atheists simply stand with NO position and let the evidence dictate what is most likely.  From the start science and history can sculpt a pretty convincing series of events that seem really well coordinated while faith relies on a book that has more mistakes than manuscripts belief in a god that went silent  years ago with no explanation and violent condemnation against reason or those different.  More than that we have a cataloged history of millions of different faithbased movements performing millions of different atrocities all in the name of the same god without that god intervening or halting his faithful from executing criminal acts against humanity.Is there a god?  The facts state that there isnt enough evidence to suggest YES.  The answer is YES when we have some inner emotional movement from a spectacular event that causes our minds to become overwhelmed and we default to the hand of god be it sunset on the beach the northern lights or early mornings in the mountains. Well the faithful would then say that equally means there isnt enough evidence to say NO... and they are correct.  But until there is proof one way or another its in our best interest to make a decision and stick with it doing the best we can with the information we were given with the knowledge that in the future things could change to a different answer.  Many atheists accept this.  No faithful bible believers do.,exjw,cqmoles,8,t5_2qp5l

It is either the Jewish gods whose mythology first arose around  approx. years ago the Christian gods whose mythology first arose around  years ago or the Muslim god whose mythology first arose around  to  years ago.gtProblem is there are many many gods amp especially goddesses which are FAR OLDER than the deities of these three religious groups.gtThe Egyptian gods amp goddesses are at least  years OLDER than the oldest Jewish gods.The goddess of the temples of Malta are at least  years OLDER than the oldest Jewish gods.The deities of the temples at Gobekle Tepe are at least  years OLDER than the oldest Jewish gods.The deities of the artists who made the cave paintings in southern France amp Spain are at least  to  years OLDER than the oldest Jewish gods.The deities of the aboriginal Australians are at least  to  years OLDER than the oldest Jewish gods  depending on which date one chooses for the migration of the archaic Indian or southern Asian populations into Australia.Finally going back to the Acheulean cultures of the Homo erectus the Berekhat Ram female figurine possibly a poppet  a small deity figure kept as a charm to ward off evil dates back at least  years amp may be as old as  years.gtALL of these gods amp goddesses came BEFORE the recently generated NearMiddle Eastern gods that people nowadays refer either directly or obliquely to when they say god.gtThat which came LAST cannot have originated FIRST.,exjw,cqn10qf,1,t5_2qp5l

3971964,0,t3_35ykzf,I used to have a neighbor that studied with JWs. She was in her s married with a small child. She studied for a few years and for the most part believed although she rarely went to meetings and never quite gave up cursing. However she enjoyed the hope of paradise and also the friendship that studying offered. She didnt have many friends and she wasnt very close to her family. So the sister who studied with her became like family.Before I was out I would have discussions with her to ask how she was progressing. One day she confided in me that the sister who studied with her warned her that if she didnt start regularly attending Sunday meetings and showing signs of progression she would stop studying with her. This hurt my neighbor and she told me that it helped her realize that she needed to start doing more for Jehovah.This is pressure. This is coercion.It is all too common for study conductor to pressure the student to become more involved in the religion with threat of abandoning the study and severing ties.,exjw,cr91cfz,13,t5_2qp5l

Like Id snuff the mild torch I carry and chaperone on a date for you great. But since he wasnt a witness they never got together.It bothered me then and still does now. Shes over  now and last we spoke still looking for someone. And I hope she finds one! I just hate that the search takes so much longer than it has to because he has to be a brother  and a good one at that.But she also mentioned wanting kids and now itd be a risk to have one and her brother has Downs and she knows the risk and its likely never going to be an option. And its like there was so much time to have kids had you not been raised in the org had you gone out with that other guy you told me about meeting when you were in your s had you had the necessary stability to leave the org and your family had so many things been different.It still bothers me and your story bothers me because the past cant be changed and so as much as I wish there was something to be done it cant.

The WTS production was a technological first for the motion picture industry.Production began in  and the presentation was introduced to audiences in . It was the first major screenplay to incorporate synchronized sound moving film and color slides. Russell also published an accompanying book Scenario of the PhotoDrama of Creation in various languages.The presentation premiered in January  in New York and in the summer of  in Germany. Over  people in North America Europe New Zealand and Australia saw either the full PhotoDrama or an abbreviated version called the EurekaDrama.Shows that combined magic lantern slides and films were common at the time but the addition of recorded speech was unusual and the magnitude of its distribution for a single religious production was particularly notable.

My dream job is to be a journalist so I spend a LOT of time with the news and all the horrible crap that happens in the world and that can get overwhelming. Especially being the intense empathetic mentally unstable person I am One day in my current events class though my teacher said our society as a whole is dumbing down and I said something I hadnt really thought of until that moment When were we ever smarter? And I realized we have been getting smarter slowly but surely we make great discoveries weve been more progressive more people are out for more than just themselves. So once in a while I just look into statistics and stuff and notice that there are a lot of things that are getting better. Also outside of the kh I meet people who really care about life and people and the world.I dont expect you to just take my word for it we all know what happens when we do that lol but I would encourage you to try and find a way to have a positive outlook on things even though it seems near impossible at times. I suffer from depression and so personally I need to look at the positive or I will throw myself off a bridge. Thats not to say that we should just forget about the bad things but instead of focusing on the fact that they exist and theyre bad I like to focus on what I can do to help to make it better. My entire life Ive been the most cynical person in just about any room I was in. When I left though I realized that just to survive I had to get a better attitude about life. I also realized attitudes like that are what makes the world a better place dont get me wrong cynicism is important and I still know that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is etc. but I also think its important not to put yourself in a box of the world sucks and there is nothing I can do about it because it doesnt help anyone and it hurts you.This link will take you to the website of a wealthy philanthropist in Italy that launched an offshore aid station for migrants that are trying to get to Italy theyve saved thousands of people and Id say thats pretty fricken amazing.

Were are actually coming up on our  year anniversary of last meetingOur parents know and at this point most of our friends know. Most were blindsided by our actions and are unsure how to react. Two of my best friends were OK with it and still talk to me on Fbook etc. One lives here in the US the other is back in Spain. The one in Spain has his own shit going on with his marriage and other things and it cynical about the org but is still in it. The one in the US has known me since I was about  or so and knew that I had doubts  but we always hung out. There are a few others that I havent heard from but that is as much the nature of JW friendships as it is about the fade.

4289424,0,t3_39ylax,I had minor doubts that turned into major doubts the more I would think about them and apply logic reason and basic human decency. Had my holy shit this isnt the Truth and ive wasted  years of my precious life and didnt enjoy higher education thanks to brainwashed parents moment about  years ago. Very infuriating and nerveracking but I accepted it and moved on.Read through older literature read Crisis of Conscience read much of jwfacts site. All of that helped cement my new outlook. I felt it would be the right thing to finally let my wife know my thoughts. So a few months ago watched the Going Clear doc on HBO with my wife to help springboard my conversation with her. We each had a couple glasses of wine which helped haha.I pointed out the similarities Jws have with Scientologists as far as DFing leaving the religion and the thoughtemotion control. That led to my main talking point to her blood transfusions. She could not refute any of my points. Shes college educated and in the medical field which helps her think logically and with a saving the patient mentality. I only touched briefly on another big point  since i didnt want to melt her brain.She was never super into door to door or giving talks so both of us have been fading from those things for a long time now. Weve also only been to maybe  or  meetings in the past year. So its not like i was trying to talk with a hardcore pioneer or something. I have ZERO doubts that my wife would choose me over the Org. Thats why our meeting attendance took such a nosedive....we prefer hanging out with each other instead like hermits haha.Admittedly she does not know that I frequent apostate sites or the true extent of my beliefs. She does know that I do not carry a blood card and that I think its likely not the Truth. She knows both of those things could get me DFed but she has no intention of ratting me out. So shes basically fading with me out of convenience at this point.TLDR waited about  years to chat with wife.

4315870,0,t3_3afcqd,Could go both ways it seems consider this excerpt from the submitted article These courts including the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rule thatBecause the practice of shunning is a part of the faith of a religion we find that the free exercise provision of the United States Constitution . . . precludes the plaintiff from prevailing. The defendants have a constitutionally protected privilege to engage in the practice of shunning.The most significant failure with this approach is that it places outside the scope of governmental regulation potentially egregious conduct. Indeed a very strong case can be made that the current interpretation of the First Amendment does not require that government immunize religion from tort laws that are generally applicable. Whatever the merits of Employment Division v. Smith in the context of criminal law one could see very significant problems developing were religions to be granted general tort law immunity for all conduct which is religiously directed or compelled. Even limiting such an immunity to intangible or emotional harm provides a level of immunity to a religious practice that would leave many uncomfortable. Notwithstanding one commentators endorsement of this First Amendment approach of complete immunity the fact remains that the granting of immunity in the face of religiously motivated tortious conduct can produce profoundly negative consequences and gives religion a license to injure enjoyed by no one else.The entirety of article itself could be useful as A threat to the Elders who are considering making a DF or DA announcement.

4353265,0,t1_csgc0lr,The problem in a nutshell is that you didnt regularly buy one or more of the dipshits on your committee dinner or other gifts.In the future if you plan on going back be sure and have all of the elders over regularly for dinner take them individually out for a nice steak at the outback at least twice a year and be sure and always donate to the contribution box via check in regular large amounts. Make sure to ask for an official letter from the congregation indicating the amount youve donated for tax purposes. This ensures the people in the right places see what youve donated.Follow this plan and youll be safe in any judicial committee.If youre a brother youll eventually be appointed to servant then elder and youll be completely untouchable.If  youre a sister you can follow the above steps and then marry an elder and youll be safer however since youre a female youll never truly be safe from the judicial committee.As a sister your best bet is to become an attorney that specializes in  a form of law that deals with either a finances or b child molester defense.You can apply to bethel at this point and if you prove your worth you are now untouchable even as a sister.,exjw,csgcgao,3,t5_2qp5l

4412064,0,t3_3bjx9w,You are me  years ago. I met a wonderful man fell in love got married baptized and had kids. I didnt know much about the religion so I started studying and was basically pressured into getting dunked by his family. I pushed doubts and questions out of my head because I didnt see the seriousness of how bad this religion would rock my world. He wasnt baptized so people were really supportive of our relationship because I wanted to study. I mean he was adamant we were raising our future kids as dubs what was I supposed to do? We got baptized and our relationship just sucked. It was horrible. We fought all the time because of the plethora of rules you have to follow and the stress that follows from fearing imminent death if you arent perfect. I felt guilty about having sex with him. I felt guilty about him masturbating in the shower. I felt guilty when my family talked to me about holidays because I missed my family and the fun. I felt guilty about hating to go on service. I was miserable and so was he. I got pregnant and that was my final straw. People didnt congratulate us. They were upset that we were bringing a baby into this horrible world. How was I even allowed to breastfeed them if theres leukocytes in my milk? I started to see the hypocrisy and lack of love and was done. After seeing how they handle abuse I was never bringing my kids up that way. I couldnt kill them because of peer pressure if they needed a transfusion. There was no way I could ignore them for years if they got in trouble. I made my husband listen to all of my concerns until he would listen. You have no idea how lucky I am to get my born in spouse out. It doesnt happen very often. Now that we are out his family doesnt spend any time with us except his parents who see our kids under very supervised visits. We get ignored by people who knew him his entire life.

4811219,0,t3_3gqsfg,Everyone has opinions about what technology stack to learn but theyre always changing. So its important to learn fundamentals things like design patterns and whatnot. this is one of the definitive works on the topic.On the one hand theres lots of incentive to get in there and do things. But a lot of people more experienced and smarter than you have thought about issues for decades and a lot of the ideas of design patterns translate into most languages.Javascript is really exciting right now. Its the language largely driving the web. If you have no interest in web programming of any sort fine but its there and you can do some fantastic things with it that are really hard to do in other languages. Javascript The Good Parts the book and videos by Douglas Crockett on youtube are top shelf to get started and get past a lot of the perennial bad PR javascript has.C is pretty old its not going anywhere but newer languages can be a lot nicer have nicer features and be easier to produce working software. I would say start small things you can reasonably achieve. Do a variety of projects. Making a game is fine but itll take a long time. So if thats the only thing on your plate you can burn yourself out if progresses and success dont come at a pace you expect.Personally I think web programming is a great way to start. You can make a webpage pretty easily and develop features as you go so your progress is tangible and a way to set goals and build up your skillset. Youd have to learn a lot of basics CRUD operations objects and classes and so on. Theres a pretty low barrier to entry compared to game programming.,exjw,cu0zsqj,2,t5_2qp5l

The carrot everlasting life with absolutely no problems pain etc. Focus on this makes the sacrifice of everything else seem trivial. This appeals to those who dont a good or easy option for solving their problems. The WTBTS difference is that this reward is going to be here very soon not at the end of ones life.. The need to believe in order to get the promised reward and to have a purpose in life. Many people on the forum have trouble with their motivation and what to do after they leave.. The ego of belief i.e. God would not let me be fooled by a wrong religion. I cannot have done all that I have done in vain so it must be the right religion.

Someone below suggested fadingthere are resources to explain that and give you some pointers in the right sidebar of this page.  I understand being freaked out about losing your family.  But you mention wasting a third of your life FYI that time wont have been wasted though you will wish youd spent it differently would you prefer to waste your entire life as a Witness in order to maintain the status quo with your family or would you rather give yourself the chance to live the life you want?  I wont judge you either wayonly you know what you want and what you can bear.  Definitely try to make some friends outside the JWs.  Consider joining a gym or a weight loss support group.  I dont think a persons weight has anything to do with their value as a human but you sound unhappy with yourself right now and either a gym or a group of people dealing with similar issues could be a great way to meet new friends.

Make friends. Dont judge people just try to be happy everyday. As far as the kindom hall is concerned. That is going to be something that will be a stresser for you.

5005793,0,t3_3jhmef,I am very sorry that youre going through this.  If you can take comfort in the fact that many many exJWs have also gone through this have lost friends family husband  and yet have come out stronger AND with a better life on the other side please know that this situation will pass.But there are things that you can do to help yourself get through this more quickly.First although its excruciatingly painful to possibly lose your husband after youd both exited together is it possible that he can continue living with you and helping to raise his son while you go back to school?Eventually most people reach the point where they have to support themselves whether exJW or worldly.  Being able to earn enough to support yourself and your son is important amp your husband should help you to reach that goal whether or not hes considering leaving.When young people are pushed into selecting a mate from a VERY tiny pool of people it can lead to a lot of mismatches.  I suspect that both you amp your husband have been burdened with this situation due to the Watchtower Societys concretewall closed system regarding dating amp marriage.Those who have suggested personal counseling are spoton.  It is IMPERATIVE that you get personal counseling to help you get through this time especially from a therapist who is familiar with cults amp mindcontrol techniques.  Even if youve gotten therapy before try it again with a different counselor.  I had to go thru two counselors before I found the right one for me  and one of her earliest assignments was mindblasting  she assigned me the task of reading one book about cults.I ended up reading at least  before our next appointment.If you cannot afford a therapist see if there are exMormon groups in your area or exJW groups or exScientologist or just excult groups that meet to discuss amp heal the abuse dealt out by cults.  The more exposure you have to the fact that cults exist everywhere amp the more you understand how cults control people  using fear guilt emotional manipulation the faster youll be able to deconstruct such habits of control as they arise in your mind.You commented below in response to unycnz s comment that you are absolutely worthy of being lovedgt It sure doesnt feel like it. My parents do not love me my brothers etc. I thought I was a faulty good person but I dont know if Ill ever be loved unconditionally. Maybe my son will.A very very large part of your feelings of being unloved or unlovable is coming from the cult indoctrination both of you amp of your family.  So every time you deconstruct the cults methods of manipulation every time you realize what horseshyte youve been fed by a thoroughly hypocritical amp evil cult youll take another step closer to being able to love YOURSELF unconditionally.Speaking from personal experience that is the most difficult break or chasm caused by cult indoctrination  the cult manages to separate you from yourself.Once youve begun to heal that breach those feelings of being unlovable will begin to fade away.I hope for the very best for your future amp your sons future.  You are stronger than you think you are  but youll need to love amp support yourself to fully understand that.,exjw,cupdx4l,1,t5_2qp5l

My mom insisted on keeping bible studies with me. She disliked preaching secretly but I knew it and she loved this opportunity to book easy hours on my expense. I just hated it.

So damn much time!And I hated the reasons they gave me for it as I did not cared about any god.I will tell you what I did. I never spoke of it but I made no effort to hide how displeased I was with this life. They forced me to go on meetings and prechings until I was  years old. Yes. I was treated like I was ten with all the freedom they gave me. No friends no parties no visits at home no boyfriends. Control of what I read or watched.I did it because I did not want to live them pennyless. I studied and got a profession before I quit. It turned out that they did not expell me from home. I was trated fairly nicely after they finally gave up on me. But how could I be sure in my teen years that they would not make me homeless? Or take me away from school I dont think this is impossible here in Brasil?There is no way to win here. I sometimes feel that I should have standed for myself.

5138227,0,t1_cv4uwon,A quick notatallscientific survey of myself and a few friends shows that our deconversion and subsequent agnosticismatheism wasnt due to any personal events but due to an inexorable journey of reluctant acceptance of indisputable facts about the natural world and even more reluctant relinquishing of the comfort of belief in a god. Believe me letting go of that imaginary friendship was saddening for me even though I had never received any reciprocation in our oneway relationship. Where would I go to for answers now? Who would look after me? Who had a plan for me? When it became obvious that the answers were Nobody Me and perhaps Me if I got on with my life I was initially terrified but as acceptance came I started to revel in the challenge. This after all was what everybody else did. They took responsibility for their own actions and decision making and made the best of things they could. Yes ultimately were alone in the universe but how unlikely and how beautiful it is to essentially wake up in it and have senses with which to enjoy and appreciate it even if everso briefly.That being said yes of course traumatic life events have lead some to atheism. I immediately think of those who survived the Nazi death camps. Ive spoken to a few and none believed in gods after their experience. Understandable. Sure personal tragedy lead them to atheism but only because they couldnt deny to themselves that if there was a god he couldnt possibly have stood by and watched such horrors unfold.What I see as the commonality in these two different paths to atheismagnosticism is that fundamentally they are both the result of acceptance of fact whether it be the undeniability of the evolutionary process or the complete absence of help from ones deity when faced with the unremitting hell of seeing your loved ones starved to death before your eyes or worse. Both of these things show you that what youve accepted as truth all your life just isnt so. This seems fundamentally different to me than the decision to begin believing in things that by definition cant be proven ie. faith in god if it could be proven it wouldnt be called faith.Is this better or worse than turning to or should I say returning to because religiosity doesnt exist in a vacuum its always a concept thats been put to you previously belief in a god? Is reliance on a psychological defence mechanism in times of crisis worse than acceptance of the facts that theres no proof for example that youll ever see your newlydeceased loved one again? Im not prepared to make that kind of value judgement. Some people are simply happier with fairy tales they provide great comfort. Im ok with the grandma who takes comfort in thinking that her beloved poodle is now in Puppy Heaven though I wouldnt subscribe to such a belief myself. I wouldnt want to take that away from her. But to reach ones potential as a human to really experience life in all its stunning and exquisite beauty I personally find that its best done without the filters of religious belief the idea that oh this is nice but heavenearthly paradise will be so much better. Its better to go see the world now to savour the joy of each moment than to be putting things off because of a belief this earthly life is only temporary and is best spent preparing for the one that is to come. As to turning to atheism I dont think its a turning towards atheism as a way of turning ones back on ones god because youre angry with them. As I said its more an acceptance of and adjustment to reality at least it was for both myself and a friend whom I have recently discovered has independently reached the same conclusions as me.Its been a long long time since Ive had teething babies in my arms. Good luck with yours cherish every moment with them. They dont stay small for long. IF youre having difficulty coping with the extraordinary demands they impose including lack of sleep an exquisite torture if ever there was one please seek assistance from family if youre lucky enough to have some close by. If not youll have to look a little further away from home I hope theres community support services available in your area.

Keep in mind most JWs believe people leave either due to mental illness or because while they acknowledge its the truth they want to live a wordly lifestyle. I think its important to be clear that youre leaving because through logic research and critical thinking youve come to the conclusion that this is not the truth. Chances are he still wont believe you when you tell him that and maybe he never will but I think its important for them to know at least in the back of their minds that you left for very sensible reasons.Best of luck!,exjw,cv931u2,2,t5_2qp5l

Two things helped First I got the number of therapist from a suicide hotline not because I was imminently suicidal but because I knew they would take the request seriously and I could get help for free. Second was just brute force. Sheer willpower. I picked one thing to work on. Not everything all at once because that would have been overwhelming. Just one thing. And I worked on it. And I succeeded. And then I moved on to the next thing.To get out of the toxic home it sounds like youre in youll need employment which means youll need some marketable job skills. You could start there. Or another option might be to start getting in shape. Set a goal of losing  pounds. This is one of the easiest things to do. Hit up the group at rfitness.

Some of the water is sent to earth.Day  Dry land appears and plants appear.Day  Moon can now be visible from earth maybe it was there all along and hidden or was brought into place.  Sun is also now easily identifiable.

5442603,0,t1_cw7bqgx,The claim the Bible makes is that its Gods Word. I think the Koran makes the same claim though. I shouldnt comment on it since Ive never read it. I understand though that the claim of it being true is not evidence as such. Faith is the universal requirement for being a believer. Thomas had to stick his fingers in the wounds where Jesus was impaled. He said God Lord it really is you! And Jesus said You believe in me and you have seen happy are those who have not seen and still believe. Is this evidence in a scientific manner? Not at all. But it is a proof text if I can call it that addressing doubt. That is what the whole Bible seems to do. It addresses perhaps every claim that could be made against it. It really holds great testimony for any who choose to believe. Its not like I saw it Jesus Christ was the Son of God I saw it with my own two eyes and I am a witness to it. Nope. It requires faith. But if we only sit at the table of doubt its all we will have to eat. If we sit at the table of faith the Scriptures justify themselves or at least they have for me. The wikipedia article you mentioned is pretty deep stuff and I cant even read it all right now. I see there are some nice little nuggets of wisdom in there but I cant go through it all right now. Ill tell you this though we dont have time to see everything know everything do everything and not even close. We get just a taste of this world just a moment of it. And in that moment we can see the truth of the world. We may be deceived but we know what we know. We know evil when we see it. We know kindness when we see it. We may not know what is motivating those animations but we know what we see. So the Bible tells us what we are looking at. We dont have to pay attention we dont have to read it. It is there for whoever wants to see. The problem is when people wrongly use it to control others well we might get a bad taste but its not the Bible that I see as bad maybe just the people hitting us over the head with it.

5456953,0,t1_cw95via,well the signals our brains use to process information are electrochemical which put extremely simply is the movement of electrons and electrons are at the heart of the quantum world so Id say there is some connection.   For example the decay of radio active isotopes are very metered and extremely predictable on a large scale say you had one pound of c you would know in a little more than  years you would have half a pound of c.  Now if you were to pluck two atoms from that pile and watch them you might have  today and  tomorrow or you might have  for  years but you would never be able to predict the answe with certainty until you observed the results.  While the quantum effects are only distinguishable at the micro level they do infact influence the macro world.  So directly from the fact we are in fact made up of individual atoms makes us susceptible to the quantum effects of their micro world.,exjw,cw96e7t,1,t5_2qp5l

If a baptized member of a congregation either leaves or gets disfellowshipped they are instructed to not speak with such one for any reason even if they are a member of their family. Ive seen many JWs lose a son or daughter to disassociationdisfellowshipping and become horribly depressed and distraught because they can no longer speak to their child. Although they love their child and wish to speak with them they have been instructed by Jehovah God to not interact with them in hopes they will return to the religion.You are an outsider looking in. And JWs pride themselves on keeping the organization squeaky clean on the outside.Youre relatives are probably the real deal genuine articles who truly try to live as good people. But not everyone in their congregation is like that. Thats where the horror stories here come from.No one here is trying to blanket statement that all JWs are bad and no one wants to call your relatives bad either. But please realize that many people here have been hurt shunned and left for dead by JWs. We arent attacking you or yours. Were just licking our wounds and sharing our experiences and trying to help each other out the best we can.,exjw,cwjg6rc,2,t5_2qp5l

5564206,0,t1_cwl4u2d,Of course there are personal reasons this policy stays in place.When I speak of class action lawsuit I mean a lot of people that have been harmed in many different ways could come together and bring one extremely huge lawsuit against the Watchtower Society. Instead of individual lawsuits. They would have grievances  miles long. No one would have to pay the lawyer. The lawyers fees are awarded as part of the damages that are awarded in the entire suit. Im talking about many investigations happening over a long periods of time. Then you would go to court and let a jury decide the damages. Your burden of proof would not be as difficult as if it were a murder trial or rape trial. Im saying sue them for Hundreds of Millions of Dollars in damages. A Huge lawsuit that would go one for a long time with constant non stop exposure of The Watchtower Society in the new media. This would bring them down. Sue the bastards. Dont try to put them in jail. Heck If I new there was an ongoing class action lawsuit against The Watchtower Society of the JWs Id join and try to get damages for the two years I was lied to. I was never told they had to fill out a time Card for the time they spent with me to send to The Watchtower Society. I was a means to and end for them. ,exjw,cwmsgit,2,t5_2qp5l

My heart sank when he said that.  As the night went on he told me about how he has a worldly girlfriend and about their recent pregnancy scare so I was just shocked how he could be so far out physically but still believe the horseshit.He called me a couple months ago and told me his roommate got disfellowshipped for fucking around and I asked if he was being questioned.  He told me hed never gotten baptized and I said congratulations. He said I learned from the big boys. Lol. Anyway youd think from there hed start bashing the truth but instead he started saying how it made him feel like he need to start getting on track since the world looks like its approaching its end.

Start off in the book of Genesis my favorite its full of SO many wacky obviously wrong mythstalesbeliefs! and examine each verse CAREFULLY  this is where uScummydross s advice about using the Boreans example could really be useful  and carefully help her to realize the inaccuracies of the bible by using QUESTIONS as utimelorddegallifrey mentioned amp a few others hinted at instead of statements.Youll want to ask open questions not leading questions.

The JW org promotes the idea that one can never do enough for it and that is part of what makes it really unhealthy for people that are in it other religions  may at times provide more benefit at less cost so not all religion is necessarily as toxic as what we have experienced. If all religions were as harmful as the JW org then IMO they would be justified in being so aggressive in arguing against belief. ,exjw,cxnbpc0,3,t5_2qp5l

5867131,0,t3_3vll5g,Reading through the comments I get the following bits of info. You arent baptized. Your father is not baptized . Youre worried about being labelled an apostateIn all honesty they cant do shit and THEY know it as well. You arent baptized  so have never technically stood with Jehovah...therefore you cant stand against him which is their ridiculous definition of apostasy. You cant be an apostate even by their definitions. So your father isnt baptized due to his job. He is trying to suck up to the elders to atone for his past and do the right thing by you. You do not owe him anything. If anything you can ask  if it is so important to believe and be baptized  why wasnt he? Surely he could have made the needed changes.  You can go to the meeting and just politely say you dont want to discuss it. Repeat that phrase. You dont want to discuss it. It is between you and Jehovah and you dont want to discuss it. Be careful about what you say in front of your parents going forward so that there arent two witnesses. ,exjw,cxopmyj,1,t5_2qp5l

5964694,0,t1_cy1hfa2,They do it quite often yes. However in this case this paragraph is telling something different. It just says not to disfellowship a person right away when caught celebrating a birthday so that it wouldnt look too cultish and so that they wouldnt loose members too quickly. Such a person will be counseled first and then if caught again he or she will be either reproved or disfellowshipped. Celebrating birthdays more than once after being counseled automatically means causing division.But I get you. A person can try to appeal to this paragraph in order to avoid disfellowshipping. However its not the supreme court its a hypocritical cult. Most likely they will fuck you up and disfellowship you anyway. Thats what mostly happens in real life.

Thats what they are whether theyre interpretations of one book or another or just intrinsic biases you were raised with. They are opinions. Its a moot point and youre arguing from a position of redefining the words. Im simply not going to credit that as honest or holding any semblance of integrity.gtYou as of now impose your bias and beliefs upon mine!In what way shape or form? Youre claiming to have divine support and Im not buying into it and giving it the same credibility as a five year old with an imaginary friend. I have not imposed anything on you that you havent claimed the mantle for.gtI dont hide behind a belief as a reason why Id dont accept something it is because of that belief I dont accept something and I will tell anyone if need be that truth.I dont even understand what youre trying to say here. Clarify it and Ill address it in its current form it would just be remiss to make assumptions on what you intended to say.gtto say for years the God concept has been laughed at by civilization is so beyond stupidity.Greek Roman Norse Aborigine Native American Inuit etc etc etc mythology. These are fairy tales. Theyre currently given less credence than a five year olds imaginary friend. Yes religious beliefs have always been an important aspect of civilization as has the shift between one belief to another. The death of a religion into fairy tale and myth is nothing more than it no longer standing up to scrutiny and being discarded as trivial nonsense.gtYes some laugh but its the small percentage of the world that has been ignored.Just a thought here but if I turned on FOX news and waited for them to talk about Islam youre saying they wouldnt laugh or ridicule it in any way? If I pick up one of the ISIS publications there would be no ridicule of Christianity anywhere in the contents? Have you ever read a book that ridiculed Judaism? Would it be wrong to say that you dont accept Shintoism and find its practices and beliefs to be silly? How you dont make the connection between your scrutiny of other religions and my scrutiny of a god concept is something I find sad.Religion as a whole works in its own ridicule. Every religion is better than the other and theyre all attacking indiscriminately. To say otherwise would be stupid. To say only a small percentage of the world laughs at religion is just misinformed and biased to your specific avenue of information.,exjw,cy1kggg,1,t5_2qp5l

The issue is faith the issue is belief and the way society sees these as virtues when they are absolutely not virtues. There is nothing virtuous about being credulous.

6155878,0,t1_cyp17o7,gt Its not a religion either It depends on your definition of religion. Is Wicca a religion? Legally yes it is but it also does not explain god and it doesnt really cover the meaning of life either. Should it then not be a religion? I think it greatly depends on how it is defined.However I digress. One reason it is often called the church for short hand  is because scientology gets confusing when you know what you are talking about. The Church of Scientology and Scientology are not the same thing and should not be treated as the same thing. Scientology is a set of religious defined as dealing with the human soul having spiritually themed and aimed practices and holding a set of beliefs about the nature of the spiritual world and reality beliefs. The Church of Scientology is a destructive cult.Thus we dont say Hes one of Scientologys fiercests critics since that would imply he is a critic against the entire concept of Scienotlogy. To my knowledge dont want to speak for him he does not agree with Scientology either but I also believe his primary target is the Church of Scientology not the beliefs of Scientology.We have no disagreement that the Church of Scientology is a cult. We have no disagreement that it is not a genuine church. We do disagree about it not explaining god the meaning of life morality or the mysteries of the universe as it explains all of those. We also disagree that Hubbard did not believe his own claims. I think when you lie about something so long and in such a grand way you begin to believe your own lies. I am fairly certain Hubbard believed most if not all of his stories and beliefs by the end. Whether he began with purposeful lies or self delusion I am not sure as I see strong evidence to suggest both....Regardless I never say that the Church of Scientology is a religious organization deserving of tax exemption. But I do refer to it as the church in context because its name is Church of Scientology. I could call my organization Church of Coffee Cups and that would not make it a religious organizaiton but in the remaining discussion I would likely say the church to refer back to my main subject. It wouldnt magically help that organization get religious recognition...,exjw,cypcxee,1,t5_2qp5l
6157927,0,t3_3zs35k,I will say that because of how we were raised I still take infidelity extremely seriously. Im not comfortable with people I know joking about it or walking the line and would be pretty pissed if my SO tested the waters by chatting with her ex or something.On the other hand we need to realize that not everyone has the same view of marriage we do. A lot of women still want to marry. Im not against it. I would probably love to get married some day. But Im not out there looking for my bride. You need to let those things naturally happen. I figure if were on the same page regarding kids religion sex finances and politics sorta then we would probably be good marriage mates. I think its also important to have your own thing. And her have hers. Alone time is not a bad thing in a relationship. Love bombing and smothering each other can be bad. It will take some time to root out whatever ridiculous ideas of sexmarriage were programmed into us by the JW. And dont forget that other people can program us to have bad views on all that. Your friends or social media or TV shows dont always portray the reality of sexmarriage accurately.

Officially they need to keep really quiet about the first century Christians because they owe a lot of their extra scriptural doctrine to them particularly Eusebius but they also need to claim that everyone other than those mentioned in the bible were technically the beginnings of false religion during the gentile times. I remember studying the All scripture inspired book as a kid and although almost all of the claims in the book have been roundly debunked by biblical scholars that was around the last time the WT society really tried to punch above its weight apologetically.

And then continued eating a poor diet...Many a loyal faithful JW has wrecked their physical health with such fallacious thinking  amp the loss of their health certainly wasnt due to any apostasy by their relatives.The supposed death threat that the Watchtower Society has hung over EVERY Jehovahs Witness head is what has caused your fathers distress.  That is on the Watchtower Societys manipulative dishonest head collectively.  You amp your girlfriend certainly werent the ones who set up the climate of fear guilt threats of eternal destruction amp manipulation of emotion that your family has been subjected to.If you feel that you must return then reconnoiter the situation first.  Instead of just blindly accepting the word of whomever has delivered the dire news of your familys dismal slide downhill go see your sister to check on her state of health.Ask your parents what has caused their loss of health.  Sometimes the aging process just catches up with people rather suddenly  it might have absolutely nothing to do with your departure.A family that clings so tightly to one member attempting to force them to return amp conform to a particular amp very unhealthy lifestyle is not a properlyfunctioning family.

I feel that it is the same with most of us.Our collective moral compass wasnt tuned to point toward the Governing Bodies patented direction.

As far as the delusional who believe despite facts  playing dumb and just asking questions seems to to be the established tactic that works best.  It doesnt put the person on the defensive and they dont feel that you are trying to change their mind.

6348077,0,t1_czb672r,gt This is like a reocurring problemExactly you hit the nail on its head. Think about this. Imagine someone looses their family in a car crash war or epidemic. What is the difference with the cult survivors situation? Its this  you have no closure. You get to feel the rejection and loss all over and over again. This is what conditional relationship essentially is  a form of repetitive rejection and abuse.By recognizing that this is abuse towards you you can gain control over it. Reverse shunning called so because usually its the other way around  cult members shun those who left is something that to be ethical needs good reason. When you recognize that you are being systematically though unintentionally abused you get to have that reason. We all have moral and ethical right to protect ourselves from abuse intended or unintended by what ever legal means.Now as I explained loosing family to a car crash is in a certain sense easier on the psyche as loosing them to a cult and the difference stands in the repetitiveness and closure. Loosing them to a car crash is an event that happens at one day and then its over what remains is recovery and moving on. With the lockstep conditional relationships with cultinfested family it is an ongoing process during which recovery and moving on can not start or happen.This brings us back to where I started. If all else fails you can change the situation. You can make it as if you lost them in a car crash by reverse shunning. And this is the only gain you can make over your current situation. You cant get them back losses are losses. The best you can do is find a way to start recovering from the losses.Right now you have a leg blown off. This is terrible and there is no way you can get the leg back. But what can be done is that you can be collected from the field taken to the hospital operated on dressed and given an opportunity to recover. If this is not done you will loose blood the stump will get infected and you will die.I hope that this analogy helps you to evaluate your life situation and make a difference. I am sorry that this cant be just a everything will be all right comforting I must give you the reality. Imagine a field medic saying to the soldier just hold your blownoff leg in place and lie here for hours it will grow back on and everything will be all right.

I was to accept communications contents of which were an attempt to persuade General Ludendorff to discontinuance of his objection to the Nazi regime. During my discussion with Dr. Frick Hitler suddenly appeared and began taking part in the conversation. When our discussion obligatorily dealt with the action against the International Bible Students Association Jehovahs witnesses in Germany up until now Dr. Frick showed Hitler a number of telegrams protesting against the Third Reichs persecution of the Bible Students saying If the Bible Students do not immediately get in line we will act against them using the strongest means. After which Hitler jumped to his feet and with clenched fists hysterically screamed This brood will be exterminated in Germany! Four years after this discussion I was able by my own observations to convince myself during my seven years in protective custody in the hell of the Nazis concentrationcamps at Sachsenhausen Flossenburg and MauthausenI was in prison until released by the Alliesthat Hitlers outburst of anger was not just an idle threat. No other group of prisoners of the named concentrationcamps was exposed to the sadism of the SSsoldiery in such a fashion as the Bible Students were.

6443522,0,t1_czlkh59,I must say that in the Bible it does say God was a man. Jesus. John  In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. Greek actually says and God was the Word Tim And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh justified in the Spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory Greek says He instead of God but God and His church was talked about before this passage Matthew  Look! The virgin will conceive a child! She will give birth to a son and they will call him Immanuel which means God with us.John  Thomas said to him My Lord and my God! When Jesus proved to Thomas He livedZechariah  And I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for hisonlyson and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness forhisfirstborn. God is speaking here and says that they will look at Him who they had pierced. John  For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled Not one of his bones will be broken.And again another Scripture says They will look on him whom they have pierced. This scripture talks about Jesus being pierced and confirms the previous scriptures where God Himself says He will be pierced and be mourned. Note The Change God did in Zechariah from me to him. This would make sense if jws believed in John  without alteration as that scripture states The Word was a separate entity from God and yet the Word was GodJust some observations there for you.,exjw,czlst1j,1,t5_2qp5l

6449852,0,t1_czmg15b,Ha! You are right. His postgt The Bible generally uses the Greek word stauros when referring to the instrument of Jesus execution. Matthew  John  Although translations often render this word cross many scholars agree that its basic meaning is actually upright stake.Ref below According to A Critical Lexicon and Concordance to the English and Greek New Testament stauros never means two pieces of wood joining each other at any angle.Ref New Bible Dictionary Third Edition edited by D. R. W. Wood page  Theological Dictionary of the New Testament Volume VII page  The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia Revised Edition Volume  page  and The Imperial BibleDictionary Volume II page .Edit other word usedThe Bible also uses the Greek word xylon as a synonym for stauros. Acts   Peter  This word means wood timber stake or tree. sane ref The Companion Bible thus concludes There is nothing in the Greek of the New Testament even to imply two pieces of timber.Reasoning book on Crossgt The Greek word rendered cross in many modern Bible versions torture stake in NW is stauros. In classical Greek this word meant merely an upright stake or pale. Later it also came to be used for an execution stake having a crosspiece. The Imperial BibleDictionary acknowledges this saying The Greek word for cross stauros properly signified a stake an upright pole or piece of paling on which anything might be hung or which might be used in impaling fencing in a piece of ground. . . . Even amongst the Romans the crux from which our cross is derived appears to have been originally an upright pole.Edited by P. Fairbairn London  Vol. I p. .gt Was that the case in connection with the execution of Gods Son? It is noteworthy that the Bible also uses the word xylon to identify the device used. A GreekEnglish Lexicon by Liddell and Scott defines this as meaning Wood cut and ready for use firewood timber etc. . . . piece of wood log beam post . . . cudgel club . . . stake on which criminals were impaled . . . of live wood tree. It also says in NT of the cross and cites Acts  and  as examples. Oxford  pp.   However in those verses KJ RS JB and Dy translate xylon as tree. Compare this rendering with Galatians  Deuteronomy  .gt The book The NonChristian Cross by J. D. Parsons London  says There is not a single sentence in any of the numerous writings forming the New Testament which in the original Greek bears even indirect evidence to the effect that the stauros used in the case of Jesus was other than an ordinary stauros much less to the effect that it consisted not of one piece of timber but of two pieces nailed together in the form of a cross. . . . It is not a little misleading upon the part of our teachers to translate the word stauros as cross when rendering the Greek documents of the Church into our native tongue and to support that action by putting cross in our lexicons as the meaning of stauros without carefully explaining that that was at any rate not the primary meaning of the word in the days of the Apostles did not become its primary signification till long afterwards and became so then if at all only because despite the absence of corroborative evidence it was for some reason or other assumed that the particular stauros upon which Jesus was executed had that particular shape.Pp.   see also The Companion Bible London  Appendix No. .gt Thus the weight of the evidence indicates that Jesus died on an upright stake and not on the traditional cross.,exjw,czmgea0,10,t5_2qp5l

I hope you do and I am working on being more understanding.It is OK to be old fashioned as I have the same feelings and honestly feel it is better emotionally and physically to live that way. But it is truly better not to judge and to accept that other people will make different decisions than the ones you would make. It is easier to do so if you dont believe you can live life for others and cant really know what is best for them. Dont make your parents response a case for anything imagine they were the stereotypical social climbers who value money and social position over all else  would you let their anguish over your sisters failings of volunteering at the homeless shelter and adopting stray cats become an issue for the person you are now?| I feel that she has given all of us a bad nameIMO JWs put way too much emphasis on reputation in part because their subculture calls for judging people and putting up a good appearance  a justification for all kinds of arbitrary rules. Try to let it go  reputation is a form of judging  labels applied that mask getting to know the real people. Even Darth Vader at the end of Return of the Jedi still had good in him and was redeemed partially? by having someone believe in him in that goodness that no one could see.Ask yourself if you think your sister is trying to shock you excite herself find acceptance or just keep you in her life when she tells you these things. It is probably a combination. The loving thing to do is to provide acceptance most when she has done that which offends you the most. And perhaps getting acceptance will help her not feel the need to be as different.tldr Reputation is overrated kindness and acceptance for those who are different is the truly loving way to be,exjw,cznfiii,7,t5_2qp5l

The serpent asked Eve what Yahweh had told them and when he heard it he told the humans that Yahweh was lying. He told them that they would become like Gods and know good from bad. What happened when they ate the fruit? Yahweh himself says it Look they have become like one of us gods knowing good and bad! And now if they take from the tree of life and live forever!

If the Catholic Church was the one who decided which socalled sacred books were to be included in the official canon and the Catholics are supposed to be a false religion once again according to the org then it seems that GOD once again has little or no control.

I totally understand both the thought experiment and the use of it specifically for procrastination as I am now doing by commenting when Im supposed to be working. So even though I know youre just playing with the concepts theoretically Ive heard resounding affirmations that most witnesses believe this way and its one of the primary ways they allow themselves to avoid the uncomfortable thought of God killing billions instantly because they can focus on all the worldly people who have already died but will obviously immediately accept a bible study upon being resurrected as unrighteous people. My goto anecdote about this is an older hippy sister who Ive known all my life and played music with all of her kids at different times her oldest is an incognito exjw who is staying in for family reasons while his marriage falls apart. Ill always remember the day George Harrison died and I spent the day in mourning listening to Beatles records. Later that week I think I went to her house and she spoke in terms of joy and celebration because every Beatle that dies is another Beatle that will certainly be resurrected!! I still shudder at that memory and at the way I slowly began to realize how even the jws I loved the most had at least some part of their personality and thinking that I absolutely hated and abhorred. She introduced me to so much literature and music and stories about living in Woodstock right in my favorite period of music but she returned to the truth just in time for the great disappointment and has been a really sorry excuse for a Jesus freak ever since albeit with better music and cultural taste than most. ,exjw,d0aoz94,4,t5_2qp5l

6688757,0,t3_478bti,I was once engaged to a man who had studied gotten baptized and was new though he had had some contact as he grew up through one of his parents.  He had family in in fact his two sisters were the powerhouses in the congregation.  Two pioneers a set who pretty much could throw their weight around and would get their way.Anyway this guy had been married before.  After becoming engaged I found out through the grapevine that the real reason that the marriage had ended was because he physically abused her.This really made me nervous but the thinking at that time was that the Bible teachings cured anything even wife abuse so finding that out didnt really give me good enough reason to break up with him even though I wanted to by that time.  I knew his sisters though would make my life hell if I did break up with him because they wanted him securely in the Borg and believed that marrying me would do that.Anyway he himself screwed up and I got away with breaking up with him.One day when he was picking me up from work he saw me saying goodbye to a really nice married co worker a friend and he went cookoo!  Grabbed me by the arm shook me like a rag doll and drew back his fist.  I didnt know how to get away so I threw his engagement ring and when he went after it I ran away.  Walked a couple of miles home and never spoke to him again.His sisters confronted me threatening to take me to the elders but when I told them to go ahead they backed down.Three months later he married another sister.,exjw,d0b6cix,2,t5_2qp5l

So anything less than that is still not good enough for her and shell probably be upset by it.So you dont have to make your nos hardcore but dont promise or allude to anything you really dont want to deliver. Her emotional manipulation may not be deliberate but its still grossly unfair. So dont go. Message her and tell her you love her but you actually only agreed to go because she was crying and you hate to see her crying note not you hate making her cry but you hate being insincere which is a form of lying  and so you have decided not to go because in the long run you believe she will respect you more and you will respect yourself if you are honest with your motives.. But you are happy to see her any other time.Take a deep breath and just do it. Dont give her chance to cry at you again and do something fun with your bf that night instead.

7035237,0,t1_d1dhtig,Hey there I was really impressed by your post.  I just wanted to say Ive been in your brothers shoes.  I obviously dont know exactly what hes thinking or all his reasons but from what you have said I recognise all the behavioral signs.  When I realised I didnt believe anymore I had no idea what to do.  Its not that I wanted to go and sin or any of the many motives JWs usually attribute to those who leave but rather it was because of things that just didnt add up to me.  When youre a witness and you go over the subject of disfellowshipping and shunning its pretty easy to defend the stance of the organisation when youre just talking abstractly about a hypothetical person or watching an actor in one of their videos.  But when you personally experience the situation thats when the reality of what you are being asked to do hits you and it doesnt feel right because you know your brother you know hes a good person and Im sure deep down you know he doesnt deserve to be treated this way by his family or have his whole reputation dismantled and his mental capacity and motives called into question just because he is no longer convinced of a religion he was brought up in.  I was amazed when I read this quote from the Awake! July  pp    No one should be forced to worship in a way that he finds unacceptable or be made to choose between his beliefs and his family.  Heres a link I was a fully believing Jehovahs Witness at the time when I first read that yet even back then I couldnt help but be shocked by the obvious double standards.Its wonderful that you havent just ignored your brother and that you are going to give him a listening ear.  Let me tell you from experience for him having you a family member finally hear him out without prejudging him and second guessing his motives will be like having the weight of the world lifted off of his shoulders!  Empathy goes a long way and you sound like you will be the first one to show it to him.  ,exjw,d1dstba,13,t5_2qp5l

7135247,0,t3_4d8cbh,I think the animal sacrifice part of the Abrahamic faiths has a much simpler explanation. The man or men that dreamt it up liked eating meat but didnt like all the labour and investment that went into acquiring it. So they convinced the followers theyd deceived that a rather vicious god they had direct conversation with likes the smell of animals being burned.  But not just burned but drained of all blood first so it just happens to cook nicely while burning.  And not pork because the smell isnt nice to Yahweh or presumably the cult leaders.  Also make sure the animal is without any blemishes or diseases because although it doesnt matter if its just being burned it does if the cult leaders are going to eat it after.  Poultry is also a nice way of begging for forgiveness. Yahweh also likes wines and cakes lifted up in front of his altar and then left there with the leaders behind closed curtains.  God liked Abel more than Cain for the same reason the Watchtower likes the child that donates his pocket money more than the rich guy that donates a little.  In a nomadic tribe food is currency. Meat and wine is valuable vegetables and water less so. Thats why Yahweh likes animal sacrifices according to the cult leaders that will end up eating whatever is given freely. All anyone seems to care about in Genesis is acquiring more goats and livestock.  By reading the first few books of the Bible you can see how the whole idea of animal sacrifice evolves into a pretty much standard set of laws of how much meat you need to give the church to cleanse you of your sins. Sins that the church itself invented. Its a pretty standard way of a cult leader using his followers for income or being cared for.  As for the article you linked which is a bit more general in what its saying our brains are also hardwired to be scared of the dark I suppose. For historically good reasons too. It might take a while to evolve out of that. But in safe places with decent education religious belief declines and maybe fear of the dark too.,exjw,d1p768b,2,t5_2qp5l

Nothing.  All I ever got was depressed.  Id hear people get good full time jobs then they could get their own car enjoy going out with other bros from the cong getting their own places to live etc.  Being a RP I got parttime jobs and a few months into the job Id get laid off.  I could never make enough money to enjoy just for necessities rent and bills no car.  For some stupid ass reason bros and sis would ask me if I was working right at the time Id have no job.  Every. Damn. Time.  Then the rumors would start that I didnt want to work that I wanted to live with my aging mother forever so she could support me.  Shit like that...  Cant feel blessed like that.I wanted to find a good JW husband.  Thought Jehovah would bless me since I was giving my all to Him.  Here I was growing older and older not finding anybody who was interested in me while at the same time these younger people around me were all getting married!!  What about me?!  I turned  and I was alone and all the cong could do was joke that I was going to be with my mom forever living a happy life together.  OH... and dont forget the comments that sisters would tell me in Spanish Te va dejar el tren! which loosely translated meant I was going to be forever alone.  Thanks a lot for making me feel special fuckers!!May I just say that all that and more just made me feel so alone in the middle of a full congregation.  And remembering all this right now is just making feel all that hurt all over again.  Its what pushed me away from them... they made it so easy for me to leave and not look back.

7350103,0,t1_d2dkpmz,Do you mind me asking what your beliefs are now? Ill share mine for fun because part of what helped me wake up was listening to some audiobooks on stuff like archaeology and ancient civilizations like Sumer and what their creation story is. For people more scientifically inclined it kind of melds science with faith which is really fascinating to me. Did you know they discovered a  year old collection of temples called Gbekle Tepe that were built right after the Younger Dryas the last cataclysmic event to have taken place likely caused by a comet hitting the earth causing massive global flooding and climate change ended? Its a more scientifically accurate description of what caused the Flood an ancient story in countless cultures across the globe. Learning about things like this is really interesting to me. I believe in what I like to call the essence of the Bible. I feel like a lot or most of its stories in the Old Testament are allegorical or mythical in nature. Probably a lot of ancient people trying to interpret events happening around them they couldnt fully comprehend. Hearing theories like the Sumerian Annunaki makes more logical sense to me than how fairytale sounding Genesis makes God and his angels sound. I mean think about how unimaginably complex and powerful a being would have to be to create the universe and planets and people with thoughts and emotion. But all we picture God doing is sitting on a throne wearing robes and a beard? Hes got to be up to some other shit we couldnt comprehend either. ,exjw,d2dnn7z,2,t5_2qp5l

IMO they could not make such a change because it would mean loosening their control and they cant do that and I doubt they would give up their attitude that they are superior to everyone else  without them being truly humbled.It seems stupid to us but I can guess they had some reasonsCarts sure they look stupid but they provide a carrot to be able to get one because they make it easier to count hours and they apparently feel the hour count is important for encouraging a sign of blessing that it increases.

The closest quote we can find in his writings is still very differentgtSince it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment regulate every act and thought accordingly. But to go away from among men if there are gods is not a thing to be afraid of for the gods will not involve thee in evil but if indeed they do not exist or if they have no concern about human affairs what is it to me to live in a universe devoid of gods or devoid of Providence? But Gods there are undoubtedly and they regard human affairs and have put it wholly in our power that we should not fall into what is truly evil.As a side note the statute in the image might be more accurate than the quote.  The sculpture is normally attributed to Caracalla but it is notoriously difficult to figure out which bust matches which figure from history.  In fact there isnt even a single sculpture ever found that can conclusively be proven to accurately portray Julius Caesar.

The IDF create problems among people that dont want problems then wonder why the hell bad elements within that community hit back. I am a complete a pacifist and anti war.

I had more doubts in recent years but when I talked to the elders about the things that would eventually lead to my DFing I was still of the mindset that I should tell them the complete truth that that was the right thing to do that theyd have my back and Id be dealt with fairly. Nope. DFed. Which lead to my waking up so ultimately Im extremely glad it did play out that way...they just arent at all what they claim to be. And my parents did the same as Joshs parents. Still talked to me after my DFing...once they realized I was an evolutionaccepting atheist and I wasnt in the market to buy into their bullshit ever again? Complete shunning. As far as Dubs lying to maintain image thats  on point. So many Dubs I was friends with were technically doing things thatd make them bad association while simultaneously talking behind my back and telling others I was not spiritual enough. Thats the weird thing about being a Dub...you have to pick your sin. Even if youre committing sin X you can still feel superior to Brother Jones because hes committing sin Y which is obviously a worse sin. Brother Jones probably thinks the exact same way about you.We all did it to some extent. Other Dubs judged me as spiritually weak in some way because for example I watched Lord of The Rings...but my family judged their family as weak because they had a huge house and a latemodel Cadillac or something. When my dad was an elder things he said to another brother about what that brother allowed his daughter to do caused that other brother to quit going to meetings. For years I always thought my dad was one of the good elders and while he largely was he clearly made mistakes that I didnt even find out about until recently.

8021379,0,t3_4p0v4g,While growing up i always know of a time when we would change our message to one of judgement. see below some articles The video just shows what the GB been think of for years. And as far as the instructions that we may receive I feel this has more to do with selling Khall and reducing stuff and closing branch offices more than drinking the koolaid.note I havent yet seen the bunker video or had our convention. w  p.  pars.  Stay Awake and Keep Your Senses  We can expect a similar expansion of our preaching activity now at this climax of the ages. No doubt before the great tribulation is finished we will see the greatest witness to Gods name and kingdom in the history of this world. And while now the witness yet includes the invitation to come to Jehovahs organization for salvation the time no doubt will come when the message takes on a harder tone like a great war cry. Revelation  shows that a great hail with every stone about the weight of a talent nearly pounds descended out of heaven upon the men and the men blasphemed God due to the plague of hail because the plague of it was unusually great. Hailstones are frozen hardened water. So this pictures how at the end Jehovahs judgment message sent down upon disobedient mankind will be like a barrage of hardhitting hail. The fact that the plague of hailstones is spoken of as being unusually great suggests that at the very end there will be a hard proclamation of Jehovahs day of vengeance by Jehovahs servants. w  p.  Questions From Readers What then did the words of The Watchtower as quoted by this questioner mean? Why that as long as there are persons attached to this present wicked system of things we will preach about the kingdom of God and declare his vengeance. We will let whatever men and organizations that remain after the fall of Christendoms religions know that Jehovahs battle of Armageddon has started and that his vengeance will reach out to consume all of Satans world climaxing in the abyssing of Satan himself. Ezekiel declared Gods vengeance against heathen nations after he had foretold the divine wrath against Jerusalem. ,exjw,d4hofrm,2,t5_2qp5l

Turn the tables change the dynamic make her put up or shut up.To be honest it sounds to me like your wife wishes to cast you in an abusive light and you unfortunately are afraid to call her bluff.As long as she can cast herself in this drama as a put upon victim she can have her cake no responsibilities that go with being an active Witness and eat it too she gets to be worldly celebrate holidays have some normalcy.She gets to feel less guilty about not fully participating you get to constantly be the bad guy and so she wins.If it were me Id do something maybe get counseling or something to bring all of this to a head.

But if you absorb it say through your skin in the form of an underarm deodorant there are some studies linking aluminum to neurodegenerative disorders including alzheimers.I dont trust Dr. Mercola on everything but i tend to believe him on this one Personally I switched away from deodorants from stick deodorant to straight baking soda it works amazingly well in case youre wondering.

8190145,0,t1_d51b5v4,Yes but what I said is a good point to start from. Show them how their logic is reversed. Its not about showing as much WTS dirty laundry per sitting as possible its about provoking critical thought. Things like the UN affiliation and ARC hearings can be dismissed in a blink of an eye by we dont know who made these things and put them on Internet you know whos internet it is winkwink. Its all emotional not factual. So to deprogram you need to work on emotions not on facts and logic.For example ask Just hypotheticallyif WTS is just another false religion next to Mormons Adventists and Baptists and if the reality was that you have been deceived just as their followers what would it take to admit this to yourself and others? What would it mean emotionally how would it affect your life from that day on how would you look into the eye of your friends family relatives and colleagues? How would it affect your self image self esteem and dignity? How would you feel then looking back at your life and assessing your success and accomplishments?You may be cleaver of course and negotiate an exchange. You give them some laundry list and in exchange you get them to answer a laundry list of questions similar to my example. As you may notice they are really all one and the same question asked in different contexts. Thats because they are not actually questions they are not asked with the goal of receiving an answer they are asked with the goal of making the answerer think. Of course the answerer needs not to realize this. This is a simple example of psychotherapy google Socratic Method and study further if youre interested and want to try.,exjw,d51bilv,2,t5_2qp5l

8196627,0,t1_d523k9g,gtyour comment smacked of JW ApologistPlease elaborate I am honestly unsure of where you are getting that from.Jehovahs Witnesses have a tendency to come into the subreddit and visit other places on the internet such as other subreddits or youtube for example and pretend not to be Jehovahs Witnesses. Theyll claim to be nonwitnesses and then proceed to argue with exjws using very JWspecific apologetics. After a while whenever someone argues with a exjw now I cant speak for everyone but I tend to assume its a JW in disguise. The reason they do this is that they like to give the impression that nonwitnesses agree with them because theyre under the impression that this might make other actual nonwitnesses become interested in the religion among other reasons.So even though I was clearly wrong in your case I assumed you were a JW. As youll note from my response to you I wasnt tearing you down. I was simply saying assuming you were a JW that you would have little room to speak against accepting advice from exjws  strangers on reddit when your entire life is based off of following seven strange old men in New York.gtEven the one about how ironic it is that this sub is anticult but acts a whole lot like a cult?Please elaborate.

8223256,0,t3_4rxknb,Backseatdevil I agree with you.What the JW elders and the WT org is doing in relation to child sex abuse is producing collecting and distributing child sex abuse material.The elders produce child sex material by writing down details and discussing those details. Those notes are collected and stored...and distributed to other men in the organization.The WTS can spin it whatever way they like but the bottom line is that they have a tidy little method of collecting child sex abuse stories and storing those stories. The WTS collects child porn stories. And they get the JW elders to collect the stories for them.Not only does the WTS have a huge collection of historical child sex abuse material at their disposal but they have managed to pull it off as religious practice. So far.I am with you on this one Backseatdevil. I think that the WTS should be prosecuted for the production distribution and collection of child sex abuse material.Maybe the victims who are taking the WTS to court should demand the release of those illegal sex abuse stories that the WTS is holding onto. Maybe the lawyers of victims should consider taking a slightly different approach when requesting documents  demand the documents on the grounds of those documents being illegally produced under child protection laws. I know that if I were a victim it would creep me out to no end that the WTS was holding onto any details whatsoever about me and we know that the elders collect as many salacious details as they are able to. They talk about it write it down and distribute those details. New York keeps track of all of itHeh...as far as I am concerned the documents that the WTS is holding so tightly should be able to be seized under child porn laws. The FBI or Interpol should be able to just simply waltz in there and take them  if those files were considered to be child sex abuse material.,exjw,d55gol2,2,t5_2qp5l

8228047,0,t1_d55z334,I have thought about this and come to almost the same conclusion.  The organization as we have known it has already undergone radical changes and within the next few years will no longer exist.  They will no longer be a religion but rather an oline religious organization with their new brand being JW.org.  JW in effect retains the Jehovahs Witnesses label so there will always be a connection to that name.  Thus the rank and file will go along with the gradual ascendancy of the JW.org badge.   As they continue to shift away from printing literature to online videos electronic media etc there will be less and less need for volunteer workers and staff at head quarters.  As we know this reduction has already begun.   Looking at videos of the project in Warwick suggests to me that this place is being developed as comfortable retirement community for members of the governing body long time Bethel staff the socalled helpers of the GB high profile Bethelites so long time COs and DOs with the right connections.  Perhaps some members of the WT Corporation directors who have been heavy contributors.  Think too of WT lawyers doctors an other  professionals who have been willing to sacrifice their worldly careers to serve the interests of WT.   These ones are going to make sure they get theirs.   Guys in the legal department and others involved in WT finances I think are probably already manuevering WT funds to make sure there is enough money to take care of themselves for the rest of there lives.  Thus we see the sale of WT properties so as to accumulate enough to care for their needs and comforts.  As for the local congregations there will be a gradual decline in the number of Kingdom Halls as they will be sold off with the proceeds going to the Society.  More and more congregations will be combined even if it means the people will have to travel longer distances to attend meetings.  From what I understand this is already happening in some areas.  The Society will have no concern for inconveniencing people.  They will not be concerned with the resultant decline in meeting attendance.  Their primary concern will be their own comfort and survival.  Over time  the rank and file will be regarded and will regard themselves not as members of the Jehovahs Witnesses but as affiliates of JW.org.   The relationship will be similar to the relationship of the members  of Scientology with their organzation.   ,exjw,d5628wz,2,t5_2qp5l

You have Eshbaal in Chronicles meaning Man of Baal but in Samuel he is called Ishbosheth where baal is replaced by bosheth which means shame or shameful thing. Gideon gets the name Jerubaal in Judges but the name in Samuel is Jerubbesheth. Also Mephibosheth for Meribbaal again Samuel uses bosheth where Chronicles uses baal.My take was that whoever wrote Samuel really hated the name Baal but Baal worship was actually quite commonplace in Israel at least until the reign of Josiah.

The intent is to ask some of those questions embarrass them out them.The idea is to provoke thought.The idea is to have a list in front of oneself to disrupt what Ill charitably refer to as their tunnel vision.  The idea is also very much to instill a sense of self confidence and appraisal in anyone subjected to a JC with  a solid reminder of the intellect lack thereof of the men sitting across the table from them  in a legitimate way.Ive tried to create a spectrum of questions with some rising relative to others depending on what the topic of the JC might be. People who are still in or only just embarking upon being mentally out still typically carry a strong sense that these elders possess some legitimate authority or qualifications or expertise. They dont.These are goons off the street more often than not and they need to be treated that way going in to a Judicial Committee. So yes the object of this exercise is to intimidate embarrass and humiliate elders present at a Judicial Committee  by asking them perfectly legitimate questions and thus make the process as painful for them as humanly possible.Whether they answer any or all of them is largely irrelevant.,exjw,d584vw2,2,t5_2qp5l

8289605,0,t3_4t0ms5,Similar to my post to GG I think some of your feeling of no energy boredom is feeling trapped in a situation with too few positives with too many pressuresresponsibilities. IMO noticing little everyday victories is necessary when one has the downer from a physical problem I learned this from my late father who died quite unexpectedly putting me into a highrisk category. I am alive today so there is the chance to enjoy life for another day  I need to savor for him as well because he had far too few days.Talk with your husband to try to fix the money situation. His getting a job would help  is there anything he can do to increase the chances of getting a job but even knowing that he focuses on it for X hours each week day will give you hope that he will find something. Spending less money will help with the paychecktopaycheck  so where can you economize? Food is one possibility starting with eating out less and switching to less expensive foods  hopefully you can do better than Ramen noodles e.g. beans and rice but even a couple of cheaper meals a week would free up a few  to put in savings. It is a team thing and it often helps to ask the other person for ideas on his approach to solve the overall problem.I am a fan of moderate exercise for boosting my energy level and mood. Some walking is one of the simplest ways to start. Getting a little sunlight in the morning also helps me sleep a bit better as does exercise  hours before bedtime.Geographically  do you want to relocate? Maybe if you can save enough money on expenses you can afford to. Maybe just if your husband can find a job elsewhere you can afford it.Relationships  decide if you are going to relocate before putting in too much time trying to make social ties. Meetup is one way to find activities to do and lets you at least talk to other people.Job  also after a possible relocation. I think many people resent that having to work to keep the money coming in. I have not been able to do this but I know I should be using some of my free or bored time to improve my skills for work. Perhaps pick a job and start a list of skills you need to add and then start learning  of them.

People seeing their god perform miracles with no question at all that that was happening and still worshipping false gods OR people taking coincidences and elevating them to miracle status? Dont we see that all the time today? With people saying I prayed to god to find a job that pays  and got a job that paid exactly that amount! Its a miracle while a child is repeatedly raped by her father? I think the answer is that its a coincidence elevated to the status of miracle.,exjw,d5jygb7,1,t5_2qp5l

For a minute I found myself playing with the idea of having my wife carry lit to do informal witnessing when out shopping. Whut thu? It is a cult. They have mastered the art of conducting people into it. I had to let my wife know I thought as much when she insisted I should agree to study with the bro who was stalking me for a study. I told her I wouldnt go to a communist meeting to learn their beliefs why would I do the same with the nonsense i heard at the hall after coming back? She left it alone and now Im right back at square one. At least when I meet witnesses in public they greet me so theres that. But otherwise no. I think it could be dangerous. Steven Hassan mentioned something to this effect in his book Combatting Cult ... that some former cult members feel empowered to go back thinking they are better than that and get sucked  in again.

A soldier began to act strangely and as time past his behaviour became weirder and weirder until  ultimately he wouldnt walk anywhere but instead hed ride an imaginary bike everywhere he went. The Units Medical Officer refered him to an Army psychiatrist and after repeated assessments it was agreed that he was no longer mentally fit to remain serving and that he would be given a P Psychiatric Medical discharge.He was duely summoned to the Commanding Officers office. He rode in on his bike stopped got off and lent it against the COs desk and than stood to attention and saluted. The CO explained that he had been medically discharged with immediate effect and handed him his discharge papers.The soldier took them and thanked his CO. After checking the documents he asked if was now free to leave and after the CO said that he was he saluted for the last time turned and began to march out. The CO called out and reminded him that hed left his bike.From the door the grinning now ex soldier turned and said you keep it. I dont need it any moreSorry it was so long!,exjw,d5qossd,3,t5_2qp5l

In the end  years of institutional living was enough. I wouldnt say it set me back in any great way. Had I stayed home Id probably have been stuck doing cleaning work and pioneering. I hated field service so Bethel was a great way to get out of that  The small bit of experience I had was enough to get put into a department where I learned a lot more.

8512582,0,t3_4w8tle,OKAY. WOW THEREs some interesting advice here to say the least. FIRST THING is SELF confidence and self ESTEEM. NOTE they will not Physically drag you to the meeting! YOU HAVE THE POWER HERE! And as far as the law is concerned? The CANNOT indoctrinate you because you are a minor! Thats like saying I can beat someone if they are my wife! As soon as you are able to be competent and know what your actions are and the consequences and form argument then you are fine in the eyes of the law. No one told you this and you never saw it so it may be hard to believe or fully comprehend but YES you have control here look at how children were able to divorce their parents and decide medical treatment for themselves. ALSO YOU CAN MOVE OUT WAY SOONER EASILY AT  LESS EASILY BUT VERY POSSIBLE NOW.This is important. Know that to the outside world this is WRONG AND to the JWs it is wrong ALSO how? Because they are on the record saying many times that that they dont force their children to become JWs. SEE taze.co article AND IMPORTANT JW article Your parents are reading Start to underline where they say things like Be careful not to force your views on your adolescent. Instead help him develop his own convictions. and point out that when they say  they realize that when a child becomes an adult he or she will make a personal choice with regard to worship. that in bible times you were an adult quite young being able to marry at puberty etc and emphasis that you have come to your OWN conclusion and you have build confidence in his faith. your faith of atheism. If they say was it someone at school or influence from a friend explain how that YOU are a much stronger influence going to church twice a week for your entire life as well as witnessing and study and that you understand their doctrinebeliefs VERY VERY well and you have had not nearly as much exposure with atheism and all ready it is MUCH more convincing to you than this faith.If they try to draw you on do you think it was evolution I say something like for all I know and you can prove God was an alien but weather or not I call this Alien God and then start worshiping it and shaping my life around it is a different story.Handling the Elders Okay so your going to face them one thing this whole ordeal has taught me was GUTS. Go in with GUTS.When talking with them listen to their words and make your replys simple. Ask to speak to them alone or one on one if you can get away with it. Basically once they finish speaking ask them do Jehovahs witnesses force their beliefs on others? they will respond with some scripture. Dont follow along with it dont open your bible or read from the elders instead look at the one you asked the question pick an elder to talk to mainly. Okay once thats done Ask him. YES OR NO do Jehovahs witnesses force others to become JWs YN. If he still fumbles say Im being frank with you and I need just a yes or no.If he says Yes you have a moral victory and can walk out there job done they will concede. Dont try more than  times to get a straight answer from them just move on. You might get we follow what the bible teaches and say Well what is that a Yes or a no? but no more than  times ask the same question can come back to it laterDont get drawn into evolution or the origin of the universe blah blah blah or the HUGE doctrine failures by the JWs thats their ground wait until your older. TELL them dont ask that the law says you can decide your religion at any age so long as your mentally competent even if its not right remember your talking to a window washer or salesmen as the smartest not a lawyer just keep saying it until its true they might default to well the bible says an adult is  or whatever number they pulled out of their ass ask them do the JWs force people to follow their religion everything they say lie were not forcing you to believe anything but you must come with your parents say would you condone or support a JW who knows in their heart they are a JW but under  for  or  being forced to a catholic church by a parent? Say you remember a watchtower article awake artile or new year article about someone who had that experience and it was condoned.If there is a LOADED question you dont want to answer you CAN say I dont want to discuss that or Thats a personal question or I do not wish to answer at this time or to REALLY shut them down say No comment believe me it works! Like well then do you believe that we came about because of evolution or that We evolved from moneys? you can say no comment or I dont know thats a in depth personal question I dont currently wish to answer at this current time because I have not yet made up my mind then they will refer you to a book or a magazine or read another scripture. Remind them you know the doctrine well and have been to every meeting witnessing ETC and you know their beliefs but it comes down to honestly I do not believe that or I cannot in good conscience support or go along with something I do not believe OR to REALLY shut them down I cannot in good conscience support or go along with something I do not believe in nor forsee believing knowing its information full well. Avoid using words you picked up on Reddit or JW survey because they might ignore you believing you were influenced somehow. Make sure you say its nothing personal just Philisophical differences and I hope we can look past it and continue to associate which is a lie when you leave the JWs you see how creepy the elders really are on SO many levels Like how you even have to have this PERSONAL inquisition at .When you walk out your parents probably expect you to be cured some how like thats all was needed.Tell them nothing has changed you are still an atheist after listening to them or to REALLY shut them down I listened to them and they listened to me and after having a theological discussion I was no more moved into believing in a God and that now you are probably more atheistic because they were unable to prove to me without multiple doubts of their beliefs yet alone the existence of a God.TELL THEM that the elders said you should not force you to go to the meetings or out witnessingTELL THEM that you will be lying by going out witnessing or to the meetings. Make sure they understand you understand their doctrine dont have to go in detail but say I have been to every meeting assembly CO Visit as they did and you came to different conclusions and thats ok because the world is a big place and we are all permitted to having more than one belief and no one can force you to believe something you honestly do not agree with.Other things like not participating in prayers saying happy birthday to people publicly at school on FB or in person is great will help you make a stand. If it is safe for you to do so make a stand as early as possible. Dont make all your friends JWs dont court girls in the JWs I know at  they keep a tight lid on it but still. As well boys is different look at doing University! Seriously make it your plan!Do NOT engage in family worship BOOKS ARE GREAT if your family ban laptopinternet during those times to punish you. BIG BOOKSread books in that time. If they talk about JW stuff dont engage leave or whatever change the subject. If someone messages you about your happy b day FB post tell them with all due respect keep your principals to yourself that really shuts them down or thanks but I dont think the all powerful creator of the universe could careless about weather or not I congratulate a friend for becoming one year older.Please dont let this be a big depressing issue trust me theres light at the end of the tunnel its all about learning to not engage them and only speak in yes or nos and keep moving forward.PM Me if you want to chat more would love to hear from you,exjw,d65mpcf,2,t5_2qp5l

8521360,0,t1_d66i1xu,As Ive repeatedly said Im not looking to isolate myself or anyone else. However Im also not looking to debate atheists every time I make a new post and this thread stands as a pretty good example of how that goes. The slightest hint that one believes in God brings a wave of demands for debate and evidence. I interact with rexjw in ways that are common to all exjws. I prefer to avoid the controversial topics. Actually before I considered starting a new subreddit I thought of suggesting that this sub should change its name to atheistexjws. That certainly seems to be the dominant feature here and any hint of religious faith is met with hostility. I read threads that otherwise interest me only to see totally gratuitous potshots at religion as if religion was a monolithic whole. I dared to post a link to my web site which my wife and I have worked extensively to refurbish over the last few months and get met with nastiness and snark. So I hid that post and decided to try creating a separate subreddit that would be free of such things. Im not sure what the big deal is that everyone is getting so exercised about anyway. I must subscribe to  or  different subreddits. Whats the big deal in having one more? It almost seems like the atheists here are afraid of having their arguments taken away but I dont think that will be the case. Christians who enjoy that sort of thing will still come looking for it. Those of us who are tired of the same old new atheist arguments will have a place to go to talk with each other. ,exjw,d66qbue,1,t5_2qp5l

8548330,0,t3_4wur9w,I dont know if you shared with her one of the latest magazines that details valid reasons for sparation.gtgtAugust  Watchtower. What are valid reasons for separation? Separation might at times be justified. Willful nonsupport extreme physical abuse and the absolute endangerment of ones spiritual life are exceptional situations that some have viewed as reasons for separation. Christian marriage mates who have serious problems should seek help from the elders. These experienced brothers can assist married couples to apply the counsel of Gods Word. In resolving marital problems we should also pray for Jehovahs spirit and his help in applying Bible principles and displaying the fruitage of his spirit.Gal.  .gtgtIt mentions extreme abuse as being a valid reason for separation.  Why does it have to be extreme why is any abuse acceptable?  Who gets to determine what extreme abuse is?They say that those having serious marriage problems should seek the help of Elders.  This has the potential of being very bad advice.  Many women experiencing extreme abuse are often threatened with life threatening violence if they talk to anyone about their abuse.

Or people who got on the list because their partner with whom they had sex last night regretted it so now theyre rapists.There is no evidence whatsoever that public sex offender registries make the world a safer place and it hooks into the stranger danger myth. In fact when an offender is publicly named and shamed they are in fact more likely to reoffend Whats more it gives rise to vigilantism which is the direct antithesis of concepts like due process.There are a lot of problems with public sex offender registries just like with the death penalty which is why the US is the only country in the world with public sex offender registries.,exjw,d6br55g,2,t5_2qp5l

I do hope though that people become more aware of what the heck is going on and that yes there is a risk. Making a child molester go out on service is like handing him or her access to children on a silver platter. It sickens me.

It was his choice to take it not mine and I cant judge him for it.If I was molested the first thing I would do is immediately call . Not talk to JWs.

Though I honestly find it stupid to NOT report to the police.I always try to have an open mind in any matter. Saying that one person died BECAUSE HE WAS A JW because he refused to take a blood transfusion is plain wrong. God has given everyone free will to take their own choices.

There was remarkable evidence that people with shorter attention spans and cognitive dissonance tend to ignore the butterfly effects of their behavior especially when God is used for the blessings and Satan for the evils.So we create our own problems while constantly avoiding accountability for them.So atheism attests to this there is not enough evidence... and the people who have faith tend to not demonstrate any displays of God.

When I told my parents I was leaving I told them I am now an atheist and therefore dont believe in religion anymore which was true. I didnt tell them that I was gay they only found out  years later because I didnt want them to think that if I were straight everything would be fine and I would still remain in.

9039863,0,t3_5420m5,Im sure there is some wishful thinking on my part but I like to think that  years a JW was a net positive.. I got out of Vietnam War so I didnt die.. I lived through the s and didnt get a venereal disease.. I could not go to college so was forced to become entrepreneurial and probably made more money and had more fun than if I was tracked into a corporate job.. Once I discovered sales I found that talking someone into parting with their money was a lot easier than getting them to join a cult.. I am extremely skeptical since I was badly fooled once so I believe I am less likely than most to be taken in by a good pitch of any kind.. Conducting bible studies taught me that teaching can be fun.. Ministry school talks taught me that speaking in public was doable and could even be fun.Did I lose a lot of course I did. That list includes  years plus another  years married to an uberdub and raising two children that way plus  years dealing with an almost yearold woman who lost  years of her life. I lost my mother and father but they are such hardasses that may have happened anyway. I also learned some shit along the way. LikeNo one has a perfect childhood and family. My wife makes fun of me because we are having fun watching the Gilmore Girls. That is fiction which makes it entertainment. Real life for just about everyone has a lot less snappy dialog. I can choose to obsess over the things I lost or be thankful for the advantages I had.I have found that everyone is worrying about themselves. Do they look smart or stupid or rich or poor or pretty enough or thin enough?  I found that it is easy to be sociable just start the conversation and lead it to be about them. If you are the only one in the room that cares more about what the other person is saying than about how you appear to others you will be their king. Or president read about Bill ClintonI have found that luck plays a much larger part in everyones life than we want to admit. Some people do everything right and their life turns to shit. Other people are stupid asses and everything they touch turns to gold. All we can do is play the odds. Is it hard yes it is? I force myself to talk to people that intimidate me. I force myself to be in new situations as often as possible. Im  and I have spend the whole summer on my own dime flying around the country interviewing for a position that pays less than one tenth what Im currently making just to follow this advice.I force myself to at least try many of the new gadgets apps and websites and even read Reddit.But there is no big brother watching out for you or judging you.

9163882,0,t3_55tntn,This is what happened to my husbands mother and father. His mom became a witness and his dad was opposed to it. It broke up their marriage with  children. The oldest never took to the religion and eventually moved in with dad. The other  became Witnesses baptized as teens. They defended their mom because all her family and her ex in laws were as they saw it mean to their mom. As they got older both eventually left the religion one disfellowshipped. This religion can definitely tear families apart.       Your girlfriend and her family NEED to research and educate themselves about this religion specifically and other cults. It is absolutely necessary that they do NOT attack it!Doing that will only make her dig in her heals even deeper she is told that Satan is going to challenge her faith and love for Jehovah she will see any attack from your family as that There is a website called jwfacts.com that will really help them understand the history and present beliefs of the witnesses. It is a must read for anyone trying to help her. Also a book called Combatting Cult Mind Control by Steven Hassan. Do these things first and tell her husband too especially.

There was an appeal that dropped the amount significantly and the Conti herself relieved the  from the defendant as long as he never appeared in court again in relation to this trial along with a few other things like never speaking to herher family and others. In the end WT owed her around  million. However with the article in the WT talking about how Jehovah blesses his organization in human court the original amounts owed are still relevant.

9273290,0,t3_57efc0,Sadly the truth is that until you resolve your inner conflicts you may not be able to attach in a healthy way to anyone nor have the satisfying relationship you want.  You have to decide whether your relationship with your parents the JW religion and cultural values are going to influence what you do for the rest of your life.  Your authentic self is already at odds with all of those things as you express your sexual identity yet you have the strength to know that was the one thing that I couldnt give up.  You may have to be prepared to give up more...Now may not be the time to connect with someone else and drag your little red wagon of issues up to their front door.  Take the time to give yourself the gift of healing and identify the life you want going forward first. Becoming clear in your mind being independent creating the value system that matches who you are not necessarily the one that is chosen for you by the parents and culture you were born to is what makes you a mature adult ready to engage in a satisfying connection with someone else.  Until you are clear about those things you are not ready to be in a loving relationship because you might victimize and maybe even abuse others because of your pain.

9287576,0,t3_57i9uy,Hello! I am in many ways in the same boat as you. I felt wrong and bad my whole life. I was never a kid that actually did anything though. Just because things didnt add up or I had questions.. I also wanted so badly to just be normal and of course just plain was not and could not be. Noone really knows yet. We are in a terrible situation because we were always warned about the love if the greater number cooling off and a that... For a long time I thought that is what this is. There is something wrong with me. I dont have enough faith... But no there is just too much to argue with. For me a big help is to keep in mind that even though its all bullcrap our families and everyone really genuinely think they are doing whats right and raised us the best way and all that. Thats what helps me not feel too bitter toward my parents for things like how I wanted to go to college and couldnt and so many other things. The thing to keep in mind now is how many options you really do have. Now that we are not going to live forever as we thought there are so many things to do and experience... I cant speak for the issues of people knowing because I myself am still struggling with this and I fear will be for quite sometime. But as I am realizing I dont enjoy being around these people I once loved. They dont want to talk about the things I do. They dont want to do the things I do... Find some safe outlets and try some things. For me something as simple as going shopping with a work friend I like was somewhat stressful because I was worried she may post on Facebook and raise questions... But I went. It was fun. Nothing bad happened and we have been hanging out more... Thats just one small thing but the point is male some of your own decisions. Start small. See where it goes. For me it is becoming much less important what these people who used to be important to me think. Once you decide what place they jave in your future it becomes much easier to decide what place they have in your present. Its rough but baby steps and you do have a big huge group of people who understand. If youre so scared if people finding out just be careful how detailed you get with your comments and at least this can be your outlet for now...,exjw,d8t9mkd,2,t5_2qp5l

9339742,0,t1_d8zure1,Sorry for my double post its my first time posting on reddit and Im still getting used to the karma.Neil deGrasse Tyson said The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.   What he means is that current observations and truths about nature and science are counterintuitive and mind boggling. Take quantum mechanics.  Ive studied quantum mechanics and could not get passed the fact that we dont actually know where any subatomic particles are located at a given time. We rather extrapolate their location based on probability. The craziest thing to me is that we can influence a particles behavior by simply measuring and observing it. What we know about the universe is only a fraction of what there is. While not backed by proof it would be unreasonable to exclude a creator in another realm of existence simply because our knowledge is so incomplete.

9346945,0,t3_58gmxl,Im not a parent but my EXJW dad admitted that he was just as brainwashed and closedminded as a usual JW parent.When I was about  I started to get addicted to magic tricks. I would perform in parties gettogethers dinners etc. and got really good at it that some of my tricks seemed really impossible mind reading close up magic levitation etc. and there are older Jdubs who were just so mindblown by my tricks that they thought I was being possessed by demons and I kind of started to scare them.Fast forward to after I got baptized at the age of  my dad and I were called by the elders after a meeting first meeting after the assembly where I got baptized. They counseled me about doing magic tricks and how I have to be careful not to stumble anyone because even though those are just tricks some fuckin dumb Jdubs get stumbled and think that its demonic. LIKE FFS. IM A yo KID WHO HAPPENED TO ENJOY PERFORMING TRICKS. Only stupid fuckin people would think that I am possessed by Satan and sold my soul to demons to be able to perform those tricks. The elders showed us some articles that they researched about. They had a hard copy of a magazine from the s or s that talked about magic tricks. So yeah. My dad did his best to defend me. But it wasnt a pleasant night for me as I just got baptized and I already got a counsel from the elders. I think that they were just waiting for me to get baptized because they couldnt really do it before I got baptized because Id still be free to leave and might do just that.After that talk we went home. My dad asked me to take out all my magic paraphernalia. Books cards gimmicks etc. all the stuff that I used for magic tricks. I spent my allowance buying those things and I spent time creating those DIY magic gimmicks. Him being disappointed and somehow annoyed that he had to face the elders because of me decided to destroy everything. Cut all my cards threw my books away my gimmicks. Everyfuckingthing. There I am depressed that all the hours I spent and all the lunch I didnt eat just to afford those things are gone.I couldnt blame my dad though. He thought he was doing the right thing. But I wont forget that night. One of the saddest moment of my teenage years.Also another experience this happened not so long ago. He read a conversation in my inbox in Facebook I forgot to turn off my laptop before leaving for school. And you know JW parents love to pry on their kids private stuff and found out that I was having sexual relationship with this a JW girl from another congregation we were both teenagers. So yeah. I had to confess to the elders and tell them the details. I got reproved.I asked my dad about that incident again and he told me that if that happened now that hes awake hed just tell me to not impregnate her. LOLSo yeah.

9487717,0,t3_5apcr4,Hello! Personally this is my one struggle left in my own separation from the society. My parents are older and unhealthy and I honestly think it will not just devastate them emotionally to hear what I think bit I feel it will most likely contribute to their health issues... For me I have decided it is a part of the way they need to be loved by me as their child. I dont think they can handle it. My fear is if I said what I really think that my dad would have a heart attack or something. My mothers illness is terminal and partially caused by stress so you can see why I dont feel I can add to it... I did try to tell my dad once when I was . He started crying alot and asked me how he was supposed to look forward to paradise without me.I realized then that I wasnt ready for them to probably ever know whats truly in my head. I am now almost ... so here I am move out married and faded... they know I hardly go and eventually I will have them know or they may find out from a mutual friend or something that I actually never go now... As much as I oppose the teachings I know that they are older and have dedicated their lives to the organization. I dont want to be any part of waking them up. I feel that as they are so unhealthy and older they need their hole more than ever. I also know my father would feel stupid for how much better he could have done in his career etc.Im still young and can do whatever I want. They are retirement age and it is just not the same for them. So I respect that they believe these things. I actually think they need it. And I appreciate that their congregation looks over them and is a support group for them. They truly worry about me and my sister told me they cry all the time and dont know what to do... I feel terrible about that but this is the best balance I can find.Ill never tell them I actually oppose any of it. I dont see what anyone has to gain by that. I dont want to be seem as their selfish apostate daughter when this is he time they need help. I go visit as much as a can and help them wih whatever I can. I make sure they know I am a good daughter and that I am a happy good person. I do some things the society says no to but why tell them that? I feel many get to grow up and become friends woth their parents. I will always just be their childnot their friend. Im fine with that. Thats all they are able to give me. They were great parents and did the best they could. They truly think raising me as a witness was the best life they could provide for me and in many ways it was. But it isnt what I want now. Remember fading basically equals being lazy or low on faith. It is forgivable by most even hardcore witnesses. But if they know you actually oppose Jehovah well that is another story. There are more articles than ever to cut those people off. Whatever happens just try ti remember where they are coming from. They truly believe you will die and are worried. Remember what my dad said. They see this as you makimg a decision to go against your family and Jehovah. As my mother says you are either with Jehovah or you are against him. They see no middle ground. You cant blame them for it. We changed. Not them. So sorry its so long. I hope something in here helps even a little bit. ,exjw,d9ikbet,1,t5_2qp5l

That said in the past when discussing things with the congregations resident code breaker I always stuck with Deuteronomy  Luke  and relevant Watchtowers like the yellow   generation one.You dont have to MAKE him believe just to ward him off. Anything and I mean anything he says isnt a good enough reason. When he drops it Proverbs  to you isnt telling you that an organisation in the st century would get revealing of scriptural truths.If he proceeds to carry on bible bashing stick with either  Yeah? Well now it sounds like either the Bible or you are contradicting what we read earlier... as in Deut  and Luke  or Well that may be enough in your eyes to break bible principles but I hold all of it to be true and God clearly states something here which to me The Watchtower is guilty of.Another beauty is to talk about the child abuse scandal. Im  and can remember handing the Awake out when younger with Watching the World sections. Every other Awake had an article or quote regarding the Catholics and the disgusting nature of this false religion. Time again it would bang on about court cases. So I turn it back. If those courts were good enough for us to listen to the convictions and prove we had a false religion how come the same courts are doing exactly the same to Watchtower yet this is Satanic attack??This one elder who supposedly could answer everything shook his head and sighed when I said  So youre telling me that Jesus took the reigns in  watched what started to occur in the s and s and allowed it to continue till present day where Gods name would be brought in to disrepute and thousands of children would bear mental scars for the res their life?

9634782,0,t1_da0mnh8,She doesnt have questions. She doesnt question what they do and say she doesnt read the articles she doesnt read the Bible nor watch the videos. When I questioned her about the doubts she mentioned it was a very vague how could god allow suffering and then a quick change of subject. If I talk less she doesnt talk more she talks about something else. If I ask a question she diverts to a subject that doesnt feel like a conflict or confrontation. I hope Im not coming off as testy but the implication that all I do is talk over her and dont allow her to express herself is the opposite of the problem. Im trying to find the right questions and ask them at the right time and although Ive done it the wrong way many times Ive also done it casually or calmly or just tried to bring up a point of interest directly related to the conversation that I hope will stir more discussion. It rarely if ever does and if it verges slightly on the controversial she moves away from it subtly or overtly. She has deep thoughts and interesting perspectives on a myriad of subjects but when it comes to religion and even the Bible its completely superficial. Shes not doctrinally minded nor particularly interested in the minutia of biblical prophecy and the same reason she lost interest in preaching and giving talks is the same reason for her ambivalence to the dogma. She just wants to go to every meeting because we have to and not question that. She sits through these assemblies no matter how extreme they get and waits and waits and waits and finds the one positive thing to say about it and as far as I can tell ignores everything negative. If I bring up something the brother said or make a direct reference like how could someone gay be attracted to our faith when he framed his point like this?... she says honestly or dishonestly I cant tell I didnt hear that part. To the extent that my communication style is making her unable to open up my post is all about taking responsibility for that and expressing to this sub how frustrating it can be to hold it all in until you burst in a regrettable way. I take your advice very seriously to talk less and listen more. But the source of my frustration is when I employ questions and listen I get silence or Ill think about it and tell you more if I can think of what to say which never comes...If Im continuing to talk without hearing the point youre trying to make I apologize and will reread.

To anyone whos a JW it looked like a Kingdom Hall. The one snag and what made it propaganda was that the people were wearing first century clothing basically robes. I explained to my daughter yesterday that the entire thing was a lie. In that time there was no public education only the rich could read for the most part there were no printing presses so every document would have been expensive and no one met in a designated building for worship the Romans would have set in on fire and simply put everyone to the sword who attempted to run out of it.

9788889,0,t1_dajmqf7,Right. Which is crazy.I should have been more clear in that I was speaking of crimes in general with a specific eye to murder since thats what the commenter was writing about and that in order to be required to report a crime it has to be specially written into the code which goes to your point. Mandated by you in certain circumstances but not in others so the default is nonreporting which I think in itself is a crime if child abuse goes unreported by onlookers. Children and old people are among our most vulnerable citizens and should definitely be protected as a community obligation.  Findlaw states that gtUnder Texas law for example you can be charged with a Class A misdemeanor for failing to report an offense that resulted in serious bodily injury or death.

10048354,0,t3_5jc9ou,There was an elder in my congregation who had several issues.  His father was an elder and he was appointed an elder at ish years old. He always seemed interested in the younger crowd often hanging out with teens outside of the hall. In one particular situation things got hairy. This elder who well call Derick was studying with an unbaptized teen in the hall well call him James.  Derick got very close to James not in a weird way they would just hang out a lot and often go out in service together  I think James genuinely put a lot of trust in Derick.  Fast forward a few months and a new brother Bobby moves into out congregation.  Now Bobby and James hit it off and they become good friends.  So much so that Derick got jealous very jealous. Things went down hill fast.  Derick would slander James and Bobby just about every chance he got.  At one point Derick took down and reuploaded pictures of him and James on Facebook with the faces blacked out.   Things escalated... Derick requested a meeting James in the back room after the meeting. Derick was upset over many things. So much so that he grabbed James by the neck and chocked him. James was able to escape ran out and sought the elders. Derick was removed as elder soon after. He was fucked up. ,exjw,dbhbr42,1,t5_2qp5l

JWs are awful BECAUSE they dont cherry pick from the Bible and try to adhere to it as closely as possible.  And back to the serena topic you obviously dont understand the term advocate the same way I do.  Merely being a member of an organization and failing to murmur against it is not advocating.  Think of it this way  I can be an employee of a company.  I can chose not to say bad things about the company.  But that doesnt mean Im an ADVOCATE FOR the company.  Advocating by definition requires actively supporting and encouraging others to pursue a particular belief or position.   I think we will not see eye to eye on this.

I had a second grade teacher who really apparently didnt like me. In retrospect piecing together little things I think she really didnt like the JWs didnt like that my parents had laid out the requirements of their faith to her and that those negative impressions transferred to me. I wanted to like her and do well in her class but the hostility made it a really regrettable year. So the one thing that an understanding nonJW can do is just let the kids know that they are valued and cared for. Theyre being told that worldly people dont like JWs. That worldly people are hostile selfish and pretty much every negative thing ever.One of the most subtly transformative events in my teenage life was going to a concert by myself and coming to realize that everyone there was friendly and not horrible.

What makes you think they will take pause to think about the results of their actions in other areas? We know that there are many elders who are not made of impressive character weve been seeing it first hand thru the many public trials and court cases right now. What are the chances that they will stop to reflect on how discussing something with their wives could hurt someone? Maybe after a few drinks perhaps with their fellow elders at a party?

There will be sheeple like my husband who will continue to believe even if the watchtower is taken down. He is the first to criticize the Catholic Church and Scientology but he doesnt think theres an issue with his own cult. He just left for his mid week meeting. He seemed urgent about making the meeting. Right before he left we had an argument about finances how he thinks were doing well because we get by.  We no longer have any savings. He doesnt seem concerned about savings. I told him I know he believes the end is near that we dont have to save for anything. He didnt try to deny it. This makes me more discouraged and hopeless. Dont know whats happening in the meetings these days but he seems convinced we have only a few more years. If the Watchtower were to be taken down sheeple like my husband will think its just satans system and that paradise is just around the corner. Theres no waking up people like him. Watchtower will survive in another form. Meantime Im having an anxiety attack and dreading him coming home from his meeting because he always acts like more of an asshole afterward.

10308836,0,t3_5ngq6y,Heres my one and only demon story Im not a good story teller but it is a  true personal experience.A few years ago I was doing a return visit on a young spanish guy I left mags with. No big deal.  He barely spoke English so I took a young spanishspeaking pioneer sister with me to interprete. This about  weeks after the initial call.The sister and I went to the call while an elder buddy of mine waited in the car.So we ring the bell and this spanish man answers. I said Were here to see Joseph  He said Who sent you?  I said No one sent us....we just wanted to call back on Joseph because we had left Bible based magazines with him and just wanted to talk further about it something to that effectAgain he says No one sent you?   And again I said No no one sent us! Why do you ask?He says Well Joseph has a spirit and we cant get it out of him...so we called a Catholic priest and hes supposed to be here any minute he must have thought we were from the church because we just happened to show up at that timeThen all of a sudden I see all kinds of ppl in the house relatives I assume coming out of the living room towards us with open Bibles in their hands and loads of crosses etc...really creepy. All this in an attempt to expel the spirit I guess.  By this time the young spanish sister is starting to get really uncomfortable. But in my mind I thought it was really neat. Then they bring out Joseph. He had hardly any clothes on and tons of scratches and cut marks on his body as well as at least  little wooden crosses around his neck put there by the fam I suspect  And he was grunting and growling like a pit bull. The whole time I was thinking cool  demons actually do exist  However the sister with me was becoming even more unglued and started praying audibly to Jehovah and she wanted to get out of there.  They then asked us Can you help us? Do you have power over the spirits?  That put me in a conundrum because as a JW we were taught that yes Jehovah is way more powerful than demons but also we dont perform exorcisms nor do we want to do or say anything which would link us with Babylon the Great  So I didnt know what to do.  Then I decided to leave the call temporarily and go out to my elder buddy and discuss it with him.  So I explained this to the ppl in the house and told them wed be back in a few minutes. So the sister and I went back out to the car to talk about it with elder Syd.  Syds strategy was for all three us us to go back to the house and present scriptures and and the information from p of the BT book How to overcome wicked spirits. So we go to do that but as were approaching the door the man of house comes out before could get there and asks What religion are you guys?  We told him we were JWs. That shut down the whole call right there because he then said Oh forget it! I used to study with  JWs and I know already you dont have power over the spirits...get lost!   So there was nothing we could do. The whole experience bummed me out because here were supposed to have the truth and worship the true God and yet we totally failed in this situation to help Joseph. I blame myself because I couldve done something but I was paralyzed with indecision thanks to WT doctrine.  I wonder how the Catholic priest made out?Anyways  looking back on it who knows what was really going on with Joseph and I dont think about demons or spirits anymore. Ive had enough of that mental baggage. But I just thought it was an unusual field service experience to share. ,exjw,dcck93v,1,t5_2qp5l

10424603,0,t3_5palc6,Glad to have you here! Having been a JW as long as I can remember  years now I can tell you that there are plenty of good bad and ugly things about the religion. As for the good many of the people seem genuinely happy there are lots of smiles and on some level a lot of the activities are fun. You mentioned tithing and JWs have been reminded more and more often lately to contribute more money but theres no mandatory rate. Personally I havent contributed a dime since I woke up last summer but I still attend meetings.The bad and ugly  The churchs treatment of child abuse. As proven by the Australian Royal Commissiona investigation into it church leadership from the top down has fostered an environment wherein child abuse by members of the church is literally never reported to authorities. As you can imagine this results in many repeat offenders and victims who feel marginalized.  Its a disfellowshipping offense to willingly accept a blood transfusion.  The strict way that disfellowshipped ones are treated youre expected to have literally no contact with them including immediate family. We were shown a video this past summer where a mother saw that her daughter was calling her on her cell phone and she didnt take the call. This makes it a very difficult decision for many of us to think of leaving especially when we have lots of family who are in. The perpetual nearness of Armageddon. Witnesses have been told for well over  years that Armageddon is imminent. Bible prophecies have been stretched misapplied and changed to support this teaching. It results in many not educating themselves because the end is so close. Many decisions to better ones life are postponed until its too late believing that the real life is just around the corner.I could go on and on but those are a few of the big ones to me. Since Im still physically in I still see the conditional love from everyone and its a familiar and somewhat fun feeling. But as Ive started to look objectively at what is taught its just completely unsustainable and so much of it is complete nonsense. Anyway Im glad you stopped by! Were always glad to have some support from the exMormon community. I know its a big deal to leave your religion too and I respect you for making that choice. Hopefully things havent been too rough on you. ,exjw,dcpp4l9,8,t5_2qp5l

I dont think anyone that says they want to live forever has truly thought about what forever means. Or maybe you do have to live a few years so you can understand how time speeds up the older you get.I could see a few thousand maybe a million or two years but forever would eventually get beyond boring. Everything would be a chore. Even eating would become more than you could bear. No matter how much variety there is on earth you would eventually run out of things to do. You could count every piece of sand on the earth and guess what? You would have enough time to do that  times over and then  times that etc....Space travel would be nice but eventually you would see every thing there is to see there too. And no matter how awesome it was you would eventually bet sick of it.The only thing that might change things is how long you remember the past. If you only remember a few hundred years then you might be ok because you could start over on a regular basis. Of course if you completely forget the past where does that leave the universal principle we are all supposedly helping to god to settle?,exjw,dd5sv0p,3,t5_2qp5l

Whoever does not have even what they have will be taken from them.  This is why I speak to them in parables Though seeing they do not see though hearing they do not hear or understand.  In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah You will be ever hearing but never understanding you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.

Dont listen to people who think buying rice and pasta in bulk is the Holy Grail of saving .  Overreliance on that shit is probably why most of our ancestors were basically retarded and died at .  All you need are fruit vegetables meat and some dairy.Regularass yogurt is all the calcium and vitamin D you need.  Milk is just going to go bad before you can finish it.  I sprinkle some raw oats on top just for iron.Buy raw chicken breast in bulk.  Open it up and cut every breast in half.  Place the halves in grocery bags and freeze them.  To cook one just quickly thaw it out in warm water in the bag then throw it on the George Foreman grill for  minutes.  Gratuitous use of spices is the key to tricking your mind into thinking that your cooking is tolerable. Theres  of your protein with little cost or effort.  Add boiled eggs and tuna fish occasionally for variety.Cheapest salad ever get a huge bunch of Kale and cut it up with scissors.  It keeps in the fridge for like two weeks.Never buy prepared TV dinners.  Never order pizza either.  Thats like flushing money down the toilet.If you drink just do shots of shitty vodka.  Cheapest way to get fucked up and much fewer calories overall than beer.  This also cuts down on trash.

It makes no sense when thought about logically but it is how some people think. Very twisted. I know my husbands exwife pulled this same kind of crap. If you dont divorce your wife she will. She is trying to get you to pull the trigger first so she can play the victim. Dont let these games affect you. Do whats best for you forget what anyone thinks and have a happy life.

10858949,0,t1_ddzrtfa,I think we are looking at the same thing and forming completely different opinions on it.  Which is fine.  One of the great things about not Being brainwashed anymore is we realize that thats ok  were allowed to have opinions!  We can get along without being united in the same lie  imagine that! Anyway I dont think there is a trick being played by the governing body or any religious leaders here.  The Bible was written in such a way to deliberately give religious leaders this kind of power and control.  JWs are lying based on the Bible.  They are staying true to the lies perpetuated by the Bible.  They can all think that they are the modern day equivalents of Moses David the apostles etc.  sure all of them supposedly had miraculous signs of having gods favor in one way or another.  But the Bible was written to avoid them having to actually prove they are inspired by saying that all those miracles and signs would be done away with.  So convenient isnt it.  Each religion can come up with its own criteria for genuinely believing and providing evidence of being used by god.  ,exjw,de00vkv,1,t5_2qp5l

While I can DEFINITELY understand your plight and am very sympathetic to it I cant necessarily blame her for feeling violated that her personal information is being shared on the internet with strangers even if it is anonymous. What I suggest is you retain a qualified therapist for yourself outside of the relationship. You seem to be struggling with a few different things that a qualified professional I think can help you with. One of those things might be getting more comfortable with communicating openly with your spouse. You have expressed that you love your wife and want to stay with her lying is not going to help the foundation in your relationship.  As for your sexual issues Im not sure what to say. It sounds like she may need to see someone to help her with her sexual guilt herself. Best of luck to you both. ,exjw,dfbdjmq,6,t5_2qp5l

First all amino acids must form a peptide bond when joining with other amino acids in the protein chain. If the amino acids do not link up with one another via a peptide bond the resulting molecule will not fold into a protein. In nature many other types of chemical bonds are possible between amino acids. In fact when amino acid mixtures are allowed to react in a test tube they form peptide and none peptide bonds with roughly equal probability. Thus with each amino acid addition the probability of it forming a peptide bond is roughly . Once four amino acids have become linked the likelihood that they are joined exclusively by peptide bonds is roughly . The probability of building a chain of  amino acids in which all linkages are peptide linkages is  or  chance in .Second in nature every amino acid found in proteins  with one exception has a distinct mirror image of itself there is one left handed version or L form and one right handed version or D form. These mirror image forms are called optical isomers. Functioning proteins tolerate only left handed amino acids yet in abiotic amino acid production the right handed and left handed isomers are produced with roughly equal frequency. Taking this into account further compounds the improbability of attaining a biologically functioning protein. The probability of attaining at random only L amino acids in a hypothetical peptide chain  amino acids long is  or roughly  chance in . Starting from mixtures of D and L form the probability of building a  amino acid chain at random in which all bonds are peptide bonds and all amino acids are L form is therefore roughly  chance in .Amino acids link together when the amino group of one amino acid bonds to the carboxyl group of another. Notice that water is the byproduct of the reaction. Condensation reaction.Functional proteins have a third independent requirement the most important of all their amino acids like letters in a meaningful sentence must link up in functionally specified sequential arrangements. In some cases changing even one amino acid at a given site results in the loss of protein function. Moreover because a there are  biologically occurring amino acids the probability of getting a specific amino acid at a given site is small  actually the probability is even lower because in nature there are also may none protein forming amino acids. On the assumption that each site is a protein chain requires a particular amino acid the probability of attaining a particular protein  amino acids long would be  or roughly  chance . chance in .Taking this into account only causes the improbability of generating the necessary proteins by chance or the genetic information to produce them to balloon beyond comprehension. In  distinguished British cosmologist Sr. Fred Hoyle calculated the odds of producing the proteins necessary to service a simple one celled organism by chance at  in K.There are  atoms in our galaxyStephen C.

Compare that to most creationist positions which actively deny and ignore observations and evidence to preserve their fundamentally flawed favorite stories. Theres a huge difference between overwhelmingly supported by evidence but nothing is  certain evolution and contradicts all known scientific evidence but bronze age people wrote a story about it young earth creationism.

RutherfordgtThe article by Dr. Coolidge concerning the application of radium as a vital force is interesting to me. About a year ago I suffered from a severe case of pleuropneumonia and Dr. Coolidge was my physician. During the period of convalescence he provided me with a radiosolar pad or belt which I wore with great profit to myself. I have since recommended it to others who have likewise benefited by it. This pad I understand is manufactured by the Radium Appliance Company of Los AngelesCalifornia and the process of manufacture is to diffuse through a mass of paste by the power of electricity a small quantity of radium and out of this the pad is manufactured. If the pad is held in the sunlight for five minutes it can be taken into a dark room and will photograph itself. In other words it absorbs the energy of the sun and transmits that to the human system. I believe that this will prove very beneficial to humanity and so recognizing it I am glad to call attention to it.,exjw,dfnl4mk,1,t5_2qp5l

Maybe he even jerked it at the temple when he was lost? He was all like shit! Its been three days traveling with my whole fucking family! I gotta JERK IT. So he sneaks off and they leave him and he comes back and was all like shit! Then he jerks it for like three days while hes at the temple and the Pharisees find him and theyre all like bro thats not right and so hes all like why not! And he starts questioning them and telling them that God made us to jerk it and if he didnt want us touching our dicks he would have put it in between our shoulder blades or something. So then the parents come and their whole group gets embarrassed and theyre all like what are you doing! Oh he was just asking us questions about god and stuff. But then Jesus realizes that the reason he was horny was because this whole time all the dudes in the temple were wearing short dresses and he could see their ankles. So he never takes a lover.

If you could examine each of those cases in detail I bet youd find that their insular upbringing was more to blame for their failure than anything else. They were probably kicked out at a young age and forced to fend for themselves with no education no life experience no understanding of sex and relationships and no family support.

11577520,0,t1_dg89mhc,I had a new JW mention this subject about JWs who leave being mentally diseased. I remember it vividly. This was a former Hells Angels gang member in Montreal back in   about the time I was planning my trip to Poland. His tattoos indicated to me that he had lived the life if you know what I mean. He was waxing how JWs had saved his life. It was actually a very enjoyable witnessing from the standpoint of gratitude and love. I felt good for him. He was with a brother I knew and neither from my territory. Then suddenly he ripped into this mentally diseased talk and I was off put by the experience. I never thought could never hold the opinion I could be effective in service to Jehovah by thinking everyone outside the Organisation was unworthy. It was jarring to see this trophy JW we were all so proud of speak so disparagingly about people struggling so. I remember it as The Event that pinched me. I would recall it often while I grappled with the UN DPI revelation. Anyway my two cents.,exjw,dg8bgn1,2,t5_2qp5l

11595820,0,t3_65ed28,Im sad too my grandma was born a Catholic but converted to the JWs Im not sure exactly when but Ive heard that she was already a JW before having her first daughter and that was when she was around yo. Shes lost far more friends and family members to death than the average person I think and she hopes to wake up in Paradise someday. It would be no good to wake her up although shes not as hardcore as other JWs Ive read about.Im sad that I know shes just obeying a harmful cult but at least due to current circumstances its effect on her isnt very strong anymore. However I still have a bit of a hope. Marcus Aurelius summed up the conclusions I came to almost  freaking millennia ago lol.Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just then they will not care how devout you have been but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods but unjust then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods then you will be gone but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.So while Im not asserting whether or not there is some form of afterlife if there is I have no doubt my grandma would make it there and hopefully be reunited with her loved ones again. If there isnt well her memory will live on with those who knew her although at least on my side of the family the bloodline ends with me.,exjw,dgae7td,3,t5_2qp5l

They want to tell people EXACTLY what to do but they want people to feel like they came up with their own decisions on their own.The discussion about documentation presented at the ARC included how easily searchable the publications are if that is what is implicated here... but a person has to first have the question then sit down and search research appropriate publications read draw their conclusions pray over it... then they still should approach the elders to verify that conclusion lest they do something that is completely wrong and they get disfellowshipped.  What Stewart was trying to say at one point is Youre a religion. By definition you are responsible for peoples spirituality and you should tell people what to do.  SO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO.This roundabout well it depends lets see what  says and compare it to  method of religion is fine for trying to get your son to stop playing video games or trying to get your daughter to stop talking science. It is NOT acceptable with child sexual abuse  an extremely simple and generally accepted cutanddryblackandwhite issue.So Im glad the brothers are doing legwork and putting together documentation.

It will be dick shrivellingly awkward and humiliating for them.  They have no power at all. No matter how smug or even how seriously they take their role in their little weirdo religious cult.  A lot of Witnesses like to live two lives and its amazing how different an elder can appear once you see them somewhere that theyre the underling dressed in normal clothes even talking and behaving differently to blend in and feel normal.

11757643,0,t1_dgrwbyf,I find this kind of all or nothing approach to Christianity is just a manifestation of the same dogmatic approach in the JWs. I value Christians and their faith. I dont agree at all as I have zero belief but I can respect their approach to life. So sad when people cant just enjoy the diversity of belief we have available to us.,exjw,dgsrbnp,1,t5_2qp5l

11782477,0,t3_683i24,I slept for days. In the weeks leading up to the Judicial Committee there was murmur and talk gossip and speculation. Friends were drawing conclusions my mom had Plan A PlanB Plan C...Then it all went quiet.  No meetings no local needs no gossiping tattletaling assumptions assemblies conventions special talks Circuit Overseer visits field service counting time literature pick up arrangements for Saturday phone calls texts emails... nothing. Just QUIET.I laid my head down at a friends house several towns over.  I have no idea how long I was out but when I got up I stretched asking Okay... who am I today?I cried for joy at the answer whoever the fuck I wanted to be. ,exjw,dgvkyio,24,t5_2qp5l

After I was disfellowshipped the source of my fear was gone and my curiosity came bursting to front of my mind and here I am now.,exjw,dgweenx,3,t5_2qp5l
11792086,0,t3_686o27,While I understand your desire for privacy I think you have a great opportunity to have your say so many never get to express all the things wrong with the watchtower because we get silenced or are trying to hang on to some family members.

11805700,0,t1_dgy76ao,Your posts painted a picture of your level of discomfort which you only try to walk back when someone suggests you assert yourself. How much this event actually bothered you is your business but Im not sure how it is confusing that your posts can be read that way. Maybe you were just exaggerating your discomfort goodnaturedly for the story which we all do thinking wed all jump in with yeah this fuckin guy or whatever and then clarified when you got these suggestions. Or maybe it did bother you that much but you have an aversion to taking action. Theres no way to tell on the internet  both versions are equally plausible. Its not jumping to a conclusion so much as it is responding to the possibility with the most need.,exjw,dgy7tg3,1,t5_2qp5l
