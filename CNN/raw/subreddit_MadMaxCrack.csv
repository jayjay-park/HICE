5095861,0,t1_cv05pc3,How about you shut the fuck up. The mere fact that the scene groups themselves cant crack it and pp groups have to use emulation methods proves that Denuvos Anti Tampering cant be cracked. Every game update this whole process has to be repeated and might even get more difficult as time goes on. ,MadMaxCrack,cv08pts,-2,t5_39ugu
5095918,0,t3_3kt272,Ill test Windows . havent used v yet Im going to download apply v directly and see whats up. Currently unpacking fitgirl and itll take a while... Will report back with result.EDITAbsolutely perfect so far only played  hour but no crashes shot the shotgun many times and even opened the map and the game hasnt crashed. Im also able to save well. Working flawlessly. I do however use a controller that may have something to do with it since people say right click crashes the game.My specs are i  gtx ti  GB RAM in case its relevantHeres what I did Unpack fitgirl repack Apply v crack skipped v which Im guessing is the reason all these problems are appearing Changed timezone to UTC  .

5107073,0,t3_3kylgr,I say stay. Crack v just fixed some crashes people were having it didnt add anything besides that. But in the future if the game gets updated or something then you might need to update your crack. Dont fix it if it isnt broken! ,MadMaxCrack,cv1ld9o,1,t5_39ugu
5115030,0,t1_cv1pzud,I downloaded a Naruto game ninja storm whatever the fuck for my little brother a while back. Day it was released. I sent the setup exe to VirusTotal like I do every exe and crack dll. Came back completely clean re scanned right then and there. Launched the setup exe and a cmd prompt popped up for a fraction of a second. And then the installer started up. Checked process explorer for any suspect processes. Ran Malwarebytes locally and everything came back clean. When I restarted the PC That stupid Fake AV shit popped up and safe mode scans of several AVs and AMs removed the files only to have them regenerate upon restart. My first encounter with a zeroday virus. I scanned the exe a day or  later on Virustotal and the definitions were finally updating.Shit happens indeed. ,MadMaxCrack,cv2jwcq,2,t5_39ugu
