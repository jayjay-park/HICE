10208193,0,t1_dbz741y,Dude youre taking it personally and not in perspective. What you dont understand is that it is NOT normal for  teens to kill themselves. It is NOT normal for   twenty year olds to quit their first job after  weeks. It is NOT normal for  of High School students to suffer from depression. THIS is what he is saying. Because you are in it you dont see it. And he blames it on the previous generation who came up with this wonderful plan for how to raise children. It failed. It failed you and your peers. That is what he is saying. And he is saying how to overcome this depression suicidal rates and lack of commitment and feeling of being overwhelmed. Personally I dont think it really applies to  and under... and only slightly to  yr olds. Its mostly the  yr olds and many of the elder of this group have overcome much of the issues. Not ALL parents raised their children using this template and therefor NOT all millenials fit this pattern. But the majority do. And HE did NOT call anyone lazy and uneducated. He DID say that they lack self esteem. Just go check out social blogs and questions peeps have and you can see many many people have insecurities and low self esteem... feel scared and whitless about job interviews... you should be a little nervous but not scared and feeling you arent qualified and they wont hire you. Thats not normal. Signed Dudette,millennial,dc15ly3,2,t5_2xzpe
