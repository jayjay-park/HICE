3740580,0,t1_cqiaxn7,It should be made explicit as well that PSE will get a return of . per year on the  million dollar cost of this infrastructure a rate of return much higher than other safe investments. PSE is essentially forcing us to pay over  interest on a loan of  million that theyre forcing us to take out. They justify this by using fake demand numbers fake capacity numbers and fake growth numbers to argue that the Eastside needs the lines. Theyre lying to build infrastructure to sell power to BC and California and theyre charging us while they do it.The alternatives to this plan would cost us next to nothing and still reliably deliver the power we need for the next  years. But because these alternatives wouldnt make PSE as much money PSE pushes these unnecessary eyesore moneymaking towers on us and charges us millions to build them.At least thats what the video says.,bellevue,cqinfmt,3,t5_2r82l

Mustard Seed on the south side seems like a haunt for some.Incidentally Mox has a gaming meetup group on Meetup.com. I havent been to one yet.,bellevue,cti81l4,2,t5_2r82l
4920206,0,t1_cuepuih,How bad is it to go for buying a house without the  down?In addition to PMI banks will charge higher interest rates as you present a higher risk. Youll find yourself unable to use homeequity loans or HELOC useful for homeimprovements as you wouldnt have as much equity to borrow against if needed. Youre also going to be paying a lot more in interest over the life of your loan.Assuming a  house and a yr mortgage at . interest down  total paid. down  total paid. down  total paid. of k is . Not spending  upfront will endup costing you .Remember not payingdown the principal of a mortgage is always a bad idea unless you have a magic investment which guarantees returns greater than your mortgage interest rate every year. Good luck finding anything returning more than . thesedays However the concerns of a not having  down and b buying a condohouse too early and getting stuck with that mistake are the only reasons I am thinking of starting with a rental.Thats my position too   but my point is that while renting you should aim to reduce your rent as much as possible without spending money needlessly. I got sweettalked into a month apartment for my first year when I could have spent month !! on somewhere almost as nice and have been  better off after that year. Thats my main regret because I could really do with an extra k right now DI was under the impression that a BR townhome anywhere reasonable around MSFT campus will cost you K ishRedmond does have townhomes you can buy theres a lot of new construction. I think your estimate of k is aboutright. A teammember of mine got one a few months ago. He seemed happy with it. But you dont get much squarefootage though I think ltsqft.Elsewhere youll find older constructions built in the s and s some earlys which have the same feel to them as nonluxury standard apartments. Ordinarily they wouldnt go for more than k or so but prices in the area are becoming massively inflated because developers are buyingup old properties demolishing them and building m homes for all the millionaires coming out of Bellevue.Remember that k is a lot of money. In realterms thats more than half of America will make in their lifetimes.Seeing your mention of k is that assumption incorrect? What are nice areas around MSFT where your house will cost significantly less than my k assumption yet reasonably good neighborhoods?There are nice areas everywhere granted some way more expensive than others  I live in Duvall which is a very nice little town NE of Redmond and has a  minute car commute to the Microsoft campus though expect  minutes in rushhour. I take the company bus most days though. Duvalls going through a construction boom and I was lucky enough to get a brandnew sqft place for a very reasonable price below k the same house design in Bellevue would probably be over .m judging by Zillow.Generally if its within  minutes drive of campus or downtown Bellevue it will be expensive.Finally this one related to MSFT. Do they provide any resources for buying a house?Not directly at least not to my knowledge. Microsoft is heavily partnered with FirstTech though and often they will give you the best mortgage rate.,bellevue,cueqb5i,2,t5_2r82l

8608471,0,t3_4py5ca,gt me and my wife both grew up in a large city in Europe and I am little afraid about being bored on the eastside.I grew up in Kirkland and have always been bored on the eastside.Since you will be working in Bellevue and have a family I highly recommend living in Bellevue. There is much more to do in Bellevue compared to Kirkland. More parks and recreational activities. Bellevue is located with access to the major highways I SB has tolls I. Although I live in Kirkland I usually go to the shopsrestaurants in Bellevue.Also since you have kids the Bellevue schools tend to have better funding for their educational programs and better test scores. Test scores are supposed to serve as crude estimations for school performance but lets not go into that rabbit hole. My high school in Kirkland did not have IB programs but Bellevue schools do may be different now.Traffic during rush hours on the weekdays can be pretty bad. I live in Kirkland and am about  miles approx.  km from downtown Bellevue. It may take me  min to get there sometimes.However living in Kirkland isnt too bad. Its generally quieter here less crowded than Bellevue for sure. The bus system King County Metro is somewhat reliable. There is an express bus that runs between Kirkland and the University District the . A nonexpress bus the  runs between Kirkland and the International District in Seattle.TLDR Recommend living in Bellevue if you want to be closer to shopsrestaurantsactivities.,bellevue,d6hnknu,1,t5_2r82l
