8645410,0,t1_d6lrjl8,Well thats certainly weird and I have no idea. Maybe because theyre procedurally generated gravity is taken into account. If I were to write code for generating creatures I would obviously take gravity into account. Less gravity  tallslenderlight more gravity shortbulkyheavy. So it would be possible that a creature could be super tall but very light in weight.,NoMansSkyAnimals,d6mad0l,1,t5_3fugm
