3352336,0,t1_cpadrag,Oh gracious! That was really intense too. How the episode starts with pans of her wrecked house but shes sitting calmly humming was... very eerie. Everything about Charles and Ray gets to me because it showed how even great people with a lot of good values can still be brought down by their imperfections  by grudges or pride. It reminded me that people are not always black or white but often a shade of gray.,eurekaseven,cpae373,3,t5_2t79j
