When Cards amp Blues conflicted theyd show the Cards over the normal Fox channels and say use the App for Blues.  But then the app would blackout the Blues game as we are local.  Its Fox that does these shenanigans not Sony.,Vue,dfwzc71,1,t5_34j3e
11509335,0,t3_63cv40,Its interesting.  I didnt have to do anything to get it to work right away.  I just fired PlayStation Vue up on my Apple TV and it worked right away  no prompts to update any information or anything. Goodbye Comcast  and your stupid data cap hello Centurylink fiber with unlimited data. ,Vue,dg0l22h,1,t5_34j3e
11519030,0,t3_649koz,UPDATE Turns out it WAS an issue with Chrome possibly the cookie settings. I tried Internet Explorer and was able to log in to the account Id created whereupon the site began requesting billing and payment info to complete the process. Once I entered all of that it finally accepted the digit code from the Roku screen and everything was activated and the billing page said . due.  Free trial underway and Im finally understanding what a blase interface on the Roku everyones been complaining about.Followup question Does the cloud DVR only work for a paidsubscription? Because I cant find any buttons or menus in the VUE app for it.,Vue,dg1omec,1,t5_34j3e
11546963,0,t1_dg4uepr,Ill give it a try tonight. This only started coincidentally after a power outage but also after we signed up for Vue and it has only happened in Vue. Bad timing haha.,Vue,dg4umvg,2,t5_34j3e
11597341,0,t1_dga1uii,Agreed  weve gotten one update and whenever I get a survey from Vue  as soon as I check off I use via Apple TV is ends survey saying thank you for your time so it doesnt seem anywhere on their priority list.  Weve had one update since launch for performance and dont have any of the IOS features like guide going back a week or this news stuff on fire tv Ive been seeing  or this new  window thing PS got,Vue,dgakfah,2,t5_34j3e
11643966,0,t1_dgfsx13,So far it is working great. Hold down the main button and up comes the quick nav. Makes it a ton easier to get to the guide.,Vue,dgfuvb3,3,t5_34j3e
11653999,0,t3_664al8,PS. Of course if youre not gonna game then I guess its not worth it. I have a fire TV and fire stick as well. The TV runs about as well as the Ps. The stick makes me want to put my head through a wall.,Vue,dggzuak,2,t5_34j3e

11686209,0,t3_667ma3,its your Roku my friend got Roku  weeks ago for the HDR feature the system is so outdated and old all the apps look like they belong in a Sega Dreamcast. Invest in an Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV the best streaming devices in my opinionWhen i had my Roku i had issues with buffering and such with PS Vue and the no guide is just horrible on thereMade the switch back to my Apple TV in one bedroom and Amaazin Fire TV in main room and no issues whatsoever all smoooth sailing from here,Vue,dgkndwi,1,t5_34j3e

11694499,0,t1_dgkekh7,I was a hula beta tester and it had my local RSN fox southwest.The hulu experience is inferior to Vue. There was no guide difficult to flip between channels and picture was not as sharp,Vue,dgll8mh,1,t5_34j3e
11702217,0,t3_66xmj7,Has happened a few times to me. Go into the manage application menu and clear all the app data. Resign in and you should be golden. ,Vue,dgmgr3m,1,t5_34j3e
11720948,0,t3_676uya,I like mine.  I only really use few buttons.  I mainly bought it for my gf so she wouldnt have to use the controller.,Vue,dgolkuf,2,t5_34j3e
11724078,0,t1_dgo715k,Yeah everything works for the TV but those buttons dont do anything in PS mode. If I want to forward or rewind I have to use the DPad.,Vue,dgoydfj,1,t5_34j3e

11777790,0,t1_dgunhrc,I agree. Have a PS upstairs for the kids and the guide is so much better. Two Roku s and the interface is blah ... I think Sony Apple Amazon are all doing this on purpose so you have to by their hardware Netflix Hulu NBCSN ESPN look great via Roku ,Vue,dgv1t1x,1,t5_34j3e
