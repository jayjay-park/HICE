8836174,0,t3_517iin,Ooh scary thought...what if Lucy was Aneelas mother...!!  Like she doesnt realize it anymore now but Khlyen turned his wife into a computer for some reason maybe Aneela had dealt her a mortal wound and it was the only way to save even part of her.Which explains why Lucy likes Johnny more than Dutch   Plus if Dutch ends up being Aneelas clone or something then Lucy is kinda Dutchs mom too.,Killjoys,d79zfcj,5,t5_2szo0
