119790,0,t3_1vgcma,If youre aware of spelling mistakes why didnt you go ahead and change them? Okay the dialogue needs a rework. Diana just met this guy yet she wants to voice a huge opinion? Its uncharacteristic of students to do this build up to personal opinion dont open with it. Also I think you need to make your TOM character a little bit less of an American. Can be annoying with all the totally s. Try to make your dialogue less formal than your descriptions people dont say I am they say Im. Wait wait wait this moon girl is just willing to put out to the first guy that throws her a compliment? I dunno if that s realistic... Hope you have a good day. is too polite. This dialogue man its so bland and unrealistic. WAY too american. By that I mean people saying youre the best for no reason guys who go around saying bro every few seconds etc. Just not actable. Work in some idiosyncrasies... all I can say.Descriptions wise its all josh this and josh that add in some hes and verbs and whatnot to introduce the action. Dont mention little details like Josh shuffles occasionally apart from anything it ironically makes the action more vague. Also dont mention clothing in scripts instead mention age something youve neglected. We assume theyre students but unless you tell us outright their ages wed never know. Theyve exchanged barely a sentence yet this lunar chic is ready to make out? Also dont include cuts or any kind of directive. You are the writer the director deals with cuts and transitions.  ,ReadMyScript,ces2l4x,2,t5_2smdl
124974,0,t3_1viqsr,Hi I finished reading and wanted to give you some feedback On page three the lines of dialogue Emmet  How do we get out of here and Imogen  We had better get a move on I feel are unnecessary because when the scene moves to EXT. OUTER SPACE urgency is implied by what is shown and by what Imogen does when it goes back to INT. PILOT DECK where she points to outside with her mouth open.On page five Emmets line What do you mean what happens after the breath breach in place of breath.Theres a page missing before the page where Emmet says Damn you...you cold dead hard piece of....Overall I like this script because of how it is structured.

314686,0,t3_1xkwrb,I didnt read the first draft posted of this so coming at this not knowing what has gone before.  I really enjoyed the start of it.  I was maybe a bit more confused than I wanted to be about the initial situation  though it unravelled in a timely fashion but Joe doing the right thing finding the source of the problem rather than just doing his job and collecting got me onboard with him as a protagonist.  The action on screen would be really interesting and exciting though admittedly my initial thoughts were Yeesh  How much is this pilot gonna cost? Though Im not sure that is a thought that should hold you back.However I felt from the beginningmiddle of act two nothing really happened.  There mostly seemed to be exposition about how the world works and the conventions in conversation between two characters.  Hes given his first job but we dont actually see him complete it  not that this is necessary.  It might just be the thing that we can see and thereby learn the rules of the world by the characters successes or failures.  The two of them having a conversation about it over a few different locations for what feels like  minutes of screen time is not exciting.  Especially in contrast to the more dynamic first act in which lots happens.  The freeze frame mechanic is also largely absent maybe as theres no action to freeze from.  But I liked the visual effect in my head while reading.As for formatting some of the issues you seem to be having with final draft seem to be pretty annoying for yourself as much as a reader Id imagine.  In addition to the alignment of character names to the start of dialogue instead of centre theres also a few instances of a character continuing to speak after a line of action without contd next to the name.  I havent used final draft so Im not sure if this is supposed to do that for you the software I use does it automactically  Fadein but Id suggest maybe experimenting with different software many programs import .fdx files or you could run an rtf through fountain or making sure you can manually figure this out for yourself and amend on FD.Some of the humour didnt land with me.  Some of it might if there was a charismatic actor playing B for the sake of the Justin Bieber and mom jokes.  But the Helen Keller one on pg. didnt work mostly because as the deaf blind person to earn a degree she wasnt stupid.  Im good with black humour and nervous laughter offensive type humour but the joke isnt accurate or smart enough to get there.As a small note I feel that the use of the DMV as hellpublic office for hellpoint of contact is overdone almost a trope.  I can think of two instances with the samesimilar premise to yours soul collection afterlife administration reaping.  Reaper most prominently featured the DMV Dead Like Me had it as material not originally broadcast but on DVD I think and there have been a ton of jokes in numerous other shows that equate the DMV to hell.  It feels done.But I think the strongest feedback I have to give is on the second half.  I do think the first act is really interesting Ive always liked these sorts of hidden urban worlds with religious mythology and celestial administration type ideas but I think for this to be as strong as a whole you should mix up the conversation and exposition in the second act with action and a feeling of going forward without just learning.Great news about the studio bite hope it works out.,ReadMyScript,cfddx4a,1,t5_2smdl

Even in the first paragraph the descriptions of things are very basic theres nothing there that interests me no scenery that makes me want to press on much.  Ill explain.Saying that the sky is blue the grass is green the blanket is red those are very primary and nonspecific.  I like to be enraptured by the first minute so I dont get bored.  Is the blanket a handmedown?  Where are they?  Is this field near their house?  Are they out on a picnic?  Why are they there?  Whats the name of the comic book?The little details could really pull someone in.  You could say its a patchwork blanket falling apart that would indicate that they are poor.  You could say its goldplated that would indicate that theyre wealthy.  The comic could be a limitededition comic.  Or his favorite story old faded and creased.  The sky doesnt have to be blue it can be ominous with rainclouds in the distance hinting at impending doom.  I guess Id say dont be afraid to elaborate build the scene build the world.

1636581,0,t3_2d2jkv,honestly its a scene not a story. thats my main criticism of the structure of the piece. Here are my other notes. People dont really talk to themselves. Everything that ron says to himself when he exits the car can be said through facial expressions and thats the way it should be.. Have you ever tried closing the back door of a car while seated in the drivers seat? Its more or less impossible. This isnt really that important but when youre producing something this kind of thing can cause problems. If youre picturing something you know is possible try to add a bit more description. This will help when you are producing something. . Why is bagface scratching his face? is he some kind of junkie? . You include no physical description of kicker.. gt Ron reaches slowly for grabs BAGFACEs chest. It crinkles like PAPER before Ron can realize what is crinkling like paper? his chest? is bagfaces chest made of paper? if the bag on his face is crinkling like paper its because its made of paper. Im confused.Also slowly grabbing someones chest to start a hookup sesh is just not how it goes. Although since this is a comedy I assume this was intentional. If so its pretty funny.lastly pouring flour on someone you are robbing is very weird. its unlikely i think that the audience is going to know it is flour. they are going to wonder what the substance is perhaps poison? and why a robber would pour flour on a victim. if its in there simply as a sight gag you should drop it in my opinion. you have to justify everything in your script against the story you are telling. ,ReadMyScript,cjlgf77,2,t5_2smdl

So Im messing with tones and devices there.Im glad you pointed out the anticlimatic nature of that scene because I just couldnt see it while writing.

3625222,0,t3_31vux5,So I glanced through it and here are a few things that stood out to me     The dialogue seems clunky.  Very this is written dialogue sound to me.         You show Kevin knocking the papers over and then telling Chris about it immediately after.  This to me at least seems very repetitive and pointless.  Its always better to show than tell so all you have to do is make Kevin mention he messed up or something about Bob it doesnt need to be repeated that falls back to the clunky dialogue I mentioned.         Im not sure who the main character is.  I take it all three men are important but theres always ONE main character in any story no matter what.         I think you could make the characters more defined.  Kevin seems like he could be a bit more bumbling and naive think Ross on Friends.  Bob could be a bit more short with his lines to show his short temper think Mike from Breaking Bad.  And Chris could be more suave with the way he speaks think Jon Hamm from Mad Men.  Im not saying to write those characters those are just some examples I see in my head.         I REALLY like the ending.  Makes me want to see more but I think its taking too long to get there.  If this were something I was watching and Im putting myself in a place where Im just trying a new show on Netflix and not willing to give it long Im afraid I might give up on it.  The character development youre putting in there could come after that.  Maybe thats more of an opinion of mine than advice.        And actually tailing on that all of this is just my opinion.  If you feel like something I said is wrong or I dont quite get something then ignore me.  Youre the writer you know your work best!    Good luck.,ReadMyScript,cq5i3jj,2,t5_2smdl

5077590,0,t3_3kihkv,Thanks for sharing! I read up to the end of Act I. First impressions. I read the logline and immediately went So its like Chronicle? then I found out you gave Nick telekinesis and went yup just like Chronicle. I was kinda disappointed as I feel like this storys been done before and in all of act I there was nothing to suggest you were bringing something new to the table. Nick getting the powers by being struck by lightning made me roll my eyes and took me out of the story. It brought to mind the Community quote my uncle was struck by lightning. Youd think it would give you superpowers but now he just masturbates in movie theaters. Bear in mind thats being said by one of the most childlike and naive characters in Community and as your story doesnt seem aimed at innocent children. I think youre gonna have problems getting an adult audience to suspend their disbelief at this point. Even if you were to make it a thunder storm that gives Nick his powers youre then inviting Misfits comparisons so youre in a tough spot. I think that unless youre adapting a  year old comic book hero with super speed powergiving lightning should be a no go. Theres a fuckload of fucking swearing in this fucking script.  I brushed it off at first and rationalized it as the story being set in a shitty working class redneck kind of area and this was just the culture he grew up in. Then the doctor fucking swore and I just fucking lost it. Its too much. Not only does it come off as fucking juvenile and inappropriate it makes a lot of your fucking characters sound the same. I dont buy the characters as . They seem like they should be in uni at least. From the popular girl whos having an affair with a married man to the drinking games at Nicks house to Nicks dream about Haleys it all just seems out of place. Perhaps youre trying to capture the voice of teens like in American Pie Superbad and Inbetweeners but again thats a bit different. Those filmstv show were explicitly about a group of immature adolescent males trying to get laid so that premise suggests childish vulgarities and crude sex jokes and makes it more acceptable. When I finished reading the script I came back to your post to see it tagged as comedy. That baffles me dude. I was surprised as I found Nick and the world he lived in quite sad and unfortunate. Where are the jokes? I recapped the story in my mind and the only things I could remember as trying to be funny were the uninspired Taken jokes near the beginning and the whole penis bookdildo thing in the library. Bear in mind I didnt crack a smile at either of them. I dunno maybe you find people who say fuck and shit and cunt inherently funny? Or the kid whose dad has a cocaine addiction quite amusing? Maybe Nicks interaction with his boss happened to you in real life and you thought it would translate on the page? Comedy this is not seems like more of a straight coming of age story actually. Maybe youre just aiming this at  year old boys and I dont know what the hell Im talking about. Things I didnt understand  The packed to the brim with kids trading cards description on pagw  doesnt make sense as it doesnt explain where the trading cards are? Why the random cut to Nicks parents doing coke and having sex? If Nick really wants help and also has immediate control of his telekinesis why doesnt he just show his powers to the doctor? Whats the central conflict going to be? Is it between Nick and his friends or is it some Nick against himself type of shit? What did I like about your story? Honestly I like how theres a lack of exposition in Act  but you still manage to make it clear that Nick has low selfesteem and wants to be percieved as popular. I can see where his arc is going which is good.Ill conclude by saying that despite my criticisms I dont think youre a bad writer at all its just that theres a distinct lack of ideas in this script. If youre going to persist with this story its going to need a major overhaul. Good luck.,ReadMyScript,cuy1i5e,1,t5_2smdl

6284449,0,t3_41lcq1,HeyHad a read through this last night So the original you posted not the edited version! so I thought Id offer some amateurish opinions! Definitely like the idea of a slightly useless more adult version of the Scooby Gang. Thought the dialogue was great really snappy.I appreciate you might have dealt with some of this in the edited version didnt have time to read through that sorry!. So feel free to ignore all of this Im no expert! Just a few things that stood out for me. Not sure the teaser really adds anything at the moment. Theres some funny stuff there but given that we never see Sally again alive anyway and theres enough to establish George as a bit of a dick in his later scenes it just feels a bit redundant. Maybe if we actually saw Sally getting kidnapped by a mysterious figure at the end? I got the Scooby Gang vibe from the start really liked the whole botched arrest of the Prospector. So Im not sure you need to spend two pages telegraphing the Scooby Dooness of the situation on Pg. I think you could establish that they try to solve mysteries but are terrible at it a little bit quicker I include the drive back and the garage scene in that. Which would mean if you trimmed all that down you get to your actual plot Sallys disappearance a lot earlier than page  which would help with the pacing of the episode. Ive got the exact same issue with a script of mine right now. Too much random banter in act one before the plot is actually established! Really like the idea of a competing Scooby Gang in the same town. Though the end of the party scene was a bit jarring in how Brandon seems to just give up the information to Leroy for no reason. If theyre also trying to solve the case that seems a tad counterproductive. Maybe Leroy can threaten to go to the police about Brandons whole attempted murder with a car thing unless they cough up the info? The end scene was a bit messy though I like the ballsiness of killing off what was apparently a main character in the pilot!. I guess I didnt quite get why nobody seemed all that bothered about Jerry pulling a gun on them. If their previous crimefighting experience extended to dealing with a rat infestation and arresting the wrong prospector it felt that being threatened with an actual gun should have been more of a big deal. Even if theres a throwaway line earlier on that establishes that they think that theyre basically indestructible because they keep getting into Scooby Gangstyle scrapes and always walking away unharmed it might make more sense?Overall though really liked the idea and the general feel of the story. Look forward to seeing where you go with this!,ReadMyScript,cz3yyu2,3,t5_2smdl
6498141,0,t3_449izy,Ill be honest Vraptor Ive read it a couples times and I find it hard to understand. So I cant really offer any feedback regarding the narrative but I can for the formatting. So here it goes! First issue  After the scene heading you offer no description of the house? The audience needs to be able to visualize the scene in order to put the characters in them. For example  is the house clean messy big small empty? Second issue  The description of the characters is formatted wrong. In Screenplays its all about visual amp sound. So lines such as  impatient and selfcentered individual cannot be shown on film. To display characteristic we have to show them through actions. For example if Peter is impatient  Peter franically paces back and forth.Ive also given an example of character description below. Please keep in mind this is just a quick example of how to format character descriptionPETER  scrawny and tall stands in front of a TV. His long brown hair vaguely resembles a birds nest.On the couch is Martin . The wrinkles on his face stretch as he pushes Peter out the way . Third issue  Transitions like End scene amp Credits are only for shooting scripts and are only used by the director. I wouldnt write these unless you are planning on filming it yourself. Fourth issue  Some of your actions likes are too long. In scriptwriting its best to keep your writing on the lean side. Its very off putting for agents amp readers when the whole page is full of paragraphs. I personally keep mine at four lines.Im very sorry if this came across negative it isnt intended to be. For such a young writer I am very impressed. At your age I couldnt write a page let alone a whole script. So well done.,ReadMyScript,czrgftk,1,t5_2smdl

I knew exactly how it was going to go down and you cut from the best part. We want to see her death not cut away.Cool twist having stacy and ryan connected. Why does she go to Ryan?

She can interact with things in the real world because she stabbed Stacy with a knife so she can still exist in the world.Why does he fuck the elephant? Is this forced? Why doesnt he run? Its a stuffed elephant! Take the kid and run!Theres some cliche dialogue throughout i.e. Not me. You. pg. . And this is a bit long for a short. I dont know if you plan on submitting this to a film festival but they prefer  minute shorts generally and they wont play a short with this much grotesque sexual things involved so if you are going to submit you really need to edit those things out.Seriously it kind of made me want to stop reading. We get Ryan is a bad guy because he murders no need for the masturbating.Try and edit some of these things out and itll be in much better shape.Good luck!,ReadMyScript,d0qjd8c,1,t5_2smdl
6958096,0,t3_4akqtf,The dialogue is a bit on the nose for my taste. Has more of a parody feel than Fantasy especially with the characters Sam and Jim introduced.If youre going to ride a horse you should feed him grain btw.A fun little story but the kings character arc doesnt ring true. He goes alone to slay a dragon? That I could buy if someone really goaded him into it. Chickening out? Totally believable. But the climax doesnt have any real payoff. He doesnt overcome any of his character flaws yet gets the super amazing power. And that last line where he wants someone to give him a girl in exchange for getting lucky ... a total slap in the face.Id say expand your ending cut cut cut most of your early dialogue and introduce an antagonist. Someone who can goad him on maybe a brother who wants him to get himself killed fighting the dragon.The defeat of the enemy army was anticlimactic. We need to really see that theyre the real threat  maybe to the point that the king going off to fight a dragon while its all going down is seen as folly.Random thought  what if the king were to try and trick the dragon into fighting his enemy?Anyway I hope something here is of use to you!,ReadMyScript,d15190u,1,t5_2smdl

7213092,0,t1_d1y1du5,Thanks for the indepth feedback here!       Agree on the title page. Its a placeholder while I just put this up.       Ill switch that up. Also Ill make another pass to put things in the active tone.       For Toms intro I thought of that simply as a readers intro. A quip that matches Billys description of hefty jittery awkward etc. Ill try and write in something that can be shown.       Thanks for the grammarstructure catches.       The exclamation point argument is an interesting one. Ive seen writers defend it and say that they use it sparingly as they believe it means the character is screaming or yelling rather than just saying something forcefully. I tried to actually hold back with the !s to try and stick to this mentality. I know a few places where more can go so Ill slip them back in.       Are you referring to literal orphans? As in children without parents?       For this introduction I wanted to set up Toms story but I do have several more planned. Theres Jack Mercers history the gangs of criminals that come after Mercer once they learned hes sold them out a posse rounded up of the neighboring Sheriffs to avenge Garrett and the biggest of them all Everett is Jack Mercers father and his backstory as well. So yes there are quite a few that Ive already sketched out over the next  episodes. I wanted to try to avoid packing too much into the pilot but I do have  pages to work with...      On my last script I wrote a North Korean prison drama I got dinged for going a bit over on all the world building so I tried to tone it down for this avenue. I do like the approach of key words however it adds spice without overwhelming the reader.      And I cant deny a helpful user a read! Dont worry I wrote an entire  page sequel to The Last of Us just for fun. Ill be sure to look over your work and give some notes like you did once I get off of work tomorrow. Appreciate it again! Thanks!,ReadMyScript,d1y2mbd,2,t5_2smdl

8054703,0,t1_d4ld2tf,Thats all good stuff thanks. And reasonable. I think the next draft will just start with him getting harassed at the bar fuck the street scene.A skycap is a person at an airport who takes your luggage to and from your car and stuff. They handle the checkins etc. Not all airlines have them anymore but some do like Delta. Those are the guys on the curbs at most airports that you can check in with.As for the celebrities Clooney could be any celeb I just picked him. The overall idea is that any guest star on the show has to  be playing themselves and  be a member of the ranch. Its intended to be a running gag even if the show only manages a handful of guest appearances like the heads on Futurama.I think youre overall right about it being better if he was a failed writer or at least a onehitwonder trying to get back on the pony. In the original outline there was no HBO just an abusive and angry publisher who really really wants the third book hes been promised. That should be easy to change back.,ReadMyScript,d4lfas8,1,t5_2smdl

9895644,0,t3_5h1nt8,Hey there.I think you made the right call by deciding to put this up in small chunks. Makes it more digestible. Although I think the language is clear Im having trouble telling some of the characters apart in conversation as there are often several people in a scene together at once and there doesnt seem to be much variation in the way they speak  at least with the sailor characters. Darwin and his pals seem to have more distinct personalities. It may help to include more details in the character introductions besides stating their age.Also at one point you have a character Henry Lowe who seems to appear out of nowhere. Threw me for a bit of a loop. I think he should get a proper introduction. In regards to Robert Lowe being an albino I would suggest adding that snippet to his initial introduction rather than saving it until after Darwins first line.All that aside however Im curious to see where the story goes from here.,ReadMyScript,daxfcnf,1,t5_2smdl
