3077682,0,t1_cogxj6g,Yeah VR would be exciting  I think. Ive recently heard some news that they do in fact have some bits an pieces of future hl but without any  cohesion story gameplay etc. The reporter underestimated that but I think those bits are probably the prestigious stuff  selling points.. thats where the gamblerisk evaluation is. And later they can tie it all together with gameplay story graphics sound.I think their aproach is unexpectedly scientific and visionary for a software company. That makes them top tier with other big software hardware names although they started as just a games developer.,HalfLife3,cogzzb8,1,t5_2s21z

6358437,0,t3_415dap,seems like some good ideas... but i think they just dont give a shit about single player games anymore. the only solution i see is if the whole community suddenly comes alive and starts writing petitions shitposting their emails well basically moving the whole stuff. they need to see that there is a GIANT demand for this game. because the ONLY thing they want is profit.,HalfLife3,czcdtq4,1,t5_2s21z
7497733,0,t3_4i1aoi,Lol The involvement of Abrams surely means a better game experience for halflife What a bullshit... Why would a movie director have any influential impact over experienced and proven game developers in the mechanics of gameplay?!,HalfLife3,d2ugc0n,6,t5_2s21z
8154326,0,t1_d26gpmz,Yeah. Marc was indeed the only one. He was just driving his desk around Valve asking everyone if they want to help him on HL. He started asking for help after he realised that maybe writing engine code AI code modeling texturing rigging animating voice acting script writing and drawing concept art is a little too much for one person. Sadly every one he asked just replied fuk off Laid and so he got cancer and diedd... of cancer.,HalfLife3,d4wu71u,1,t5_2s21z
