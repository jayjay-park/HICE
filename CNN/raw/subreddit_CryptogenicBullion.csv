I believe he is a good person but he was acting selfishly and damaging the community. I also have no personal interest in the other sub and was not trying to take people from rCryptogenicBullion.. they are supposed to work directly together.,CryptogenicBullion,cfekus9,1,t5_2yxw7

445253,0,t3_1z6941,Great work! I was working on a similar post but probably better to consolidate with yours. I think we have  categories of opportunities for the community that should be outlined here. The best part is that even the nontechnical can participate!. Most important  Communication! We have  major social media outlets Bitcointalk Twitter Reddit and Facebook  should provide links but lack cohesive communication. When posting in either of the outlets please try to communicate via the other medium as well. If you see something of interest via one medium take the time to share it through the others.. Incremental exchanges  already covered. Would just add that if the community knows of additional exchanges that should be on our radar please let us know so we can add the target list.. Incremental services  suggestions from the community for businesses and other services that we can reach out to and request they support CGB as a payment option.,CryptogenicBullion,cfqwz04,3,t5_2yxw7
