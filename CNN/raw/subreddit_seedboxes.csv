I had one download going from my whatbox yesterday at home and was only getting about KBs max I could get is only about  but still this is a significant difference this is a non segmented download.

Just like not everyone likes being opted into those special offers emails when signing up on a website people typically like companies to not assume they want to pay them over and over again. The recurring bill section of your checkout doesnt really make it clear that youll be automatically billed  to me it makes sense if you were to be applying a coupon that your next payment might be more so thats why you included it not necessarily that youll be charging automatically.Is uHotDoctor being a little persnickety? Maybe but it is their money and they have to pay an overdraft fee now. Perhaps now would be a good time to update the section and make a note that this is for automated billing and make it optin. I would personally rather inconvenience my users by making them pay manually and opt into a subscription than inconvenience them by charging them when they dont want to be charged or didnt know they were going to be charged.

I added plex a few days ago to my server and its by far the best thing on there. I have my whole library available the moment the torrent finishes not only that but with the correct adons deluge will automatically move files based on where they came from...so all my moves are one place tv shows another music in a third....and plex makes them immediately streamable to my phone my computer my friends phone and computers.

3190103,0,t3_2wob30,Glad you loved the seedboxes I might have some advise for you. and  Consider setting up Plex. It supports streaming and transcoding on the fly so you wouldnt have to do any manual work. It seems PS support is possible there as well. It also allows multiple user accounts. Only thing that might be a problem is transcoding two streams at the same time depending on the VPS you have either  or  virtual cores and Im not sure its enough to handle on the fly encoding to two different clients.  Dont become to paranoid about securing your VPS. You are not a high priority target. The most important things are to disable root ssh access and just do sudo on a user account and I would suggest you disable password logins all together and use keys instead. Just pick secure passwords LastPass  Password for any services that do require a password. I think these are the most important things.,seedboxes,cosnjze,3,t5_2sqvk

7123183,0,t1_d1mtjrq,Not being techy is okayUnfortunately i do not know nor can dig up any server connection to mihama. You may have to link me to the provider to be able to give any sort of routing comments. Until then i will have to make a few assumptions on the target network your dealing with.As for spark that is a good step Global gateways sparks upstream network provider is very much clear of congestion.Unfortunately they can be a bit funny with routing too and since Spark are the ones that own it they dont exactly have alternative routes for you to travel.FTP instead of sftp is totally fine your not going to strike any of the third strike laws but i suspect that is not your issue here. The overhead of sftp is minimalAre you using a hardwired connection or wireless?Is your modem the HGb generally black or HGb generally whiteBe glad your not with the big red gorilla they do dodgy things with their network. Spark would actually be the second best isp i would recommend so your okay there!As a quick test  i would try downloading this. It is hosted in the Netherlands.

7256761,0,t1_d22vhnz,I  wholeheartedly disagree with them being crappy or unreliable.I cannot speak directly to issues others may have had in the past but I wanted to say I am a genuine seedbox enthusiast  private tracker addict and am a current Tuvix customer and couldnt be happier.Over the past month or so I trialed seedboxes from Feral Seedboxes.cc Seedhost.eu Seedbox.io RapidSeedBox Tuvix Hosting and probably another one Im forgetting atm. Anyway I have consistently gotten the fastest speeds from my Tuvix server and their response time to my tickets was faster on the whole than every other one of those companies I was with.To be fair none of the other companies really let it go over  hours but Id say most of them had an average of  hours turn around time for tickets. Tuvix has responded to all of my tickets so far within like    hours tops with several of them being within an hour or two or less.Theyve honestly bent over backwards for me which aside from the ratios Im pulling the support is what made me decide to increase my original budget for a box a bit and stick with them on a dedi. Id seen a couple of those threads you linked to before and asked the support guy about them directly in a ticket. He admitted that the guy who was running the show over there had some serious personalfamily issues that ended up affecting his ability to oversee things well and that the guy that was supposed to step up and fill in for him totally dropped the ball. He was straight with me and said that for that period of time response times to tickets went way up and some customers didnt get their problems handled correctly. Obviously I have no way to verify if their story checks out but he told me they took those prior issues seriously and let the guys who werent doing their jobs go and were there to make sure these sorts of things didnt happen again. And like I said theyve stayed true to their word with me so far and have delivered everything they said they would. I demoed one of their servers last week for a few days and am going to be writing up a full review on here sometime in the next couple of days with screenshots and stats and all that so whoever is interested feel free to check that out. But I was so impressed with them from the trial that I decided to stick with them and let the remaining couple of other boxes I was still on the fence about go.I plan to make progress posts here and there on how things continue to go for me with them so Ill let you guys know if they start to slip but needless to say theyve recently made a believer out of me. Sorry for the rant but my ADHD meds kicked in and had some extra energy I needed to get out. But seriously I wanted to share my own experience as it has been nothing but positive. Time will tell but personally I believe them that theyve turned things around over there and unless they give me a reason not to Im going to keep recommending them and sharing my experiences. ,seedboxes,d231ivk,3,t5_2sqvk

9967602,0,t1_db6ihdk,gt Because wget and aria arent as fast as segmented SFTPI personally like to rsync over ssh either from SB to Storage SB to Home or Storage to home. I do have a slow as fuck pipe at home tho.    It was more a general question because i do see a lot of replies about ftp and sftp speeds being slow. due to sometimes it being throttledshaped on the source or during peering.   In fact there are two such replies in this specific topic.    Shouldnt  help in these cases ?,seedboxes,db6szek,1,t5_2sqvk

10341762,0,t3_5nzgdv,I recently picked up a SYS its had pretty good specs and I was hoping to move there from my Hetzner auction machine. I try to upload a few things on BTN a week so I tried my SYS server to see how it would preform. Unfortunately I got a share ratio of . and . on my own uploads. Both uploads were grabbed around  times in the initial swarm so its pretty disappointing to see that performance.,seedboxes,dcgaq5a,1,t5_2sqvk

10492808,0,t1_dcxf88c,pretty sure the early days of k drives had jumpers amp im pretty sure my drive model is from the dd test at GB in addition to that attempting to run htop or even ls during a heavy write operation results in waiting for quite a long timethe proper test is a network download using large files i can clearly see the same write speed GB files from major providerson OSs that appear to use ram or cache to fake the speed the download will start out over MBs then eventually break down to the slow speed in fact on fedora it retried the connection once or twice in ubuntu it kept doing it over amp over,seedboxes,dcxgxew,1,t5_2sqvk
10526101,0,t1_dd18lar,gt ...This is the node causing all of your problems.. those pings are ridiculous but I can tell you its not on hetzners end. A VPN could help you because your connection to that server will probably be better and the connection between that server and yours will probably be good as well and in your case my ping ms to the server times  is far better than yours is now. Maybe unplug and plug in your modem see if that helps.. but this is caused by your ISPs routing to the server. EDIT It is probably a temporary issue if this is the first time it is happening? Wouldnt be sure. ,seedboxes,dd18xzv,1,t5_2sqvk

10622954,0,t3_5s1awa,Seedbox usually refers to a computerserver that resides in a datacenter anywhere in the world that you rentlease.  Because this seedbox is not located in your home it does not use your ISP or your home bandwidth.  If you prefer not to rentlease a seedbox in a datacenter you can build one yourself and run it from your home and thus use your ISP and your own bandwidth.,seedboxes,ddbodno,3,t5_2sqvk

10881737,0,t3_5virnw,Keep in mind youre on an overseas connection and even going through multiple countries after that.Youre never going to get a good speedtest with those kinds of HTTP tests its a single connection thats going max out at a few hundred KBs or MBs with a browser. Thats honestly not that bad.The key is segmented or multiple connections something both lftp and torrent sharing are very good at.Your torrents will have  peers each one of those able to pull multiple hundred KBs MBs or even higher if theyre closer to the servernot overseas. lftp has fantastic segmentingparallel downloading support so pulling files locally will be as fast as can be.Ive had no problems with Hetzner and downloads in a year or so Ive had them but I also know what the limitations are with traditional downloads and how to maximize my connections.,seedboxes,de2dgv4,1,t5_2sqvk
