Is it legal and does the weather allow for outdoors training? Does the town provide free spaces for sports and other activities? Maybe someone would allow you to train if you do exhibitions in exchange? Do actors want to learn more historical stage fighting and could give you a space to train in exchange for sharing what you learn? We were lucky enough the town gave us a space for free but id guess that varies a lot by country and city.This is optional but youd probably benefit from picking a single weapon to start though i wouldnt take long to diversify i find being able to compare several weapons helps. Picking one that is easy to gear up for is an option which might help get things started rapier and smallsword for example can be done without spending as much on gloves or the jacket. Picking one that allows you to read straight from the sources without translation is also nice. Something currently popular can also help get members so think vikings and GoT right now. Or of course whatever youd like to do but it hopefully fits into at least one of those. We screwed up here we came from choreography and used longswords and didnt follow any particular source so it was a bit messy.And of course when you get the chance go to seminars and learn from others.

2177782,0,t1_clgclpi,gt The fact that someone uses footwork similar to fencing in HEMA means that a sport fencer has started HEMA and his old or first trade is affecting this one. That is not a specific example. Well then Im not sure what you mean by a specific example. Fencing footwork is a specific coherent way to move I dont know what a better example of something you could export from fencing would be.gt Because if he uses only sport fencing footwork in longsword hell not receive much joy from it.And yet someone who does that disagrees with you.gt gt gt gt Yes I havent fenced epee. Mainly saber and I was shown and played a but with foils. I dont have much of an idea of epee to be honest. And I admitted that fencing footwork isnt help any rapierist or smallswordsman but not someone training longsword or sampb.Im not sure its any good to argue about this so Im dropping it. People from Bruce Lee to the originators of boxing have stolen fencing footwork and tempo ideas but if you dont see it I guess you dont see it.gt gt gt gt Well from the sound of it he needs better sparring partners. I myself cannot tell how good someone is at fencing by the way they type much less how good their sparring partners are so I cant make that evaluation. He sounds to me like a pretty serious fencer.gtThe advance lunge he describes I not something alien to HEMA but if he had good sparring partners they wouldve punished him enormously for using twotime ripostes which in longsword give a twotime option to return. Epee uses one tempo actions on the blade called opposition counters and two tempo actions called parryripostes. It is not the case in epee that you can always make a one tempo action on the blade. I would bet that its not the case in anything. Its also not the case in epee that a two tempo attack is always slow or incorrect and I bet thats not always the case in other weapons like longsword or whatever either. A beat attack for example or a second intention parry riposte both are more than one tempo. If you think that one tempo actions are always correct its possible that your sparring partners are not punishing you for this mistake.

2391699,0,t3_2mr1ij,I just came from fiore tons of grappling into German stuff and just had a breakthrough after having this same problem.  Heres what I learned.My style consists of  steps throw the mastercut that is most likely to counter their strike and give you cover.  Example thwart against Vom tag or squint against plow or thwart to the body against ox. if  didnt hit move your blade to cover their most likely attack and thrust. Example ox if their blade is high or plow if their blade is low.  Make sure your crossguard is at  degrees pointing at where you think their attack will come from.  This protects your hands. if the thrust from  didnt connect they will either disengage your guard in  protects you from getting struck while they back away or they are in range for a grapple because their hands should be very near.Im still new at the German stuff but this is working well right now.

If you are not comfortable with the level of intensity you receive from a partner then let them know you would like to slow things down.

I did a quick search of Fiori Gladatoria Liechtenauer and Silver for the words finger thumb and grip and the only relevant passages were from Silver Cap. gtRemember in putting forth your sword point to make your space narrow when he lies upon his Stocata or any thrust you must hold the handle thereof as it were along your hand resting the pommel thereof in the hollow part of the middle of the heel of your hand towards the wrist amp the former part of the handle must be held between the forefinger amp thumb without the middle joint of the forefinger towards the top thereof holding that finger somewhat straight out gripping round your handle with your other  fingers amp laying your thumb straight towards his the better to be able to perform this action perfectly for if you grip your handle close out thwart? in your hand then you cannot lay your point straight upon his to make your space narrow but that your point will still lie too wide to do the same in due time amp this is the best way to hold your sword in all kinds of variable fight. Emphasis mineConsidering this is a section on using sword and dagger I assume this is a onehanded grip.  Still my interpretation of it is that the thumb and forefinger are not tightly gripping and it is the other three fingers that are which is essentially what is done with in Japanese arts.That said Im not intimately familiar with any of these treatises so perhaps somebody with more context can correct me.,wma,cobq3rw,1,t5_2qo6j

3204492,0,t1_cotspz0,The bit in question gt He isnt fencing hes just standing aroundI dont want to speak on Pauls behalf but I think they are testing one specific claim can a backsword like weapon create active cover against a quarterstaff. It should be noted that this is a vastly different position to can a person armed with a backsword fence against somebody with a backsword. I think the later part is closer to an actual fencing display. However it is marred by the three fencers being unfamiliar with fighting against a quarterstaff with their swords. Also Tim the all black fighter isnt using a heavy backsword but is actually using a Hutton Sabre which compared to most c backswords is fairly light and nimble. In the video Tim fairs decently against the quarterstaff but his inexperience fighting the weapon shows. He creates cover on more than one occasion but fails to get into measure allowing meaning that he can never threaten Paul. Paul is left open to continually attack Tim and just like the masters say Tim eventually loses. Tim is fairly decent and knowledgeable. He posts on this subreddit. Overall I think that the major problem is that Stoccata rarely crosses weapons outside of same v same and this leads to an environment of potentially skilled fighters not knowing wtf to do. ,wma,cou5863,1,t5_2qo6j

3580856,0,t1_cq0fhld,gt  My thoughts as just a reader is that the footwork for a form is not set in place the main part is which leg you move not exactly at waht angle you move it.Yes.  Foot work is to control distance angle and measure in a fight.  Since you can never be sure what your opponent is going to do having preset footwork might not serve you well and make you less adaptable.  That being said the assalti of the Bolognese are meant to teach basic principles of the weapon involved and perhaps just as importantly develop grace and flow in your fighting.  You are right to say that that the footwork as described is fairly vague but if you read into other parts of his writings one can begin to see that the footwork is actually fairly precise at least when it comes to which angle to move it on.  I am working on an article on the subject which I hope to finish by the end of April stay tuned.While in a fight you probably have better things to worry about than what angle your foot is passing on but in the assalti it is important to practice precise footwork so that you dont have to think about it when the time comes.  I am sure Marozzo was well versed in the concept of Perfect practice makes perfect.,wma,cq0g2f5,3,t5_2qo6j
3582964,0,t1_cq0nhgo,Unless you can back that up with facts thats just your opinion.  I strongly disagree with you.The flowing graceful motions of Bolognese are very efficient they arent just for show. A falso to parry a blow is used in the same motion as the tramazzone or mandritto to riposte.  That same mandritto can be used to parry an incoming blow if the first one was just a feint. Its about accomplishing many things with a single motion and then seamlessly flowing into the next action depending on your enemies actions.  Also the Italians love love love the one tempo counter you cant get more efficient than that!Economy of action is a big part of Bolognese fencing and is a big part of what they mean by grace.

4515423,0,t3_3cv0y5,Hi im Federico and Custodia Tertia is my blog. I decided to write short articles on my blog because most of the time people become bored in read a lot of words on pc so my article want basically to made people think about some aspects of fencing.How a well designed sword is?A well designed sword have a good mass forward that can be launched using her pivot points the more the swordsman gain experience the more our point of balance can be placed forward. My type XIV sword have is POB at  cm from the cross but it can be placed forward with the growing of skill sometime an unbalanced sword is a good sword i had chance to handle some XV century swords in Armeria Reale in Turin that are realy heavy in the hand.Wath is this certain Mechanic?Dont smash the blade in the enemy using an arc just pull it down and push it forward in a relaxed way tense just at last when the bind occurs I practice Traditional Ju Jutsu same as punching in some waysAt wich intensity the training was done?Different intensities as at the event i go Berlin Buckler Bouts the speed is based on the level of skill of the two opponent the more is the skill the more people go faster and harder.The muscles problem Is not a realy good way to say it but Strike with tendrillons and not with muscles some martial arts instructors say that. so use more the withe part of the muscles than the red one to do this just move toward the enemy without tense up then tense up just during the impact and then relax again when you aremoving in the bind and playing with the enemy sword etc. etc.I must say in fact that when you do that you dont telegraph the strike in fact is exactly the opposit.I think i am not at all the martial artist i want to be but im improving. I practice Shinto Muso Ryu JoJutsu Yoshin Ryu Ju Jutsu and I. ars Dimicatoria that is my main goal I also use the I.

They are also holding their arms too highstraight when on guard which would make them easy targets if you ask me.When he demonstrates the parries when facing the camera you could also tell that he was parrying wider than necessary or at least with a larger action.

5298064,0,t1_cvousls,ya I think that is the main gist of it.  If someone is hold a guard and is not really holding it strong then yes you might be able to cut right through it and make the hit.  That said I see two ways of doing that cut  . cut to the weak part of their blade and make contact with the force that is required to break their guard. Or . Cut with as much force as you can muster to hammer through their sword at any point strong or weak.  Option one gets the same point across with less chance of injury but takes a bit more skill then just muscling through their guard.  I also would consider option one coaching.  Option  could get you labeled an ass hole.  I just went to my first tournament this weekend after training in hema for about  years.  Only one person at that tournament was hitting way too hard too bad it was the guy who organized it so I dont think many people brought it up.  Dont get me wrong the guy had some skills but also made many people see stars and bent a lot of masks.  I have a feeling some people lost to him over simple fear of getting injured.  I think this will be a debatable topic for many many years to come and what one might consider too hard others might not.  That said if you injure someone you need to step back and remind yourself you mostly do this for fun so does your opponent.  If someone gets injured thats just one less person you have to train with.,wma,cvow0ck,3,t5_2qo6j

I used to compete in Epee was never very good but within our club theres a lot of respect and interest on both sides of the blade.In fact the more historical fencing I do the more willing I am to get rid of my classical mentality when fencing modern styles and just enjoy the athleticism and intellectual difficulty of modern fencing.

Off the top of my head Fabrice Cognot Daniel Jacquet PierreAlexandre Chaize PierreHenry Bas for example. gt Really? Care to cite that claim? Please do better than a tripod.com site with terribly low res animated gifs. That is not representative of fencers. If you want to represent what Fencers say their history is study Santelli or Elthes not some dude with a tripod site.Sorry is FIE good enough for you You tell us how accurate that part isgt Thrusting fencing which according to Vegce allowed the successes of the Roman soldiers is almost nonexistent in the Middle Ages because the only law is then that of the strongest in combats where the mace the battle axe the halberd or the twohanded sword could not match with the subtlety of thrusting fencing.I cant even believe I found that here. I have it the French version in an old  or something book somewhere but I would have thought that the FIE would have redacted that since then.Being French I have a clearer view of the French and European scene.

The site for CSG had pictures added in . Im not trying to put them down but given the dead nature of their websites and my experience with a historical fencing group I met at the Renaissance fair period clothing one guy referred to HEMA as what we do but with a bunch of clumsy punching and kicking and shoving. Another proudly corrected me with Ochs when I said I noticed him slip into Fenestra. I saw your hands they were at shoulder level... you may understand my trepidation.

6615290,0,t1_d03k4ca,I think we can say with some certainty that the idea of modern fair play divisions along sex weight and age lines is something that mostly emerged in the th century along with the notion of sports itself as we understand it.  Thats when you start to see the formal rules created for ball games such as football and baseball.  Its also when you start to see wild dangerous events such as prize fighting turned into controlled boxing with weight divisions rounds and including an official to control the conduct.  Before that the only rules imposed on prize fighting were pretty crude.  Like try not to overtly murder him too much.  Of course the way we do HEMAWMA outside of tournaments is also anachronistic since not many of us are intentionally hurting each other.  So maybe we just have to accept the fundamental impossibility of ever understanding how people truly fought with swords.,wma,d03ksoe,-1,t5_2qo6j

The emphasis is not that the point is up as much as the point is offline.Cutting through the crown in the article resembles Slicingoff ab schneiden.Mark...That the two Underslices pertain to driving against the fencers that like to run in with outstretched arms that drive thus when he binds on your sword and drives high up with the arms into kron and runs into you on your left side then invert your sword into hanging point so that your thumb comes below and fall in with the long edge under the pommel in his arm and press upward with the slice.My personal opinion is that the names for the guards denote function more than precise positioning.  This is backed up by different weapons sharing the same guard terminology.  Are your hands high and not inverted with a horizontal line of defence at head level offering no threat with your point?  Its kron.Halfswording is different enough that this new interpretation still fits.  In all the traditional interpretations and this new one the point is offline and the arms are extended high to protect the head.,wma,d09fqg1,2,t5_2qo6j

8691942,0,t3_4yyqk3,I wont add what others have already said but I will give you some tips on how to bring up your issues with out calling anyone out.  You might ask a question like I have been researching tournaments around the USAEurope not sure where you are all of them seem to be synthetic and steel and none are doing wood why is that?  Ask some questions about where is everyone buying their gear from?  What would you recommend a beginner buying?I had some issues when I first started a few years ago.  The club I go to is great but when I first showed up everyone had pretty normal fencing gear almost no real hema gear  and we were using rawling long swords that were very floppy.  At first I was like what the heck is this they have tons of people and we are all using gear setups that would have been fine in the late s but this doesnt look like the hema I see on the internet  Well it turns out the club started a long time ago and not many people had the money to upgrade gear.  After I asked about purple heart armory and spes and other gear companies ect... my couch said oh that stuff is great and we wont ever buy new rawlings but we try to replace equipment every few years.  When we buy new stuff we are going to move to newer nicer synthetics.  If you feel like buying some so we can test them please do.  Well I bought myself a new sword a pentii  many club members followed suit.  Shortly after that a few feders started to show up and more people upgrade gear.  Now we look like many other clubs lots of spes steel all sorts of other brands of gear arms and armory feders ect...So I guess ask questions and lean on being naive and see what answers you get.  If you get a responds like you have to feel pain to learn how to protect yourself! or wood is traditional and you can expect to have broken fingers ect... thats just the way it is  you may want to look around for some other club that better fits what your looking for.  On the other hand you may get the responds similar to what I got.  we just dont have much money and one of our club mates makes these wooden swords.  Or anything you want to use is fine with us  I should also say that if you ever feel like something is not safe say so.  I have attended a tournament where someone was not happy with the flex of an opponents sword a really stiff blunt longsword.  He said Hey Im no wuss or anything but I dont want to fight someone with a blunt I just dont want broken ribs over something I do for fun in my spare time.  He was meet with respect and the opponent was able to use a friends feder for the match and all went on like normal no judgment or issues.  YMMV but for the most part people in HEMA are respectful if you are not listened too or respected..... find another group of people to sword fight with.Its a fighting art and some injuries are going to happen but that doesnt mean you should expect them or that you should do nothing to prevent them.  I know it can be hard to speak up when your the new guygal but others might be thinking the same thing.  If you feel like mentioning where youre located even just state or province you might find other people here that can help you find a better fitting club.,wma,d6s4dz2,7,t5_2qo6j

Im familiar with the Silvers concept of True Time although I always thought it has to do with safety rather than proper power generation.I think what I should try is keep my arm bent a little more so that I can extend it while striking further like you said and generate a bigger motion to accelerate the sword.Making a riposte isnt a problem for me since you bring the sabre quite close to your body so I feel right at home there coming from a Medieval system its striking from engaging guards that are already extended is what giving me trouble.,wma,dad38vg,2,t5_2qo6j

10157977,0,t1_dbvg4hc,You are treating the head as a fixed point though.The spring can only compress as far as the amount of force applied to both sides allows. The limit to this is the inertia provided by the head for any blow of sufficient force that wed need to worry about concussions. When the spring is struck on one side it will compress up until the point where the inertia of the head is exceeded. At that point no further compression will occur. Instead the head will accelerate an amount that reflects the total imbalance between the force applied by the weapon and the inertia of the head itself .This is in fact no different than what happens if there is no spring. The spring only changes the amount of distance that the force needs to be applied over which changes the energy required to cause acceleration but doesnt change the amount of force. For any blow that is sufficient to cause a concussion we should assume that providing force over sufficient distance i.e. some amount smaller than the thickness of the padding is trivially accomplished unless you are assuming that the opponent is striking to the helmet rather than the head. ,wma,dbvgopd,1,t5_2qo6j

No. Was every historical sword made to the same dimensions? No.Was there a fairly high likelihood that you have to fight someone who had a largersmaller sword than yours? Hell Yes!People shouldnt be punished for going with a longer sword if who they study says to have a sword of that length. And its very anachronistic to do so. You know what a master back then would have said about fighting someone with a larger weapon? Most likely rely on your art,wma,dcljtj5,0,t5_2qo6j
10399225,0,t3_5omj59, What mastertradition are you studying? That will give better indicator of what length you should be looking at. Vadi is the only one to give proportions relative to you body for the various parts although handle length may need to be lengthened depending on what hand protection you use.For the Italians Vadi likes a long blade while Fiore appears to favour shorter blade some conjecture that he shows a blade short enough to be wielded in one hand without great difficulty. The german schools likewise have their variances.Tournament wise it seems some of the larger Northern Hemisphere tournament provide blades so practicing with a shorter blade would be advantagous when you are preparing for these.Make enquiries of Regenyei or Castille. They appear to have the most reliable turn around on orders and communications but you are still likely to have a few months waiting on your orders. Some Regenyei swords are resold by stockist with a noticable mark up and tend to be made from his default blade length which is half way between the range he provides for his standard orders.,wma,dcmthfe,1,t5_2qo6j
10412365,0,t3_5p2ut2,I practice Longsword and Sword and buckler as well as dagger and wrestling but lets focus on mainly longsword since it is by far the most popularThere are three areas of training that you want to include in a most optimal format.. Skill Training. Strength Training. Fitness Training Cardiorespiratory mainlySkill training consists of performing the specific activities that you wish to excel at in your area of study. On a surface level this could be doing a large number of cuts and transitioning through guards but ideally it would be going through specific plays or doing specific free play exercises that encourage you to develop your body to excel at specific tasks.Sparring has a specific role in testing the level of physical and cognitive development you have achieved it lets you know what you are doing well and what you need to improve upon but you need to do activities other than sparring to further hone the skills that sparring has shown you need to work on.Strength training consist of some resistance training program it could be body weight machine driven or free weights. Even holding your sword in a high guard for like  minutes while watching something could be considered strength training. Now for Strength training you have several goals that you could be looking for those goals include Strength Power Hypertrophy and Muscular Endurance. If you are new to or not consistently involved in a strength training program you want to start developing your body for hypertrophy that is to say that you want to increase the crosssectional area and mass of your skeletal muscles. To accomplish this you want to design a weight training program in a very specific way you want to find your  Rep Max when applicable and you want to work with a weight that is between  and  percent of that your goal should be    sets with repetitions from    per set and you should rest for  seconds to a minute and a half between sets of the same exercise.If you are experienced with strength training and do it consistently you might want to start developing your body for power as that is where most of HEMA longsword benefits from. For power oriented strength training different from Power Lifting you want to ideally be doing    percent of your  Rep Max which might have changed if you last measured it a month ago when you were training for hyper trophy and you want to be doing    sets sets of only    repetitions per set and you want to allow a greater rest period between sets    minutesNow what exercises would be the most beneficial to HEMA longsword? Well major muscle groups to target would include Your arms and chest Brachioradialis very important for almost all armed HEMA Triceps brachii Biceps brachii Deltoids Posterior anterior and lateral and Pectoralis Major. Your back and core Trapezius Latissimus Dorsi Rhomboids Your Rotator Cuff Supraspinatus Subscapularis Infraspinatus Teres Minor Internal and External Obliques  Rectus abdominis and Transverse adominis. Your legs and butt Quadriceps Rectus femoris Vastus medialis vastus lateralis your Hamstrings Bicep Femoris Semitendinosus Semimembranosus your Triceps surae Gastrocnemius and Soleus and your Gluteus Maximus it is difficult to target the Gluetues Medius and MinimusWow that is almost your whole body so in order to hit all of those you have several options available to you the first is breaking up your strength training workouts which should be    times a week into different days for different muscle groups IE Leg day chest and arms day back and core day etc another option is to set up various circuit rotations for your workout so while your legs are resting from your squats you go to do your bench press and work your chest and triceps then you go to work your back and biceps with rows and then back to the squats.You also want to work on your cardiorespiratory fitness level there are many ways to accomplish this from activities such as running cycling and swimming to machines such as the treadmill elliptical stairmaster etc. However there are several caveats here to make note of. The first is that training your body for strength affects a particular muscle fiber type Type II Fasttwitch muscles fibers particularly Type IIB Doing long distancestamina based activities such as prolonged runningcycling work a different type of muscle fibers Type I Slow twitch. At first this might seem like a good thing but developing one of these actually impedes the developmentgrowth of the other. Knowing this you might want to consider how you develop your cardiorespiratory fitness level and it might lead you to focus on shorter period but higher intensity activities which incidentally are time saving as well In particular an effective route are exercises referred to as HIIT HighIntensity Interval Training also known as HighIntensity Intermittent Exercise. This will still allow you to grow your VOmax and train your heart and lungs but will still support and develop those Type II fibers from strength training.Lastly we want to talk about stretching you could argue that it might have advantages into your lunge or something else but the main reason why you should stretch often is Injury prevention. Stretching prevents injuries stretch before and after your skill training your strength training and your cardiorespiratory fitness training.This is based on our current understanding of the various sciences relating to sport and exercise if this understanding changes then you will have to incorporate those changes and reevaluate how you train.,wma,dcob560,6,t5_2qo6j

Is that what you have in mind?In any case different sources have different empahsis on guards. Early German sources such as LiechtenauerRingeck suggests that all you need are ochs pflug alber vom tag. See paragraph .Later sources such as Meyer while acknowledging that the  main guards are ochs pflug alber vom tag also suggest a whole host of secondary guards like Wrathful Guard Long Point Changer Close Guard Iron Door Hanging Point Key and Unicorn. See chapter  on Of the Stances or Guards.In my opinion it might seem like a U shape in one source text it might not be necessary true in other sources. As well why cant it be a  shape with left ochsgt left vom taggt high vom tag gt right vom taggt right ochs?If you combine all the guards then you get a nice oval shape covering the body.

10725443,0,t3_5tanrq,Before I start my thoughts on this Im not denying the outcome of this strike. Obviously it worked heres what Im thinkingPath of attack hes attacking basically straight downward at the target since its so low. This allows for the most amount of power for even a small tap. Most taps I see during sparring or tournaments are directed forward to maximize reach Id be genuinely interested if he could replicate the result in a similar manner.Hanging target when a target is hung from up top Gravity will help tear at the cutting point downwards more than if a target is standing via its own weight. Exception would be outstretched arms Age of carcass we dont know how long the pig is dead. The older it is the easier it would be to cut flesh.Weight of sword we dont know how heavy the actual blade is. If this thing is absurdly balanced with a super heavy blade but absolutely razor sharp then it would accentuate the previous points even more. We just dont know.Now again Im not trying to invalidate this. Thatd be stupid it obviously worked. But just wanted to point out there are a lot of factors and unknown variables that went into that success. All that Im cautioning for are people not to think that all tippy taps will have the same result. I highly encourage everyone to try test cutting themselves to see what theyre capable of instead of looking at a video and assuming that all results will be the same.,wma,ddm8zw2,7,t5_2qo6j

11015027,0,t3_5x2t5o,This was a great article.  One of the things that isnt mentioned here is that HEMA is fundamentally different from other weaponoriented activities like LARP SCA HMB etc. by its being at least informed by test cutting and even by its competitions usually being judged by judges vs. some kind of system.  Im not passing judgment on these other combatlike activities just acknowledging a difference  e.g. SCA scoring comes down to whether you yourself feel like the hit you just took would have been disabling or incapacitatingfatal and its an honor system to call these when you get them.Test cutting and judging seem like potentially important checks on the pointsfighting nature of competitions because. Test cutting with sharp weapons gives us a realistic understanding of how they really work in the real world and what types of techniques appear to produce real results.  I would be totally in favor of more exploration of test cutting in general and how we can further inform judging of HEMA competition with what we learn from cutting.  Full disclosure I havent done any test cutting at this point yet.  However from watching even a little its pretty obvious that swords worked man and someone who can align the edge can cut tatami.  What is less clear is how well say a cut that is not parried very well and still lands would do to a human skull.  Maybe there is a way to develop better analogs for test cutting than tatami that can help us expand our understanding in this way.I wonder if this type of research would allow us to sharpen heh heh our understanding of whether what we do in competitions would be martially effective.  . As above cutting can inform judges but the other important thing is that competitions really are judged and not simply scored.  In Olympic fencing there is no afterblow rule and this allows for the elimination of certain techniques focused on covering the line while striking  and it also facilitates electronic scoring.  HEMA obviously doesnt really work like that because we usually use an afterblow rule of some kind but I think the main thing that is doing the work in competitions is that we have judges making judgments about say whether that grazing tip cut on someones hand is enough to stop the exchange.  That is to say HEMA judging at present really does revolve around judgments of whether the fencer has used a martially effective technique.    ,wma,degitao,5,t5_2qo6j

11533509,1,t1_dg39nrn,It was much cleaner than most HEMA tournaments. Also yeah its linear. Going around as German sources say actually sucks in real fighting it takes too long which is why nobody does that in tournaments.,wma,dg3bq66,-2,t5_2qo6j

11555946,0,t1_dg5togc,gt used to rely on the shield to protect them and later relied on armor to protect themThats incrdeibly simplistic. Fighters wore very good armour even at the heyday of the large medieval shields. When greatswords were the thing on the battlefield there was still no plate and yet a lot of fighters would hold their swords in two hands and put the shiled on their back.Any spadroon and any arming sword are very very different in terms of how mass is distributed and how the weapon is used.Actually especially in colder parts of Europe people would walk with gambesons all the time. And no a thick th C coat is not comparable to a gambeson in terms of cutting resistance.And while most strikes are aimed at the headneck area that doesnt mean most strikes fell there. People are very particulat to protect their head.gt but the core of Liechtenauers system which is the Vier LegerVier Versetzen interation is flawed and just doesnt work when applied as specifically written.First of all you are presuming that the Vier Versetzen are dsecribed as they should be directly done. That is not so. They describe principles.gtExcept no... they dont which is why nobody uses it in tournaments. That is quite a ridiculous statement and it is simply wrong which can be eaisly proven by getting any random  videos of good tournament fencers. Some people already did that in this discussion you ignored it.,wma,dg5vcd8,2,t5_2qo6j

11596631,0,t3_65hzsr,Maybe once but our oldest Treatises are lt years old. Gladiatorial contests were long gone by then. Thats not to say the Romans didnt write it down frankly I think it would be odd if they hadnt but it hasnt survived. For the trident particularly you may be able to compare it to a shorter spear but accounting for the other prongs,wma,dgahizw,3,t5_2qo6j
11637656,0,t1_dgf37eh,I think Waites problem here is that the man in question raised his sword well above his head. The guy in this video did not do such a thing. Waites instruction to halving the sheep carcass was to cut it as he instructed to cut the lead. Although the video doesnt show a picture perfect representation of Waites illustration it seems close enough to me.,wma,dgf53kt,1,t5_2qo6j

Im in walking distance to my college but my SO had the campus police called on him and his training equipment taken without any way to get it back after practicing on campus. It was knife fighting so I understand it looked much more real but I dont wanna run the chance of losing my new  dollar investment P,wma,dghgtxv,3,t5_2qo6j
