9041550,0,t1_d7yfv2a,Just to add on to the reports of lack of power I would say  of those reportscomplaints went away after the car was broken in. This car apparently does legitimately have a learning curve for the ECU. It can take around miles for the car to really wake up. The B pillar rattle is a complaint a fair few people have had and while Ford has issued a fix its worked for some and not others. That being said Ford is saying that cars built after May should not have this issue but we have yet to really get feedback about those cars. ,FordFocusRS,d7ynetf,2,t5_38jy3

Just in case you didnt know when you throw it in Track mode and the dampers switch the dampers can be individually set to normal mode by pressing the button at the tip of the indicator stalk. So you can have it in track mode more relaxed ESC and heavier steering compared to Sport mode but without the spinebreaking roughness of Sport dampers. And you are almost spot on about the shifting point peak torque is . ,FordFocusRS,deda9tg,1,t5_38jy3
