Another reason we are looking to incorporate other venues besides Pinballz is to put the focus on having playable machines throughout the city. We want to establish relationships with the local operators. If we say Hey we are having weeklymonthly events here with a nice built in crowd of guaranteed business as long as the machines are in nice order we figure it will be good incentive to keep the machines in good shape.

60125,0,t1_cel9opd,I got  bar of service in my house in south Austin.  Never got high speed data.  Coverage map shows i am in a good location.  I called they told me that among other things my house was in a low area and would never get good cell reception.  My house is on a fucking hill.  They also said that my TVs or microwave could disrupt my service.I had them for  years  lines of service.  When I canceled my service they gave me  early termination fees that ended up about .  I said I was out of contract I have never gotten a new phone.  Apparently changing your plan will also change your contract.  I was forced to change my plan because I needed to travel internationally and when i switched back my old plan was no longer available.  After explaining this to a very rude supervisor she said she would wave the fees.   months later I received a collections call for the fees.  When i called them back they said they had no record of my fees being waived.  I had the supervisors name and they told me that they have never heard of that person and unless I could provide some proof the fees would stand.That was a year ago.  I switched to ATT have gb of data shared across  lines including  tablets.  Have not had a single issue.  Get great coverage at my house despite my microwave and televisions.Now maybe mine was just an isolated incident but my career also has me working indirectly with cell phone carrierssell cellular enabled devices to the DoD and I have heard similar stories from other people about them.,Austin,cel9xtm,1,t5_2qhn5
60356,0,t1_cel7bd4,gt Texas doesnt have an income tax for individuals either.But it does have property business and sales taxes.  Are we going to claim that the Sriracha factory isnt going to be positioned on property wont be classified as a business and isnt going to be distributing the product retail?Now admittedly the factory is getting lured with a big tax break.  But then tax breaks were what lured Sriracha to the California location in the first place.  And those tax breaks were contingent on the factory managing the waste byproduct produced by its plant.  Texas isnt offering tax breaks so much as it is promising to allow the company to recklessly dispose of hazardous waste products.gt For US distribution Texas is kinda centrallylocated compared to California. And it has a port Houston for international distribution.Texas is rapidly increasing the number of toll roads within the state.  If you want to do business here youre going to pay through the nose riding on our highway system  something in the area of . per mile once you get on one of those turnpikes.  Position yourself on the wrong road and you will be paying a phenomenal amount of money in transportation fees.Central location is nice but Sriracha would be better off locating in Nebraska or Kansas if thats its only concern. ,Austin,celavtk,4,t5_2qhn5

226415,0,t3_1wp6h9,I highly recommend checking out meetup.com as there are several groups that meet your interests.Im part of Boards and Brews but that meets every Thursday and is a bit down from you at Burnett. Instead I would recommend the Central Texas Boardgame group that meets up at Wonkos games every Wednesday. Age isnt really a factor there as many people are there just to learn some new games. Link to their group If interested in boards and brews as they tend to be a bit younger in age link is For a group of girls in general I know a few people in girl geeks of austin. Though most of their events are Central  South Austin. You may want to check their link out atFor a hiking group that has many young people I highly recommend going to the Hiking and fun outdoors activities around Austin way to long of name IMO. The group is ran by a younger couple is great at being welcoming. They even walk the path before hand and during the day of the event one will be the lead while the other is an anchor so no one gets lost. Their link is Finally a shameless self promote of my group Austin Explorers. We are a group of people    who want to try new things in Austin ie board games go karting laser tag hiking glass blowing new bars etc. Anything that seems interesting I tend to do. I highly recommend anyone in this thread that just wants hang out with some laid back people to come on out. Next meetup is this Wednesday at Dave and Busters which is half of during that day. Link is Finally do yourself a favor and one day make your way to Pinballz off of . Its a retro to current arcade that is a really fun place to hang out. Walking distance to that is Emerald Tavern which is a cafebar they make a great cappuccino that caters to the board game crowd.

264318,0,t1_cf83spk,No there isnt. Fostering with APA is very flexible. I became a cat foster late last year. My first pair of kittens were already with another foster but she and her husband were leaving to Europe for a couple months and couldnt continue taking care of them. So they contacted the foster manager about the situation and they put out a notice that they needed someone to take over fostering for them. I volunteered drove to her house picked them up and they were adopted by a nice couple who came to visit them at my place two weeks later.My second pair of kittens were also with another foster before I got them. This time the foster was having trouble with them because they had medical issues and required frequent trips to the vet and she had a fulltime job and lived in Round Rock so it was a huge strain on her. I took them from her because I have more flexibility with my time and I think she picked up an older foster cat later the older ones dont require so much work.I typically take a two week break between fosters. Theres no pressure at all from the shelter that you need to be continually fostering. I highly recommend you apply to the program. I love it and its great getting to play with kittens for a few weeks without having to take them in permanently. Just dont get too attached. The only part I dislike is having to take them down to the shelter to get spayedneutered vaccines etc. I have to drive downtown for that and usually get stuck in traffic for a significant amount of time. But I only have to do that once every couple of weeks or so.,Austin,cf85mpi,5,t5_2qhn5

Back then nobody knew the long term health effects of secondhand smoke and it was everywhere. I like the fact I get to work in an office that isnt full of smoke. Unlike the s this time around employers are leaning on the side of safety and banning them before half of the employees are smoking ecigs inside the building. We do not know the long term effects nor will we for a while. Is it really that hard for a smoker to just walk outside while theyre at work to a designated smoking area? What have smokers who work for WilCo been doing for the past decade? Perhaps going  hours without a cigarette or just stepping off the property?  ,Austin,cf8ye8d,19,t5_2qhn5

Nullification isnt an express power its one we are able to grant to ourselves in a matter of speaking. That doesnt mean its wrong or illegal. It doesnt mean its right either but it is a power the jury has and it has roots deep in US history. You dont have to explain your verdict to anyone nor can you be compelled to change your verdict by anyone. Its similar to how the Supreme Court granted itself the power to find laws unconstitutional and strike them down. It was never specifically granted the USSC has that power but they do. ,Austin,cfl4skj,6,t5_2qhn5

413472,0,t3_1yo1a7,The reason this post has  points is because this entitled mentality is exactly whats wrong with Austins music industry. Local concert attendees look at a  cover as a fee instead of an investment in the local scene. Look most local artists are not selling out venues and Austinites need to support us to sustain. I realize youre saying I dont want you to play for free! but in reality thats exactly what youre suggesting by removing the cover charge. Unless youre playing to a packed house the  of the bar and merch sales are not going to cover gas and our equipment loan payments  MAYBE well break even. Ive seen people complain about  cover then go straight to the bar and order a  Jameson amp coke. You say there are no free options. Free week. Some of the biggest names that played SXSW last year did so at Auditorium Shores free of charge.

453657,0,t1_cfrtit2,It doesnt surprise me though. It seems a lot of Reddit in general is high school  college aged students or young adults who have decided that growing up really isnt an option yet in their life. Probably even more so in this sub due to UT. When I was their age I thought the world was very cut and dry as well. I still had my parents to fall back on for support so it was easy for me to advocate issues that was generous with other peoples money. I had seriously volunteered for the local Democrat office believing their ideas would bring about an utopia. Perhaps once I no longer had my parents to fall back on for support I could always fall back on the government.Then you grow up and realize the world isnt so black and white. Most college aged students believe they know what it means to work hard because of a big midterm they had to study for. Most of the time college work is nothing compared to realworld. Thats when my eyes were really opened and my position begun to change. Ill spout off another opinion that wont be popular on here at all. If Republicans stopped with their family values bullshit and were more open to social liberal ideas I would be a huge supporter of most Republican candidates.

Once they were out the various developers were going to buy the vacant land. They got caught and it was trashed but it was never really made public. The only reason I know is because my husband was interning under someone who was working with the city council. If this is just a group of busy bodies within the community trying to get their hands in what can or cannot be developed within the community then that is somewhat tolerable. But if this is a push by developers to be able to move in then that is a nogo. The biggest reason I worry is because of the corner store ordinance. People on here keep saying that it is just going to allow corner stores in the area but everyone seems to be ignoring that I already pointed out that we already have corner stores in the neighborhood. I have one just two blocks from my house. So clearly the zoning already allows neighborhood stores to be built here. The ordinance theyre suggesting will allow any retail store that is  sq ft or smaller in the area with a small parking lot.  sq ft is almost twice the size of every single house in my area. I mean Im ok with some of the provisions like increasing the bike lanes the side walks and Im into the smaller housing lots Im just leery of rezoning laws. They havent exactly turned out well for other parts of Austin. Im from here. I used to live in the  area and went to the Zilker school district when I was a kid. Back then it was predominantly Hispanic and low income. Now its all rich people and uber modern housing. I can get down with some beneficial community development but the citys track record with me isnt exactly sparkling. ,Austin,cg46rlv,1,t5_2qhn5

Cedar Park is at least twice that far so roughly  to get to Cedar Park Center.  I would definitely check out Metro Rail.  It will get you close to the Cedar Park Center at either the Lakeline or Leander stations and you can call a cab to get you the rest of the way from there. Unfortunately you would have to catch a cab all the way back downtown after the show but at least you can minimize your expense on the way up there.  The Southbound train quits running after PM.

Just because someones interested in data behind an organization claiming to do good doesnt mean theyre somehow responsible for a negative paradigm shift in public education or policy. The fact that youre getting so defensive and personally insulting indicates to me youre not very familiar with acting at the organizational level where documenting progress outcomes work and resources are integral parts of developing and maintaining a healthy responsible and accountable program.edit A few years ago I worked for a summer camp that sounds pretty similar to the one OPs mentioned. El Ranchito is an amazing program and has two camps that operate simultaneously during the month of June one for younger kids entering grades  and one for older kids entering grades . Theres a family income cap for the students who participate. For the younger kids its a small price to get into the Nature Discovery Camp  for a weeklong sleepaway camp and for the older kids its no cost to attend the day camp and they actually earn money working for a conservation corps crew doing trail work learning about nature resource management and teambuilding.

851932,0,t1_ch11j84,gt I know I know  the idea of reducing taxes is anathema to government but it IS possible.I really suggest you reconsider your framing here for a number of reasons. Property taxes both rates and actual amounts paid have regularly varied in taxing jurisdictions in Texas throughout the years.  The snide comment about reducing taxes is anathema to government makes me think youre more interested in ideology than facts.. You have the relationship between taxes and spending wrong governments at least Texas taxing jurisdictions for the most part set their spending levels first then set their taxes after.  Proposals to reduce taxes for one group without corresponding proposals to reduce spending are merely proposals for making some people pay more taxes and others less.  Maybe thats a good idea!  But posing it as a tax cut when every dollar cut is paid by another taxpayer is disingenuous.. Reducing property taxes for xeroscapers is conceptually very similar to establishing a spending program that gives money in exchange for xeroscapers.  If you cant see the economic equivalence of spending on tax breaks  loopholes and spending on direct programs that doesnt scream serious candidate to me.,Austin,ch14b82,1,t5_2qhn5

You are paying a higher price due to technological inferiority of the cab business model. Under our existing system someone is always getting gouged due to price ceilings and price floors. Its a mathematical certainty. With ridesharing the price is a free market price. This means both the driver and rider are getting a price near equilibrium where neither party is getting gouged.gt The existing industry would love to see the current regulations relaxed in a way that they could operate the same way that rideshares do elsewhere.Taxi cab companies love existing regulations. Its what allow them to have a legal government granted monopoly without which they would be forced to compete with a business that customers overwhelmingly prefer.

1117348,0,t1_chv7qdm,I believe the problem is that high demand for housing in austin isnt tapering off with rising prices like it should since people from other economic environments can bring in enough money to keep purchasing housing no matter the price. Given that wages certainly arent going to inflate at the same rate rent is this is making kind of a rising tide in terms of what kind of income it takes to live here. Slow growth would be great I think it would allow for inflation across the board for goods and services and wages as well. Fast growth is frustrating because anyone whos not well sheltered against the rising rent anyone in the service industry single parents anyone starting a new career working through school etc is getting stomped out of the city and then written off as some hipster who doesnt think the city is cool any more if they say anything about how it sucks that they cant afford a place to live any more.Speaking ofgtcomplaining about it just makes it look like you want to be one of the cool kids.

Is that something you guys would be into? Or is it too inside baseball?On the last note we have done interviews with local music figures about what they want from the mediapublicity end of the world.

1310155,0,t1_cigzmmx,Lots to talk about there let me see if I can address them. For those of us whove lived in Austin a while or grown up here or been here multiple generations weve seen it change so much. Its not really much of a bohemian state capital and university town anymore and so this change to being the th I think largest city is somewhat uncomfortable. Does the City have a responsibility to those in the arts? Sure but I really think those are the same responsibilities we have for all residents are our tax dollars being spent on valuable projects? Have we created a regulatory environment where the real estate community can provide lots of housing and different price points to fit different budgets. So very broadly I dont envision anything like a designated artists housing colony or whathaveyou but I do think we ow all residents a fair shake.And as for the music venue questions I think that fits right into the citys Code Next discussions to make sure we have the right zoning compatible with neighborhoods so that going forward we can try to decrease those sorts of conflicts.,Austin,cih0bxl,4,t5_2qhn5

Instead youre just stuck in the same exact traffic as sitting in your car...thats where rail is advantageous you get to bypass the traffic. Busses have a stigma because they do a pretty crappy job of being ontime and getting you there in less time than itd take to drive find parking and then walk to where you need to be.I think youre overcomplicating transit.

1331593,0,t1_cija2at,I think the biggest reason there isnt a separate moving to Austin subreddit is because rAustin is the logical starting point for someone who knows little to nothing about the actual workings of the area. Someone whether a mod a bot or a good Samaritan would still have to redirect the submission to the appropriate thread anyway and a sense of hostility might still linger. Rejection is rejection after all.As for your frustration with not being able to start a discussion thread about xyz topic I thought self.posts didnt affect your link karma score and any down votes wouldnt count against you. I may be incorrect on that point but if I am correct that means you could ask your questions and not worry about down votes affecting you at all other than a bruised ego I suppose. Plus down votes help declutter the subreddit by keeping the newcomer discussions off the front page so that rAustin as a community and news resource maintains its usefulness to the community.  The second page would still show the filtered questions and rAustinnew has always had every post submitted to the subreddit in reverse chronological order for whomever is inclined to be personable that day and help a newcomer get acclimated to the area.Disclaimer Im curious about what youre interested in discussing with locals.

1346303,0,t3_29hugx,gt Doing work helping animal the environment or people would be ideal. I mean no offense but so many people want to make a living doing one of these three things. Its rare you find anyone who does though because these tend to be jobs where the administration is absolutely begging for donations to sustain the mission.The best way  almost always  to get a new job is to court the people and skills youd be using in the job you want to be in. So if you would like to make money photographing get to it and start submitting to places that pay for work. Meet up with other photogs or offer to do their crap work assistant stuff basically  setting up lights managing talent etc.. If its helping animals start volunteering your ass off at the animal rescue place  they need volunteers during the day in particular so you could make a name for yourself in no time then if funding opens up for a new position you might be first in line.Check idealist.org and Greenlights job board for the type of jobs youre looking for. And remember if you do get an interview somewhere leave all the kvetching about the machinist job at home. Show positivity and optimism for the possibility of a new job not the urgent desire and distaste for the job youd be leaving. ,Austin,cil2pkb,3,t5_2qhn5

Whats your position on a  Homestead Exemption? kathietovo Starting at  AMA! reddit AskMeAnythingktovo H N  point  minutes agogt I sponsored the resolution asking staff to provide financial information for a  homestead exemption because I support having that discussion. The staff memo we received indicates that it would result in just over M of property tax reductions which is a lot. The better path for Austin I believe would be to continue to work for a legislative change that would enable a flat rate exemption. The  exemption disproportionately helps owners of higher dollar homes and may even shift some of the burden to renters. Thats why I sponsored a successful resolution in June to make property tax reform a high priority on our citys legislative agenda.mbg H N  points  minutes agogt What would you do to help lower prices for renters in Austin? Many are coming out for homestead exemptions but that does nothing for the majority of Austinites.ktovo H N  points  minutes agogt Affordability is a huge challenge  thanks for the question. Austin has many new apartments coming online which is a good trend but we need to work harder on strategies for preserving existing units. That helps keep lower cost housing available. Our city staff just drafted a report on preserving existing rental housing and I look forward to moving forward recommendations.,Austin,cjguvc1,3,t5_2qhn5

Also  at night.  It is slightly scary  but in a peaceful  urban oasis way.  While in the area  take a stroll down the streets of the King William neighborhood. At night these historic homes are amazing to look at. Hemisfair Park is in the area and never closes.  Cool place to hang out at night and features a large playground. Yes  for kids but its mostly adults having fun reliving their childhood at night.  Also  they have swings that you will fit into.  Thats kinda romantic.  The park is home to the Park police substation so dont be alarmed by the parking lot of cops cars.  They dont care what youre doing as long as youre not being a dumb ass. Pro tip parking meters are free after  or pm until am. Cant find parking downtown?  Park at Hemisfair Park  the entrance on Alamo Street across from a large hotel.  Basically on the corner of Caesar Chavez and Alamo.  There is a parking lot that many people neglect to find out about. ,Austin,cjpucb9,3,t5_2qhn5

They smoke with post oak and hickory making their own charcoal. Their Oyler pits which are made in Mesquite are designed to massage the meat as it revolves through alternate temperature zones. They cook around the clock in two batches rather than one. One of the pitmasters Richard McMillan says the brisket is the Queen of the Ball. We really dont season it too much says McMillan.

I do have an old bill from last year with an account number but when I use that info to login to the website it says I have no new charges since the last bill .  So did my toll in March not register somehow?  Or will I be getting a bill for thousands somewhere down the line?Possibly complicating things more is I did move between the first bill in  and the tollroad screw up back in March.

Most pedicab companies will not provide you with you monthly lease rates for a month in advance let alone an entire year in advance.  Many will impose sudden rate increases without much advance notice for events especially for ACL UT football F and SXSW.  Sometimes lease can more than double during these months. The rates in that DOB ad arent just amazing because they are easily the best in town they are amazing because they are in writing for the entire year in advance.

1952143,0,t3_2gyyqv,Im for this project.   Austin has a severe drinking and driving problem right now.  The new urban rail would run until AM on weekends and would service  and  among other zip codes.  The new SafeRide program that is being sponsored by UT is a designated driver program offered free to UT students.  SafeRide only services  and .  They had  students sign up in the first weekend.  That tells me that people will absolutely use this rail at night  this rail would not only service those zip codes but would also provide access to UT and ACC. Another point about the student population its common knowledge that when school goes back into session traffic gets much much worse.  When school ends in the summer and the students leave traffic gets a little better.  It happens every year like clockwork.  I cant buy the argument that this rail that will service heavily populated student areas AND Austins major campuses wont help traffic at all.  If this rail keeps students from having to drive to school it will absolutely help. A common argument I keep hearing is that this rail is being built to service future residents not current ones.  I would argue that the people saying that have not been to Southeast Austin anytime recently.  I live in SE Austin were the part of Austin no one wants to talk about because its largely made up of lower income and minority households.  Were also incredibly underserved by public transit.  Were also pretty densely populated  the Riverside corridor is apartments on top of apartments going all the way south to Oltorf if not further has a heavy student population and many of the single family homes in that area have more than one family living in them.  I live less than  miles from the proposed Pleasant ValleyRiverside stop and work in NW Austin if this rail gets built I would use it every day.  I cant be the only one. The other major argument I hear is that this rail is not going to help traffic.  No it wont... but neither will a GuadalupeLamar line.  Not alone.  Rail is not a magic bullet that is going to solve all of Austins traffic issues. That will take a combination of things the most important of which is getting people out of their cars and intoonto public transit carpools and bikes.  Along with this rail we need to redesign CapMetros bus routes into a grid system with the rail as the backbone.  That is going to take years.  To say that a GuadLamar line would alleviate traffic problems now is wishful thinking.  Build the HighlandRiverside rail now redesign the bus routes build dedicated lanes for MetroRapid and redesign the streets to provide a smoother more consistent traffic flow using narrower lanes to reduce speeds and roundabouts to replace fourway stops and traffic signals where appropriate and then you might have a solution.  There is no one piece that is going to solve this puzzle. Im sorry but the argument that doing nothing will be better than approving this rail plan is illogical and shortsighted.  Getting any drivers at all off the roads right now is better than doing nothing.  Austin is averaging what at least one or two fatal traffic accidents a week?  Our traffic is literally killing people.  We need to get cars off the roads and we need to do it now.  Hell we needed to do it years ago.  This plan isnt perfect but its good... if you want to hold out for a perfect plan youre going to be waiting a very very long time.  Build the rail now build the extensions later if there are problems with it down the road we can cross those bridges when we come to them.  Austin is a city full of smart innovative people.  We can make this thing work.Or we can vote against it and spend our evenings sitting in gridlock for a few more years.  Its your call.,Austin,ckofqr2,11,t5_2qhn5

What do you plan on doing about the embarrassment that is Northern Walnut Creek Trail? for reference The neighborhood and cycling fans whom were very excited to get this project finished noticed all the contractors trailers and equipment have been packed up and gone. I realize you are not elected yet but this seems like a feel good project that could get done rather quickly once in office if someone holds the right persons feet to the fire.The whole project has been a debacle. Several deadlines have been missed and I believe about  to  million dollars of taxpayer dollars have been wasted and there is less than  of the proposed trail done after  years and absolutely no one seems to care. All we have now is an entrance to a bike path that goes about ft. The bulldozers could of at least blazed a smooth enough dirt trail for runners and bikes to get to the mopac underpass but they left logs boulders and torn up fencing along the unfinished path. ,Austin,ckpt0og,3,t5_2qhn5

2098437,0,t3_2iwejt,First.  Dont say anything to the hotel about you using the room for a photo shoot.  The nicer hotels wont allow it without a location shoot agreement of some sort or just outright dont allow it.  As long as you are just shooting inside the room you should be fine. Depending on budget you should plan to theme the shoot to the vibe of the room.  You can totally ask to view a room beforehand and switch if you dont like the light view or whatever.  Obviously this is on non event weekends.Hotel shoots can be very cool.  Youll need a lens with a wider angle to get everything and not feel cramped in the smaller space.  Remember that any flash or strobes that you end up using will bounce around the room like crazy in most instances.  So try and harness as much natural light as you can manage.Look you need to be very professional and upfront about the shoot.  Straight up ask her what her guidelines are for the shoot.  Does she want a portrait shoot?  A fashion shoot like something out of Vogue magazine?  Perhaps a boudoir shoot?  Lots of boudoir shoots happen in hotel rooms. And you need to expressly ask what state of dressundress she wants to do in the shoot.  Dont assume.  Dont guess.  If you do youre guaranteed to be wrong and things will get weird.  Open and upfront communication is key.Once you know what sort of shoot youre doing you need to get to work.  Research and planning are the watchwords.Let me know if you have any other questions.  I shoot all the time and have done hotel shoots before.,Austin,cl6k37t,4,t5_2qhn5

The big problem in Austin is people NOT using public transportation so dont worry about pissing off us bustakers if you try to commute cap metro. OP has an etiquette guide for you!To all people who want to bus it but fear awkwardness just get a monthly pass at HEB. Or failing that have quarters on you look at the driver and say I need to buy a day pass. No problem voila youre on public transportation.Remember to sit in the back so older and disabled people can sit down. I forgot that first time.Try it youll like it!

The only bad thing youll run into is that we are currently in a real estate bubble that folks think is close to bursting. So housing is expensive and really competitive. I couldnt afford my own house if I was shopping for a new one and I live up in north Austin in what would be considered an up and coming neighborhood. Crestview and Allandale are great family neighborhoods with lots of eclectic folks. Were up around Walnut Creek and Eubanks Acres and you get bigger houses on bigger lots but its close to Rundberg not a great area but its slowly gentrifying.There is good stuff down south but I dont know the neighborhoods very well. ,Austin,cljr4kh,3,t5_2qhn5

Otherwise the steps would be to go to the shelter in person and fill out an adoption application. Once that has processed theyll put you in touch with me to do a meet and greet with Pogo. I would ask a few questions and if you have other dogs this would be a great time to do an introduction. If you are the right fit for him then I would let the shelter know and set up a time to drop him off there for you to pickup. Youd then pay the  adoption fee and go home with your new little buddy.

2213978,0,t1_cll7lyh,You dont seem to understand that the perfect solution according to ME and my friends that discuss traffic problems at Bouldin Creek have it all figured out. Even though the Guad route was shut out  years ago due to business backlash me and my friends will totally get it approved if they put it back on the ballot. sLets just keep holding out until we get the most expensive worthless watereddown option that truly does nothing. To spite Cap Metro which is much better managed than it was  years ago were going to have more toll roads owned by private greedy corporations that we can sit on for hours at a time at  a day. Woohoo!Austin is not quite the progressive town it thinks it is. Theres a very vocal hippy protectionist NIMBY group that refuses to believe that growth has been coming and will continue to come. Theres also an Alex Jones Libertarian faction that wants to lower taxes to zero add more private free market solutions AKA nobid state government cronies.Prop  is an expensive start but at least its a start. It will create a rail bridge that can be used by other routes in the future and it will make a rail line to the airport easier to build. And the Airport Blvd area is ripe for development. The proposed rail line will at least offset the growth in that area. Voting NO means all the new people who move there or that will attend ACC Highland are guaranteed to get into their car and sit in traffic.Wait  more years and you may have a change in options but you can be assured that there will be some group of people that will again ask the citizens of Austin to hold out for their perfect route.,Austin,cll9093,14,t5_2qhn5

People work a doubleshift the day before theyre about to take  days off for a festival so they have money. Etc etc. I didnt go to FFF but Im so glad that I didnt try.

In my neighborhood they added a new long left turn lane and it amazes me how much that cut down on congestion at that intersection.

2320717,0,t3_2ltedl,For meFriday we got there when it opened and missed the first black stage act save the last ten minutes due to them not letting us in. That was weird.Anyhow Friday Radkey was really great wish they could have played longer. PeelanderZ is always good though they were missing two members at least. They got volunteers from the crowd holding up signs bass player wanted guitar player wanted drummer wanted and this being Austin the volunteers were better than PeelaanderZ musically. Love their shows though. Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo Bay School of Medicine was Jello in character the guy has far too much energy. Not sure who my wife and I saw after that but I ended up back for Amon Amarth. Much like PeelanderZ and Jello Amon Amarth did precisely what was wanted. All of the above bands were having a lot of fun despite the light turnout. Had no idea what was going on with the crowd and the line outside. I kept telling my wife that there was so much more room than previous years.Death From Above and AltJ were both good though the sound for AltJ was off. That stage had issues all weekend. AltJ was mostly invisible had a great light show and played everything theyve ever released. It was a bit like hearing the studio version. A gripe about modern bands with that clean sound they sound the same live and recorded.Saturday was mostly black stage for us. Not sure why they moved the black stage but hey. Favorites from Saturday were The Fat WHite Family best I saw all weekend their performance is remarkable and Sick Of It All. We also saw the comedians before W. Kamau Bell then W. Kamau Bell then Jello Biafra all at the yellow tent. I wish I could find the schedule to know who the comedian was before the terrible comedy rap guy. He was funny as hell. Bell had a great set and Jello is well Ive seen him do spoken word six times. I like him.Saturday my wife wanted to stay and watch Modest Mouse so I stood there in the haze of bad pot and bad sound. Never much liked that band.Sunday I stayed home. My lower back was broken a few years back and acts up sometimes and by Sunday I was crippled. General Ive said it elsewhere but everything FunFunFunFest does right they scrap. Having sidebyside stages for instance allowed for much faster rotation between acts meaning more music I saw so many small  obscure bands at the black stage two years ago and all of them I now follow but theres no time for that now. The ticketing thing was obviously bad. The USP from what I saw and heard was just as pathetic as previous years the last good PiP  USP thing was  apparently. Trash cans were few and far between though the janitorial company was totally on top of cleanup saw more of them than anyone. I didnt go last year because of the PiP debacle in . I went this year without a USP and was glad of it but I wont be back again. Time to find something smaller.A couple of years back FFFFest was a tribute to the old Aquafest. Someone should make a new festival small limited ticket sales local and small acts and have it be a tribute to FunFunFunFest.,Austin,clyjz20,5,t5_2qhn5

2329919,0,t1_clznk2h,Its a long story so Im going to try to give it the context and be objective.Went to sixth street on a Tuesday after final exams. I was standing between two cars six street isnt closed on the weekdays like it is on ThurSat and my friends were on the sidewalk and we were just talking. Officer comes up and asks me to get back on the side walk for my own safety so on so forth to which I apologize and oblige no harm done. We are still waiting for friends and very nonchalantly and not thinking I had one foot on the curb and one foot on the side walk. Same guy comes up to me and says Son Im not going to tell you again and starts asking me questions please remember I have one foot on one foot off the curb and am standing between two parked cars.So while he is talking to me three young pretty blonde girls walk directly behind us and jaywalk on the street. I point it out to which he replied You need to worry about yourself son. I remember that like the back of my hand because he didnt even bother turning around. Anyways he ultimately leaves us alone after I just shut my mouth and respectfully said my Yes Sirs and No Sirs etc. Now to be objective. I do have issues with authority. Not with teachers or my bosses or my parents just what I see as unjust authority like in this sense. So when I talked back I completely realize that was wrong of me to do so and I should have kept my mouth shut. So what happened next I take responsibility for although I do not believe it was an arrestable offense. About  minutes later we are walking across the street at the crosswalk legally and he rides behind me on his bike and says You better listen to your friends buddy my friends were obviously being levelheaded and were telling me not to worry about the incident. I then filled with rage sober rage turned around and said Im just crossing the street would you leave me the fuck alone?!.Obviously this wasnt the right move on my part. He jumped off his bike and then tried to put my hands behind my back. Now if you recall I just hard two rods put in my arm about  weeks before rod placements dont require a cast and I only had it bandaged for about two weeks. When they put on the rods however they scrape all the muscle off the bone so I essentially had NO movement in muscles that attach down there like the biceps brachialis triceps and other forearm muscles. My range of motion was very limited so he tried to yank my right arm behind my back but my right arm wouldnt move that way I could barely move it in my normal anatomical position. As a reflex I yanked my right arm away and screamed in pain because it obviously fucking hurt. He yelled he is resisting and his buddies tackled me my head hit the pavement and I just remember yelling in pain as he was yanking my arm and three cops were on top of me while my friends were yelling to them about my injuries. After about  seconds they get the gist and see my arm and realize I really cant move my arm.I end up being arrested. I think the pain I felt in that arm that night was worse than when I had broken it. On the way to the station the cop not the arresting cop told me to quit being such a bitch because my arm really hurt but its not like I was complaining to him or anything I think he just saw the tears and anger in my eyes.Now from previous experience people accuse me of not being objective or thinking there is two sides to the story. This is as it happened and I was arrested for resisting arrest was never told original charge. On Officer Villanovas will never forget that name police report he wrote that I turned and pushed him with both hands on his chest so yeah like I said complete bullshit since I couldnt even use my right arm to yank one out much less push Officer Villanova.I understand I shouldnt have yelled at him the way I did and I wasnt drunk by any means as we were still waiting for our friends to get there to start our night. It was just a fit of rage in which I felt harassed and unfairly targeted for standing between two cars right next to the curb?.Honestly Im really happy that situation happened. It was a really low point in my life as I went from being extremely active to not even being able to drive myself run or do anything in which I might fall and hurt my arm. I went into a... depression I suppose? I dont think it was super bad but I was definitely unhappy lacked confidence and had little motivation in that period more so after this incident. But it taught me a lot and the whole experience broken arm and arrested was really humbling. I understand people out there have more problems than myself and that not being able to use my arms for  months is minuscule in comparison to certain problems that plague others but they are still my problems and they still affected me. Anyways I feel I came out the other end a much more empathetic person especially to the plights of others. Ive always been a fairly compassionate and good person in my view but something about this period of incidents really made me change the way I view things.Anyways Im fixing to graduate from graduate school have a couple interviews for medical school and my life could not be any better than it currently is besides the usual baggage of school. Ive always wanted to be a doctor but I think it was this period that made me really reflect on my life and the why in why I wanted to be a doctor.So I digressed at the end and I am certainly not void of any blame. And I have tried to be objective but I cant help but think I got the shit end of the stick on this one.,Austin,clzovqd,6,t5_2qhn5

Later I heard the original Strange Fruit and understood the meaning this was only two or so years ago.I get that naming a PR company strange fruit is a shit idea but it seems to me from what they have said that they thought the term had the meaning that I had thought it was.With all of that being said it drives me up a wall that the typical Internet social justice warrior would much rather have them crucified and spew whiney garbage on twitter rather than contacting them directly and saying that they should change their name.

2612815,0,t3_2psdvo,Your landlord may be right and property taxes are often a big part of why tenant rents go up and up. Property taxes have two components the assessment value less any exemptions and the tax rate set by local officials. Even if the tax rates remain constant an increase in the value of the property will result in a tax increase. Your landlord may share the increased costs with you or even absorb them all.... but you can bet she is paying more!For information tips techniques and helpful agents across Texas that can help keep your property taxes under control visit the Texas Property Tax Assistance Network TexPTAN.www.TexPTAN.com ..... were here to help!,Austin,cmzmrfx,2,t5_2qhn5

I think Lamar is the closest one with a large parking lot that can really be justified as a park and ride.The one at the Triangle seems excessive if youre already driving as far as th street why not just drive the rest of the way?

2746170,0,t1_cnft7p9,Thats why I like licensing. I imagine firearm licenses like driving licenses. You take a written and skills tests as well as an additional background check and then you are permitted to operate a firearm. It wouldnt be exactly parallel I think you should have senior licenses or some concept that allows you to supervise other unlicensed people to use firearms. I guess similar to learners permits though without requiring a the learn to do anything.So in this scenario having a license doesnt mean that you own a gun like having driving license doesnt mean you own a car. Sure you probably own a car but you might own none you might own one you might own two or three or seven. You dont need a separate license for each one. Having a driving license is just proof you are competent to operate a vehicle. Also you can own a car without having a license you just cant drive it. In your doomsday scenario if the government knocks at your door and asks for your guns you can claim that you dont own any you just go to the range sometime. Or you can give them a beater handgun while your secret cache of weapons is hidden in your basement or whatever. If youre very paranoid you can buy your guns and only use them with someone who has a license or just use them illegally and hope you dont get caught. ,Austin,cng87x3,1,t5_2qhn5

It would be difficult to discern from smell alone how much gas is being released into your neighborhood but fortunately the likelihood of an explosive mixture of gas and oxygen occurring in an open area is quite small though they do occur. Most detonations are the result of prolonged buildup within a structure at which point an ignition source is provided and boom. Hollywood has tainted most peoples understanding of explosions made us afraid of light switches to the point that even talking about them is bad PR so Id imagine your best bet is to contact your local newspaper or investigative journalist and get some exposure. Light a fire under there ass if you will. Realistically you are likely in very little danger the odor being more of a nuisance than anything else.Not to freak you out or anything but there have been a few catastrophic events associated with outdoor natural gas leaks in the past.

They are all gone and taken by family and friends but i was in your same shoes not too long ago.  What i basically did is research the hell out of cameras.  I wanted something that wasnt in the  range but i wanted it to perform like it was .  What i settled on...well not settled as I am extremely happy with was the Gc  GPS yes the C model as it is the new Ambrella ALA chipset that supports Widescreen Full HD xpfps  It is beautiful.  Here are some exampleschange your youtube settings to p or p and watch in full screenI have a retail relationship with the manufacturer so i was able to get them rather cheaply.  I offered them to my friends and family bundled Gc  GPS  gig memory for  and I made about  each on them.  I strongly recommend this camera.  You can purchase here for  with free shipping but youll need to purcahse a memory card max gig get a class   Note shipping will take about  weeks.  All i can say is GET THIS CAMERA...dont settle for others.email me if you want to chat djpennin  yahooheres email i sent to my friendsfamAllMany of you have expressed interest in dashcams.  I have researched all units and have been recently testing one out in my car.The camera installed in minutes is super small and simply plugs into cigarette lighter with the wire hidden behind glovebox and along behind trim so its invisible. It comes automatically on when you start your car and turns itself automatically off or runs until the battery dies on it.There is never any need to touch it.It has loop recording so once the memory card is full it will automatically record over the old clips. gig card holds about  hours before loopingThe orange button on the back allows you to save current clip into a protected area that does not get overwritten.  The camera unclips from the windshield mount much like a radar detector and plugs into your computer via USB then pops up like a hard drive.  You can simply drag and drop the video files or watch them directly from camera.Many other features like motion detection and Gsensor if you get into accident.and much moreWell enough marketing I have been in sales relations with the manufacturer in Shenzhen China and have purchased an allotment of  units. units of the BRAND NEW Chipset Ambrella ALA Gc model WITH GPS and much higher resolutionsWith GPS it will display also speed.  See this video change to p and full screen They have given me special pricing due to my Jewish Chinese negotiating skills note on spreadsheet image below is on  units and will be expediting the shipping via DHL Express so expected to arrive in  days.I have also purchased  SanDisk Class  gig memory cards I will pair with the cameras.If you are interested in one of these Gc dashcams  GPS  gig memory card please let me know  They will be  for the packagePlease EMAIL me back if you want one or the Quantity that you want.Great for your wifes car kids car or insurance proof that it wasnt your fault deepak or to post funny youtube videos of dumb Austin drivers!if you look online for any other cameras that have GPS and the Ambrella ALA chipset they are in the  range wo memory card just google ALAMy costs Cameras  DHL Express  MemoryCard  ...so thanks for the  tip everyone Cheers!Dan,Austin,cnw2455,3,t5_2qhn5

3009381,0,t3_2umznc,Getting a job at UT is really difficult because half the time its all about who you know. And things are spread out so much that most folks can only help you within their own departmentschool. I highly recommend you submit an application to UTemps and try to talk to someone there. Getting your foot in the door is half the battle and I have personally seen quite a few people brought in as a temp before hiring permanently.  While I got my current job via a friend who held the position before me and knew my skills would be a perfect fit I still had to start as a UTemp before being brought on fulltime. I will warn you that they have a max amount of money they pay temp folks and it is usually much lower than fulltime salary this obviously depends on the job.If you do apply try to talk to someone within UTemps and explain your issues and see if they have any suggestions. I would also tell anyone on the callbacks that you want to work in higher education and are seeking to pursue grad school and because of that you are looking for a position that would enable you to do this.

Austin was deliberately modeled as sort of a small town that just happened to be the capitol had a large university and vibrant music scene. Dallas has always been more metropolitan than basically every other area in Texas prior to . If youre a Texan and from a rural area Dallas was always associated with urban cowboys. The saying All hat and no cattle. comes to mind.The excesses of the s prior to the savings and loan crisis were pretty outrageous to small town Texas and it didnt help that Dallas the TV show was doing everything it could to fuel those expectations. Keep in mind that this was a period of great financial hardship for basically every other place in America as well.This schism continued through the late eighties and began to normalize as the Texas economy diversified out of just Agriculture  Oil and Gas. We didnt really see the full effect until around the mid s.Thats when Austin started to really grow in terms of new people moving to the area. Austin natives have seen the population more than double in less than  years and thats just the city itself. Round Rock  Georgetown  Leander  Cedar Park  etc etc were all just pasture compared to their present footprints.Most of the population boom is not from California but from Houston and DFW.

3276712,0,t3_2xmpsf,I had a great big slice of the record breaking cake that was baked to celebrate Prince Charles and Lady? Diana visiting Austin in the mids. Prince Charles would not do the Hook Em Horns hand sign because it was a rude gesture in England. They used a Chinook helicopter from Camp Mabry to pull the statue off the top of the capitol for cleaning. At that time you could drive through Camp Mabry and one afternoon we went there to see the statue. Its sort of odd looking because the facial features are exaggerated to be seen from the ground. Later when they tried to put the statue back the Chinook helicopter pilot was unable to get the statue in place to lower it down on the support rod. The pilot had to go by spoken instruction since he could not see under the craft. A crew from Tennessee came in on a Flying Crane helicopter and were able to place it in the first try. My friend called me from New York and said he was unable to find a job there and was running out of cash and would be homeless soon. I told him to buy a bus ticket to Austin and he could stay with me and wed find him a job no problem. This was in the late s and we had been friends in another town. He called a day or so later and said he would be arriving at  pm. I was at the bus station at  but by  it was obvious he wasnt there. This was before cell phones were a regular thing so I wasnt able to call him and ask where he was. I drove to another place where I had once been dropped off by a much smaller bus company. In the parking lot a guy came up to my window and asked what I was looking for. I told him I was looking for a friend and he motioned to a woman he had been sitting with and said I have a friend for you. I thanked him no and drove home.

I think people stay indoors during the winters here too on the few days it is really nasty or the weather is just crappy in general. Staying indoors during the summer time is not unheard of here either. It gets really really hot. I talked to a board game retailer and he told me something surprising to me. He said board game sales increase in the summer time because people are not going outdoors as much. You might consider working a deal to sale your scented candles at a local board game shop like Dragons Lair. They have times of the year they let people set up booths.

The only things within walking distance are bars clubs and restaurants. Only asshole parents bring their children to bars and most wont even let you in. There are movie theaters downtown but Alamo wont let kids in past a certain time which is rather early. The other movie theaters are more independent and wont be playing anything children would want to see and perhaps even things they shouldnt see. Downtown Austin is pretty childunfriendly which is why I love it so much because I dont like children. They annoy me. I think the suburbs do a good job of catering to those with children with things like Main Event Dave and Busters etc. Id save DT for evenings when youre away from your kids.

The apartments are recently built but not super high quality. At least it has parking if other people want to visit but they wont usually want to party there since its outside the main social circle west campus. All student housing will be noisy.I personally would suggest not living in the Riverside area while in college since its far away relatively speaking from most of the students.

3857734,0,t1_cqvw834,I never experiences the icy problem. That is from the air in the freezer clinging to the ice cream via condensation. Blue bell pretty much went the science route to make their ice cream more desirable and eventually going as far as could away from natural. The sudsy bubbles you see when it melts is from either xanthan gum or guar gum one from a plant while the other is actually a bacteria for thickening. People often point out that last point as unnatural  but i worked for a company that made ice cream and those ingredients are perfectly healthy and very beneficial yet one is a bacteria so you dont want that in the dairyfree or vegan batch.,Austin,cqw0mh9,3,t5_2qhn5

3866589,0,t3_34ms2z,Just got back last week from a one week motorcycle trip. Flowers were incredible. Bluebonnets lining the road from Marathon to Panther Junction. One of the wettest times Ive ever seen.   Rio Grande village is hot and mosquito infested. It does have showers though! You may have to stay there one night then move first thing in the morning upto Chisos basin. Upon arrival in the park go to Chisos basin first thing even if the sign says the campground is full. A lot of times they are real late on changing the notice. Most sites are decent cant give you a number though. Recommend one with a cover over it Youll appreciate having shade.  Just reread your post arriving Saturday midmorning Chisos may be full. Not too many people leave on a Saturday  Never cycled in the park Hikes in the basin are my thing Boot Springs is flowing and water in most of the creeks. Pine canyon waterfall was running and also Cotontail waterfall. By  in the afternoon its just too hot to be exposed.   Terlingua is only  miles away highly recommend sitting on the porch and drinking a beer in the evening.  Congratulations to your brother. ,Austin,cqx0wrq,1,t5_2qhn5

Because all I see is All events should be posted to the weekly stickied stuff to do in austin thread.  Which sounds more like a suggestion not an imperative anyway. But why make allowances in this case but not for smaller events put on by members of our raustin community? Seems like the opposite should be true and raustin would want to help the little guy instead of the likes of C and KGSR. gt Which is actually doing you a favor  posts for one time events that arent as big are burried by the end of the day neer to be seen again.Dont worry about doing us favors we know how reddit works.  If ACL and Blues on the Green get their own individual posts instead of just a post the week of why shouldnt my event?  Cant we post our event in the Stuff to do thread as a reminder to folks that its happening that week? If people dont like my event and want to downvote it into oblivion thats fine by me.

4097387,0,t1_crf7d2p,It was the derive all their powers from the state language thats the problem.  If you define from the state so broadly as to mean from the Texas Constitution then you could make that claim but I dont think thats the way that most people even legal scholars would parse that phrase.  If you claim that incorporation under Texas law counts as deriving all authority from the State then youd have to likewise say that Reliant Energy Corporation derives all of its authority from the state as well because it is a Texas corporation.  As with Reliant Energy a home rule municipality is selfgoverning subject only to limitations on authority imposed by law.  Reliant can do whatever the State of Texas does not make explicitly illegal or Feds within Federal authority and the same holds true for home rule municipalities.But even with this analogy municipalities are even further removed than Texas corporations because corporations in Texas are incorporated per statutory authority  by the Texas Legislature.  By contrast home rule cities are chartered directly under Texas constitutional authority.  Bear in mind that this same Texas constitution is where the Texas Legislature gets its authority as well.In short your refinement doesnt really add meaning.  To say that Texas home rule municipalities derive their authority through the Texas Constitution by way of the th amendment is correct but thats only another way of saying that their authority isnt independent of the Texas Constitution.,Austin,crnbt48,2,t5_2qhn5

4256214,0,t3_39o0jc,Depends on what you are looking for.  Both offer solid learntorow opportunities.  TRC arguably has better water in the mornings as everything west of MoPac is fresh and clear unlike the garbage around ARC.  Parking at ARC is incredibly difficult  TRC is located near plenty of onstreet parking and in the morningsweekendssummer the high school lot is also available.  Dont be fooled by the sole proprietornonprofit deal  both are city concessions and both must turn a profit in order to give back  of their annual revenue to the city.  This need is met by renting paddleboards kayaks and canoes for the most part but ARC also leases out their venue during SXSW meaning you lose access to the boathouse for the most part during that time plus again good luck parking downtown.If you want to join a club that is actually competitive TRC has all that and more.  The masters program has strength coaches significantly more equipment than ARC and has dominated the local races as of late.   Im not certain of your gender but TRC has very competitive male masters rowers from their mids to mids and a very fast group of younger womens rowers ish.  Once you master the learntorow class and spend some time with the intermediate crew you are able to move up to the competitive crews.Its a truly wonderful sport and I wish you the best of luck in learning!,Austin,cs5e5io,2,t5_2qhn5

Like the state legislature districts which were made by the GOP itself and the GOP was doing everything it can to keep itself in the state legislature.  The only race limitation on them was that they couldnt seem to be doing their gerrymandering based on race.As for the Austin city limits we annex areas here and there for various reasons usually because we want their tax dollars and theres other cities around us as well and we end up with the irregular borders.  But city limits arent really gerrymandered like election districts are  the benefit really isnt there and the borders are usually made piecemeal over years anyways rather than all at once.,Austin,cskjy8h,4,t5_2qhn5

4391672,0,t3_3b867q,LOLgtHistorically in Texas? Mr. Paxton in  Texas officially clarified its longstanding legal tradition Texas explicitly defined marriage as a union of one WHITE man and one WHITE woman. Exclusively literally. Not only could a black not marry a white but blacks could not marry at all a freed black man and black woman could exchange vows in a black church but they were not married in the eyes of the state because marriage was only for white people. This was the Great State of Texas legal tradition until  when marriage was diluted to include the blacks. And the shocking part was scandalous unspeakable things relations between a white woman and black man could be elevated to the status of marriage by SCOTUS. This went against the deeply held beliefs of many people. The KKK clearly had a demonstrable history of a deeply held belief that marriage could not be between a black and a white and to do so was an irreversible great harm to society so if that belief can veto other peoples marriages then they are first in line. Prior complaint. This is within your actual lifetime Mr. Paxton you were born and raised in a legal system where marriage in Texas was a whitesonly tradition by law until nine unelected judges denied the states rights of  states democratic decision to define marriage as a sameraceonly or even whitesonly legal tradition on this flimsy legal premise from  that all people are due the equal protection of the laws.Texas marriage was legally defined as whitesonly until .  Ken Paxton was born in .  I believe the problem is that in  blacks even freemen were not considered true citizens.

4614332,0,t1_ctc7ab3,Agreed thats a great thing now.  But  years ago we did not have a whole lot of good restaurants and Austin was definitely not known for its food.  I think thats what many people constantly complain about... that the city has changed its focus from musicart to foodtrendiness.  I feel like a lot of people that complain are the same time that cant adjust to change and refuse to realize that the same culture still exists here just not in the same locations.  For example several key music venues have sadly moved from the Red River are due to rising rents.

4618245,0,t1_ctcoqq9,A NAS or RAID array is a bad choice for a sole backup solution no matter how you cut it. RAID can give you good performance and some redundancy in certain configurations but it is not suitable as a backup for a few reasons I can think of off the top of my head. First the drives are all connected to the same power supply and controller. One bad power supply or controller could potentially hose every drive in the array. Lost two hard drives at once many years ago when I had an Antec power supply blow out. Took a lot of other hardware with it too. Secondly being always on and attached to the network theres a small but present risk of getting hit by some sort of a worm or other exploit that causes you to lose some or all your data. Third and this is a pretty big one depending on the hardware you choose you could get hosed when the controller goes down and you cant find a suitable replacement to read the drives. This is a big problem with products from a company like Drobo and Ive heard several accounts of people who were left up shit creek without a paddle when their  year old Drobo box kicked the bucket and even their support basically told them sorry bro. The same thing can happen with standalone RAID controllers. I had it happen years ago where a RAID array created on one board was somehow obliterated by trying to access it using a later revision of the same controller board after the first one failed. Im not sure what the current status is of standardization of how RAID arrays are implemented on a hardware level because I dont trust my data to arrays anymore. Maybe there is some way to work around migrating your data from one RAID controller to another but that seems like just one more headache to deal with when recovering from a data loss in my opinion.Backing up to individual drives that are stored unconnected to anything is a much safer option assuming there is a secondary backup somewhere.,Austin,ctcphbc,3,t5_2qhn5

Lyfts ability to set rates based on demand means that I can only work at busy times still make some extra money and demand is met.  Customers have access to an easier to use interface and not worry about incar payment.Taxis should be mad that theyre being handicapped by crazy regulation.

5277145,0,t3_3n8q53,This is my advice get a book for LG and for RC and LR just do practice questions. Practice tests are your best bet here. Ive only had experience with PowerScore and heres what I think. The books by the by are largely useless. They want you to do all this extraneous shit which would just bog me down complicating the entire process instead of helping me answer the problems. For example the only worthwhile thing the Logical Reasoning book helped me with was to negate an assumption for questions which ask which assumption is required for the argument to work because I had trouble with that for some reason. I skimmed the book but really only did practice problems.Honestly I think that if one doesnt understand logical reasoning questions without diagramming them they probably arent cut out for law school. You need to be able to understand the English language. The Reading Comprehension book didnt help me at all. RC is pretty much you need to know how to read and answer multiple choice questions. Not a whole lot it can help you with there. At the end of the book it even had a chapter only for people who wouldnt regard noncompletion of an RC section as failure. LOLLogic games at least for me are not nearly as intuitive as the above sections. Thats why Im suggesting get a book for LG. Apparently its the easiest section to get a perfect score which makes sense. You just need to learn how to diagram. I think Powerscore tries to apply this methodology to LR and that really didnt work out for me. Just buy practice tests. If you get a question wrong go back and see why its wrong and the right answer is right. This will help you the most if youre like me at least.,Austin,cvm7roy,2,t5_2qhn5

Sure you still have those weirdos that pick up their dog shit and then tie it to a tree for some reason but theres always bad eggs.Maybe we just need to start putting bags at the entrances to the greenbelt large biodegradable paper bags might be best although large plastic trash bags would be cheapest and tell people to pick up some litter while they are out there.This isnt going to fix the problem that people just dont give a shit  but if we reduce the amount of excuses they have and help others to clean up after them maybe well see some positive results.PS No matter how many times someone has complained about greenbelt trash on reddit over the past few years the net amount of trash on the greenbelt remains constant.,Austin,cvp66bq,2,t5_2qhn5

I exited and saw his car turn right on burnett but by the time i got onto burnett he had sped off onto a side road.  sure Id be willing to provide a statement I didnt see the accident per say because there was another car in my line of sight but I did see the aftermath and the gray corolla driver and watched him speed off.  sorry i couldnt be more helpful.,Austin,cvzhlb4,27,t5_2qhn5

5392837,0,t1_cw0wflx,Ive heard the anticapitalism argument many times especially here in austin. I welcome socialism with open arms but only once we can assure that nobody is stuck with the work making sure everyones standard of living is high. I suspect well have capitalism for the next  years at least until society is realistically automated enough for everyone to have an equally high standard of living with no reason to work. By then we may not even need anyone to continue advancing nonessential technologies like space exploration could be conducted by AI theres entire books that have been written about this shit. But for now we have capitalism. Its a system that rewards people who provide something society deems is of value. Unfortunately Trailer spaces target audience is highschool to collegekids who are typically making less than  a year and are either living at home or in lowincome student housing or dorm. Why would they buy a  used CD when they can either go online and get a spotify subscription that offers so much more for  a month or pirate it illegally? Especially when you consider the constraints with many of them being full time students or otherwise unemployed dealing with debt etc. Heres the main valueattraction Trailer Space provided a live music venue. Whether you admit to it or not thats what packed the store not their music selection. I like metal and most of the shit they sell and their selection is pretty garbage. Waterloo records has a better metal selection even. The reality is is that they werent capitalizing on their audience and the prime reason they were there for live music. Most of the audience is hungrythirsty they couldve started selling food or drinks. Or had an extremely low cost door price im pretty sure most kids can afford a dollar surely. Or shit maybe even a subscription?  a month for all you can eat live bands? Unfortunately they chose not to capitalize on their audience which while a decent move for the kids who got to enjoy the venue ends up costing them in the long run when they cant pay rentmortgage and whatever else. They were betting on the venue portion of their store to bring in customers for their CD shop and lost. I feel bad for them theyre nice guys and probably just wanted to make it a great place for kids to hang out but the cold reality is that they have utility bills and taxes to pay at the very least and free shows wont pay for those. TLDR Capitalism is going to be reality for probably the next century at least. If you want to help speed the transition along start a robotics company focused on automating essential tasks that runs on clean energy. ,Austin,cw0ztxc,3,t5_2qhn5

5425970,0,t1_cw4n1qq,Gigapower user here. As of right now I have absolutely no issues with them. A few points to make  Yes you actually DO get gbps. Both upload and download  I havent had the actual service go out once  Gigapower users get specialized support  you just have to call the right number. The call center is actually here in the US.  Yes its insanely fast.  Overall its awesome. I had a little trouble at first as I had it before the special call center came online. I need static IPs and they didnt know what they were little less how to actually get them working. After a LOT of back and forth  and cluelessness on their side  I got  static IPs for  extra a month. To do this you WILL need a separate modem for your internal network  but they did reimburse me for that modem.  They also claim a TB cap but I know Ive blown past that and Ive never heard anything from them. My guess is that they are completely ignoring it here in Austin  for good reason google fiber!.  Im not sure why people are saying its not worth the price. I had the  with TWC before  and I was paying . For  more I now have gig up and down. HUGE difference. Definitely go with Gigapower if it comes to your area. Itll be the lesser of two evils until google fiber comes in to play in your area I would switch immediately!.

5902784,0,t3_3w3kpu,UT has respondedAUSTIN Texas  The university is aware of media reports about an outside groups intention to stage a group performance of a mass shooting on the UT Austin campus this weekend. Our Board of Regents rules designate our campus as a space reserved for the business research and educational purposes of UT Austin. Within the university community the campus is a place for the vigorous exchange of diverse viewpoints which is an essential part of the educational experience. The property or buildings owned or controlled by UT Austin are not however open to outside groups for assembly speech or other activities including theatrical performances as are the public streets sidewalks and parks. Only the university itself faculty staff and student groups may engage in such activities on campus. This applies equally to an outside protest group an outside theater troupe or any outside group wishing to use the facilities or grounds of the university.Many groups seek to use the universitys facilities each year and they are all treated equally and are turned away. For example we have not allowed the Westboro Baptist Church to protest on campus and have not allowed labor groups to protest on campus. We have told outside sporting groups that they may not use our sporting facilities.When outside individuals come on campus and violate our rules regarding use of our grounds and facilities they are asked to leave. If they do not it becomes a criminal trespass matter. We suggest that any outside organizations planning such events on campus relocate them to other space where they would be allowed.Our Dean of Students Office is attempting to contact the leaders of this group to make sure they are aware of our Board of Regents rules and procedures.source ,Austin,cxte0cv,16,t5_2qhn5

For instance the idea of people as chattle to be traded without concern for their wants needs or autonomy is common to both Civil Rights and Womens rights. Or the fight against advertising is common to both Feminism and AntiCapitalism.By using intersectionality in this way the left seeks unity of understanding between struggles... its a way for the left to seek cooperation internally its not something being projected onto the opposition.,Austin,cy0ksgc,4,t5_2qhn5

5962572,0,t1_cy048bp,I dont think any of the conventional wisdom is correct when were talking about a growing city with very high demand for living in the urban core.  Conventional wisdom says that multifamily housing in singlefamily zones depresses property values.  However Hyde Park probably has the most multifamily housing stock of any predominantly  singlefamily neighborhood and also some of the highest property values.  Secondly I think small missingmiddle type multifamily like  or  unit apartment buildings stacked flats rowhouses etc. could help make our central neighborhoods feel more urban and thus more attractive while providing cheaper housing options.  You are right in that increased entitlements would increase LAND value but it would probably decrease structural value since it would increase the supply of housing units.  It could benefit singlefamily homeowners by increasing their property values while simultaneously providing more affordable places to live if you built a plex land costs could be shared by  units which would bring down costs immensely,Austin,cy182j4,1,t5_2qhn5

Frankly I think youre overthinking the space limitations imposed by milk unless youre considering a TINY space. Also like I mentioned elsewhere dont forget we do get chilly months here. Designing a business around ths of the year isnt a great idea. Youll need steady profits through the lean months too.

6378891,0,t1_czemlxe,There is no evidence that civilians being armed stops any mass shootingsgtRoughly half of all active shooter events Blair studied ended before law enforcement officers arrived. The most common occurrence was that the shooter stopped the attack spontaneously on their own. The decision was often made after an initial burst of violence in which the shooter attacked everyone who was in the immediate area Blair said.gtBlair said he found only three cases in which an armed civilian shot the attacker and in two of those incidents the civilian who took action was an offduty police officer.On the other hand there is evidence that the right to carry guns around is linked with an increase in crime ratesgtAcross the basic seven Index I crime categories the strongest evidence of a statistically significant effect would be for aggravated assault with  of  estimates suggesting that RTC laws increase this crime at the . confidence level. An omitted variable bias test on our preferred Table a results suggests that our estimated  percent increase in aggravated assaults from RTC laws may understate the true harmful impact of RTC laws on aggravated assault which may explain why this finding is only significant at the . level in many of our models. Our analysis of the yearbyyear impact of RTC laws also suggests that RTC laws increase aggravated assaults. Our analysis of admittedly imperfect gun aggravated assaults provides suggestive evidence that RTC laws may be associated with large increases in this crime perhaps increasing such gun assaults by almost  percent. gtIn addition to aggravated assault the most plausible state models conducted over the entire  period provide evidence that RTC laws increase rape and robbery but usually only at the . level. In contrast for the period from  which seeks to remove the confounding influence of the crack cocaine epidemic the preferred state model for those who accept the Wolfers proposition that one should not control for state trends yields statistically significant evidence for only one crime  suggesting that RTC laws increase the rate of murder at the . significance level. It will be worth exploring whether other methodological approaches andor additional years of data will confirm the results of this paneldata analysis and clarify some of the highly sensitive results and anomalies such as the occasional estimates that RTC laws lead to higher rates of property crime that have plagued this inquiry for over a decade.,Austin,czeplyg,-1,t5_2qhn5

Thats not saying it is Beverly Hills of luxury but it is safe and the grocery store at McNeil and Parmer is great but surrounding shops and most in the area are nonpremium that said you can get good food near by. Both Parmer and  have bad traffic into town in the morning due to heaps of people who live in Avery Ranch Cedar Park Leander and surrounding areas all coming to Austin for work. Honestly Parmer actually is smooth sailing east bound in the morning once you get through the McNeil intersection so youd be in good shape there. I used to work off Metric and had no real traffic.  traffic is bad but it clears up between Duval and Braker which is only one exit down from McNeil. Granted if youre heading downtown youll run into more traffic on Mopac or I. All in all its a nice location whose crime is relegated to easy open garage raiding and juvenile shenanigans. Location wise youre  minutes from good shopping in the Arboretum or Lakeline areas and only maybe  minutes to the Domain and  to downtown. ,Austin,czg4lo8,5,t5_2qhn5

6473623,0,t3_4483p2,Probably a student pilot. One of the first maneuvers they teach in flight training is a standard rate turn AKA  minute turn where youre turning at second completing the loop after  mins.  One of the ways to practice this is to simply circle around a fixed point. Basically fly north soon as your chosen point lets call it a pond thats what I always used is directly on your left start turning left. After two minutes you damn well better be back flying due north with the pond on your left or your instructor is gonna have you do it again.  And again... and again... Fun memories.  Its an added bonus that the wind is going to be affecting you variably throughout the entire turn.  Upwind youre gonna be slowing down downwind speeding up and youll have crosswinds to either side on the other quarters of the circle.  Gotta be constantly considering the direction of the wind amp making appropriate adjustments to yaw and bank to keep that shit on lockdown.  My point is  when a small aircraft is doing weird maneuvers its probably a just a student pilot sweating his balls off.  ,Austin,czox2ln,4,t5_2qhn5

6636978,0,t3_46jd4y,Worked in the industry since . Havent been a band have been supporting be it touring doing merch marketing business end of things. Guerrilla marketing social media when it was bulletin boards... Strictly a freelancer worked with major labels  Started off with Aware out of Chicago and my first four bands were Train Five for Fighting John Mayer and Vertical Horizon. Hell of a way to get thrown in. I didnt tie myself to one band or one place thats why I moved around. Centralized myself to east coast would travel from Wilmington NC mo for rent to Toms River NJ regularly about every  weeks for  days to work go into NYC work a show for about  nights recover drive back home and go out on tour out in the Southeast.  miles on my car in  months just on my own before i got rid of that car and got a new one. Would never give up what I did in my s it was a blast and I loved it. Right you get the idea? k.Austin is Nashville is Austin. I had friends that recently moved from Kansas City to Nashville because KCs local scene was dying for them. They couldnt find what they were looking for anymore Hurricanes closed a long time ago Beaumont had Westport was turning into a soulless corporate shithole. Theyre loving Nashville. Great music every night able to go out and find it where they didnt know it even existed. Several friends on Facebook all in Nashville are pretty much doing the same thing.St. Louis has a pretty good scene. Great college town lots of venues still has record stores and most importantly youre going to find decent housing and youre central to a LOT more places than here. Here? Youve got Dallas and Houston in a  hour drive. St Louis? Nashville is a  but youve got Chicago Kansas City Des Moines is under  you get the point. Youre more centralized than down here in Austin.I worked SXSW early s. I tried getting in to work when I moved here  years ago. No one wants to pay you anything but tickets and lip service. If Im going to work I expect to be paid. After  years in the industry if Im going to spend  hours on your show  tickets and a few drinks at a bar isnt worth my time  you arent doing me a favour and dont get so damn offended when I politely decline. If I dont do any work in this town its no skin off my nose thats why i have a day job.Keep in mind Ive not been a musician and Ive only supported the musicians but if youre looking for a place to live here where  can rent a big ass house where you can park a  passenger vantrailer and that wont break the bankCan you find a big ass house? Sure but not anywhere near downtown. Parking a van like that? Quite possibly but dont keep anything of value in it  dont be a dumbass. That wont break the bank.. this is Austin where over  people move a day and have for the past few years. People call the cops over a kid in an apartment throwing a tantrum because he cant have another cookie.Im just being honest. I dont think youre going to find what youre looking for here. Youve looking at it through rose coloured glasses. This is not the Austin it was and this is now the Austin that will sit here take your money and fuck you dry unless youre ready to take whatever job you have to stay afloat. landlords dont care youre an artist or that youre musicians  youre a dime a dozen and people move here every fuckin day mate.Youd do much better moving to a place with a much lower cost of living if youre only going to be living here for  of the year if youre touring  days of the year.I wish you luck whatever you do!

And thats kinda why these largerthaneverbeforezoned and largerthananyothercityminimuminTexas lots were implemented gt so that the lands value would be propped up by the structure sitting on it and the Citys economy and tax base wouldnt tank even further.Now that the markets have turned why is it not reasonable to revisit this practice? And furthermore why do you think neighborhood preservationists are so against it? Current home owners have something to gain in increased liquidity as do developers.The meta look at this situation Holding up the opinion of the established home owners over that of people wishing to be included as home owners is exactly what a large part of this country is railing against right now. You can see it in the presidential election and the cab amp hotel industries etc.If these established owners of the process dont include the opinion of others soon there will be an even bigger market disruption than just Small Lot Amnesty.,Austin,d06zear,1,t5_2qhn5

6675942,0,t1_d09i5d5, Its not a zerosum game. The city can invest in both its local music community and in bringing in tourism dollars. The two are not mutually exclusive in fact a lot of people visit Austin specifically for the live music scene. Im not sure how establishing new venues would retain musician jobs in significant numbers. Theres not a lack of venues. The problem is that there are so many bands in Austin that venues can pay them next to nothing to do a show. A handful of new venues wont change that equation.  I agree that the convention center is ugly but saying it doesnt benefit the vast majority of Austinites is a bit silly. Every single month the convention center has dozens of events and conferences that attract tens of thousands of people to the city. Those people are staying at local hotels and AirBnBs theyre eating at your favorite restaurants theyre shopping at your favorite stores... its an injection of cash money into our local economy. Austin is a top city for conferences and events because its comparatively cheaper than LANYCSF but is still a place that people actually want to visit.    ,Austin,d09umic,10,t5_2qhn5

6687731,0,t1_d0azbw0,Good points. But Im not arguing that in an environment where there is massive outside pressure on the market that any solution would make housing considerably cheaper as you say.  Im just saying that it would soften the rise if you had more options than fewer.  If the demand were neutral and multi family homes were offered for the same price or more than the same single family home not counting amenities that come with condos such as pools and fitness centers then something fishy would be up and most likely the market would reject it in favor of single family lots with more space.  ,Austin,d0b2ivh,1,t5_2qhn5
6689214,0,t1_d0b7rx4,gtThey did a bunch of capital expenditures this year bought new buses and stuff. Are you allocating this cost over the assets lifetime or just putting it all in one year? If so the cost in later years could be far less.I based it on revenue not expenditures.   of revenue comes from the  sales tax and does not vary with yeartoyear variations in capital expenditures.gtA lot of people who use cap metro are part of the vunerable population. These are people that couldnt use cars. For example the blind mentally handicapped people that are highdrunk all the time. I know a blind guy that has a van literally pick him up and drive him places for free. For a applestoapples comparison his free car would need a free driver.This is not meant to be a practical suggestion only an illustration of just how expensive public transportation is.gt The average cost of owning and operating a vehical is about . This includes the cost of the car I think so lets subtract the annuitized value of k over  years and  interest k. This means just operating a sedan costs about  dollars a year even if you get the car for free.A Prius C is less than  per year to own including the payments If you want to run the calculations purely on cost of ownership it actually comes back even worse.  Cap Metro runs on around  in total revenue taxes plus fares.  Divide that by  and you have  per person per year.Again not an actual suggestion.

I have worked with organizations that rescue train and provide dogs for veterans with severe PTSD and Ive seen the effect some of these animals can have.  Two cases come to mind.  In one case a soldier who spent most of his time hiding in his closet was able to break from his crippling fear because he felt protected by his Belgian Malinois mix.  Belgian Malinois are often used as military dogs so that helped this guy feel safe enough to go outside to the store etc.  The fact that the dog was a complete sweetie that was afraid of squirrels did not seem to matter.Another one I remember was a vet with agoraphobia.  He was given a young lab mix to care for which meant that he had to leave his apartment to walk the dog at least twice a day.  Due to his sense of duty to this dog he did what was necessary.  He could not force himself to go outside for other humans but he could for his dog.  Remember humans created dogs.

If the business arranges for the art to be repaired and demands BET pay the bill it is likely to cost a few hundred or perhaps into the low thousand which BET will file under their advertising budget.  The cost of repairs is fairly minor for BET.In addition to fixing the art the owners should push the police for criminal mischief  graffiti charges against the individuals and businesses involved. Since the cost to repair all the murals is easily over the  limit it reaches into the felony category. Under  in damage is still a misdemeanor.

Those are two of the top ten largest metroplexes oin the Country and you know what? They have a shit ton of roads under construction. You know why? Because they need it. And these places already have the holy grail of light rail that did exactly jack shit to alleviate their traffic issues.Austin needs to decide if they want to be the sleepy little cool hipster town or if they want to be the big bad destination metropolis that everyone likes to make it out to be. Within the next few years Austin will have joined the top  largest cities in the nation. Aside from three lesser used toll roads out on the periphery what highways has Austin built or expanded? Right...not much of anything.Now go ask that exact same question about Dallas Fort Worth Houston San Antonio.There is no way to fix Austin traffic without expanding roads and new roads.

7136319,0,t1_d1pat9k,gt So youre saying that the CoA has zero process for changing the zoning of a platted lot and they can just do it by fiat?Not at all! The citys rezoning process is long and complicated. If they wanted to rezone this property from SF to say CS Commercial Services to allow a gas station or GO General Office to allow a dentists office or whatever they have a whole series of notifications and hearings they go through although ultimately its the City Councils decision. Im saying that dedicating land as public right of way doesnt go through a rezoning process as public right of way isnt a zoning category its a totally different type of land outside the zoning process.gt And were not even addressing the ethical and legal implications of the City accepting Milestones donation. If the City wants to put a street in then it should use eminent domain in a more open process like it would have to do under any other circumstance.Eminent domain is a rarelyused last resort process used for seizing land against an owners wishes. The owner of this land Milestone is perfectly willing to part with it so it would make zero sense to use eminent domain. Developers gifting land as rightofway happens all the time. When you see a large subdivision with a whole bunch of houses sitting on a street typically thats because some developer owned a bunch of land and was required to build streets on it to make their houses accessible then they gift those streets to the city to maintain as public.gt This is a back room deal. Im convinced that somebody in the City bureaucracy is trying to bend the rules so they dont have to follow City policy.It sounds like theres little evidence that can convince you otherwise. Oh well! But for the record on a large development like this the city requires extremely detailed agreements before it permits them to go ahead. These agreements are to ensure that the developer is complying with the citys many complicated and sometimes contradictory regulations. To ensure that the city staff believes the plan is legal the developer is required to have many many many meetings with city staff before the plan is finalized and taken before City Council for a vote. Some people call these meetings regulation and oversight you seem to think of them as backroom dealing.If you oppose this plan because you dont like the idea of an existing row of SF homes broken up to have a street placed between two of them I understand! Neither of the adjacent neighbors signed up to live on a corner lot! Cities change all the time and while it seems pretty unreasonable to have imagined that their undeveloped backyard was going to remain undeveloped forever it is surprising to find that your neighbors house will be torn down to make a street.I dont believe that makes this plan illegal. but by all means if you oppose it because you think its a bad plan lobby your city council members not to go through with it.,Austin,d1pbktf,1,t5_2qhn5

Any amount of time in traffic and you know the slinky effect where a deceleration produces a wavelike effect.

I knew it was a long way out and I was mentally prepared for the expensive food so that was all good. The venue itself is pretty nice clean with good sound. Weather last night was perrrrfect.Nile Rodgers is an inspiration to me. Far from being just a disco nostalgia act Chic also perform other Rodgers penned hits recorded by others including Lets Dance and his collaboration Farrell Williams and Daft Punk Get Lucky. Their live sound is completely on point its a band of musics musicians. They were in the pocket for the whole set and it was funky.This was my nd time to see them. The first was at Essence Fest  when they played right before Prince. Both times Ive seen Chic Nile Rodgers has bared his heart on stage in a good way sharing from the heart his gratitude for life love and music. Last night he said how broken up he was about Princes death but that our smiling faces seen in the sunlight at the outdoor amphitheater in Awesome Austin were helping lift his spirits through the loss. For me who loves both Prince and Nile Rodgers and who had seen them on stage together at Essence Fest this was a serious teary eyed moment. Beautiful and all heart and soul.Duran Duran dedicated their whole performance to Prince starting with purple lights and a dedication message up on the video screen before their first song.The set was a great overview of their long career not just an s nostalgia set. They sounded good overall but were not as tight musically as they could have been. Still they hit some great highs and it was a very cool show. Great lights and effects.For their encore Simon came out and spoke a moment about Prince. He related how they had heard about Princes emergency plane landing  health scare the week prior and at that then that night they had dedicated Save A Prayer to him for quick recovery. And now a week later he had passed and so now again they wanted to dedicate the song to him.

I never cut over at the last minute I just accept my fate so as not to cause problems but Im not surprised that people are bad drivers in Austin. The lanes on most freeways are also much smaller than I am used to. I feel uncomfortable being right next to a car because it feels like youre inches away.

This guy shot a dog dead for basically no reason and even admitted it wasnt a threat. By every measure I can think of that would be called murder except he did it to someones pet so its being called pet murder. Thats all were doing here I dont see what the problem is.No he wont be charged with pet murder because that isnt a crime at least not in any place I know of. But language isnt beholden to some specific set of definitions and we can call him whatever the fuck we want and in this case were calling him a pet murderer. And yes Im sure you can come up with some kind of convoluted examples of how thats logically inconsistent with some specific other way we treat animals but who gives a fuck?

For compliance of the fingerprinting section it saysgt Benchmarks are calculated as the percentage of hours or miles driven by compliant drivers of the total hours or miles driven by other drivers for the TNC during the benchmark time period. I assume they must have meant all instead of other?  Otherwise imagine for simplicity that every driver drives the same amount...and to put a number on it each group drives  hours during the year.  The benchmark percentage would be  in this case even though only half the drivers were fingerprinted.  In the real world scenario where some drivers are full time and many drivers are part time I could see a scenario where maybe  of drivers are fingerprinted and the TNC could still have  or more of the benchmark.,Austin,d35ejya,1,t5_2qhn5

7859500,0,t1_d3z3mtf,I dont believe the Travis County program targets any particular neighborhoods. If anything I think the county hedged its bets. Property tax rate is around  in most of the city. Property value is generally rising. You buy a home it gets appraised again at a potentially higher value and the county recoups the grant within three years. Most people stay in their first home longer than that. Lets not forget that k was k for  the upper limit. It includes all the folks making less. Personally we almost went through with the program this spring. We backed out because we werent comfortable with how low our savings would dip to handle closing costs. Our income is near the top of the eligibility range but thats a recent change. Childcare and student loans eat up more than  of my familys takehome pay but will be gone from the budget within ten years.  For people like us it lets us get into a house and stop renting a little sooner. County locks in people it has financially vouched as tax payers and some folks stop renting a little sooner. In that situation it doesnt seem bad. Im sure there are ways it can backfire.,Austin,d3zh8sx,1,t5_2qhn5

8016725,0,t3_4p03mq,Council is being asked to provide  of additional contract spending authority for the continued performance of professional services necessary for the completion of this project. This . million is available in the current fiscal year budget of the Library Department. These funds will not affect programs or services. The funds will come from cost savings on operational contracts and commodities which will be deferred to the next budget year.While construction of the project is progressing the presently anticipated Substantial Completion date for the delivery of a finished building has moved from March to November of . This will ultimately move the opening date of the Library until spring of . Accordingly Lake|Flato and Shepley Bulfinch the projects design consultant the Consultant will be required to provide six months of construction administration services beyond its contractual completion date. These services include reviewing contractor submittals addressing design issues clarifying and interpreting contract documents facilitating progress and recording a set of changes that occur during construction. The timing of this agenda item is critical to moving the project forward and maintaining the anticipated completion schedule.Taking into account the current contract budget the authorization being requested is necessary to complete the Project. While both the Consultant and the City have asserted claims on the Project the claims will not be resolved until the Project approaches completion. It is the Citys position that the consultant is at least partially responsible for Project delays and it is the Consultants position that it is owed compensation for other services and increased costs. The parties have agreed to a reservation of rights agreement to preserve their respective positions as the Project continues to progress. While it is anticipated that the City will recover and offset some of its costs any such recovery will not occur in time to postpone the requested funding action.In addition to the present request for design contract funding authorization staff will likely bring a request for an increase in the construction cost limitation for the Hensel Phelps construction contract later this year as multiple project change order requests and claims are addressed.It seems there is going to be a process later where the city tries to recoup costs from the contractor due to the nature of the delays. ,Austin,d4h5khe,13,t5_2qhn5

The greater Austin area has a number of soil types which have various likelihoods of presenting foundation problems for various types of foundations in various conditions.  You should get a structural engineer to look at it before buying anything with foundation issues.  A lot of people are skeptical about many types of foundation repair commonly performed.  Ultimately you cant fix soil that is too expansive or a foundation that was poured too thin.

I get it I think lots of people would if they kept their prejudices out of it.  Its the same reason I like fast cars.  I can never use the speed I have and doing so is dangerous but I like knowing its there it makes me feel powerful to know how much force is available under my right foot.gtI think the benefits outweigh the negatives.I dont think this is a winning argument though.  I think gun advocates who try to push guns as a solution to problems or as being a net good to society are doing afterthefact justification.  I dont think guns are a net good and I dont think they ever will be but thats not the point.

Austin is home to the Austin State Hospital multiple addiction and treatment centers Brack Seton and St Davids all have mental health facilities inside the city limits. The most at risk populations for becoming homeless come from all the surrounding areas for treatment counseling and help. Once folks are discharged from these facilities there is a patchwork of group homes and day centers to try and keep folks off the street for people who need it but for a huge number of reasons many of these folks end up on the street anyways. If they get stuck in a cycle of incarceration it only solidifies their hopeless situation and is way more expensive than plans like this which involve ongoing outreach programs to keep people out of jail and out of the emergency rooms. ,Austin,d5wh42n,14,t5_2qhn5

8534811,0,t1_d67rrq6,The recent flooding has done a number on all of the woodsy trails to the western side of that park but the overgrownness is just something that happens every year to varying degrees. I used to run my dogs there every morning before the bridge collapsed and some after and swore up and down that Id just take my damn mower and trimmer and clean that trail up every few months but never did. As soon as fall comes around though the grasses and shrubs die back the trail widens and you get that beautiful autumn second spring of low new grasses and flowers without the brambly mess of the summer. Having said that I havent wandered the far north trails that sit along the Colorado since about the midpoint of the heavy flooding a few months back so its possible that entire sections of trail have collapsed along the southern Colorado banks that I dont even know about. ,Austin,d68f113,3,t5_2qhn5

8550761,0,t3_4wvlx0,Full text gtThe move comes after Union Pacific Corp. NYSE UNP in February backed out of an agreement with the Lone Star Rail District key to making the commuter rail line a reality. The Lone Star Rail project hinged on using Union Pacifics rails between Austin and San Antonio. In exchange planners would have built a new rail line for Union Pacific.gtgtDuring Monday nights meeting commissioners frustrations with Lone Star Rail District officials was evident. The project began in  as the AustinSan Antonio Intermunicipal Commuter Rail District before changing its name in .gtgtI have lost such faith in them that I want to make sure that this institution is as clear as possible that we divorce ourselves from the Lone Star Rail organization said Will Conley Hays County commissioner and CAMPO policy board chairman.gtgtAustin Mayor Steve Adler also a member of the CAMPO policy board pressed to make sure that the language of the resolution permitted CAMPO officials the Texas Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration to attempt to meet with Union Pacific officials to see if there was any way the project could move forward on their lines.gtgtMy belief is that UP has the same crisis in confidence in Lone Star Rail that we have in Lone Star Rail said Adler. I believe that there is an opportunity to handle this at a higher level. Lets raise different kinds of issues where our messenger was not Lone Star Rail.gtgtBut Adlers colleagues on the board grew increasingly frustrated and skeptical as the mayor pressed for this option.gtgtThey obviously know what they are doing said board member and Cedar Park Mayor Matt Powell. I havent seen any indications from them that they have left anything off the table. Lets end this one and move forward.gtgtAshby Johnson executive director of CAMPO said during the meeting that the vote will start an official process to remove Lone Star Rail from its longrange transportation plan. That will be handled as part of the organizations regular plan amendment process.gtgtStarting Aug  a proposed amendment removing the project from the longrange plan will begin a day public comment process. It would feature  open houses across all six CAMPOmember counties. At CAMPOs September board meeting the organization will hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment. After that the amendment removing Lone Star Rail returns to CAMPO during its October meeting for a final vote to accept the amendment which would the put final spike into the rail proposal.,Austin,d6af1m1,3,t5_2qhn5

8644525,0,t1_d6k8r7e,Sorry for the wall of text...probably TMI and I get a little rambly about this topic so just take from it what you will haha.Im really glad that the ladies at Planned Parenthood were able to assist you.  Dealing with endo is incredibly frustrating for a lot of reasons not the least is figuring out a treatment plan.  Im sorry youre going through this at all.  People dont really understand that this is a chronic disease that can control your life.  The pain doesnt just come during your periodhonestly I generally have pain all month long.  That happens when you have internal bleeding and scarring where it doesnt belong.  Im going to be honest I have had the most success with pain management right after my laparotomies.  They go in and burn it all out and then start you on hormone therapy birth control pills or injections to prevent ovulation which in turn slows down the growth of the endometrium in your body.  Problem is that shit still grows back!  Or at least can which it has in my case.  However my last surgery was  years ago my symptoms have been getting pretty bad again and I dont have the means to do surgery anytime soon so I have figured out a few things that help.Lifestyle changes like exercise and a good diet are key.  So your gym membership will totally help!  Alcohol is not a friend and things that make you gassy wont be kind to you either Im thinking about going gluten free but I love gluten so... Ive been on all sorts of painkillers over the years and while narcotics are helpful theyre not really a viable long term solution.  Naproxen sodium is best when it comes to OTC and the key is to stay ahead of the pain.  The only way to really do that is to become very familiar with your symptoms.  Ive found that using the app Eve really helpsit enables me to track my symptoms and my spotting and whatnotand its free!  For real though the thing that has helped me the most is marijuana.  No terrible side effects doesnt destroy my liver actually helps with the pain SO MUCH its stupid.  I dont think I could have made it out of bed a lot of days without it.  Risky for the obvious legal reasons but I cant stress enough how helpful it is for my daily functioning.Heat pads like the bed buddy things you pop in the microwave are a godsend.  For days when you gotta go to work or function in reality like youre not dying on the inside Thermacare heat pads go right in your pants and stay hot for like  hours.  Epsom salt baths on bad days.  When I was in high school and still on my dads insurance plan I was able to get deep tissue massages on some of my problem areas and though it hurt it helped in the long run. I have definitely found that when I am stressed or low on sleep my symptoms are worse and Im more liable to get ill.  The more healthy choices I make exercise regularly eat fruits and veggies get lots of rest not overextending myself the more manageable my pain is.  Its a really rough road.  I wish I had a surefire thing to tell you that would prevent the pain but my experience has been that its just kind of there a lot of the time.  The plus side to that is my pain tolerance is out of this world and Ive just gotten kind of used to it   I know other women who have no issue controlling theirs though with little more than the right birth control for them and advil.  Im hoping you lean more towards the latter. Again sorry for the ramble I hope this was somewhat helpful!  If theres anything else you have questions about or you just need an ear obviously I have no issues with talking about the nitty gritty of this.  I have found that its hard to find people who dont think youre exaggerating or making things up or just being a flake because you dont look sick.  Im sending lots of positive vibes your way!!!,Austin,d6m6d92,1,t5_2qhn5

8736743,0,t3_4zol58,Flashback to The machine is spinning up with the cry Austin desperately needs more convention center hotel rooms.Mayor Lee Leffingwell takes to the dias to proclaim the city needs another large hotel to help attract larger conventions and other events.Randy McCaslin a vice president in Houston for PKF Consulting a hotel industry consulting firm has said Austin is losing an enormous amount of economic impact by not having enough rooms to maximize the use of the convention center.OK so  years later and now the emergency is that we have too many hotel rooms and need a larger convention center to fill them.  For some reason we also need to compete other cities measuring our centers to brag about whos is biggest.  Its an arms race with the centers needing more hotels which need bigger centers which need more hotels and on and on.  In the meantime bigger and bigger chunks of downtown are turning into convention center wastelands  places where no one goes unless they are here for a convention.  Dead zones usually marked by oversized blocks that impede both auto and pedestrian traffic and masses of pedestrians at meeting start and end times but no one to be seen otherwise.I would much rather live with the center we have now and just let San Antonio and Denver have the big meetings we cant.  Id be much happier with vibrant urban life  life on those blocks.,Austin,d6xqp1y,3,t5_2qhn5

Those who disagree with me can call me whatever names they want I dont care. This isnt about terrorism or security Im not worried about that at all. I am worried about being asked to burden the costs when our own need so much more help. Its for that reason Im against taking in refugees.

Toss in k in renos on the house and it is k which is still lower than most of Austin. It would be a gigantic pain in the ass so I dont see this being a thing people do in the future. Just my  cents after actually researching it. k is on the high side too for a move. So say you found a house in a suburb of Austin it would be much cheaper than that. I factor in that much because of where my family house is how big it is and moving it  miles. ,Austin,d8bpnfh,2,t5_2qhn5

9178055,0,t3_56142k,From uGirardKinney in the Schedule Postgt In the early to mideighties City Council passed ordinances prohibiting billboards i.e. offpremises signs in Austin and the ETJ. Councilmembers stated at that time and other councilmembers have stated over the years that the long range goal was and is to eventually rid Austin of its billboards.gt In  the billboard industry was successful in lobbying council to allow relocation of billboards i.e. removing some reconstructing others in someone elses neighborhood usually out along the gateways to our city. At that time the number of billboards had steadily declined from around  in the s to about  in  through attrition i.e. when a billboard came down for any reason it was generally not allowed to go back up anywhere. The action in  stopped attrition in its tracks i.e. the number of billboards has been relatively static since then i.e. we are no longer achieving the goal of ridding the city of billboards.gt Recently the billboard industry has proposed an amendment that would further erode the offpremises sign ordinance among other things allowing taller billboards but most notably allowing conversion of existing sign faces to digital i.e. internally lighted with changing images up to every  seconds  claiming that the fact that they would allow public messages will make driving safer.gt Scenic Austin believes the billboards and especially digital billboards not only detract from view of the beauty of our city but also distract drivers from driving safely it is obvious to us that the PURPOSE of a billboard is to distract otherwise they would not work for their intended commercial purpose. To see a short Scenic Austin Video on this topic go to YouTube uGirardKinney s yesno versions are also posed heregtWith regards to my earlier post about digital billboards my questions aregt If elected will you co sponsor or at least support a resolution reaffirming the longrange goal of eliminating billboards in Austin and its ETJ?gt If elected will you oppose digital billboards?,Austin,d8fdw1m,1,t5_2qhn5

9232433,0,t1_d8m8tju,The company is Lane Construction out of Waco. This is an open hole in pavement surrounded by construction debris. The area was left open like this overnight public can access it and there was no lighting. It is illegal for us to leave open holes like this at ANY time without a barrier to prevent cars employees and citizens from falling into the hole or tripping over debris. Also about  feet further to the South is an even more dangerous excavation which is about ft long and ft deep without ANY type of barrier protecting traffic and citizens from dropping into the hole. Multiple sites are like this or even worse. Aside from the total disregard for public safety the construction of the sound barrier walls is as bad as anything I have ever seen. The amount of repair that is needed on certain sections is unbelievable. Drunken monkeys could have done better. ENTIRE sections are scheduled for demolition and rebuild. The contractor that I worked for is working under TampM contingency time and material. The have hired a bunch of unskilledlow skilled workers for hr which they turn around and bill the General ContractorCHM Hill  times that amount. Material is billed at twice the cost. Unused new tools are stacked in containers by the dozens. Every piece of heavy equipment is under rental and is being billed at x a large  type excavator costs kmonth rental for example. A Lot of the equipment is not even used and is present for billing purposes only. The overbilling is not a secret and is openly bragged about. Its YOUR tax  Austinites and it is being misused and stolen outright. It is also a TXDOT project and every taxpayer in Texas is being robbed.

Just try to eat a burger there then walk across the street to the b hail and hog or even elevation burger and try one from the Alamo.Same prices vastly inferior food.  Fries are single fried taste like frozen mix or maybe fresh mix not fresh cut potatoes. They should be double fried low temp and high temp.  Like all good fry places.Burgers are not seasoned well and cooked way beyond well done.  Ive asked they always come super well done and dry.

If you disagree where are the German American studies courses? Italian American studies? Scandinavian American studies? All of which contributed far more to making America great and thats without counting all the detrimental impacts of Mexico on the USA. Its really a kind of mental disorder ... its really textbook codependency that has developed from low selfesteem and selfrespect due to constant abuse and misuse from abusive Democrats the left communist socialist and muslim infiltration usurpers and selfsaboteurs have brought into the country in the name of diversity.Why would we be focusing on promoting Mexico and thereby weakening ourselves when they are an adversary engaged in an active effort to demographically overwhelm us for their own interests so they can take over the southwest one day. They call it the Reconquista which the President of Mexico has openly stated is happening. It is precisely why all the Mexican nationalists are burning the American flag on our soil and flying the flag at the riots and unrest they are causing.

9675982,0,t1_da4j2is,Uber and Lyft wont provide numbers. In fact they sued Houston to prevent that information from becoming public and a judge prevented any city in Texas from releasing the info.This is part of the issue of Uber and Lyft. They are operating in a space that provides a public service transportation that the government has mostly turned over to private companies limos cabs etc and in return those companies must provide information back to the city that is public inspectable and reportable. However they refuse to allow the info to be public  suing the government instead. In my opinion that is so that they dont let anyone know how much money they are making and they can claim things like fingerprinting requirements are too much for them to operate profitably technically theyve never said that they cant be profitable but thats the implication they put forth for like ever until recently when they switched and claimed fingerprinting was discriminatory. Theyve also recently started admitting that they do make money in N America after implying for like ever that they didnt. But just because they are kind of deceitful and dicks doesnt mean they shouldnt operate here.

According to the International Code Council ICC they issued a ruling way back in the s that yes they do require them.According to the uniform plumbing code they do not.Though one could argue that both codes defer to manufacturers installation requirements so that supersedes whether or not theyre required by code.Austin code is adopted from the  IRC International Residential Code promulgated by the ICC so theoretically yes theyre required in Austin. However practically no municipality enforces all codes so no not really is the final answer.Also they arent required on sinks. If theyre there though they are required to recover quickly enough to not overflow. I would say about  actually do recover quickly enough.edit Actually thinking about it Austin follows the UPC for plumbing stuff so no not required by code.

Intentional strawmanning usually has the goal of  avoiding real debate against their opponents real argument because the misrepresenter risks losing in a fair debate or  making the opponents position appear ridiculous and thus win over bystanders.Unintentional misrepresentations are also possible but in this case the misrepresenter would only be guilty of simple ignorance. While their argument would still be fallacious they can be at least excused of malice.,Austin,dbpvu5d,2,t5_2qhn5

10159895,0,t3_5lgomf,OK heres my system. It seems to be working ... mostly. Get up in the morning take two Zyrtec with a glass of water immediately before even going to the bathroom.Go to the bathroom then take a nice hot shower. Immediately after drying off and before even taking the time to get dressed Two squirts of FloNaze in each nostril while your sinuses are still clear and there will be nothing between the FloNaze and your mucous membranes.If my eyes start to bother me AT ALL Two drops of Bauch amp Lomb Alaway in each eye. Dont wait till it is really bugging you. That just makes it more likely that it will trigger your sinuses too.No more than eight hours after the first dose I take one more Zyrtec.Just before bed I take yet another Zyrtec. I know thats a lot. You will likely want to take less. I just decided that I would rather my liver take a bit of a hit than to be suffering for  of the year. Besides I dont drink so I figure Im coming out ahead. During the rest of the year I only take one Zyrtec per day.I also keep my humidifier going as much as I can stand it. Dry sinuses are irritable sinuses. I run it all night long no matter how high the humidity already is in my apartment. Finally I do not use regular Kleenex. That crap has dust on it that just irritates your sinuses even further. Believe it or not I just use napkins from Wendys and Chipotle and such. It feels more rough but actually is less abbrasive to the skin around your nostrils and has no dust to irritate your sinuses.Normally I would have gone through half a box of Kleenex already today. The first year I was here I had to go around with a respirator on. At work I had to sit with my HEPA filter blowing right on my face. When I got home from work I had to isolate myself in my tiny room with another HEPA filter running . But now I am sitting here after spending plenty of time outside breathing through BOTH nostrils at the same time!Yes I looked into allergy shots. I cant afford it even with my insurance. I am not a doctor or an expert on this crap by any means. But this is what seems to be working for me.Good luck.,Austin,dbvoifv,8,t5_2qhn5

I wish Id known about this event.gt if you are a true transgender person and you go to the court and get your birth certificate changed were not discriminating against you.The level of contempt or willful ignorance it takes to offer up such a statement as a simple and succinct defense of this proposal is epic.  There is nothing remotely simple remotely affordable or remotely standardized about this proposed legal standard.  In the most basic case where the person in question was born in the state of TX you must have surgery minimum k likely not covered by insurance if youre even lucky enough to have insurance.   You have to hire one of the very few attorneys in the state who have experience with this K.  Your attorney had better get you in front of the right judge because they are free to deny your petition if they feel some moral compunction to do so or even if they dont think you arent convincing enough.  I know post op women who were denied.So there are a whole bunch of ways in which he thinks its untoward for the govt to compel behavior but hes totally fine withholding a persons identity and legal status until theyve spent absurd amounts of money undergone a major and invasive surgery that some people arent inclined to want to endure and even if they do the waiting lists can be years long?  How many other groups of people have to go through something like this just to be able to piss in the right room?But its no big secret that you dont have to be born here to call TX home.  If you were born in a state that prohibits birth certificate modification then youre screwed period.  And what of the people who came here from somewhere like CA where there is no surgical requirement for birth certificate modification?  So they get to pee in the right bathroom in TX but not people born in TX?  Unequal treatment under the law.I really wish the interviewer could have at least touched on some of this stuff.gt We dont have a law today in the state of TX that says men cant go in the ladies bathroom.Correction...we have never had a law like this and there has been no spate of abusive behavior as a result of it.

10375483,0,t1_dck1py2,I agree minimum wages should be adjusted regionally and not federally.On the other hand a high national minimum wage could incentivize reversal in trends of flight from smaller cities and towns across the country.  Not really a relevant point but an interesting possibility to consider.  It could in fact reduce strains on already overburdened metropolitan infrastructure resources and services.Edit Furthermore if driverless commuting becomes as commonplace as many predict in the coming years suburban style housing development will likely undergo a surge disrupting the very meaning of the term metropolitan area and altering the framework within which costofliving per region must be considered.Retail and Telecom are certainly apples and oranges.  I didnt intend to compare companies across those industries.  The idea that companies have any interests in the survival of competing companies and so are therefore interested in maintaining antitrust legislation is a bit of a stretch in the face of the enormous amount of evidence that companies can and do seek monopolistic advantage and outright market domination all the time.  Telecom is only one example.  The banking pharmaceutical health insurance especially utility entertainment and even software industries all rely on monopoly advantage to a greater or lesser extent and within certain regional boundaries.Given enough relaxation in antitrust and laws like the Fair Labor Standards Acts I am certain that most employers have more than enough incentive and would not hesitate to suppress and even collude to suppress wages far below the existing price points at which workers trade their labor.,Austin,dck4gry,0,t5_2qhn5

BUT I have a gut feeling backed up by several sessions of driving around Austin for  hours getting no rides that theyve successfully onboarded so many drivers that the more lucrative supplydemand setup there was before has gone by the wayside ergo the decision to commit equally to both Fasten and Ride side bitch note da fuq is up with . ratings and below based on ONLY last  rides!!! are grounds for deactivation?? feels necessary.BUT heres the kicker to my original question Im pretty sure that he had Fasten online in the background while giving me my RideAustin ride....is this a thing?...I was fairly certain that all of them boot us offline after a certain period of inactivity?,Austin,dd45hhs,1,t5_2qhn5

You speak as if your view is the only correct one but My opinion and that of many others in this cityDensity doesnt belong everywhere. People shouldnt be forced to live in a small house or apartment in the middle of the city. Areas with large houses on large lots shouldnt have to be surrounded by small lots in the neighborhoods. Moving people around by car from anywhere in the city is still important. Cheap housing doesnt mean better housing. Preserved natural lands shouldnt be replaced with more development. Quiet neighborhoods shouldnt suddenly be trafficked by thousands of cars. We also deserve a voice. There are people who reasonably want to make central Austin near downtown through the numbered streets more dense and focused on public transportation. But there are others who want to make changes that basically strand everyone not in this area outside. ,Austin,dd45vwl,5,t5_2qhn5

Most people dont use Reddit most that do dont subscribe to subreddits dedicated to specific politicians most that do dont post etc.Im an ardent Sanders supporter and an ardent Clinton opponent insomuch that I have the liberty to choose between the two and not destroy my country in the process.

10660308,0,t1_ddfht53,Not a lawyer or city planner or anything but in my experience youll be fine.  It somewhat depends on where the house is.  eg if its a super nice westlake house then yea the buyer might require to see all permits proof of work etc.  If its an east austin fixerupper where this stuff happens all of the time its a sellers market through and through.Basically the only way that it could really hurt you is if a seller forced you to provide some kind of documentation of it  of which you can just say it was like that when you bought it and you just fixed it up.If you DO pull permits though bear in mind that they DO all need to be closed out before you sell.  A friend of mine who incidentally actually does built mil homes in Westlake now lived out near Steck and MoPac.  He built a garage with studio apartment above it.  He needed to pull permits because it was entirely new construction on the house cant really get away with that so much.Anyway when he went to sell it turns out that he was over his impervious cover for residential I believe its  total max coverage  includes footprint driveways walkways etc. and by like  sq ft or something crazy.He had to postpone selling the home pull a permit to do this repair rent a cement cutter cut literally  inches off of his driveway from street to garage door then have it inspected and then the permit was closed and he could sell it.  He got it done being a professional builder and all but it took him another  months if Im recalling correctly.Point being that it can go both ways.  Again Im sure there are plenty of people on this sub that could argue with me but the level of developmental bureaucracy is insane.  Most people who have gone through the process of any kind will echo this to you.  It can get very expensive but again the biggest killer is time.

10684434,0,t1_ddhwis5,I feel like youre mixing up terms and concepts here.gt  literally not doing anything as a response to police questions...is at best risky...When you talk about your not doing anything being risky youre really talking about the risk that an officer may respond inappropriately to your passive conduct right?  An officer can judge that you could be a threat but if your response to their questions is really just to do nothing then youre not legally subjecting yourself to force or arrest.  So if the risk is that in the US today you may well be tasedarrestedtackledshotwhatever anyway then that may be relevant to a debate about whether youre smart. But its not relevant to a debate about who is actually legally and morally responsible for that outcome that would be the officer exercising force or power outside what is sanctioned by the law. Otherwise it just becomes an argumentum ad baculumShe called me a loser so I punched her. She knows I have a temper so shes really got nobody to blame but herself. Why would she create a violent risky situation like that? I guess some people are just irresponsible.gt...and at worst obstructionYou mean a criminal offense of obstruction? How? There isnt even a specific obstruction of justice or of governmental operation offense in this context in Texas. It is a chapter title  in the Penal Code but the offenses under that heading arent defined the way you probably think they are.For example you cannot commit Failure to Identify . in Texas by refusing to saydo anything unless you are already under arrest not just being questioned not even just detained. You cannot commit . resisting arrest or resisting search or resisting detention in Texas except by using force against the peace officer or another. ...and unless you arent using a reasonable amount of force to resist an officer who is using more force than necessary to apprehend you before you started resisting. Thats an affirmative defense in Texas.  Force in this context according to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals means violence compulsion or constraint exerted upon or against the officer. gt In essence using force against the peace officer or another means violence or physical aggression or an immediate threat thereof in the direction of andor into contact with or in opposition or hostility to a peace officer or another. I.e. passively resisting arrest is a meaningless phrase in Texas law that does not describe unlawful conduct no matter how many times police chiefs or department PIOs use it. Further you cannot commit . evading arrest or detention in Texas unless you know you are fleeing from a peace officer or federal special investigator attempting lawfully to arrest or detain you. Take a moment to remember every time a confession dumb lie incriminating action entry search discovery or whatever else was deemed admissible because the interaction was technically voluntary even if it was orchestrated to make it psychologically difficult to say no shut up close the door or walk away. Unless you want all of those thrown out you cant turn around and try to criminalize the rare person who responds to police pressure by actually saying nothing putting his headphones back on and walking away. Huge swathes of criminal proceedings rest on the assertion that defendants could have just done exactly that.There is an offense of . Obstructing a highway or other passageway that can involve refusing a reasonable request or order to move but I doubt thats what youre talking about. In any event the request has to be made for the purposes of clearing the obstruction not as an excuse to badger you. And Im pretty sure theres no way it would be lawful to distinguish whether or not youre an obstruction based on the content of your voluntary  protected speech. If youre not obstructing the sidewalk while youre being verbally cooperative to questions then obviously youre still not obstructing the sidewalk if youre ignoring questions. ,Austin,ddi0od9,7,t5_2qhn5

Consider if legal immigrantion required but a signature everyone would do it. If it also required  fewer people would do it. Keep extrapolating along this path and its easy to see that the more difficult the process the fewer people will do it. We can decrease illegal immigrantion by making the path to citizenship easier and cracking down on employers who exploit illegal immigrants. Thing is we dont actually want to do that. The illegal immigrantion crack down is a scape goat from our real problems automation the growing economic divide and a global economy.

With local PDs or Sheriffs Departments where you know exactly where to look but even in the cases where they use normal jails and arrest bookings ICE can and does send the detainees to whatever holding location they want.  In this operation they first sent them to Burnet County Jail but in the article ICE refuses to say where the people are now.That might seem like a minor quibble but our system is really built around the idea that we know who the police have detained and where they are.  It keeps the police honest and ensures that lawyers are able to talk with their clients.To me the whole thing is just uncomfortably close to things like the government of China just disappearing people from Hong Kong they might turn up in a jail on the mainland they might not.,Austin,ddqcj3m,87,t5_2qhn5

Its pretty easy to blame black incarceration during the s on immigrants if you dont account for the other factors namely a ton of laws being passed about marijuana and crack cocaine and the widespread unequal enforcement of those laws on African Americans. And that far more than anything else accounts for the unemployment incarceration and other negative societal impacts in African American communities.

I imagine most people who come here will enjoy it a lot but I would not suggest any musicians move here to try to make it.

Lesbian Gay and Trans people have actual concerns about marrying people of the same sex or changing their sex and having that reflected in a legal manner. Bisexual people cant marry a man and a woman at the same time so they arent afforded the same protections under law.

I used a humidifier at night in the bedroom moved into a nocarpet apartment used Rx nasal sprays and expensive eye drops and would still have awful days during cedar season. Only after the horrible cedar season in  did I take serious action. While shots did not cure me they have significantly improved my situation to the point where the symptoms are mostly alleviated with OTC pills sprays drops and lifestyle improvements mentioned above. Im just glad Im no longer helpless....NOTE I would strongly advise against doing the acceleratedrapidrush immunotherapy buildup. Do it slow. For me personally there were  days after beginning the rushed buildup where I was so incredibly itchy I was seriously having psychological issues.

11340699,0,t1_dfhd9g3,Heres the reality though you pay more for healthcare that is also controlled by the government which determines oh you dont need that because we dont think you should have that procedure because we dont think you deserve it because we are the government so fuck off. Americas main problem is controlling costs and removing the massively inefficient health insurance and health care inefficiencies which account for around  of the cost of healthcare in the USA. Retirement... you seem to have totally skipped over that part. You If you knew what was going on there you would understand that you pay way more into retirement over the course of your work and life and you get a paltry sum back because again We are the government bureaucrats and we determined that you dont deserve what you paid in because we now have uneducated muslim cheap labor to take care of and dont care that pensioners rebuilt the whole country after the first Nazi dictatorship. We are busy building up the second more retarded nazi dictatorship where you equally mean nothing in this islamofascist regime. You should and you ARE responsible for your own retirement if you put the amount the government takes from Europeans and put it in an investment account you would have massively more money back and you would have more control over it and it could not be taken as easily simply by determining you dont deserve the the amount you should have gotten. College education again you are paying for it through taxes and as a side bonus e.g. in Germany in particular because the Government controls higher ed the corruption and nepotism is rampant which is why the children of the elite and academics are far more likely to gain entry to the university all other things being equal. Baby supplies for new parents seriously now you want others to pay for baby supplies too? What is it with you people and making others pay for other peoples choices and lives? Feel free to split the cost with people. Set up an agency that gives out freebies and then lets liberals put their money where their mouths are to pay for everyone elses babies. You are nothing but an authoritarian fascist type if you are trying to make others do things against their will to benefit others thats actually slavery.Im not sure I know what you are trying to say with the last sentence but I know how the European system and society and culture and economy works ... quite well actually. The fundamental difference between the USA and Europe is that we are free and you are not. You cannot choose what to do with your money or resources to any even slightly similar degree as we can. You cannot say you dont want to partake in the hugely defrauding and thieving retirement system. You cannot say you dont want to pay for other peoples babies especially ones that muslims just brought into the country and were imposed upon people against their will and in direct violation of the most fundamental concepts of democracy and in direct contradiction to freedom and liberty and selfdetermination. It would be nice if I could break through the propaganda indoctrination to get you to fully understand the actual the full cost of subservience to government but it is actually far more difficult to get someone convinced of socialist slavery to understand its pernicious nature than to get a free person to understand the trap of socialism and subservience to government that invariably will violate the agreement and social compact just like the European governments have with the import of muslim and otherwise third world incompatible people the industrialists elite see as cheap labor to enrich themselves damned be if they destroy thousands of years of history and culture and civilization in the process.

11364187,0,t1_dfk16hh,On the same note a few months ago I nearly hit a cyclist on North Lamar going north somewhere between th and th dont remember exactly where. I was going between mph which is the speed limit but I cant control physics and blind spots and between the hills and curves I didnt see him until it was almost too late. Luckily there wasnt a car in the right lane so I was able to avoid the guy. I understand needing to use that stretch of road if your final destination is on it but I happened to stop off at a gas station on nd next to P Terrys and not even a few minutes after pulling in I saw him still riding on Lamar heading north. That cyclist while I appreciate him taking a car off the road was making a poor decision riding on Lamar. Hes frustrating drivers on a very busy highway that will have to go around him. Hes also putting his life at risk considering the terrain of the road. Also he could have used the sidewalk. Its only illegal to cycle on the sidewalk in parts of downtown but considering the light pedestrian traffic on the sidewalk coupled with the fact its decently wide in most places on Lamar it wouldnt be a bad idea. Sometimes the route that works best in a car is not the route that works best for a cyclist. This guy could have taken Rio Grande which I believe has a separated bike lane then cut over to Guadalupe if he was going to keep going North past th. Hed be out of the way of cars since Guadalupe has a bike lane and life would be better for both cyclist and driver. Both sides need to work together better. ,Austin,dfk3xp0,4,t5_2qhn5
11364563,0,t1_dfjq10v,If your genuine goal is to reduce abortions unwanted pregnancies the verified effective way to do so is to support initiatives that provide proper sexual education in schools as well as birth control especially to low income folks Planned Parenthood is great for this!. Places that have done this have experienced unsurprising drops in the number of abortions the area has had. This IS the most effective and proven way to accomplish your goal so if you are serious about your goal to want to preventreduce the need for abortions fight for proper sex ed in schools and fund health facilities that hand out or help cover birth control.

Im assuming that cost a fee and probably wouldve been a revenue source for the city. Uber came back with proposed legislation that would let them pay less taxes on their busiest routes repeal the fingerprint checking and allow them to stop in the middle of a lane of traffic to loadunload. The people voted thats bullshit so UberLyft picked up their toys and left. Austins been a dystopian hellhole ever since.Another revenue concern might be that the taxi industry collectively donated k to city council campaigns.

You are required to resolve toll violations within  days from the date the violation notice is created. If payment is not received in this timeframe the account is referred to a collection agency and the charges will no longer appear on your toll statements.The collection agency can offer payment plans to assist with the repayment of balances.gtIf transactions in the collection process are not paid the violation is eligible to be prosecuted in court and additional fees and court fines may be added for each transaction. If you have received a Notice to Appear from a court of law for a toll violation you must contact that court for resolution. Once a toll violation case has been filed with a court of law neither the TxTag Customer Service Center nor the collection agency is able to resolve the transactions. They must be settled through the applicable court.So I would call and explain to them that you never got the  day notice so how could you know that the bill would go to collections if you didnt pay with .Writing this comment reminded me I hoped onto a toll awhile back ago and I have a  dollar balance that was billed on the th of last month.
