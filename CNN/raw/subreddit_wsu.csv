Pullman makes me happy and I could not see myself going anywhere else for school. We do have a reputation as being a party school but you will find parties at any college you go to. You just here about them more in Pullman because it might be the only newsworthy thing that happened on the weekend. The truth is just because other people party every day messed up Monday Twisted Tuesday Wasted Wednesday Thirty Thursday Fu up Friday and then Saturday along with Second Saturday does not mean that you have to. Curriculum wise I know that UW is considered better than WSU but I think that you will find that rankings for undergrad are not useful at all. At WSU you will find teachers that care more about the students and less about releasing some ground breaking research. Personally I have friends that are in engineering at UW and our curriculum is as tough if not tougher than theirs. Which school you choose shouldnt be based on any of this though it should be based on what you think. Visit them both make an educated decision and then you can post another thread about how much you love WSU in one years time.,wsu,ckk19jh,2,t5_2roja

So my research has shown something that could be done after hours maybe drunk or at least buzzed would be mini golf and during the day or early night would be go karting and these ideas did go over well when presented to the  people.

4200019,0,t3_38iyad,I was an RA there last semester and will be an RA there this year! Honestly from an RA perspective the building can be very fun if you get involved! There are always some sort of things going on there and you should usually have something to do if youre bored. The rooms are considered some of the biggest doubles on campus so thats an upside  The building itself isnt the newest or nicest but it has its perks. Its a large building and there are tons of students there so youre bound to make some great friends! Like everyone else said super close to the Southside Dining Hall which is great.

4329137,0,t3_3ak8m8,I worked there for  years while finishing my degree. The most important thing is they want a dedicated person who will be there for a while  year minimum but that was like  years ago now might be more now and will work  hours a week plus overtime. They also want someone who is honest aligns with their values and is what they think is a good fit for the floor. As umattakasturty  pointed out you havent mentioned your qualifications your goals why you need the job what your plans are during or after etc. so I cant tell you if you are going to get the job or not. It is a very good job so it is competitive in the community but they are always hiring. They are very picky about who they choose.I will say do not lie during your interview to get the job. I do not care how desperate you are. SEL puts a lot of time and money into their employees. The trainers both on and off the factory floor work hard to get you up to speed quickly. If you bail before a year or what ever the minimum is now you will be burning a lot of bridges. This job looks great on a resume even if school takes you a little longer you want those references and experience.Also ProTips If they are still doing the assembly test it is brain dead easy. if you can build legos you can do the assembly test. Just follow the instructions and youll do fine Doing SEL and school is do able if you limit yourself to a couple classes and work swing shift. It is not easy but it can be done.

6946516,0,t3_4aunf8,Howdy! Im a current graduate student at WSU with an undergrad from Texas AampM University. I was only at the Pullman campus for two semesters though before moving off to one of the many college of agriculture research sites so I can just give you some first impressions and cant tell you much about their chemistry program. Welcoming campus atmosphere?Yes everyone is very friendly and open. Supportive staff?This one can be hit or miss. I did have some very friendly professors who were happy to meet with me outside of class and were in general very helpful. But I also had some who were somewhat less than professional and some who would just tell me to meet with their TA until I bothered them enough that they realized it would be easier to just meet with me.ParkingIt is very very limited and expensive. I recommend learning the bus schedule and getting comfy walking shoes. There are also a lot of hills on campus so you will get healthy!Cost of living?It is a little more expensive than near Texas AampM but probably comparable to a lot of places in Texas and probably lower than the national average for college towns. Gas is about gallon. Unfortunately there is no HEB here but Safeway has decent quality and Walmart has low prices so you can find what you are looking for. Dissmores is low quality with high prices so I wouldnt bother.College student apartmentsThere are a lot of apartments on College Hill I think it was called. They are a little pricey especially if you want a private bathroom but otherwise fit for the college experience and have plenty of bus stops nearby. If you want something a little more adult there are other options in different sections of town but those are harder to find.Bike and skate friendlyLike I said there are lots of hills so I would only try biking or skating if you are a real enthusiast. Other than that I dont think you should have any problems. Off campus though it is pretty hard to find a bike rack.Townies?They are very friendly.Stores close to campus?Dissmores is the closest grocery store which as I said isnt very good. There are a couple bars and coffee shops within walking distance.Cons?Coming from Texas you will have to spend a lot of money for your first winter here. Snow tires for your car. Winter coat gloves scarf hat waterproof boots. Snow shovel if your apartment doesnt do it for you. Ice scraper and brush for your car windows.Football weekends will be rough. It is just as popular here as it is in Texas.The overall undergrad culture seems more focused on partying than learning but you should be able to stay separated from that if you choose to. The Greeks are definitely more bizarre than any Ive seen before. My first weekend exploring Pullman was the first time to see males laying out to get a tan.It is not very close to any big cities.Pros?You will experience an actual winter which is pretty neat. The summer is pretty mild. Great for getting outside.The student rec center is pretty decent and they offer a lot of exercise classes and have an place to rent outdoor recreation equipment.The graduate school is relatively good at replying to emails quickly. Ive never had any trouble with them.There is a Panda Express on campus!The GPSA graduate and professional student association is pretty good about arranging things throughout the semester. Usually a free bowling night ice cream social Ricos Pub night and the occasional free football ticket.Overall Im pretty happy with WSU. ,wsu,d13pv7v,1,t5_2roja

7969911,0,t3_4ob6nu,Depends a lot on what days of the week youll be here and what your interests are. However here are  of the most popular entertainment spots in Pullman although you can always just walk around and explore WSUPullman on your own. As OneDers mentioned we do have a minigolf spot as well as a driving range and normal course in Pullman  Its a nice way to spend a few hours in the sun. Ive had a few friends do it and they generally seem to like it.. Pullman also has a laser tag as well as a indoor minigolf spot at  Its a super cool experience and a nice way to get to know students that are already going to WSU great time to ask them questions to get a better sense of WSU.. No list of things to do in Pullman would be complete without Zeppoz  a bowling spot that nearly everybody has been to at one point in time or another. Its a pretty typical bowling place so if you like bowling or want to try it that would be a nice way to spend your time.As another option you can go to WSUs recreation center  I wouldnt really recommend this but at least its an option since youll be going to the recreation center as part of your Alive experience later for free.Let me know if you have any more questions and as always GoCougsBesthp,wsu,d4bw6bw,2,t5_2roja

The judge saw none of that.  I cant believe people arent pissed at Barber for whining like a baby and playing the race card.  Just a couple years ago Marquess Wilson whined and played the abuse card and people were pissed.  But since that was against Leach and the football team it must be different.  Such a double standard around here accepting wild accusations one way but not the other.gt ... its clear our in state competition has a much better process that protects their students.Thats compete conjecture.  Show me solid evidence that it is clearly better.  Granted there are pluses and minuses to all systems but simply because UWs system is more adversarial doesnt necessarily make it superior.gt Keep your head buried in the sand and continue to ignore the fact that the school has retained a law firm to review the SCB as a whole after this debacle. You dont do that unless theres a chance something is wrong.Theres certainly the possibility there is something wrong Im not denying that.  But really this EXTERNAL review is being done because of the allegations of racism and bias to get out ahead of this so it doesnt become a bigger PR issue.  Other articles have said that the SCB has been reviewed before and there were changes made but obviously its still there.  So explain to me whats different this time?gt Youre getting torn apart by well thought out arguments left and right in this thread. Its clear youll continue to hold your ignorant views no matter what.Im not getting torn apart at all.  Bring the downvotes just a lot of people on here who would sell their souls for a win on Saturday.  Just because its been over a decade since the football team has been successful doesnt mean WSU should compromise its morals.  Leach used to talk about running a clean program but obviously hes got a job to protect.All youve done is attack me and not the issue at hand and you still havent addressed anything about the incident.  Deflect deflect deflect.  Barber can punch a guy to unconsciousness play the race card and because he has the means to get a lawyer who can find a technicality is able to escape any consequence.

Again it is just lazy to not want conservative speakers because you dont like what they say. ,wsu,dcnx7lp,2,t5_2roja

11346369,0,t3_61xekn,I took Physics  and  and while its not quite the same its pretty similar to  and . Overall for difficulty I would say its pretty easy just as long as you put in a little bit of effort before each exam to review the information. If you just care about passing it shouldnt be too challenging as long as you keep up with the material since physics does build up on itself so the harder topics will seems really hard if you dont understand the easy topics.As for the professors Ill just focus on the professors that Ive had Im a physics minor that occasionally teach  and  and my thoughts on eachYi Gu Had him for  and he was meh at best. Its pretty clear that he didnt want to teach just basically copied some examples from his lecture notes and is just at WSU for the research. Try to avoid.Nicholas Cerruti Had him for . Many people consider him to be the best lower level physics instructor. I thought that he was good. He covered the material well and while I didnt do as well as I would have liked on the exams I blame myself for that and not him. Good professor if you want to understand whats being covered.Fred Gittes Seems to be a bit dividing. I personally liked his passion as it was clear he really wanted to help us and wanted us to succeed. Some people find his lectures to have a bit too many side tangents. Hes a solid choice to have IMHO.Hope that helps you!Besthp,wsu,dfi39yw,2,t5_2roja
