7241670,0,t3_4el6wm,Im just not sure about this and its effects.  Construction seems to be out of hand on Sanibel and Fort Myers too for that matter.  Sure property values go up but at what cost more congestion and higher cost of living.  There are already enough shopping centers and great food locations that this just seems to contradict the Sanibel way of life.  Next Ding Darling and SCCF will sell off plots of preserved land for more commercial or residential lots.  ,Sanibel,d21bpud,3,t5_2v2jv
