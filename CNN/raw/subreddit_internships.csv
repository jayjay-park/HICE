2318440,0,t3_2ltn0n,. I dont know annything about visas but theres a work permit you need in order to work in Denmark. I think the employer would help you with that.. Knowing danish enough to communicate makes it infinitely more easy to get a job but it is certainly not necessary. It is possible to get an internship without knowing any danish. Danish pronunciation and understanding of it is a pain in the a. When you have a permit to work in Denmark and a job you will get a health insurance card. I dont think its any different from insurance for permanent residents.. No worries at all. Im a foreign student in Denmark and I have never experienced any discrimination at all. Danes are really tolerant and im sure they have nothing against foreigners especially in Copenhagen.,internships,cly9v1r,2,t5_2s17d

4699907,0,t1_ctmthpq,no i just kind of winged it. i went there without a plan but i did have friends who helped me out. eventually one suggested me to apply to an internship which i did and stayed in korea for two years. i cant speak korean and im not ethnically korean either. but if i could speak korean it would have really helped. if you dont speak korean then i suggest you learn for the first half of your gap year and then go in your second half to finally intern. but keep in mind that your visa depending on what country youre coming from may limit you to what you can do. for example you cant teach english if you dont have a degree E visa. do some research on what visa youd like and then see if you can even go to korea in the first place legally. you cant earn  on certain things so do your research. ,internships,ctmynmr,2,t5_2s17d
