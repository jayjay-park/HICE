8181971,0,t3_4ra8wn,There are lots of community sites out there but I figured one that wasnt limited by programming language or project would be useful. And being on FB it was fairly easy for most just to apply. Theres some good stuff on there already. Thanks to those who have joined.,learnVRdev,d50aoen,1,t5_3elf8
8812157,0,t1_d773grk,Trust me a LOT of people is still elitist Yesterday evening I was supposed to demo a social VR experience. People didnt need a Vive or the top of the line hardware ... only a working recent smartphone with an internet connection. Well of course it worked for some but I got in random order  no phone phone but empty battery phone but no Internet connection phone but too oldso... yes being actually catering for the masses for high tech products is really hard.,learnVRdev,d773nyx,1,t5_3elf8
