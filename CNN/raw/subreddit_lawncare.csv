3833845,0,t1_cqsw7zs,Fall is the time to plant  not summer.Summer heat like in Georgia stresses lawns.Grass needs deep roots to survive.If you plant in summer you will probably be throwing your money away.  Especially if you are a novice.Do what the other commenter suggested kill everything there.You will want to wait about  days after application of RoundUp before planting anyway.So RoundUp the yard.  Do it now and do it again a month later.   That combined with the summer heat should kill just about everything. In late summer ask your utility companies to mark where your utility lines are in the yard.  In my state of Va we have a state department that takes these requests from homeowners and then distributes them to then companies for you.  I dont know about Georgia. Once you know where the utility lines are go ahead and rent or buy a gas powered rotor till. Till the entire yard  inches deep. Buy some starter fertilizer and apply it according to the directions based on your future lawns square footage.. Mix the fertilizer into your tilled soil... Buy grass seed and broadcast spreader spread accordingly to directions for your future lawns square footage... Get a seed mat and lay it on the slope to prevent water from washing the grass seed down... Cover seed on flat areas according to directions usually about th inch under soil.. Water twice a day for  minutes or so until the seeds have germinated.  Gotta keep it moist.  Ive usually had success using premium seed after about  days for turf type tall fescue.  Other grass types might take more time like bluegrass... Once the grass has germinated reduce the watering to once per day for do it for about  minutes instead of .  This will encourage the roots to start digging deeper for water...  After a week of  minutes once per day reduce the frequency of watering to once every  days... Once the grass is about  inches tall cut it to be  inches if you are using a cool season turf.  Cut across the slopes never up and down.  ..  Maintain watering twice per week for about  minutes each for another month... About  weeks after you planted go ahead and apply a Wintergard fertilizer.  This will feed the lawn and help it dig deep roots during the winter months... In early spring apply a Fertilizer with Weed Preventer... In late spring apply a Weed and Feed Fertilizer... In midSummer apply a Summertard fertilizer with Insect control.  Grubs will eat your lawns roots.. In early fall apply a general fertilizer and law some more seed down overseed.  ..  In late fall apply a Wintergard fertilizer.Repeat steps  every year and you cant go wrong!,lawncare,cqtaigl,2,t5_2rzrk

4310895,0,t1_csbgrph,First of all  is fine.  New grass has little roots and littleno stored energy. Having a lot of phosphorus is awesome for that phosphorus is the second . Keep using that stuff if you have any left. Secondly the lawn looks awesome!   Lots of stolons mean that the lawn is happy and spreading.  Stolons are the runners.  Third dont be too afraid to hurt the grass by mowing to low. Rule of thumb is take no more that a third off at one time. So if the grass is three inches tall dont go lower than two inches in one mowing.  Bermuda is very tough to kill. Also the lower you now it the more dense it will get. Finally the second picture has some sort of grass weed in it. Pick those out. I cant tell what it is possibly crabgrass signal grass or something of the sort. Either way pick them out.

I just have one hedge  thats maybe  feet long that needs trimmed once a year  so Im thinking the PAS  would be overkill? I see the PAS  also has an edger with a blade  but wont the string trimmer do the same if I turn it  degrees? The PAS string trimmer with straight shift is  its  with a curved shaft..

10676624,0,t1_ddh5uv8,The universities have guides with real info so I would follow what ever they say. If any comments on here disagree with what the universities say you would be wise to go with the informed guidance of the experts. The home stores and nurseries may not even have any sod yet I am not sure. Even if they do have sod though by looking out at St. Augustine lawns right now they are still dormant. The dead and tan pieces from last year seems to be far more dominant than shades of new green right now. Even if the weather today and tomorrow will be unseasonably warm it will still take the grass a while to wake up. Sod is unprotected and vulnerable so it needs pretty much ideal growing conditions I would wait a bit. I doubt it will take very long now though spring is coming fast. I honestly dont know what or how to fertilize new sod. There are many guides out there though. Personally I do not use much fertilizer or weed control products. I do  times a year at most but mowing high not bagging grass clippings and manually removing weeds works great for me. I was thinking about your pictures over the past few minutes and it is possible that you have a fungus or brown patch in the front. It might not be a bad idea to hit the grass with a fungicide in a bit. I like to do it right before a rain so that the treatment will soak into the grass. If you do put down sod then you will be watering a ton as new grass needs to get established. All that water it will make your lawn more susceptible to fungus. Being on top of it from the get go would be a good idea I would think. One thing that I have become a big believer in is to mow your lawn especially St. Augustine frequently and very tall. The grass that we see on the surface is the engine to make energy for the plant. The taller the leaves are the deeper the roots can go. The deeper the roots the less watering and fertilizing the grass needs. For your lawn this is especially important because there is a dense shade over much of the St. Augustine SA in the front. I suspect it will be shady in the back when that Cedar Elm regains its leaves as well. And the reduction of sunlight means that the grass is receiving even less energy per length of the grass blade. I recommend cutting SA grass at least three inches tall and under deep shade even taller. Four inches tall may seem crazy but I would try it as this is some very dense shade and the grass is obviously under stress as it is. To measure how high your mower cuts put it on concrete and measure with a ruler from the ground to the cutting blade. Just remember that you should still be cutting frequently. Remember to buy ethanol free gas for your mower to prevent headaches and talk to your neighbors. They seem to have the same grass that you do so they may have some relevant knowledge. Send us some before and after pictures I bet it will come around wonderfully. ,lawncare,ddh7oq5,2,t5_2rzrk
