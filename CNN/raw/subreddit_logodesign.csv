1178177,0,t3_27m11i,Probably because Im Canadian and because my brother carried the torch so we had a lot of swag in the house I immediately thought of this I agree with jellevdv that the letters seem out of place especially because theyre a different font than whats written underneath. I dont mind the idea of the purple circle but I dont like the haze it has around it. I think because the rest of the logo is flat that seems out of place. I would also shrink it a little where it seems to touch the other colours gives it a weird look imo. That said I like the concept. I get it but its not in your face obvious.

Especially the whole left part of the logo ac oval shape thing looks really cramped and it isnt pleasing to the eye.. The oval shaped ac thing the a and the c are way too big for the shape and not centered. . Kerning looks off the oval ac thing is way too close to aua and onnect. Nitpicking but the nn is too close together too. How I read it overexaggeratedly     aa ua    co nn e ct. Dont really like the fontspacing personal opinion but Id like it better if the aua and the first  letters of onnect would align properly. . If Id see this logo I wouldnt think about a social network to be honest its not even really a logo but two words with a little bit of stylizing.

4338912,0,t1_csep5v6,Im going to be completely honest here I do not see any of your description represented in your logo.You need to think how your logomark is representing your business. You need it to say gtBracelets and necklaces clutch purses leather and metal simple statement pieces. Your logo needs to represent you to your customer basegt people like me and for people who like to layer their stuff.What do I see in your logo? A jewellery store that sells costume jewellery that looks nice but maybe isnt super expensive. Id say your target group is teens to midtwenties females. There appears to be a product line that is focussed on precious stonesglamourstones that appear to be big and for an outfit to dazzle.There is nothing in this logo that even hints at leather and metal to me.With these things in mind I think youre taking the wrong direction with this mark. My humble advice is that you take a step back and have a good think about how you can really represent your branding more appropriately.I hope this helps ,logodesign,cseq46c,2,t5_2s4v6

4486581,0,t3_3cioy5,Kudos to you for learning graphic design. First piece of advice dont give up. Youll have many moments where you will convince yourself that you dont have the skills or the creativity. Then one day youll do something that you really like and it will reenergize you. Fight through your own selfcritical thinking and keep at it!Second piece of advice strategy comes before design. Good design is pretty. Great design is pretty AND smart. Logos are a companys identity the physical manifestation of their brand values. So before you do any design work you need to have a solid idea of what that logo is supposed to communicate. As people pointed out here the blown out umbrella looks cool but what do you think the message consumers are getting is? Chaos unexpected events malfunction etc.Final piece of advice Simple Wins. Dont overcomplicate with textures and unnecessary elements. Keep it simple. Google logo evolution and look at how many brands have spent years and years simplifying their logos through iterative refinement. That doesnt mean you cant inject creativity into your design or do something cool. It means you need to be able to edit your work and really ask yourself is this adding anything?Specific to this logo I would kill the textures on the lettering. It wont render in small sizes anyways and frankly why is it there in the first place? Then you need to focus on the practical  is this logo always going to be on black? How does it look on white? Is there too much verticality? Start thinking about it in context  how does it appear on a website a business card a print ad etc.Oh and def fix the kerning!  ,logodesign,csw735f,1,t5_2s4v6

5021910,0,t3_3jocxu,Hi I like the logo a lot. It looks like a smile but also its thematic to restaurant.I think people have issues with the gray ladle not because its gray but because theres not enough contrast between the white accent and the gray and it lowers the contrast between the orange innards of the circle and the gray ladle.Its an issue of contrast IMO so if you play with colors a bit it might look better defined.As for the t I did assume its the font but sometimes when you use a font in a wordmark one or two letters stand out slightly weird because we focus on them so much. It probably can be softened a bit so it looks less well special compared to the other letters.This is speculative but maybe try reversing the direction of the ladle so the handle is on left. It looks as if the wordmark and the ladle stand in opposition a bit like this but maybe thats just in my head.,logodesign,curbyfr,1,t5_2s4v6

6009900,0,t1_cy7f0ki,When it comes to Logos avoiding Trends is probably the most important thing you could do. Logos are meant to last forever and by following a Trend with your Logo Design you are basically slapping an expiration date on it. Trends become Clichs and Clichs are bad. I mean just look at the Hipster Logo trend that came and went sure it might have been Unique at some point but it became Trendy then Clich then we moved on and companies and organizations left over that still use the Hipster Logo style just look like a sad joke. A company that paid for someone to design them a Hipster Style logo  years ago are probably back on the market looking for someone do Design them a new Logo today. Actually you raise a good point. Logo Design work is hard to come by nowadays if we can convince companies to accept Temporary Trendy Clich Logos then we could easily double our clientbases in two years time more  for us at the expense of forsaking good design work that is. ,logodesign,cy7fg0x,4,t5_2s4v6

6276068,0,t1_cz2lw1u,Heres the thing In part we have to accept that we live in a world where logos where color is the key player is ... in some ways more acceptable.But the problem that will always be true is that if you are designing around color you arent actually designing at the core. I made a comment earlier about this too. It says Black and white allow you to create a powerful and effective logo in its composition. To a small extent it can be about not being hindered by color not letting color influence your design. But to the larger extent it is about the primary principles you use when creating a logo. Figureground continuity closure... Most of the principles can be applied to a logo fairly well. But those three tend to stand out to me.

7034268,0,t3_4byyb0,Hi there. First things first the third word is spelled wrong. The website overall is fine it is pretty even but I dont see a through line. What are you trying to do with the site? Is it a portfolio site? Is it a business site? I think you need to clarify what the purpose is and then focus all your elements to that end. I would suggest you edit and rewrite most of the copy. Maybe ask a friend who is a decent writer help edit and punch it up a bit. Some examples You dont need to tell people to click buttons. I have been learning about graphic design since  and since then I have been learning as much as I can about the field. This sentence is kind of a mess. You have the word since twice in a row and you really are not saying anything specific. If you are self taught say that tell me how you learn be specific but not rambling. You dont need explain you have a wide variety of projects that will or wont be evident when I see your work. On the right you can see all the different versions that I created and ended up with the one on the left. This can be punched up quite a bit. Ended up with sounds like an accident and different versions should be something like process or iterations.Does that make sense? Do you see where I am headed? Its always hard to write your own stuff.Using rlogo design is speaking to a very specific audience. I would consider rewriting those heads and maybe leave out the word contest while your at it. It may give someone the wrong impression.I question including multiple iterations of your personal logo.Hope that helps a little. Best of luck.,logodesign,d1dou81,3,t5_2s4v6

I assure you that it will work out fine. The only people that will be scared off are the cheap timedraining asshole clients. Many will respect you more if you have a higher price because you respect yourself. Also you will never charge based on the time it takes you but the end product and the value to them. Theoretically as you get better you will get faster. Does that mean you charge less just because it took you less time. When I first started I did any and every project regardless of price we all do. As I raised my rates the quality of the clients increased as well as the prices. I have a quarter of the annual projects than when I first started but make X as much. Having less clients does not mean less money. I havent seen your work but I dont touch logo projects under  and I am an average logo designer. Most are  plus.

9160211,0,t1_d8cj8ad,Ahh I couldnt see that before. Try it without the background mountains. Its a good idea but in this case I think its trying to do too much.Also theres a white stroke between the fin of the helmet and the back part of it maybe  take that out?  I whipped this up in Photoshop to show what I mean. Also be careful of your stroke widths  in some areas they get really small when overall youve got very thick strokes to keep that team sport logo feel. And one last thing  some of the strokes towards the bottom are kind of curvy and overall the logo has a very jaggedangular feel to it so I might try to make those match aesthetically. I think its a very cool logo! Just a little cleaning up to bring it home.,logodesign,d8d4hao,3,t5_2s4v6
9173807,0,t1_d8d4hao,Thanks for the feedback Irsic  I totally see what you mean and i certainly agree looking at it again My cousin has already signed off on it but Ill definitely keep  your comments in mind for future designs If it helps initially I designed  logo ideas for my cousin one with the helmet and one with a mountain he suggested etching the helmet into the mountain cos he liked both and instead I decided to play with making it a part of the mountain thatll be why theres some leftover elements such as the finer strokes within the helmet but I think youre right making that a lot thicker would help it sit within the mountain image betterdefinitely food for thought!  Thanks!,logodesign,d8euj2u,1,t5_2s4v6
9184457,0,t1_d8g67ka,A freelance designer agencies are expensive Ill agree on that will tailor your offer to your specific needs. Do you know why logos are expensive? Its not because the designer will agree to use Illustrator instead of Paint if you pay him a thousand more. Rather an increase in price means an increase in quality. Time will be spent on your logo it will be revised to the finest detail possibly worked on by a few designers to catch any flaws. Every possibility will be thought of and adjusted for.But if you dont have the budget for that  and I know how expensive it can be to open a business  you only have to find a freelance designer and ask for the cheapest logo option they offer. Youll probably save money too. A good designer will take time to communicate with you and learn exactly what you want before making your logo. Even if you only get one prototype it will be exactly what you wanted. And if your relationship with the freelancer was not to your liking find someone else for your next project although I wonder who those people are that need a new logo every month.On designs you fill out a generic brief and hope for the best. They guarantee a certain amount of entries depending on how much you paid but youll find many of them are blatant copies. The goal of those designers many of them dont even have training in design they just like to make pretty illustrations is to enter as many logos as possible in as many contests as possible thus they steal ideas from each other resubmit designs they made in the past... and at that point theyre not an artisan theyve become a factory.,logodesign,d8g742l,6,t5_2s4v6

The shorter diagonal on the other vertical made it harder to see as two letters rather than an abstract shape and the horizontal alignment reads to me as SV because the crossbar on the J only extends to the right.Its simple and geometric I like the shape and weight proportion.
