Since the updated car and engine it is less of an F competitor and more of a stopgap between F and F.Unlike FR. it therefore doesnt compete directly with either series but I foresee the FIA trying to monopolise and get the series shutdown as it would interfere with their proposed career progression.Its fate will depend on whether GP becomes F.

6063756,0,t1_cyefwfm,It depends on where you draw the line on open and I wouldnt call F or F open at all. F is open in a different way  manufacturers and teams are the same entity. F isnt open on a series level and only identical cars actually race eachother. Fs engine regulations are really tight and theyre all very similar performance  and the chassis are all identical at least in the only series that really matters.F is open because its the pinnacle its where the FIA wants teams to splash their cash. F is meant to be a support to F both in terms of the event and driver flow. If you mean open like F then I that would make sense as it gives some incentive to manufacturers and even fans to pay a bit more attention to F.It wouldnt work if it was open like F. To start with all the current GP teams would move elsewhere because the costs would be astronomical for them and itll die really quickly.

9385100,0,t1_d95l3pj,The same bunch claim Pascal was entirely dominant last year because someone told them he was. What I dont understand is how people expect him to outperform WEH from day one debuting mid season in a car that wasnt designed for him and with very few miles done before debut. WEHs comments comparing Ocon to Haryanto as if they were equal didnt help. I thought it was rather ignorant of Pascal to say something like that. ,F1FeederSeries,d95mlah,4,t5_316st

9549973,0,t1_d9pf7j4,Cipriani has always raced in the fastest possible single seater series which allowed a driver to just flat out buy a car and race it. But he is selfaware enough not to buy himself an IndyCar ride unlike one of his former rivals. He is a lot better than the BOSS GP drivers you can go there and enter with a plethora of different open wheel cars including exF ones so thats out of the question for him despite owning cars eligible for the series.Until  that fastest series was Formula Palmer Audi he had  seasons in it from  until last year that was AutoGP in which he has decent results for a gentleman driver even sneaking in a podium when half the field retired in . There was another much younger gentleman driver Michele La Rosa with whom he had some good fights near the back.With Renault dropping the funding for the . series and effectively stopping the teams get selected and then they have a place in the series thing Cipriani could just buy one of the old cars and go racing for the hell of it.He could have a decent career in GT cars but he wants to race in the fastest possible championship. Which given that he is a fully amateur driver is about as close as you get to the drivers of the early years of motor racing.,F1FeederSeries,d9q8c9j,4,t5_316st
