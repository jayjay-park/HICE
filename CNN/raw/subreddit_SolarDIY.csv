8463533,0,t1_d5zdldh,I searched all over and only found a handful of companies in south africa and there wasnt any info on availability in the usa.,SolarDIY,d5zh7yd,1,t5_2yh9y
8470899,0,t1_d60ebrc,It is legal to sell not to use.  If you do not know the difference between a space heater with consumption and an inverter with generation then you have no place doing an install.,SolarDIY,d60ei3q,1,t5_2yh9y
9594771,0,t1_d9uagn3,To add to my previous reply. On wholesale solar some of those panels are listed at v. Are those for a v system?,SolarDIY,d9vr2l8,1,t5_2yh9y
10618291,0,t1_ddb6vcv,What panel string voltage are you planning?The Midnite Classic  will max out at A output and supports up to a V nominal battery with the higher voltage units having progressively less output current.,SolarDIY,ddb72ys,1,t5_2yh9y
10819523,0,t3_5uk1ll,... no.  You dont charge the different batteries separately unless you hate your batteries and love replacing them.You should be running all the charge controllers in parallel charging the combined V bank.,SolarDIY,ddvyhay,1,t5_2yh9y
10820742,0,t3_5ujj3a,I am sorry but w on a pen charge controller is pretty inefficient.  You would be better off with  w on an MPPT charge controller.   You also need fuses batteries and an inverter.  ,SolarDIY,ddw30ak,1,t5_2yh9y
10887869,0,t1_de2tcmz,Oke youve got the battery part all figured out it seems.    gtso I really just need enough panel to charge the Ah in d or so.    IF you are using wet leadacid do keep in mind you want to completely charge them frequently to make the liquid bubble a bit to prevent stratification      Especially in the beginning do keep an eye on that with a voltmeter and specific gravity meter until you know exactly what the solar charge controller is doing.    To charge that VxAh. kWh in  days you need .kWhday x  days   kWhmonth  with a few clouds or  if your shadows are a bit bad PVWatts says ReddingArcata airport gets  kWhkWp in December x WpV panels in parallel with a cheap A solar charge controller should do the job.         Those V panels do cost .Wp WV costs only .Wp two of those give more energy even if you dont use an Mpptcontroller because efficiency.    If that temporary setup remains on a trailer for the next  years fine if you want to integrate them onto your cabin roof maybe you should start from there how many panels fit nicely together and from that calculate back to a larger battery size that those can support maybe continuing on a daily while living there basis.     You dont have to attach all your appliances to it having two separate PVbattery systems does give you an option for critical only loads like fridgeradioLEDsphonecharger when one of them has a problem.      You do need to plan those other panels on your roof as well with chimneys and other shadow producers on the North side only obviously.     gtand there is some tree cover      If allowed choptrim them right away shadows are a disaster for PV and if a freak storm passes by you dont want them reaching your cabin if they topple over.     It is not a must that panels point South if you connect them in parallel with long mm wires you can point them individually EastWest or SESW whatever so they collect the most photons.    The panels themselves are cheapish and people like some luxury I would build the roof EastWest myself with panels in parallel to maximize the available PV area and maybe have room for some solar hot water       Edit     Ah seems the biggest thats available Amazon Wallmart you can connect two of them in parallel if you follow method or       ,SolarDIY,de308b3,1,t5_2yh9y
10957953,0,t1_dea3yp2,Then your decision. A is fine for one panel A is good for up to  panels.,SolarDIY,dea8gro,2,t5_2yh9y
11245386,0,t1_df6jrjs,Yeah I saw that voltage cap after I linked it then I looked up and found that second one I mentioned that goes up to V I believe it makes more sense to go with that one the more I think about it it can control current too I believe.  Well my plan for the power is to have it run my TV once Im home from work I live in an apartment so really having it wired that way wouldnt be much of a problem since Id have lights it would just be a bit annoying to have to rewire it twice every day. The two panels into V charge controller will work or the one panel into DCDC converter to up the amperage will work. As for mounting that is still being worked on. As I live in an apartment my initial idea was to put a panel or two against my back glass doors that get sunlight for a few hours a day and see how much I could generate Ill probably start with this as a test. Ideally Id put them outside but I fear someone might walk away with them and theres no easy way I can think of to mount them securely without marking up the building. Also Im not really comfortable with the idea of setting them up and letting them run dozens of hours a week without anyone around to monitor them until I really know what Im doing.  So to solve the theft issue and sunlight issue and monitoring issue I think a more creative way of doing this is to design a roof mount for the panel for my car and have the charging system be able to be put into my car. Now even though the panel will be flat on my roof or perhaps tilted a bit if I can design a sturdyenough adjustable system it will still get more direct light during sunlight hours than if it were to be on my back porch or behind my glass doors. I dont have to worry about someone walking off with it while Im at work it would also be secured in such a way youll need a key or keys to get it off the roof without cutting it off. This would also allow me to monitor the charging when Im on breaks at work. Only issue I foresee is gassing to which Ill look into seeing if cracking the windows and adding a window ventilator with some  duct to the battery area maybe put them in a box would solve that. A bit ambitious but again this is all just a big experiment. ,SolarDIY,df6nbu2,1,t5_2yh9y
11287724,0,t1_dfb9n60,BatteryUniversity is very helpful and they were one of my sources saying that they shouldnt gas unless as you mentioned it is overcharged but some other sources and forums thought otherwise. I still plan on having a window cracked just to be safe but will forego the window fan.  MPPT is a great concept but yeah unless I can find a used one at a good price I think Ill just stick to a DCDC converter feeding a PWM for this experiment.,SolarDIY,dfbg408,1,t5_2yh9y
11469568,0,t1_dfw1xrb,No as mentioned in my other comment you cant run pretty much anything without either batteries or grid tie. Electric resistance heat and certain well pumps that were specifically designed for it and similar loads that can infinitely vary their required load to match the production in real time are the only things that can be connected directly to panels.,SolarDIY,dfw2isx,1,t5_2yh9y
