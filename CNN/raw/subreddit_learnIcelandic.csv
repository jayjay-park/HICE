1667666,0,t1_cjedilk,Im no expert in any of those languages English or Icelandic but speaking a language even quite good is not the same as speaking it fluently. Like sometimes they need a specific terminology that you wont know unless you are REALLY fluent. I dont think anyone would take just a good English speaker instead of a native one for things like I dont know translating something for embassy court ect. What I ment to say is there will always be a job for a fluent English speaker even in countries like Iceland or Netherlands where most of the people speak it very well because its not enough for some translations. Not saying its gonna be easy though it would probably take you years and years just to learn Icelandic enough to work in translation so I dont know if its worth it up to you. ,learnIcelandic,cjpddcv,1,t5_2wndm
2228345,0,t1_clmzxx1,I mentioned that English Dutch amp German are all germanic languages amp I never said knowing English would help you learn Icelandic because I know it wont. German like others have said all though not brilliant German amp Icelandic because being part of the same family  have similar sentence structures as well as large amounts of cognates in common.Sorry I didnt make that clear the first time,learnIcelandic,cln2qjf,1,t5_2wndm
2358733,0,t1_clzzjco,Ok thank you Ill definitely look into those. If I were to buy an Icelandic translation of an English novel say Harry Potter for instance would it be better to read it completely in Icelandic on its own or use the English version alongside it?

4106943,0,t3_37jqv9,Alright people I took some initiative and searched harder for something. The upvotes here indicate that at least a few people would also like some beginner reading materials. Heres what Ive found so far. Icelandic online has a list of readings including IcelandicEnglish bilingual texts. This book Sagnasyrpa is apparently a series of intermediate readings.  Not quite what I want but the online textbook slenska fyrir alla seems a bit more readingfocused than what Im currently using.If anyone knows of something else I would still love to hear about it.edit Im adding more things as I find them.  This old textbook has some myths in Icelandic. I cant comment as to their difficulty or relevance to modern Icelandic. Not exactly for beginners but it looks ... relatively understandable. Litli mlfringurinn Seems to be a linguisticsgrammar text? Cool if youre into linguistics like I am.,learnIcelandic,crof0cq,2,t5_2wndm

5934367,0,t1_cxfxwh7,In French I think this is usually to avoid two same sounds in a row. The same happens with mon amie instead of ma amie if I remember my old french classes.In Icelandic its not about how it sounds. Im not good enough with grammar to explain this but read the other replies for that. It would change the meaning to use essi see what rafeind said. etta is intruductory it points to anything regardless if its singluarplural and its gender. ,learnIcelandic,cxxiyaa,2,t5_2wndm
