Well literally we all except of you indeed.If ppl like Pier Tezza Greyl and other dedicated Players tell their Opinion its atleast worth something since they are passionated long time players with hundreds or possibly even over thousand hours in this Game! While you actually just play this game barely or maybe you dont play it at all would not surprise anyoneEverytime you write something its just mindless stuff while others talk about facts and what they actually dont like about this Game.If you really want to tryhard as Whiteknight then please bring atleast some valid arguments like your Opposition does pretty much now. If you cant then dont think anyone believes your bullshit!
