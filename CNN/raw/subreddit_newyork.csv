It may not be the most vegetarian but the view over Central Park is incredibly romantic.Also very good is Artisanal Fromagerie and Bistro. Its has less but nice atmosphere and the food is good.Edit Also vegetarian friendly is Kashkaval. Everyone Ive taken there has loved it. Also The Cornelia Street Cafe for that bohemian Greenwich Village vibe. Food is good and there is often good jazz world music and the like in the basement.,newyork,cgq3g0j,2,t5_2qh3t

2239930,0,t1_clodt48,gt  lets just assume that these guys who are basically saying Hey baby oooh God damn!!! are just trying to say a friendly helloIm not sure what youre talking about. In every one of my comments I agreed that a hello means more than hello and in my last comment I agreed with your points. Did you just get so spun up on trying to attack someone that you forgot Im agreeing with you?gt if a group of male models were saying hey hey baby sweet ass she probably wouldnt swoonI didnt say anything about hey hey baby sweet ass. I said hello. I very specifically addressed your statement regarding the guys who said god bless and hello. I then very specifically pointed out how all the other things said and done by the guys in the video are in fact harassment.To reiterate my points saying god bless hello or even smile even with romantic intent is not wrong or harassment. Saying hey baby nice ass is harassment. Understand my point now?So please stop acting like a stupid troll looking for an argument. This is why people cant discuss these kinds of issues.,newyork,clojrbt,-1,t5_2qh3t
