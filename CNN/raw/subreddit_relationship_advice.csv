I get to the point where shes my best friend or something like that and I keep asking her indirectly and in different ways about being her boyfriend so she knows that I like her in that way and its just like Our Relationship so I keep going for it. I read a selfhelp book and because I feel entitled as well as the selfhelp book I tell her straight up Im attracted to her. We skyped every day and iMessaged everything up to that point. She told me to go fuck myself. I didnt respond for a couple days. I say sorry on Facebook and then hi on Skype and she blocks me. I keep going. I keep thinking that this isnt a friendship I want to lose or that this isnt really going where I think its going whichever at different times. And I WhatsApp her and I iMessage her and I email her because my emotions are taking over. She sent me an email after which I stopped after apologizing for one last time that I took what we had for granted. Heres the emailgtstay away from me.gtim not kidding.gti do not want to see you hear from you talk to you i do not want to have anything to do with you. i cannot make myself any clearer. gtrefrain from making any further attempts to get in contact with me. i have no interest in interacting with you. gtstay away from me. forever.I was devastated. Dont take what you have for granted. Make sure what you see as exceptions are realistic. And more than anything else and I know Im repeating this but just dont take what you have for granted. She had a boyfriend. She really really likes her boyfriend. Probably loves him. I was just jealous and I wasnt thankful that I had such a good friend. Just because you think about her in that way doesnt mean she thinks about you like that. Think about someone you just arent interested in romantically but you still want to be friends with them because you like talking to them. Really think of someone. Thats how she feels about you. Remember that. And dont take her for granted. If you have any questions please ask. Id love to help you out.I know that were so young but this feels so real I know.

45966,0,t3_1um3lu,You have to decide whether this is a dealbreaker for you. For me it would be because you already gave her other chances and she has been lying and hiding stuff from you again and again and again. If it isnt for you then you need to take full control of the shared accounts and have access to all her personal accounts. She also needs to make real changes about her relationship with money and her shopping addiction which might require seeing a professional. She needs to regain your trust and the issue needs to be solved before marriage can be on the table again. If you do get married to her before it is  which would be a terrible idea  you need to see a lawyer or get legal advice on how to protect yourself.,relationship_advice,cejnwxs,5,t5_2r0cn

58486,0,t3_1urxah,I honestly think you should forget about whether you meet your husbands essentially unobtainable ridiculous standards and worry about seeing a professional regarding your poor body image and disordered eating.  calories a day is not a healthy intake for an adult woman. Obsessing about whether you meet someone elses standards is also not healthy thinking. Sure hes your husband but if he thinks your body isnt going to change as you get older and closer to your s then hes a damn fool. Does HE look exactly the same as he did  years ago?Why dont you have another chat with your husband and see if HE cares whether you meet his standards. If hes that superficial that he puts that much stock into your looks to the point that its affecting your mental health then I dont know what to tell you other than I think hes a dink but thats just my opinion  Any man who thinks a woman will always look the same as the day he met her needs a reality check. We get older sometimes we put on weight sometimes our looks fade and we dont always look like the hot young thing he married. It happens to everyone including your husband.I should add there is nothing wrong with wanting to look good for your husband but you should do it because it makes you feel good...not because youre trying to turn yourself into his fantasy girl.

By consequences I just meant any changes that only went into effect because of her actions such as being able to check her phone on a whim. My point is that treating her boyfriend right obviously isnt something shes very motivated to do.

It was the fault of a type of birth control pill she was on but we didnt figure that out until later. At the time it was incredibly difficult to get along with her for any period of time.The sex in between our breakup made me realize that I needed to increase my level in tolerance in what I found upsetting when it came to my girlfriend because I didnt want to be without her. If the sex I had had been great and I didnt miss my girlfriend it would be a different story.Im just here venting because Im upset that I hurt her in something I dont really see as extremely dire.

94387,0,t3_1v6hwx,Hes not perfect. No one is. Neither are you. Youre  and you have no idea what you want. You didnt even tell me enough about yourself for me to give you proper advice. What is your life like? How is your family life? What about school? Work? Are you suffering from depression or are you just using the term loosely? What do you think causes your anxiety?Normal doesnt exist. Normal for me  years ago is not normal for me today. Normal for me is consistent aches and pains contentedness with lounging around and looking for work in education. Normal for me is eating McDonalds. Normal for me is not even remembering what a relationship was like.Even with that bleak outlook Im more or less happy. I love my family and I have a whole bunch of positives in my life. What about you? What makes you happy and unhappy? Is your boyfriend some guy who you fell in love with but are now floating back to real life realizing that he isnt the solution to lifes problems? Or is he that magnificent ideal that you look up to? Or is he just a normal guy with normal problems and normal positives.When it comes down to it relationships are just another facet of life. Your boyfriend is some guy you like to hang out with right? You enjoy his company and you love him. You find yourself wanting to spend time with him. He makes you feel good. Is that true? Are there issues with the relationship? Are you just unhappy with status quo? People at your age tend to question everything. They tend to think about what could be or what could have been as if they are looking back upon a vast life of failing to reach expectations. The question you have to ask yourself in the end is Who am I?Talk to your boyfriend about your issues. Sometimes just talking about the way you feel that you are unhappy with your situation or that you want him to maybe do something to set fire to a dim light. Just be yourself.,relationship_advice,cep6cky,1,t5_2r0cn

98214,0,t1_cepl1zs,In OPs case it seems like he didnt tell his ex GF because he didnt want to face up to the consequences of his actions. His lying by omission came from selfishness ie I was going to break up with her anyway why rock the boat.. His GF didnt get a true picture of his actions and hearing the truth  years later rather than at the time likely caused her even more pain. She may be wondering why she put in all this extra time into a relationship with a guy who cheats and feels most comfortable being dishonest than owning up to his mistakes. Now  years later OP is dealing with exactly what he wanted to avoid. Since he seems to avoid most unpleasant situations his cheating and lying seem to fit best into his selfish personality rather than care for his ex GFs feelings.Sleeping with another person even once has the possibility to lead to STDs. His girlfriend should have the right to know if she is being exposed. In my book being honest and owning up to ones actions is much better than sweeping it under the rug. ,relationship_advice,cepm0t2,2,t5_2r0cn

You are now learning another lesson That men are not as responsible for their actions as women are sad but true.  He is obviously trying to stick it out because he knows its the right thing to do and the only choice you left him. but his heart does not want you you were just a passing fancy to him and hes likely feeling trapped and looking for a woman with less complications.  Im not saying hes a good guy sounds like an irresponsible prick but thats his problem.  You will have to figure something out.  I would not toss him away your options are limited by your child and youll need his money to raise the baby.

144661,0,t3_1votjb,This is exactly how my ex boyfriend surprised me with his first outburst of domestic violence after almost  years together. He momentarily choked me during a fight. I was shocked but forgave him.  months later we had another argument. That time he bit my finger and choked me until blood vessels in my face broke. The neighbors called  but he took off and left the state before they could catch him. The state wanted me to press the charges  the detective assigned to the case practically begged me saying this was a very dangerous situation.  I was stupid and felt guilty so I didnt. He came back. Months later the third and final assault escalated to him not only choking me but imprisoning me in our apartment and breaking my cellphone while he threatened to kill me. I escaped and ran outside barefoot in February its the Midwest where he followed me and bashed my head into the pavement. He went to jail after a trial where I had to sit in a room full of strangers and recount the most horrifying moments of my life hoping they believed me. Im not saying your boyfriend will do these things to you. But I can say without a doubt that I didnt see any of those things happening to me at the hands of him.

However you are saying that if you werent both so invested then you wouldnt be in this relationship which worries me. Investment of time money etc is not a reason to stay in a relationship. If you love each other and can work together to make this a positive relationship then things will be fine. But it wont work unless you are on the same team working towards the same goal. ,relationship_advice,cewyduj,2,t5_2r0cn

193804,0,t1_cf0bqld,gt Really I inserted myself? She didnt have a say in this? Even your language is biased to marginalize her responsibility.I like how you chose one quote to take out of context and then tried to manipulate it to make it seem like Im letting the girl off for what she did. Is that how logic works?gt You can argue all you want that providing friendship compassion and tenderness is somehow a breach of the boyfriends rights but the fact of the matter is that I was building a relationship with her not him. Like I said before her relationship is her business. If I had swooped in and emotionally manipulated some naive girl into having sex with me so that she felt guilt ridden and used that to get her to break up that would be one thing then I might be an asshole because my intent would have been selfish with no care for her well being. But what I did was offer a connection and companionship that her boyfriend wasnt giving her and when she realized that she would rather be with me she left.This entire paragraph is moot because thats not what I was saying and thats not all you said you were doing. Nuzzling faces and progressing the relationship which is pretty hard to progress past cuddling if youre only providing friendship compassion and tenderness. I call bullshit.gt You can keep telling me all you want that society doesnt approve of my actions but you have three things going against you.Youve already got strawmen going against you lets see what you think I have going against me.gt First your arguing that building a social connection with a girl is a betrayal of her boyfriend disempowers women and also imposes a standard that women in relationships should be isolated and not allowed to have close friends of the opposite sex.Wrong. I am asserting that you sought out a relationship similar to a psuedoboyfriend which is much different from being just a close friend of the opposite sex. You can keep trying to make this about me disempowering women but youre going up against a guy who had three sisters. Trust me I respect them and their relationships plenty.gt Second you have no idea what the relationship was actually like... Comemichiamo is probably convinced that I just showed up and started fucking her based on the way he has been responding but maybe we never even kissed while she was with him... I havent bothered to clear up that kind of misconception because it really doesnt matter because she was responsible for herself and me for myself. I dont have a moral obligation to someone I have never met that somehow limits who I can be friendly with.Youve definitely insinuated you did more than cuddle. If thats false then it is what it is but your own words certainly seem to stand against you. And why are you bringing the OP into this? He hasnt said anything about you its mandano.gt Lastly and perhaps most importantly a relationship and the rules of that relationship are created by the people involved in the relationship. There are some relationships with three people some that are open some that are very exclusive some where kissing in public is great and others where no public displays of affection are allowed. There isnt a single recipe for a relationship and in this case I was developing a relationship with her and she with me and the rules of it were up to us to write. And personally I thought her timing for breaking up with her boyfriend was just about perfect given the way things developed between us.Well yeah if youre just going to buck societal convention and say who the fuck cares every relationship is whatever the people involved make of it nobody else should have any say in any way a relationship progresses then fine. But then why the FUCK are you in a relationship advice sub if thats what you believe? The entire point of this sub is to get advice about societal norms and conventions for relationships and how to progress them well. You clearly dont subscribe to or believe in this.gt So you can tell me all you want that your rules for my life are right but frankly I dont give a damn. You dont have to approve if I smoke or drink or get a tattoo or if I have a relationship.Again if thats the way you feel gtfo out of a place that is trying to give you guidelines for how to relationship properly. Youre just trolling at this point.gt And frankly since I never gave you any details about the relationship other than we started as friends and grew closer until she broke up with her boyfriend and started dating me I am inclined to see any criticism as ignorant narcissistic and judgmental of others for the sake of feeling good about yourself.Are you judging my social and moral means of making me feel good about myself? Are you trying to impose your own social and moral values upon me? Gosh I wonder what you had to say about that earlier.gt By limiting my choices based on what I thought her obligations should be I would have been imposing my own social or moral values on her. Forcing someone else to live by your own personal values is controlling. Not only that it is insulting because it shows that you think that your values are more important than theirs.Well ok then.

194502,0,t3_1wbbjv,He seems to be at a crossroads but unable to catch a break. His GF doesnt seem to be the best for him hes had an unfortunate deal via work and now his dad kicked him out. Did he deserve the kicking out? whos kid doesnt?....but hes needs you more than ever. He needs a break. He passed the bar but hes looking to switch it up and apply to JAG. Him being  seems hes mature enough to feel out some career prospects and you may be right about how much higher he could go but you should let him make his own I wouldnt say mistake experience. It sounds like he has the emotional maturity while reading about the GF but he needs to figure that out on his own. The best thing to happen to him is the worth thing in regards to relationships. He needs to experience the shitty GF so he knows where to draw the line with his next . Hopefully not the latter. Hes taking the icing on the cake you kicking him out is like a walk off grand slam in the world series of moping. And it feels good to get a reaction out of someone and to pull someone else into his world of grief and events. Can you really blame him?Im not giving your son a way out or saying whos right. I feel its not what you said but how you said it. Maybe whenever he shares something with you instead of you saying that sounds like a nice change thats exciting and rolling with him on it you may be questioning him or offering other suggestions and one upping him or not taking his back.You either need to wait it out or text him a list of apologies and say a few mistakes you made throughout the week or not. Show him you dont know it all and that you arent out to harm him. He wants you to take his side and say fuck this shit Im making some changes instead of just go to the gym answer answer answer. Be the first to take blame for what happened. Good luck. Your son sounds cool. JAG. Maybe help him start his own side business and hire others to review documents for him and he can take a percentage.  Im just throwing stuff out there now. Make it a project between you two.

I think your best move is to try to be his wing woman and dont let on that you dug into his accounts Which is easily as creepy as anything hes been doing by the way but your intentions are good so well ignore that. He needs some serious help if hes going to improve his dating techniques and you obviously had a sense that hes struggling even before you snooped.Things like continuing to date multiple people no matter what even after a successful date or two refusing to be exclusive right away say anything under  dates meeting sooner rather than later so that he doesnt create a fantasy of the person but instead meets them within a week or two of messaging to see if theres chemistry etc should help him avoid being super clingy. It sounds like hes probably buying into the rom com bullshit notion that persistence gets the girl. Society really does push that message and its absolute bullshit most of the time. The notions he has about dating from popular culture are as misguided as someone trying to learn combat or performance driving from action movies. None of the times Ive managed to really hit it off with someone were hard at all they were almost effortlessly easy because when someones really into you it just clicks and good things naturally happen. It never feels like work but most people dont click with most other people.

213175,0,t3_1wk6c7,While it doesnt sound exactly like she was threatening suicide to keep you in the relationship its definitely something that does occur. If you want to leave or end up wanting to leave and you believe it was something she was genuinely bringing up break up with her tell a close friend or two of hers and also her parents that you broke up with her and that she threatened suicide and that they should keep an eye on her and then you move on. Exaggeration or not if you think it had a chance at being a genuine threat better safe than sorry.And most importantly of all if you did break up with her and she actually did commit suicide afterwards its essential you understand that it wasnt your fault. No one goes from  mentally fine to suicide because of a breakup. In no circumstance would you be the actual cause. Of course its one thing to tell yourself that or that you will tell yourself that and another to actually believe it if that ever came up.But the answer is never to just let that threat keep you in the relationship. Because then you are trapped literally until one of you dies. The same threat would be made over and over again. Its basically a oneperson hostage situation.,relationship_advice,cf2q4jt,2,t5_2r0cn
213546,0,t3_1wjbxl,What kind of drugs are you using?  Are you still using them regularly? My ex was an oxy addict and he absolutely had trouble remembering things correctly  if at all.   If you looked on your computer and saw a history of hookup sites  and you werent ever on them yourself  then theres a decent chance she was.   Maybe it was just curious it  maybe something more troubling.  Your theory that she is plowing your boss seems a lot less credible  at least going off of what you wrote in your post.   Theres a bigger chance of you misremembering or misinterpreting conversations and impressions than there is of you hallucinating hookup sites.   Is it possible you might have told your boss that information and you thought you told another friend?   Is there another way he couldve found out  like from being a Facebook friend?   His mood doesnt really indicate an affair to me.   Im sure youve seen a drunk person insist they are totally in their right mind before  right?   Truth is  recreational drugs change your perception.   Thats the point of them.   So you may not have been presenting yourself as you thought.   Youve been in a bad place emotionally.   Has your productivity suffered?   Is it possible you looked distraught or acted irritably when you came into work after the fight with your girlfriend?   Maybe your boss is annoyed by something you did that you arent aware of.   Maybe hes in a bad mood because of something that has nothing to do with you.   Did you have a relationship with your boss that included giving each other crap before this past week?   Is it possible you inferred malicious intent because you were caught up in your own pain? Take a deep breath and get some distance from your situation.   You cant trust your perception on drugs  so make yourself rely on tangible evidence.  I recorded the work I just did so I know it is done.   my bosss number is in my gfs call history so there definitely could have been contact.   I definitely recommend you see a therapist.   Youre self medicating and it has a negative impact on your life already.   Either the drugs make you paranoid that your girlfriend is cheating and she isnt  or they are making it harder to see that she obviously is and you should leave her ASAP.   A therapist will help you learn productive coping strategies so you can manage your feelings sober and at least be able to trust your own judgment.

214074,0,t1_cf2sl3j,The point I was making was that sex doesnt have to be an unfortunate part of having a wife.   Youre putting pressure on yourself to have a normal  sex life.   This is why you ended up in bad relationships  because you could take or leave sex  but your partners had a need for it.   The solution isnt to try to change your libido  its to find a partner who feels the same way about sex that you do.   With your high libido ladyfriend theres a high probability it will play out like this at first  you might be flattered by her initiating  and have sex.   Maybe even a lot of it through the honeymoon period.   But you will eventually fall back into the schedule youre comfortable with  lets say once every two months.   She on the other hand will keep wanting to have sex x a week  and keep initiating it when she wants it.   Shes always going to feel like you dont have enough sex lets say you cave in and have sex once every two weeks and that you are rejecting her since she is the only one initiating  and you will feel like sex is a chore and that you have to do it to keep her happy.   If you find an asexual girl you like or at least one with the same libido level as you  all those problems go away.   Sometimes you might initiate  sometimes she will  but a majority of the time you wont have sex and youd both be satisfied with that.   Sex is an important aspect of relationships  but not in the sense that there has to be a lot of it.   You and your partner just have to be sexually compatible.   That could mean having sex twice a day  or twice a year  or putting on clown suits and poking each other suggestively with balloon animals.   Everythings fine just as long as both partners are on the same page.   Wanting sex is like being hungry.   Either youre hungry or youre not.   Say you love waffles and you are ambivalent about pancakes attractionpreferences .   Your exes were pancakes  but the emotional connection you had with them was like a bunch of syrup.   So you ate because it didnt taste awful  and they appreciated it.   If you were hungry  youd be craving waffles all day.   When you get pancakes  youd eat them because even though it wasnt your favorite youd at least stop being hungry.   You just wouldnt order them if given the choice.   If youre not hungry  you can look at a mountain of waffles and say  they look delicious!   But I seriously cant eat all those waffles.   This new girl is what you hope is  a waffle.   I suspect  however  that you just arent hungry enough to keep eating waffles as often as she serves them.   That said  she seems like an awesome waffle and I hope things do work out at the end of the day you should find a partner who wants waffles as often or seldom  as you do.   Youre not broken for not being ravenous.   Dont choke down food  is all.   ,relationship_advice,cf2tt12,1,t5_2r0cn

234649,0,t3_1wsw47,Say a nicer version of what you wrote. Say that she is wonderful and youre so grateful and glad for the time you spent together but you can see already that you want different things and have different plans so you think it best to go your separate ways. She may ask for specific plans of yours to see if you two can agree on them at this point tell her that one of the things you want at this stage is to have the freedom and opportunities of keeping your options open  any plan is not for you at this time.She will probably freak out. Be kind but firm. Tell her versions of you are wonderful but I cant have any girlfriend or commitments at this point in my life. Repeat as needed. Dont crack under guilt or sympathy.If she offers to stay loose and hang around while you decide say something like we both know that isnt the life that you want and it wouldnt be fair to keep you hanging and waiting on something from me that may never happen.If she asks when you will be in a position to want a commitment refer to point one about needing to not have a fixed plan which includes knowing such things. Say something like for her own good because you care about her you want her to have the chance to move on and find someone who wants what she wants live how she lived and will appreciate how great she is etc.She will still be upset its inevitable but you cant marry her to make her happy and the sooner you give her a chance to move on the kinder.  If you know any of her friends or family well enough and think they may be helpful you can reach out to them and ask them to be supportive. Time the breakup so she can go to one of them immediately after i.e. at her house with family home or at her friends.Thats my  cents. Good luck.

You hear all the time about women who have rape fantasies and so forth.If your feelings about it truly rise to the level of disgust youre just going to have to consider how important this is to your relationship. You might be able to get him to quit but the fact is he enjoys it so my guess is forcing him to quit something that he probably views as totally innocuous is only likely to drive a wedge between you...Some people would say relax its just a cartoon.

Its something I have always been very good at picking up when getting to know a person. I also have a crazy good memory. Between these skills I was able to pick up that Ian hardly ever looked at me in the face when describing girls he was with a long time ago and he would mix up dates of past events quite often.Any woman who claims this is pretty much a psycho bitch. Men confirm? I confronted Ian about what I suspected ...Normal people just say I dont want to deal with this. Psycho women want to bathe in the details when theyve been wronged.

If on the other hand he supports the decision which is  legally morally and practically  yours even if he would rather you decided something else! then you know hes a keeper. On abortion more specifically if you decide its what you want and not that its any of my business but its certainly a much better option than bringing a life into the world who will be resented pursue it soon. I dont know where you live but assuming youre in the U.S. legislatures in many states have been on a crusade to illegally and immorally restrict abortion and make it almost impossible to access. You have a limited time and it may well be harder to get it taken care of than you anticipate. Relatedly there are plenty of organizations that in their advertising suggest theyre there to provide abortion services and then once youre in the office they pressure you into carrying to term. Thats why you should go to Planned Parenthood which is a name you can trust to give you straight talk on all your options. They also charge on a sliding scale so whatever your financial condition you can afford it. I am a parent and it breaks my heart that there are children in this world who are resented unloved neglected or just simply deprived because their parents dont have the desire or the means to provide for them.

323840,0,t3_1xsrcw,Yeah there are some serious red flags here. The most important of which is she is trying to have a relationship with you while simultaneously shutting you out of her life. That level of dishonesty tells me that she is either embarrassed or hiding something. You only have one choice here well healthy choice and that is to talk to her. There is no way this relationship can work unless she comes clean about her roommate situation her separation and why she is hiding you from her friends and family. You cant enter a relationship without being open and honest and she is currently being neither. Until you have her provide clarity on these issues I wouldnt get too emotionally involved. Also keep in mind that some of the things she tells you might be difficult for her to say so be calm and patient  but not too patient. Understand that it might take a couple of talks to get it all out there. Also remember that you might not like what she has to say and you need to be prepared for that. Know what your limits are when it comes to her roommate or the hiding you parts and anything else that may come up. If she doesnt come clean or isnt willing to fully come clean then I think you need to move on. That would be the start of a very dishonest relationship and will certainly cause you a world of pain if you let it continue. ,relationship_advice,cfec4nn,4,t5_2r0cn

If you actually are interested in knowing her now say so but tell her that no one has contacted her before because they never really met her and didnt want to disrespect the limits her mom set. I wouldnt hide any of that bs from her. She has a right to know.

338993,0,t1_cffunka,Going off of what uChocolateandBeer saidIm a firm believer that humans are in control of their emotions much more than Hollywood has led us to believe. In Hollywood they would like for you to believe that love is just something that happens and when it does you have to do everything you can to keep it up. But the truth is that this kind of love can be really unhealthy for people. This is the kind of love that lead people to stay with abusive partners. I believe that healthy love is something created through intimacy and trust. Thats why I havent asked a girl I was in love with out. I ask a girl Im interested in seeing if I could love out. I think this really applies to you. You need to realize that just because you love him right now doesnt mean anything significant other than that your brain is conditioned to inject some specific hormones when you see him. Its going to go away.Another important realization is that you dont owe him anything. If he becomes depressed its his own problem unless he told you explicitly that this would happen before you started dating. The game he is playing is just scamming you into being his girlfriend. Its comparable to a grocerystore giving out samples even putting a sign over it saying free samples and then asking you to pay afterwards anyway. Your only nineteen! You still have time to put stuff behind you! Your in no rush to find a life partner. So chill out!Just for the fun of it I asked my dad who is  how may times he thought he had found the one.

343417,0,t3_1y0wvs,You are young. If you arent happy with this girl dont stay with her regardless of what type of manipulation or threats she makes. Whatever she does is on her not you. Always remember that.As for the dynamics of the friendships with the roommates. If you are close to your roommate let him know your situation and ask for his support. Definitely dont make him pick sides but ask that he respects the fact that you want some separation from her for awhile and not to invite her out when you two are doing something and vice versa when they are doing something with her. You should make a serious effort to cut contact until both of you are over each other. No need to confuse the situation anymore than you need to. Unfortunately when you have mutual friends you have to let the cards lie where they fall. Meaning you can try to maintain friendships with these mutual friends but ultimately it is their choice is they make a choice.

It wasnt something either of us had really embraced before but its been amazing the past few months. It takes a lot of trust and communication.If this is something important to you maybe you can pick a few articles for your BF to read. Just make sure you give him a clear general idea. For example do you want him to control you from when you wake up to when you go to work layoff and then take control again? What kinds of tasksassignments are you willing to do. Does punishment enter the picture if so how? Every ds relationship is different so make sure you read around and really digest what you want before approaching him.Otherwise saying I want you to take complete control over the relationship could be met with a boat load of fears in his mind that you dont intend.Oh.

420624,0,t1_cfoce1r,It doesnt matter if theyre wrong honestly what changes if they know the truth or not? Why are you driven to convince them that its this way not that way? If you know the truth what does it matter if others dont share your truth? Does it make it less true? Further if you cared so much about how others would perceive the outcome why not hold off until the marriage was clearly and obviously dissolved? Mathematically dating was more important than avoiding confusion. Im not saying they arent mistaken Im simply saying the behavior implies you dont care what other people think and when they think differently you suddenly care. You cant both behave one way that is inseparable from a certain perception and also demand others to deny that perception in favor of yours. Its a complicated situation as Im sure you know but you cant do one thing and say another you cant both care and not care. If the important thing is their current relationship and the not the perception of it which they dont control then the best way to be satisfied is to understand their limits.,relationship_advice,cfod36t,8,t5_2r0cn

You can give up your standards and become a faggot but you will never be happy this way.Its not internalized homophobia gays are a protected group now because of liberals and their mass obsession with loving and tolerating anything so long as it agrees with them. The gay community is full of sick twisted degenerates dont make me pull out facts Id rather not make you hate these people forever that goes against the were totally normal narrative and thus must be promptly ignored. It doesnt matter much as theyre not part of the community and dont care what happens in it thus they dont know how it operates.

439183,0,t3_1z3yep,You continued on with the texting because people like flirting its fun to crush on people and we all do it although some of us do it far more often than others. You had the option of feeding your crush you had the option of instead turning back towards your boyfriend and focusing on him. The correct move was to focus on your boyfriend and not feed the crush. Your boyfriend is totally right you could replace him at any point and he could replace you at any point. Thats the nature of relationships theyre mutually consensual agreements. What keeps two people together is honesty trust and treating each other the best that you possibly can. How do you fix this? Time and making sure you show him how special he actually is to you. The crush wasnt special it was simply new novel and exciting. I would also suggest you two  avoid talking about this to death accept that it happened and it will likely happen again one or both of you will crush on somebody in the future next time have very clearly defined boundaries and dont cross them.,relationship_advice,cfqabet,3,t5_2r0cn
441172,0,t1_cfq2t6m,Pay for a dating site subscription preferably a place like Match.com or eHarmony. If you are looking for something more meaningful those are the kind of places you want to go. People are less willing to pay for a subscription if they are just looking for a hookup and more willing to pay to find something long term. I think on those sites you even have to answer a bunch of questions each time you want to talk to someone so you kind of get to screen the person before you even say hello. I dont know exactly how it works. It might take a while and you will probably go out on a bunch of failed dates before you finally feel like youve found someone worth your while. But this is true in real life too. Though bear in mind Im a straight lady.Source Sister had no luck with free dating sites switched to eHarmony and Match. Finally met some men who were on the same page. Met her husband on eHarmony. Been married for   years and is gonna have a baby.Source  I used a freeish site. It was free to have a profile and to send smiles but if you wanted to start a conversation with someone you had to have a subscription. Guy who was paying for it messaged me. Still dating him   years later. So thankful he chose to pay for a subscription. Never would have met him otherwise.Edit I had an RA in college who was very gay though you never would have guessed by looking at him. He was blunt and open about it though so everyone knew. He had been in a relationship with another guy for about  years when I met him. I think they moved to New York and got married about a year ago.

510425,0,t3_1zxs6w,I wrote a response to your other post that has more detail and I suggest you take the approach I suggested. That said heres some more advice. Do not write her a poem put a kick me sign on her back make any references to the kiss or otherwise try out any other ideas. None of that will get you where you want to be. Instead be the same guy you always have been and just talk to her like shes a person you want to spend more time with.Heres the thing she already likes you. Further she likes you because of how you already treat her. Suddenly changing the way you interact with her is likely to confuse her or put her off. Instead treat her the way you always have. Whatever youre doing its working. Keep doing it. No poems no grand gestures no weird overly serious conversations. Theres plenty of time for that stuff later. If you want to date this girl ask her out on a date. Go see a movie hang out in your parents basement go to the mall it doesnt matter. Get some alone time with her and have fun together. When youre having fun together and youre alone tell her you want to kiss her then kiss her. Kiss her right on the lips and watch her melt.I said it before and Ill say it again Dont overthink it. She likes you you like her. Tell her you like her and you want to spend more time with her. Shes going to respond positively to that I promise you and its a whole lot easier than trying to force some misunderstood notion of romance into the equation. TLDR Just ask her out on a date.,relationship_advice,cfyadqg,1,t5_2r0cn

513916,0,t1_cfyo2k9,Thank you very much for taking the time to write all this. I really appreciate it. When he ended it I didnt try to change his mind or get emotional. He told me that he was fucked up in the head and I said that I didnt like it when he talked that way about himself but that I did feel that he never really let me in emotionally and he didnt disagree. I told him that he had a right to his feelings. He said that he hope we can be friends there is no way I could do that with how strong my feelings were and I was just quiet for a little and said that I just needed time and that I wish him the best. It is hard to go from waking up in his arms to nothing. And it is scary that it can feel so right but not be. But you are totally right... Ill adjust as I get used to it again. It is really cool to see a guy being so honest by the way. You didnt mean to hurt her and were also trying to figure things out. Deep down we know if a guy is giving us his all or not and I did know that wasnt the case in my situation and Im sure the girl in your situation knew too. It is just hard because we want to be close to those people we care about so much physically emotionally etc. even if we know they arent at the same place. I guess we just hope that you will get there. These things are hard for both genders. But it just seems like guys have an easier time at it somehow....anyway right now the thought of never talking to him again is really sad to me even if that would be the best thing.Thank you again you are awesome ,relationship_advice,cfyoopp,2,t5_2r0cn

518413,0,t1_cfz6bjs,Thanks for this reply I think I will go over it more seriously with her and maybe him before our Dominican Republic trip. I think my issue is that I am not sure if I am being totally reasonable. They havent done anything behind my back and I trust her so I wish this wouldnt bother me but I cant help it. She is generally a very nurturing kind person and is more comfortable with guys than girls. Its not the first time Ive been bothered by how close she is to a guy but its certainly the worst Ive felt because of how close they are growing recently and because she just seems way too comfortable with him. For example he recently broke his arm and was in the hospital for surgery. When he was getting ready to be discharged my gf immediately jumped in to help him change from gown only into underwear clothes etc. while me and the other visitors all male kind of helped. I feel like most girls would have left the room with his junk barely out of sight and she wouldve with other guys but not with him. It didnt bother me much at the time but my dad who was there too pointed it out to me later as unusual and now I wonder if I should mention it to her or something.,relationship_advice,cfz748j,2,t5_2r0cn

We broke up a handful of times over the next three years did the roommate thing thing did the fwb thing and ended up becoming exclusive again though we were never out of each others lives. The whole time we werent together I had like two shortterm boyfriends and a couple of flings.  We married when I was . It was the worst mistake Ive ever made. We broke up just under two years ago.  I hadnt experienced nearly enough of life. Who you are at  is going to change. Thats an incredibly young age. Your brain isnt even finished developing. Theres a lot of life to experience in your s and s a lot of stuff you need to figure out for yourself.  My advice is to get serious if thats what you want but dont get settled. Have fun in your relationship but acknowledge that this isnt the person you should marry. And when you do break up take time to learn how to live by yourself. Your relationship with yourself is the most important thing you bring to the table when you get involved with someone else. You have to know what being alone is like and how you deal with real life without a partner.

I am not overweight but I have terrible self esteem when it comes to my body thanks to my super critical mom and mean brother and I am sure there is a little of self hate in there too. I have been extremely comfortable being naked around some people and really nervous around others and its all down to my partners view and encouragement. Whenever she looks good tell her! When she takes off any article of clothing woot and catcall her. Even if she is only taking off her sweatshirt and still has a tshirt under it give her a little encouragement. Be her nakedness cheerleader and she will want to be less covered up around you. Tell her she looks sexy in a sincere way and that you love her body. Also dont forget to complement her when she has all of her clothes on and complement her on nonbody stuff too help her to develop her confidence as a whole human.

559217,0,t3_20iyii,You have to view a relationship like a rental car agreement. You rent one of those Dodge Challengers and You love it ! Enjoy the ride dont abuse it give it the appropriate level of maintenance but if the rental company calls and wants you to return it cuz you said you only needed it for a couple days but now its going on a week SO you just say Oh really ? oh ok thanks here ya go ! Then find another rental car. If they rent you a clunker you just turn around and bring it back.In other words you cant get too emotionally invested. And when you get married you end up financially invested without really understanding to the degree you really are. You have to remember nothing good lasts forever. See rkillmarriage for more reference material on what you need to be aware of. Like never cohabitate with a woman with kids. Its very possible the evil US family courts could pin child support on YOU for HER kids despite DNA tests. Im not a lawyer and this isnt legal advice.Ive been studying all this since my divorce  years ago. So Ive come to some conclusions between an  year marriage and about  relationships including the one Im in now Have relationships. Get to know people. Move in move out when the red flags go up. Relationships and marriage have a finite shelf life. Relationships last about  years. Marriage fails  in  times after about  years. Relationships fizzle. Why ? from dictionary.com FAMILIARITY BREEDS CONTEMPT The better we know people the more likely we are to find fault with them. Long experience of someone or something can make one so aware of the faults as to be scornful. For example Ten years at the same job and now he hates it familiarity breeds contempt .

Unfortunately as great as the Indian family mentality thing is most of the time the other part of the time its hell because family really does play a significant part of our culture. Fortunately his momma will be moving overseas within the next year so distance will be better. Plus weddings usually bring out the worst in people Indians I mean so Im just waiting until were married and everything finally goes back to normal. Ive definitely made it clear to him that it is US and OUR relationship OUR marriage is his priority not anyone elses feelings although it is good to at least take someone elses feelings into consideration but not let it influence whats best for us. He understood and is working hard to change his ways. His mom told him she would pick out his outfit for the wedding and he told her hes not getting his outfit until I buy mine because he wants me to wear what I want and not have to pick something that matches him.

Never mind of course that you dont even have a job much less any particular skills that could land you anything other than a shitty job and the fact that youre a full time student. Clearly the stresses of a minimum wage job the never ending accrual of debt and being a full time student on top of it all are worth it just so you dont have to hear a few bad words from your mother every now and then right? RIGHT? Clearly!!!!I swear some of these people offering advice on here can be frikkin hilarious sometimes. You want some good advice OP? How bout grow the heck up! So your mom talks down on you BIG DEAL. How bout growing some thicker skin have you tried that? If shit like this is going to affect your emotional well being so much so to get you depressed Id hate to imagine what the real world and ACTUAL problems will do to you. Not everyone is gonna baby your feelings around in life you understand that right? So how bout being less of an emo crybaby and taking advantage of the fact that you have the luxury of being able to live at home debtfree rentfree while you study in university. Dont worry. Youll have plenty of time to live parentfree once you actually graduate land a decent career job and THEN move out... Oh you know... for no good reason... other than maybe to not ruin the next  years of your life financially when moving out.P.S. If you decide not to take any advice from the above at least take this one... never ever take out a loan without first already having a very solid ability to actually pay it off. ,relationship_advice,cg6nk77,0,t5_2r0cn

594068,0,t3_20y0me,I was in a similar situation and you have a  options to consider.  Well get there in a sec.  But first you should think about why shes acting this way.  Is she always like this with you?  Is she ever like this with other people her friendsfamily?  Are you sometimes needyinsecure?  If shes always like this then I would dump her because thats just whom she is Option No. .  If youve been a little bit needy then I would shake this off and keep a healthy distance between you two initiate less take longer to respond etc.  I hate games but some people respond positively to this Option No. .  The third option is speak with her about her insensitivity to your trip to ER.  Tell her what you would have appreciated  a show of genuine concern.  Stay calm and rational about the whole thing.  Gonna give you a headsup though  she might not respond well to this.  She already treated you as if you are whiney when you were in bad pain.  She might again say youre acting like a baby over nothing.  Some people are like this.  If its a fundamental difference in sensitivity to one another it might be worth parting early on before getting hurt further.  Another thing worth considering is that youve only been seriously dating for  weeks.  The relationship is still very new and you might be expecting too much right now.  She might grow to be more caring or she might not.  Again look at how she treats other relationships in her life  is she thoughtful caring considerate with them?  If not shell probably never be that way with you.  Good luck bro and speedy recovery.,relationship_advice,cg7ssj2,2,t5_2r0cn

You have to schedule a time to have a skype date whether it be for an hour every other day or a few hours on the weekend. You need to schedule a time where you guys can both sit down talk about your day flirt and see how the other is doing. Another thing is that you need to remember is that you are going to have to be extra honest about feelings and communicate them properly to each others. If you dont like that he isnt texting you enough explain to him calmly why its important to you. Oh and dont do countdown clocks. Those stress you out and the days seem to drag on.

One suggestion is to gather evidence of bed bugs photos pictures of bites etc... then ask him politely to break your lease and allow you to move out because of the bed bugs. As a landlord he needs to make reasonable efforts to clear the place of bedbugs or he is in violation of the landlordtenant lease agreement.

628825,0,t3_21bk83,Ive been in this spot a few times before male side.  You started off on the wrong foot.  Your jealously made matters worse to begin with. Tell a man he cant do something hell just wanna do it more outta spite.  He is trying to have his cake and eat it too I wont deny that but you did not make it any better by getting upset and giving him an ultimatum.  The rough patch just threw him closer to S.  You both should have remedied that rough patch before it got too this.  The flirting is just that he wants to have sex with her.  Just that.  Not a relationship.  There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING any female can do to make her man NOT WANT to have sex with another woman.  Not possible.  So dont get all bent outta shape cause you found out your man thinks about other chicks.  I have a GF and every time I meet a new chick the first things I think about are how she looks naked and what she feels like.  Doesnt mean Im gonna cheat on her.  Thats just how Im wired.  She knows she sees me staring at other girls as they walkby even tho I try to be like a ninja somehow she still catches me!Anyway advice time.  You dont seem like youre open to their friendship at all and if you cant justify it then he will not listen to you at this point and continue to do it behind your back.  He might keep it at a friend level for his whole life or he could end up messing with S because of the problem the two of you are having.  You I and everyone else here cant be certain on the actions your man will take.  Only he knows.  Ask him what he wants dont tell him what he has to choose from.  If you want to beat S at her own game get loose!  Start dressing up for your man in skimpy outfits.  Workout and get fit.  Make him remember why he wanted you in the first place.  Or... Just leave now while you can.  My ex and I were together for  years and had a child.  The last  years we had a rough patch just like you.  She gave me ultimatums on who I could and could not talk to and got mad if she even saw some chick look my way.  I met someone else by chance and being the complete opposite of my EX I fell fast and hard.  My EX never wanted to fix herself and we had a bad break up.

Tell him that you understand that this might not be what hes looking for and that you can no longer sleep with him. This will prompt one of two responses from him either you two break it off and are just friends platonic! or he will acknowledge the exclusive relationship between you two. Option  is that you could simply mention to him that since you two are not exclusive you intend to datebe intimate with other people.

640957,0,t1_cgd1r58,If your brother is mentally ill you need to advocate for him. If hes schizoid ie if he talks about auditory hallucinations theyll most likely prescribe Zyprexa or Risperdal. These drugs have a serious lifeshortening consequences from metabolic syndrome onset to actual brain shrinkage. These drugs will put your brother into a haze and arent a cure. They should only be a step. People can recover from or compensate for schizoid tendencies or clinical depression which could account for his erratic and strange behavior but it takes a lot of work and sometimes people succumb to the madness. Its not hopeless but there will be not much hope. Strangely in my experience diet and exercise help. Centering on reality cooking cleaning all the little things  when youre in lala land you dont take care of yourself helps. Your brother is so disconnected right now he doesnt have any empathy or understanding when you clearly communicate your ill. But he also knows he needs help and thats why he asked you about the therapy.You can get him for psychiatric stuff into your community mental health program which will give him meds with reduced prices copays we or even free based on his income. Theres usually an extensive intake and a wait time for an appointment. This would probably be where to go first as they would provide a diagnosis.  If your brother goes into crisis suicidal or violent lots of cities have crisis centers where he would get placed on a  hold. Depending on the severity of his condition this could be extended. However crisis centers are much better than jail. Try to avoid having the police getting involved if you can as their treatment of the mentally ill is generally not good. And therapy can be had on a sliding scale with most therapists. And there are plenty of Christian ones with serious training and education as in not just Bible college grads or pastors though his pastor if he has one might have suggestions or resources.As for advocating that means helping him find therapists going on initial interviews and trying to find someone who wants to help your brother get better. And helping your brother keep appointments at first at least. As he improves he should be able to do it for himself. Your brother isnt his disease whatever it may be. And hes together enough to be a waiter at least which means hes at least still functioning. It can be difficult to reconcile ones position in life with ones expectations for themselves when confronted with failure. It can make you crazy especially if you feel trapped and unable to make your life better. e. sorry for all the words.

683916,0,t3_21vmlt,Im from the Pacific Northwest and its really true that theres such an incredible diversity of people and beliefs. When I went to college I found myself amongst a staggering number of conservatives but I was very often in a position where voicing my opinion would do more damage than good. Just because you have your beliefs and convictions doesnt mean the world needs to hear them. And I dont say this to favor any political or religious side but sometimes Americans can forget that it is generally regarded as impolite to bring up religion and politics when meeting new people. Because youre dating their daughter theyre likely to want to know these details about you. My advice would be to listen first to how they phrase the questions they ask. For example if youre watching television or the news and something controversial comes up and they ask you about it try to gauge their personal reaction before you form your answer. One night I was having dinner at a friends house her parents are pretty staunch conservatives and a particular type of Christian that does not embrace science. They asked me how I felt about global climate change and I could tell by their facial expressions that they thought it was all hocus pocus and my real views would be attacked if I offered them. Instead I mentioned how much I care about the planet and regardless of what the facts about global climate change are humans have a responsibility to take care of the planet because we all live here. Always be polite remind them what a good job they did raising their daughter how much you care for her and if youre steered into territory youre uncomfortable with remind them that youre from a different culture and the political issues Americans are raised with are very different from the political situations youve experienced in your life. If they start with the questions make sure you answer but then make sure to ask as many open ended questions as you can in return. Americans love to hear themselves talk clearly as Im rambling and most will take your cultural ignorance as an excuse to anything mildly offensive you might say. For the most part among conservatives and Christians sex drugs same sex relationships abortion taxes and governmental control are big taboos.

Secondly be aware of the possibility that a lot of guys who want to have an FFM threesome but who also know that their GF will not agree to it try to manipulate her by offering an MMF threesome first and then when the MMF threesome is done turn around to tell her I gave you an MMF threesome its only fair that you give me an FFM one now.

In an era of the Internet with burner phones hidden email accounts and cyber cafes if someone wants to cheat on you they damn well will and if theyre careful enough youll never figure it out. The only thing you can realistically do to prevent yourself from being hurt or betrayed is be open honest and expect the same in return from your partner. People are sometimes tempted to cheat and being really insecure is a way to make that actually more likely to happen not less likely.

Im not a fan of ultimatums but I think he needs a wake up call. All of that comic book crap doesnt help the family in any way. So I dont think that it is unfair to tell him that either he agrees to move the family to a larger place or his toys have to go. At some point we have to grow up and handle our responsibilities and it sounds like hes just being selfish and putting his toys before his family.If he refuses to compromise then rent a climate controlled storage unit and have the stuff moved without his permission. Therapy is great and all but you have a situation that needs someone to take action. Its not a decision that he can make for whatever reason so you make it. Hell probably be upset either way so you might as well just do what needs to be done. If he says hes moving the stuff back then I would say if it comes back into the house that you and the kids are leaving. Its dangerous to have a family living in that mess.

Ive started making choices and connections towards a managerial oriented career Im even considering getting a public accountants license as a supplement and alternate career path. I want to be able to provide for those around me more than my parents ever could. I came from a low income family and I need security knowing that my partner and I can provide in the future for those we care about. . Her reckless lifestyle worries me. We live miles away and I never know if shes safe. She lives in a very large city and is always out late at night. Instead of planning her future out she goes out and gets drunk almost every night. My father was an alcoholic in his earlier years he stopped once I was born although I do have two older sisters and both my parents tell me of how big of a problem it was for them. I cant help but think that her drinking will be a problem as well in the future.. Im not too sure how to answer this. Like I said many of the achievements Ive gotten so far is because I believed I was right when no one else did. Most of the times I can remember thinking to myself that I shouldnt say sorry because I did nothing wrong. We never say eye to eye on this and it was one of the biggest problems we had.. When I saw her she looked so happy with where she was without me. I felt that maybe it was true maybe Im just the cause of her unhappiness. When were together we are both very happy its more when we are apart that we tend to feel sad and hurt by one another. I wanted to be the one to make her happy not her friends.

Even solid relationships that would normally be perfection can crumble under the uncertainty distance and scheduling complications of the military.  If you are not  on the same page then you cant really support and love each other from a distance.  To keep forcing this relationship is not fair to you.  You deserve to have a relationship that gives you what you wantneed.  This one is not it.  Thats not to say that in time you two cant make it work but right now he is very clearly telling you that he doesnt have what it takes to continue.

Just as they assume things about you because of your own opinion! Im not shaming her my opinion on the matter just defers from hers.People make the assumption of shame because others and commonly women are shamed for some of the things your opinion concerns. Sexual freedom and casual sex does not necessarily equate to loose morals and a lack of selfrespect. You are shaming people who have healthy yet casual sexual relationships. A person is entirely capable of respecting themselves and having a casual relationship.Remember that were speaking generally  yes there are going to be people who fit with your opinion entirely. But not everyone. That is the problem you dont seem to accept the people who do not fit with the judgement of your opinion  and you seem to place that judgement on your exs past.

1003478,0,t3_25krj4,EX. Ex boyfriend. Ex.  Lets set him aside for a moment. He is out of your life. What he does or does not do is absolutely none I mean ZERO of your business.   Lets look at you. You broke up with this guy in December. Not last week not last month December. He should be  out of your life. So what do you think it is about you that makes you want to keep tabs on him?  I can understand the desire to feel right to sort of lord it over him that hes a fuckup. Maybe he is maybe he isnt. Its none of your business. But at this point you should well have moved on. Usually the need to point out others flaws especially those who are not in our lives anymore is seated in our own insecurities. I ditched a friend  years ago very similar to your exbf and sometimes I want to call her up because I just know shes still a loser fucking up her life and it would make ME feel good to just kind of rub it in her face. Oh Id do it as a thinlyveiled offer to help but I know damn well that I would get such smug satisfaction out of just implying that she makes crappy choices and I dont and my life is sweet and hers isnt. Ane every time I have that urge it is because I myself messed something up or made a mistake or Im just feeling kind of insecure that day.   So I have to remember I cut her out of my life for a reason. And I also have to remember that while she makes reallt bad choices I do too. Instead of thinking about her and what crappy choices she made today leading to her latest crisis du jour I need to focus on ME. What slipped through my fingers today? What am I feeling guilty about? Forget telling her what she needs to improve what do I need to work on about myself to get rid of that feeling of needing to prove Im better than her?  So look to yourself. Are you perfect? Do you have flawless grades? A highpaying satisfying career? All of your bills paid all of your friends loving and supportive? Are you healthy and fit with great habits? If there is any aspect of yourself that you might be able to improve then work on YOU. Forget him or anyone else. Work on you. After all youre the only one you can change. You cant change him certainly not with criticism and shaming.  If you are absolutely perfect in every way keep it a secret. One thing I learned is that being perfect and a knowitall does NOT make you any friends. At least pretend to have a few flaws so people will find you relatable. I  know this because I am also  perfect in every way and I learned the hard way. Okay that is my attempt at a joke.

1007925,0,t3_25msvq,This is a classic example of what Ive been taught to recognize as a crucial conversation that needs to happen. The basic issue is that neither of you actually know what the other is thinking. And based on very limited evidence you both I assure you hes doing the same thing are constructing stories in your head to fit said limited set of facts. One of you needs to initiate a dialogue to break the tension. That doesnt mean that you should rush out and try to fix something based on the limited story you may have constructed. The conversation that you should have is specifically to dispell any false assumptions about the situation either of you may have formed. And yes that may lead to an end of the relationship but there will be a concrete reason for it. More likely however itll get you two past some minor misunderstanding. Since you are reaching out for help here Im assuming you are willing to take that first step.The fact that hes emotionally introverted does make it harder. I am one of those dudes as well so I can attest to often feeling misunderstood as a result. And while I rarely share of my own accord when prompted especially with targeted questions that I can answer in  word sentences Im much more inclined to communicate. Assuming there is no issue on your end over such a personality trait work with it and structure your dialogue in such a way as to make it easier for him to open up.First agknowledge the situtation with him either via phone or text or whatever means you feel most comfortable with. This could go something like Theres obviously something going on. I know there is dramatrouble with your band and it wasnt my intention to make things harder for you.Second try to dispell any assumptions he might have formed in his own mind. It sounds like he was looking for some support and instead got what he perceived as a brush off or a joke. It may have really seemed silly to you for him to snap over whatever it was but it sounds like to him it wasnt. His reaction was certainly not helpful either but that is where you need to give him leeway now. So something along the lines of I realize that what I said probably wasnt helpful but I was also hurtupsetangry over how you responded.Lastly probe for a response along a similar track. Whatever his response is dont get angry or upset and even if you do not speak from that emotion. Rather every time agknowledge what it is hes saying and counter with a response that identifies some point of misunderstanding and clarifying how you saw the situationclarify what you wanted to happenacomplishhow you wanted him to perceive something rather then how he actually DID perceive it. Definitely avoid saying things like no wrong you dont get it at all etc.. That will only make things worse.I know all of the above sounds weird. And thats because its not really relationship advice but rather a guide for any testy conversation. Could be with a friend a family member or someone at work. If you can deconstruct any conversation into identifying an assumption someones made  aka a story theyve told themselves based on limited information  and gently dispell it by explaining clearly the actual intent as you saw it only good things can happen.,relationship_advice,chiuxdk,3,t5_2r0cn

But more of an issue is why you agreed to go along with her demands if you did not want to follow the spirit of them?  I have to wonder if she just has a controlling and domineering personality?

1040273,0,t3_260ox6,So this is totally totally about you. In my humble opinion. This sort of behavior is going to push your boyfriend away from you which is quite easy for him to do given that he is seven hours away. Youre heading towards a career in medicine. Presumably you understand that people who have medical issues go to see medical professionals to get help. In your case you have an emotional issue that is going to cause irreparable harm to every relationship you will ever be in if you cant get it under control. I would strongly recommend that you find someway to speak with a professional and try to get to the root of this insecurity.Listen a lot of people feel insecure in relationships its probably one of the most common issues that couples deal with. But intellectually you can already see that your insecurity is unreasonable. Just as you mentioned in your example he already called you twice the same day and then when he didnt call the third time you flipped out on him. That is overthetop. I wouldnt be surprised to see you reply that you dont have any money or a way to find a therapist in a foreign country and so on. not because of anything you have written but because we see it a lot here on Reddit. But people going into the medical profession need to be able to solve problems. I would really urge you to find a way to see someone or at the very least do some research and find some good books on dealing with insecurity.Its quite possible that your boyfriend needs to have a role in helping you balance your insecurity. However at the root of it I think this is your issue to resolve.Good luck!!,relationship_advice,chmj7qz,14,t5_2r0cn

We dont have to be in perfect mental health to have a relationship but we need to be in good working order and frankly this guy sounds like a bit of a mess right now. Its not you its him and thats obvious. There are probably two choices you can really make right nowOption one is to leave. Its pretty straightforward so I wont really say much else about it.Option to is to accept that hes not going to be putting much into you at the moment and along with that I would recommend putting less into him not because you dont care but to put yourself more on the same page as him to even things out because youre feeling very put upon with giving him more than youre getting back. You cant change him but you can change your actions as they relate to him.This could be permanent or a very long road and if youre still in this situation in  months Id walk away no matter what.

1099792,0,t3_26p79k,This is some really sound advice that uzosoevr gave you. Just to touch on it further for OPs benefitHer communication issues need to be resolved before progress can be made. This is a foundation of good relationships being able to trust each other and speak freely. No one is a mind reader. Therapy would be a great option because it would also help her with her security and self esteem issues. Self esteem issues leads to sex life! Sometimes libidos dont match up. Sometimes its because of deeper issues. Maybe and Im just guessing here but maybe she wants sex more often because thats how she feels attractive loved and wanted. Solving some of her esteem issues may calm down the sex drive. Maybe it wont. Find other ways to promote intimacy. That way she is still feeling valued but you dont have to fake sex that you may not feel like having. If I worked as much as you do Id never have the energy to bang!Best of luck to you OP. ,relationship_advice,chtav5h,1,t5_2r0cn

Then went to the psyche ward for a talk but was released within an hour.  So the last bit is believable.  Also Tylenol will not kill you you will only suffer horrible pain for awhile.

Dont even blame yourself here.gtive been depressed since middle school since my move to the US and now im falling back again to this dark abyss he was my rock my light my best friend my companion my everything and now im back into the darknessGet help for your depression he cant be the one source of happiness for you. You need to be able to make yourself happy. Breaks are purgatory and they suck harder than a breakup in my opinion. I dont think this will work out if Im honest. I think hes using this break as a slow breakup like softening the blow until it gets to the point where he says I dont think we should get back together I will not take years for you to get over it and no. Dont be his friend itll only serve to cause you more misery. In the meantime go completely no contact and work on treating your depression. ,relationship_advice,chtz55b,3,t5_2r0cn

She is basically finding a nice way of saying she wants to fuck other guys while having you as a fall back. Again youre being a doormat. Stand the fuck up for yourself.

The only thing you can control is yourself. Youre the only person responsible for your own actions and emotions. If your friend did end up lying to you then maybe hes not who you thought he was. Better to find out now.But expecting someone to tell you that theyre pursuing a friend is illogical and immature. Be the bigger person. If you cant handle the idea of them dating distance yourself now and seek help for how to control your emotions. Most high schools have counselors on staff who will keep your conversations confidential.,relationship_advice,chuyr1f,1,t5_2r0cn

1127491,0,t3_2710ag,For him he needs to stop drinking. Being drunk is not an excuse for domestic violence. He may in fact not remember it but that doesnt make what hes doing any more excusable. He still chooses to drink although he figuratively knows what hes like when he drinks. He is either a hardcore alcoholic or he simply doesnt care about what hes doing. Like one other person commented his lack of acknowledgement helps him defer responsibility from himself. How he feels is completely irrelevant if there is proof of abuse like your photos and police reports. gtwe have the baby coming soonFor you If I was in your shoes I wouldnt want this person anywhere near my child. Personally I would stop trying to fix your ex and focus on the health and safety of both yourself and your child. Go to counseling on your own and focus on healing yourself and then I would absolutely make sure to not let him have custody of the child. Your child could easily be the subject of his drunken violent behavior if he decides to keep drinking or relapsesand no child should ever be subjected to that. ,relationship_advice,chwga3e,3,t5_2r0cn

There must be other things in your life right now that you can focus on other then having a boy friend?  You made some comments about how your boy friend breaking up with you made you wonder if you are not desirable.  It makes it seem like you are basing your standards for feeling attractive partly on if you have a guy wanting to date you.  Since you dont really know why exactly he did it you are just beating yourself up over nothing thinking this way.  Maybe he did decide he isnt attracted to you....maybe he is too focused on other things to enjoy a relationship right now...maybe he is gay...you cant know for sure.  But just because he might have decided you arent attractive to him doesnt mean you arent attractive.  Go do something girly that makes you feel pretty just for the fun of it ,relationship_advice,ci256tg,2,t5_2r0cn
1179894,0,t3_27mdfz,So...to me this seems clear. She has been  honest and wants to be able to sleep with people you cant be upset with that. I have a dear friend whos basically done this she genuinely doesnt want a relationship only wants sex and does care about the guys...as friends. She just doesnt want the relationship and when you press her doesnt experience romance with the guys shes involved with and would prefer to spend her time on friends like me hobbies work etc. There are legitimately women who dont see relationships or marriage as an end goal sometimes I envy them.The girl youre seeing may be holding out for a relationship or she may just not ever see one being in the cards for her like my friend who legitimately feels trapped as soon as shes in a relationship. The deal is she told you off the bat shes going to fuck other men and that is not up for negotiation you do have no right to ask her to change or get less promiscuous just like no woman has the right to tell a guy that after making the same agreement. Im not sure she legitimately likes this ex from another country more than you he may have been a great lay and not someone shes romantically interested in but hes getting time priority because youre there all the time and hes got one week maximum. There may be things sexually that he does differently and while he may not necessarily be better shes made it clear she wants that variety.So why is she keeping you away and not letting you be affectionate in front of him? You barged in on their time together that shes promised to him presumably after him paying a stiff ticket fee to have sex that they both enjoy. Men get jealous SUPER easily with my friend even though shes supposedly the red pill fantasy of never asking for anything from guys and having sex. Regardless of how cool her lovers act they hate being in the same room together she rightly suspected you guys would butt heads and start getting territorial. Frankly if she had started bonding with this guy and didnt value you she wouldnt have put you guys in the same room. She gave you the opportunity to act like a mature guy who was fine with the other guy as you agreed to when  you insisted youd act that way if you hung out in the same room and you failed.The fundamental flaw is She doesnt want what you want. You have romantic feelings and she doesnt. I highly doubt this has anything to do with the other guy youre special to her but as a friend not the way you feel about her and when people get romantically attached they tend to get possessive. You are no longer capable of having the relationship she wants I would tell her that and let her decide if thats something she wants to explore or not.,relationship_advice,ci2cwe5,5,t5_2r0cn

This isnt a simple fix and will likely require a lot of time and possibly even several things to help you overcome it. The only thing I can suggest is to push yourself out of your comfort zone every single day. Try to strike up a simple conversation with a stranger at least once per day. Rejection is a part of life and some of these strangers may reject your attempts to talk while other might accept it. You need to learn how to deal with both as well as initiating it.

Will you write down what kind of deodorant bodywash and shampooconditioner you prefer to use? If you dont have a preference Ill just pick something out that I think smells good. I love that fresh out of the shower smell its insanely sexy!Phrasing it that way gives him a chance to pick up the slack on his own terms and feel like a sexy man beast instead of necessarily feeling down because youre saying you stink. Unfortunately smell can be a very sensitive subject.

But you honestly think youre not only ready for a wedding but for a marriage? Do you think that the same qualities that you have that made you completely shit on any promises you made to be faithful to her that made you repeatedly put your own needs before hers including exposing her to potential STDs condoms do not fully protect against STDs where other parts of your skin are touching like warts and HPV that make you afraid of communicating with her and make you hide who you really are... do you think those are the qualities of a good husband? Granted I dont know you but based on what you have said here the least selfish thing you could do is set her free to find someone who will actually honor her and treat her the way she deserves.

Basically he used money that you two earned together doing some deeply intimate stuff and then turned around and spent that coin on tipping which he told you from the getgo he never did. And then lied about it twice. TBH if this were me I would put my foot down that he could no longer visit these sites as he could it be trusted to be honest about his activities with you. An open webcam show is one thing but a private show is pretty intimate. Add in the fact he lied multiple times I just feel kind of icky about the whole situation.

This to me is one of the biggest turn offs because a youre only talking about yourself and b youre not showing interest in me.

1224538,0,t3_284bba,I dont see that theres anything you can do. Bringing it up will likely only drive a wedge between the two of you and cause drama since the boyfriend will probably hear about it. Also people tend to cling to relationships when other people dont approve of the match. It can cause a strong sense of bonding between the couple so you may just strengthen her resolve to stay with him.If youre truly determined you could privately express your concerns to her about the way he treats her. Use specific examples talk about how it makes you feel and why. Emphasize that shes your best friend and that you care deeply about her well being and happiness and only want the best for her. If your other friend wants to join you go for it but be careful not to seem like youre ganging up on her. Try not to be judgmental just caring and concerned.However after you talk to her dont be surprised if she pulls away from you. Once she knows that you dont approve of her boyfriend shell probably be less comfortable having you two around each other and it will be in the air between you afterward. This is one of those opinions that really cant be taken back once its been put out there so be really sure that youre ok risking damage to the friendship first.,relationship_advice,ci7dnca,2,t5_2r0cn
1225799,0,t3_284zgq,Wow... This woman is totally taking advantage of your affection for her. If she loved you there is no way she would treat you like this. People do not treat the individuals they love in this way. She has been caught more than once. These affairs are planned and carefully thought out. It sounds like the only thing she is upset about is getting caught. I would file for a divorce and full custody since you seem to be the more stable one.There were all kinds of red flags before you two even got together. The fact that she wont end things immediately with the other men she has talked to in the past says to me that she puts them ahead of you. That is no way to live in a marriage. The fact that the counselor wont even see you two anymore should say something as well. There are few cases in which someone whose entire job is to help fix things just gives up because there is no hope.  You enable her to continue to cheat and she will continue to walk all over you because youre a nice guy and think you can change her. You cant. You wont.The issue I worry about the most is what you are showing your children.  By staying and having her continue to cheat on you over and over in all likelihood introducing your children to these other men you are setting a relationship example for your children. You are supposed to exemplify what you want your children to see and know about relationships. So far its okay to cheat and lie to your partner just dont get caught. If you do get caught this is how you work on problems.  Kids are not stupid. They pick up on so much more than most people give them credit for. They see something is wrong and often times they dont understand it exactly and will blame it on themselves. Please dont do this to your children. You need to talk to a lawyer. You need to do what is best for you and your kids and get a divorce. Things are not going to change with your wife and if she isnt willing to really put in the effort to change then its just time to go. Sorry. Finally you need to look into some counseling for yourself. I am not sure if you have some self esteem issues or depression but not many people let this shit happen constantly without standing up for themselves.,relationship_advice,ci7ir3y,4,t5_2r0cn

1292302,0,t1_ciexmed,Oh ok sorry its more clear now. First does she have any desire to have a career or better herself? Dont worry about the hate from reddit or anyone. Ya you might be a jerk for thinking of your career first but thats just how you feel and you cant just change that its pretty normal too. I know a few kids of divorce and they can all agree that parents that separate and make a good effort and dont spite each other are better than ones the are together and dont work at all together. If you know for a fact that youll always live with regret if you dont go for this career then itll always come back to haunt you and always put strain on your relationships. So I say go for it but theres no easy way around it. If the relationship crumbles then so be it. You will lose a slight connection with the kids yes but you can make a huge effort by constantly visiting like every other weekend or whatnot. Talk to your partner and tell her youre not happy with yourself even if you might be with her and that you need to do this. If she understands enough to only be mad at you but still respect what the kids want then the kids will make the decision of whether to stay connected to you. But youre their father whether they like it or not youre going to be there for them no matter how much they resent you or want to be with you. You do not ever try to pull them between you and your wife though it seems like with your career she would take the kids for most of the time. You make it clear with your kids its not working out romantically but you will still be friends with each other. And dont give them any false hope that you might end up together again unless you really mean it. You tell them honestly that youre not happy with yourself too and that sometimes in life if youve done a lot for other peoples happiness then you have to do something for yourself to be happy. Whatever happens youll still show up to pick them up from school every once in a while and youll be there for every birthday and holiday. ,relationship_advice,cif019p,1,t5_2r0cn

Many are out between  hours and so blood tests are useless by the time someone comes to gets to a hospital and is blood tested..that evidence is gone.Also a rape kit is damn invasive and not fun to go through under any circumstances. I have no idea if his girlfriend cheated but I do know she is ripping out some of her pubes by the root having an extra invasive pelvic exam and swabs taken. Its pretty far to go just to convince a boyfriend she didnt cheat. People will do some wacky stuff either way.And holy shit I cant believe someone actually said there would be no lubrication if it was rape and the vagina would show it. Sure if it was forceful there would be tears but still lubrication. That also applies to rough consensual sex. Someone drugged or intoxicated to the point they cannot give consent isnt necessarily going to fight and thus no tearing.

One of my partners therapists pointed out in front of me that my partner is capable of more than he was doing.  I dont know how much you have read or heard fromDr. Temple Grandin but she insists that while folks on the spectrum have issues that need accomodation ie addressing overstimulation  bad behavior should not be tolerated.

If this thread was made by him it would readMy last girlfriend cheated on me and I ignored the signs because I trusted and loved her..etc. We break up and I meet a new girl. I went to the bar with my girlfriend and went to get us drinks. The line was long and I could spot her talking to a single guy while I was in line for  minutes she couldnt see me. I then approached them as she was giving him her number and he looked agitated and frightened upon meeting me. She introduced me and said he was just looking for new friends so I volunteered my number as well which he accepted before immediately darting off and leaving the bar. Me and my girlfriend try to talk but it escalated into a fight and she decided to sleep on the couch.

Okay lets listen to the CDC not livestrong.com and see what the people in charge of preventing public health crises have to saygtSTD screening tests are usually done for infections that can have serious outcomes if they are left untreated. For example finding and treating curable STDs like chlamydia can prevent those infections from leading to serious complications such as infertility the inability to get pregnant in women. Genital herpes infections can cause intermittent symptoms that may be uncomfortable but infection does not usually result in serious complications in healthy adults.Essentially the CDCs position is that routine testing is likely to leave millions of people who have no symptoms with the psychological stigma associated with HSV which is worse than having HSV itself for those people. gtGo fuck yourself for calling me a moron.If you kiss anybody without assuming they have HSV youre a moron.

Over in rbestof theres a post where a woman posted in the subreddit for quitting smoking under her fathers username  he had died a few days ago from lung cancer and she was giving encouragement to everyone else to keep trying to quit. To some people smoking is more than just a shitty habit and it may be much more than a bugaboo to him.

You cant expect to drop your feelings and just be friends but maybe after some time has gone by if its a friendship you truly want to pursue than it may be possible. I would take time to focus on yourself you say youre having issues you need to work through and that should be your top priority. Take the time to pick yourself up and back on track.

If you have a willing and enthusiastic partner and you just need to work on learning how to please each other better thats always something that can get better.

Ive seen it a hundred times two people get along great love each other have trust and caring but their sex life is terrible or non existent. This almost always leaks into other areas and builds resentment. People underestimate how important sex is in a relationship.

You can learn to cope with that and move on or you can fixate and self destruct.

He may care that you are uncomfortable but that WILL NOT stop him whacking it to anything he comes across.  accept it and deal or fixate and self destruct.He sucks at communicating  A lot of guys do.  This is the one that is actually important and correctable ... so demand improvement but understand he may have a past that gets in his way.   Start with asking how he feels and what he likes and work up slowly ... dont pry and dont demand ... just make sure that you have scheduled intimacy practicing sessions.

I would be fine with never going on a trip with him if it needed to happen but he is insistant and I enjoy them.

1600964,0,t1_cjgydrr,He never said he wanted them to be a part of it though he just said that his family is mad that the sisters werent asked probably because they just assumed theyd be able to insert themselves into the wedding which is super rude and inappropriate since its not the familys wedding its the couples. If OP had actually said that it was important to him that his sisters be bridesmaids that would be different though he could have groomswomen just as easily without forcing his fiancee to pretend to be close to his sisters. It sounds to me like he just wants the number of bridesmaids and groomsmen to be even and to not deal with his pissed off family members. ,relationship_advice,cjgyy7d,36,t5_2r0cn

1601619,0,t1_cjgf65b,Ok here goes chronologicallyMisunderstanding  Early in my and my gfs relationship my ex asked to do a catchup lunch with me since we hadnt seen each other or talked in a while and had an amicable break up.  I asked my current gf if she was ok with that she said sure thats fine so I went.  Nothing bad happened except I couldnt bring myself to put my ex on the spot and tell her in person that I was now dating someone else.  Instead I sent her an email afterward telling her same day which she could read and react to in privacy more humane in my mind at the time but it was a mistke.  This weakness displayed toward my ex made my gf really upset.Misunderstanding  My gf feels every time we visit roughly once per month I get a text from my ex which I never try to hide or be cryptic about so my gf confludes my ex and I talk all the time even when my gfs not around which she feels is behind her back she even manages to convince me I must have been talking to my ex more frequently than even I thought though I still think it may have been largely coincidental and feel like my ex and I texted at most a couple times per month.  The texts were also very surface level and superficial nothing personal or meaningful never initiated by me and never went past a single reply.  So gf freaks out because she feels like Ive been communicating behind her back and she mandates that I sever all communication with my ex and that she doesnt want to have to deal with my ex ever again and I should just handle that problem and not involve her.Misunderstanding  A month or so later my ex sends me an email about how hurt she is that she and I had been ok as friends but then I was so cold and cut her off completely.  Im an idiot and misinterpret my gfs previous you should just handle that problem without having to involve me statement and I reply to my exs email to give her better closure and explain the situation more completely  be less cold about it.  It works and my ex hasnt contacted me since but my gf freaked out because I replied after she told me to sever all communication.Misunderstanding  I went to visit my gf whos doing grad school at my undergrad which was the same undergrad my ex went to with me.  I visit for an annual weekend event the school hosts and invites alumni back for double win for me  get to visit gf and see friends.  Unbeknownst to me my ex also goes back for the same event.  My gf and I bump into my ex nothing more than hi was said.  My gf freaks out and feels like she cant escape from my ex whos invading our lives  relationship and is miserable for most of the rest of the weekend.Each misunderstandings freak out resulted either in a temporary breakup between me and my gf or a very near breakup.  I should add that I dont think I need help understanding why my gf is so sensitive regarding my ex.  What I need help with is understanding if  how I should try to appease her demands that I never interact with my ex indirectly equivalent to saying I cant go to any events with friends if my ex might show up given all our mutual friends without being stressed  miserable myself.  Or if this is just a tragic situation where things are now broken and theres no real fix.  Sorry for the delayed reply Im busier during the week.  I really appreciate your taking the time to fully understand the situation.  Let me know if I should provide any other background info.,relationship_advice,cjh1x74,1,t5_2r0cn

1645742,0,t3_2d6ej1,Ok  so here are concrete steps to take. Do them one by one. First things first Divorce lawyers usually offer a free consultation. Go to one and talk about the situation and your finances and see what they say. Talk about costs as well.Second Give your wife an ultimatum  go into therapy and couples counseling or you will seek divorce. Then actually try to work on things for a defined period of time. This will trigger a huge series of events one way or the other  but at least you can say you tried. And for the sake of your child she needs to get her shit together.Third Separate your finances as much as you can. Get your own bank account. Call all of your creditors and work out payment plans with them. Most creditors dont want you to default so they will work with you. Close all of the credit cards that are in your name or your names jointly. Deposit a weekly allowance into her bank account so she has some spending money. Then go to rfrugal and figure out how to cut everything else back to the bone.Fourth Considering declaring bankruptcy. Fifth If counseling doesnt work out go for primary custody with frequent visitation not  custody. Unless theres something youre not telling us theres no reason she shouldnt have some custody and its better for your kid to see her once a week or whatever than not at all.Dont let anyone deter you or tell you you cant get primary custody. Most of the time when they pursue it fathers get custody. The problem is fathers are often discouraged from doing that and just agree to whatever the mediatormother wants because they think they dont have a choice. You do. Fight for your kid if you have to.Good luck. You have a long hard road ahead of you.,relationship_advice,cjmly9w,1,t5_2r0cn

Generally people will be on their best behavior at first but once they become more comfortable around you you will begin to see the flags on the field. Just keep you eyes open and trust your gut. As for the binge drinking lots of girls will get drunk occasionally and it isnt a huge problem in of itself. But it can become a problem depending on how she behaves while drunk. Some people will get drunk do stupid shit then blame their actions on the alcohol. Dont let that kinda shit fly. If she can hold her liquor well and not become blackout drunk falling over or hooking up with other guys while intoxicated there shouldnt be a problem. As for the history of abuse as long as its not causing any significant problems in your relationship it may not be an issue. If shes gotten therapy or some kind of help to deal with those issues it could all just be in the past.Just make sure you dont fall into the trap of feeling like you have to fix her.

1789000,0,t1_ck4myeh,If you two are hanging out and communicating most of every day since the break up youre becoming emotionally reliant on each other. Particularly her on you.Even in a relationship thats not necessarily a good thing. As we move through life we rely on our emotional support network in times of strain. Hell even in day to day life when we have bad days we reach out to that support network which is comprised of friends family and romantic partners. In this case where your close friend is starting to also tread the line into romantic partner you can see how this starts to become you each putting all your eggs in the one basket. Your main source of emotional support and fulfilment becomes this one other person. What happens when its that person that hurts you? You have no one to turn to. You ever wonder why some couples who break up keep doing the stupid thing of talking to each other? Its because their recent ex is so entwined in their support network that they dont have a proper contingency fallback e.g. other friends family to go to.Even if its not so dramatic as a breakup if your sole dominant source of emotional fulfillment is this girl and vice versa you will become reliant to the point where you will be unhappy when she isnt around. Ive lived that and its fucking awful.So.. what can you do? Its a really hard question. If I told you to not see or talk to her as much youd still think about her and youd both hurt. So I wont say that exactly. But I will say this fill your time with other people and other activities. Be mindful of how much attention you assign to her each day. Dont let her become the central figure of your emotional landscape. Im not talking in relationship terms now just day to day. If you get to a point where following that advice keeping in touch with other friends maintaining that broad range of people and activities starts making her feel could make her feel that youre pulling away be explicit. i.e. say to her that you enjoy having her around but you are also worried about being too dependent on her and her being too dependent on you so youre keeping busy. dont just fade away!Sorry for the long response but you are in a tricky spot and anyone who can respond in less than  words is probably oversimplifying.,relationship_advice,ck4nlgi,1,t5_2r0cn

So I understand how hard this would be for you.  But you honestly cant help someone who doesnt want to help themselves and by what youve described he seems content with his self destructive behavior.  And he doesnt seem to have any real care for your feelings on the issue he will do what he wants to do because he sees it as his right.   Show him that you will stand by your word and maybe take time away from him without much contact and see how he reacts.  But be cautious always a real addict will say anything and do anything to keep doing drugs.  He may promise to be clean but is really just hiding his use from you.  Overall I think if he wont take you or his health seriously there isnt much you can do other than look out for yourself.  Maybe just be his friend until he gets help if he ever does.

I was with a girl that cheated on one of her past partners.  While she didnt cheat on me to my knowledge she did do other stuff behind my back that I was NOT ok with.  Basically find out the situations that lead to this if she is ok with talking about it.  Find out if she gets kissy when she is drinking or partying.  Find out if she has done it to get something.  If she did it just because she wanted to and enjoyed it well then you need to know if YOU are fine with that.  Lastly with all that experience she should be a really good kisser so enjoy that much of it.  People saying that you just need to get over it are silly.  This is a potential relationship for you and her.  If there is something that is really bothering you it needs to be addressed.  Dont just leave it in the dark and tiptoe around it.

It does not sound like he is cut off from his feelings more like he wants you to make him happy without telling you how.  However a change in personality does seem to indicate he may be ill.  What does his family think?  You might suggest couples counseling.  And if he refuses you may need to take a step back and think what you really feel your responsibility is to yourself as well as to him.  If he is accusing you of standing in his way of doing what he wants it may be worth getting out of the way and seeing what happens.,relationship_advice,ckg75mw,1,t5_2r0cn

1894275,0,t1_ckhfnwx, Thank you very much Ocelot. Your words have really given me a ray of hope in knowing that Im not losing my mind. Sometimes I think that I am going crazy becomign sexist or racist like I said earlier. But theyre just thoguhts not actions. I suppose that I wasam just heart broken. Not over girls encessarily. But over the dream that I was promised as a kid but that for the most part doesnt actually exist for me or people like us. And yeah I thought about moving hence why I decided to go into physics move back to my parents land in Africa and become a teacher. That would be nice. My heart does struggle with wanting to believe and see the equality and good in people that our politicians talks about so often in the west. But...it is very difficult to see it a lot of the times. Before I head off to work here though do you mind if I ask if you are Chinese Asian? Because you mentioned the mainland and HK so I assume you are. But I dont want to guess. The reason I ask is because I find it interesting that you seem to do a lot better over there than here. Well by interesting I mean disheartening. ,relationship_advice,ckhg884,2,t5_2r0cn

I dont think its as simple as you two are just totally incompatible. Maybe you are maybe not. Of course everyone wants a relationship where everything is easy but is that reality? I dont think so. I think she just wants you to put a little more effort into remembering things like that. If tentative plans makes it hard for you to remember make more solid plans. Stuff like that. I think you should be willing to adapt to your partner but she should also feel the same way. Maybe talk to her about that. Tell her that youll try to not be so forgetful and that you really do want to do things you just have a slightly different way of showing it. And the same goes for her she should be able to adapt to you if you happen to forget plans she shouldnt automatically be mad at you. But be careful because things build up over time. If you keep forgetting shell still get mad. Itll seem like youre not putting in enough effort. ,relationship_advice,ckhl5pi,2,t5_2r0cn

In my case my partner was very articulate and intelligent and I was not so I couldnt have a logical argument to point out that the person was wrong even though I felt it was wrong.  In others cases the abused was too tired to do it.I kept a journal because back then I didnt think to go on the internet to ask Am I crazy?

You dont make it clear in your post is your boyfriend ok with you playing with other men to get that need met? It sounds like it is but itd be great to know for sure. Building off  our romantic partners cannot fill every single need that we have. Thats just a truth. In both sexual AND nonsexual contexts. You likely have hobbies and interests that the other doesnt share. You need to look to an external source subreddits friends whatever to get those met. Sex kink is no different. If your boyfriend isnt actually a switch and you guys taking turns between you as dom isnt cutting it you may just have to accept that he can only meet this need by allowing you to get it met with other people. It sounds like hes genuinely tried and just cant do it. Thats all you can ask. Bonus point you dont mention how HE feels about the sexual side of things between you.

1912906,0,t3_2gjaxw,Well the relationship is new. When people are your friends and claim to warn you about this stuff its hard to ignore. She would need to step up and not let other people dictate the relationship from the outside.As for the drug thing maybe she wanted to bring it up without outright asking so are you a former cokehead?. As for the condoms not sure why shed lie about it. Unless she was trying to get knocked up but if she found some later on somewhere in her apartment but didnt want to look for em spur of the moment then its prolly a truth. Not sure why she wouldnt be prepared ahead of time though.She wasnt direct I dont think itd make her a liar. Have a discussion with her that if she wants to know something she should ask you directly instead of hearing it through the grapevine where words and truths are bound to be twisted.Its rough dating with a seedy past even tougher when theres whispers of people who knew you prior to the start of this new relationship.

She needs to think long and hard about the family business  does she think she can work with her father knowing this about him? Does she think she can compartmentalize enough to do that for the long term? I mean  years is a very long time to hang in there with someone you no longer respect. I understand how hard that can be  my family has a business and I worked there for several years. I couldnt take the mixing of family business with work business after a while. My brother on the other hand stuck it out and is in the midst of taking over. I am in a corporate job making a lot less money than I could be but I am much happier without all of that drama.Your girlfriend can learn how to run a business from a million people  it doesnt have to be her dad. She can start her own business even. The fact that she comes from an entrepreneurial family gives her an edge there  she knows it can be done. She knows its a suckers game to work for other people. Its in her DNA. The hardest part of starting your own business is getting over the fear of taking the risk.Thats just to say that she IS NOT trapped. ,relationship_advice,ckqxg2l,1,t5_2r0cn

2002146,0,t1_ckudlwi,I agree with you that the issue is more her reacting to the two of them drifting apart. My suspicions are that she does want to date other people and has already checked out of the relationship whether shes willing admit it to OP or even herself yet.Theyre both still young and it sounds like they dont have a lot of experience dating other people. She sounds very immature and needs to grow as person before committing to marriage IMO. Her focus on the ceremony of becoming married is more important to her than the marriage itself which is incredibly shortsighted but it could be a redherring and shes really just having second thoughts about going through with it at all. I think shes dissatisfied with other aspects of the relationship so the proposal is a convenient peg to hang her unhappiness on which is ridiculous because the proposal was picture perfect!I definitely think OP should call off the engagement take the break and date other people. From what OP has written their values are incompatible and marriage right now would be a disaster  an expensive disaster.,relationship_advice,ckughnf,5,t5_2r0cn
2002680,0,t1_ckui9a3,Sometimes you gotta listen to man that loves you as opposed to fighting him. Ive noticed a pattern in my own life as well as my friends with their SOs and compliments.   Why would he want to compliment you when your response is to give him the third degree about it ?  Guys want their women to feel good and not upset them. So why would he do something that so obviously upsets you?Do you really believe he doesnt think youre beautiful inside and out? Or do you think your insecurity has worn him down to where he might feel that it is futile to compliment you?  Like I said Ive struggled with this in my own life.  Im classically beautiful and not overweight. Sure a little fat here and there but thats about it. But my own self esteem drove men away and the compliments away because instead of trusting them or accepting that that man thought I was beautiful by whatever means internal external both neither whatever I said no im not pretty or deflected it  which made my partners stop me then in turn made me feel worse and the cycled continued. Unless you can accept and trust your partners words nothing will change. I had to learn to accept and trust and I worked on me. I hate that my arms are fat enough to need the next shirt size up even though my boobs are so flat that its just baggy so I decided to change that.

2045571,0,t3_2i7u9t,Dont fall for it.  Given the statistics surrounding divorce you and your future financial well being clearly are at risk.I have a cousin who genuinely is a good guy.  He has now been divorced three times all to women who seemed solid at the beginning but all of whom engaged in bad or erratic behavior eventually.  For example his first wife ended up being a pill addict as a result of an accident premarriage and was burglarizing the neighbors homes for cash to pay for her addiction.  I met the lady at their wedding  she acted completely normal.  Yet five years later the police showed up at my cousins home to take her away. Now at age  and three divorces later my cousin has perhaps  to his name saved for his retirement.  The three exwives looted everything he had saved.  Yea no fault!If there are things giving you concerns like her inability to live within her means or reckless foolhardy shopping patterns it is better to be safe than sorry.A final thought there is published research that has shown that the more promiscuous a woman is before marriage the more likely divorce is.  The results were statistically  significant.  If your fiance has had  or more sexual partners the research shows a c.  chance of divorce. Four or fewer partners?  A c.  chance of divorce.  ,relationship_advice,ckzu5mj,0,t5_2r0cn

Im glad you said that I did nothing wrong because I wasnt sure if I handled it correctly. I was worried if I didnt shown enough care. However if I did I dont think I would be able to accomplish my initial goal of showing Alice that it couldnt work between us. It would just make things harder for her if I was too kind while still acting disinterested. On a separate note Sarah not her real name sent me a text asking about a class that I took which she is currently taking. I am also taking a class that she already took so we decided that we can help each other out by exchanging notes and other materials. Tomorrow we are going to meet in my lab to study together.

That sucks.I have less than a month until the girl I am seeing leaves.  In my case I actually do know shes really into me.

We just may have not have enough time yet that things could survive a  month break though.  When I think about whats coming I think that maybe ending things would be easier in the long run.     My instincts are telling me the circumstances just might not work.  But as I get older time flies by.  Ill give it a shot with the understanding that if she doesnt feel she can put the effort in at any point to be honest and tell me.Sorry for my own babbling on the topic.  Oddly enough you are the only person I have talked to about this lol.   She and I have only been together a few months and shes only met a few of my friends.

They are presenting what they are currently capable of in a relationship but it sounds like you quite rightly need more. Its up to you you could say Look I really need to have a serious talk with you its really important to me. and go forth and explain your needs from a relationship or you can put up with it sounds like you dont want to do that anymore or you can cut it off. Neither option is easy and all may lead you to the same end ultimately. If they respect you and want to be with you they will at least listen to what you have to say.

2224535,0,t3_2kkjly,Get her to speak with a doctor.Her alcoholism is probably damaging her health and would not be helping with her depression or her anxiety as it dehydrates the brain and can cause korsakoffs due to the lack of thiamine. Women are more susceptible to the physical decline with alcoholism. Not to mention the damage to the fetus is she is pregnant.Does she have times when she is sober because you really need to sit her down and explain all these issues to her because the effects of alcoholism can rarely be reversed and alcohol withdrawal can kill her.I dont think either of you should be in this relationship although I think you should attempt to get her to agree to some form of treatment for her issues. The relationship appears too toxic for you to continue.,relationship_advice,clmlbox,1,t5_2r0cn
2225001,0,t3_2kkyvu,This is going to sound terrible but here is what I would do if I were you  set it up so that when you do break up with her she has no one but herself to blame. If you were to end it with her right here and now she would probably lose her shit right? Shed try and explain how hard it is to find a job call you an asshole for kicking her out with no place to go the phrases how could you do this to me and I hate you would be thrown around etc. So start by having a conversation about her job situation. Sit her down and tell her in the nicest most polite way possible that her unemployment is becoming a significant burden on you. Shell get defensive and tell you how hard shes trying so the next step is to offer her help. Offer to help with her resume or cover letters offer to pay for her to see a career counselor. Set deadlines by this date she has to do X Y and Z whether it be have an interview or  lined up see the career counselor etc. Broach the subject of taking a job that isnt in her field or one that shes overqualified for because at least its something. What youre doing here is giving her every opportunity to fix the problem. You need her to contribute so see how willing she is to do that. If the deadline comes and goes with no significant changes broach the subject again. Reiterate how much you need her to pull her own weight ask her what shes done differently since the last time you talked about it ask her what shes doing to network and market herself and her skills. If that point nothing has changed but youre still together have the do or die conversation. Tell her you cannot under any circumstances continue like this and if she doesnt do A B and C by X date shes going to have to find a new place to live. If she loves you and is willing to work on the relationship you will see that. Its possible that her getting her shit together will make you respect her more and you wont want to break up with her. If she gets a job and you still want to end it at least now she has a way of supporting herself. If its clear that shes not willing to do anything to contribute to your collective future end it and tell her why because you gave her every opportunity to find a job you offered to help and she refused you gave her suggestions and she ignored them youve had this conversation  times already she promised things would change and they havent. She failed. Obviously this is a very rough outline of what I would do and its not guaranteed that any or all of it will work. And if I may just say one thing about her parents while its nice that theyve helped and they like you you owe them NOTHING. Everything they contributed was because their daughter was living with you. If you feel like its the right thing to do give the furniture back or pay them for it. Good luck dude. ,relationship_advice,clmngim,1,t5_2r0cn

At the office Christmas party last year she walked up to us didnt even introduce herself to me and proceeded to pretend I wasnt standing in front of her while she chatted up my SO.   Heres what I did.  In situations like that the best way to go is to kill them with kindness.  Impose yourself into the conversations not in a confrontational way just be interested in her.  If her intentions were to make this encounter awkward for YOU flip the script on that shit.  How long has she been in this field?  Does she like the companyschool?  Is she seeing anyone because you are all about double dates.  The attitude you want to convey is authentic interest Come on chick get to know me!  This dude is a two for one deal.  Make her get to know you so if there was any shady intentions on her part youre not just an other she can distance herself from to evade a sense of  guilt.  That way youre not being the irrational jealous wife.  Youre an engaged partner.  Your husband wants you guys to hang out anyway.  Do it!  Get excited about it.

2232082,0,t3_2kou6v,Im sure if his ex read a correspondence between the two of you shed say the same thing....he never acted that way around me youre soooo luckyLike notevenapro said every interpersonal relationship is a unique everchanging dynamic organism.  You can never compare one to another.  This is like siblings complaining to their parents that one of the kids is the favorite.  Everybody treats everyone else differently and uniquely.  You happened to stumble upon a correspondence that from your perspective contains communication that you feel is lacking in your relationship. Did you stop to consider that perhaps the reason why hes less open now is because of how badly he feels burned by her?  We base all current relationships on our knowledge of the past tempered by our hopes for the future.  Obviously they didnt work out.  He treats you differently because he believes something he did with her caused it to not work out and he doesnt want to make the same mistake with you.This is why you should never snoop.  We can gain information but information without context so much more damaging than no information at all.if you want information from him you should always go directly to him.

He was going to borrow his dads car to meet up and he texted me asking if I was free but Id already gone back home. And then he said we should definitely hang out. If he didnt want to he probably wouldve never gotten to borrow his dads car. The next time I asked if he was free he was at some festival but he said see you soon soooooo..

Since those conversations shes seen a therapist for other things but it may be a good idea for her to see one again for the road rage.I do want to reiterate that the rage that she has when shes driving is completely out of character for her day to day behavior.  She is consistently unnecessarily frustrated when shes driving but she does not get that upset when shes a passenger and she certainly does not behave like that in any other situations.I think that there is some narcissistic tendencies to her road rage.  It is entirely from her thinking that people are driving wrong and not following the rules of the road like dont stay in the left lane when youre going slower than traffic behind you.

2354052,0,t1_cm2mfvc,Thanks for your thoughts I appreciate it. I agree that its probably impossible for somebody to truly love someone theyve only met twice but thats not the case here I should have phrased that a bit differentlyWhen we first met we spent about  hours together and then she flew home. But when she visited my current city we spent time together close to daily for a couple months and she asked to stay with me at my apartment for her last week or so before she flew back home. We went on plenty of dates and the vast majority of the time we were hanging out together for those couple months it was just us. Weve talked on the phone for countless hours and we both know each other very very well horrible dark secrets personality flaws weakness and all. Im not infatuated with her  Im sure of that  Im familiar with infatuation. Ive had relationships in the past which were borne of infatuation and have recognized them as such. Ive also thought I loved girls before and realized that wait I dont really love this person for who they are... I love this idealized version of them but when Im honest with myself and think about their flaws and issues realize that those flaws repulse me and Im just infatuated and want to love a version of them that doesnt exist. I could never have truly loved those girls for who they were. Ive only had one other relationship in which I truly loved a girl. This is quite different from infatuation... As Ive gotten to know her better Ive gotten to really understand who she is  Im not obsessing over an idealized version of this girl like I have in the past  I do love her for who she is including her flaws. In fact weve both been able to make progress and improve ourselves fix to some degree some of our flaws by having straight honest discussions about them offering our perspective of each others problems. I love her as a dear friend platonically and also romantically. Our friendship has for a while now been deeper and more meaningful and impactful in my life than any other friendship Ive had.Even if you dont agree with me here regarding love vs infatuation please humor me  how do I tell her of my feelings whatever they are without jeopardizing our friendship?

2475164,0,t3_2nw74d,Ah the sex hump of age. Her testosterone has gone up and your interest has waned over the years from a possible number of reasons that most likely stem towards your wife. I think its perfectly reasonable that youve lost interest because why would someone keep trying when they got shot down. That said shes probably coming into knowing understanding feeling better about herself sexually. Its just out of sync. The simplest advice tell her as calmly and easily as possible After x amount of years excuses being shut down and coming to expect sex as infrequent if nonexistent combined with the rigors of everyday life. I appreciate your sudden reinterest in sex but itll take me that many years and several more to recover from  years of conditioning. Yes you could help her out by talking about fantasies over tea or food when you feel like its appropriate since she now seems obsessed about it. And yeah you could introduce her to things you like and the stuff youve seen in porn before that youd like to have done to you could be because the kids are gone or you could even try going the kinky route in an effort to feel powerful and in control since you have years of rapport and knowing each other. But at the end of the day you will have to communicate your feelingsemotionsand everyday experiences in a way she could understand and relate to. Just because she suddenly gained an interest in sex doesnt change how your views changed in reaction to hers. Which in and of itself is a discussion of its own. Short version Skip the porn for a month see if that changes things any up the amount of physical exercise so you have more testosterone in your body in general try and relate back and do some of the things you used to do when you initially got together you have a different woman in front of you now than you did  years ago and give it a chance try to voluntarily see her as the woman you once did or explore other aspects of the relationship youd have liked to have tried out.

But not helping around the apartment and giving you a hard time is horseshit. So is that last comment. It sounds like he prefers a life of malaise. Unlike many others I dont think that there is anything inherently wrong with being lazy but I do think its an incompatibility with someone who wants more.It sounds like he cant handle stress but the conversation you need to have with him is stressful. Therefore you must find a nonstressful way to relate your feelings to him. I would recommend writing him a letter hand it to him when youre leaving and tell him that you would really like him to read it and take it seriously I dont recommend just leaving it without saying something he may feel ambushed or overwhelmed. Then you can articulate exactly whats bothering you. Tell him youd like to talk about it later in person so he has some time to think over the things youve said.Finally dont lower your expectations. Youd be giving him a little rope with this gesture so dont let him hang you with it!

If the intention is to betray ones partner a kiss can resemble the breaking of a trust in one scenario but be totally harmless in another. Where the line goes is up for you to define together. I would say porn isnt a problem in general it is a part of his sexual fantasies which he is entitled to just as you are to yours. However he shows sign of having clear control issues and so do you though not at the same level and you should seek counselling. I am happy to elaborate if you want me too but the advise stays the same. Seek therapy for yourselves or as a couple. His control issues flag him for being reluctant to the idea of therapy and if so you need to make him understand that it is vital for estabeling trust in your marriage.

If she cant empathize with your family and financial situation shes probably not going to see your issue with her from your point of view.

You dont need to break up because the engagement is on hold its perfectly fine to date each other for a bit since it seems you skipped that part but she might be realizing that this isnt the relationship for her. Talking it out is the only way to know. ,relationship_advice,cmqtbbb,2,t5_2r0cn
2546161,0,t3_2oueef,The advice on here so far is horrible.It is fine to be uncomfortable. The fact that your boyfriend was thoughtful enough to ask you before he committed to living with his friend should be reassuring.That said good room mates are hard to find. Over the years I have lived with many room mates of both genders and not once has a relationship developed between myself and my room mates or even between themselves. Do you seriously expect both you and your boyfriend to only have same gendered room mates?  That is quite onerous. Trust your boyfriend. He is with you because he wants to be. Who his room mate is wont change that. But let him know about your discomfort so that he can be sensitive to it and be there to reassure you when you may need it.,relationship_advice,cmqx4s3,2,t5_2r0cn
2546560,0,t3_2ovpys,You do have a right to be angry and hurt but... so does he. Hes sucking at what to do with that apparently but the feelings legit.Not specifically at you of course you cant be expected to have a romantic relationship with someone you dont want to but in general. For many guys winding up to let someone know youre interested like that is a commitment unto itself sticking your neck out. So its not just egosting when the intended doesnt feel the same way.BUT Im with you on the insistence part. If Im understanding you he didnt just ask once hes just keeping at it with additional arguments? Thats some bullshit. He does have the right to ask he does have the right to feel badly about it when you said no. What he doesnt have is the right to keep asking as if its a negotiation. Speaking from experience its best to take a little alone time after this sort of thing happens He was all ready to think of you in a different way now if he wants to stay your friend hell have to learn to think of you in another different way. And youre still adjusting to all that and if you still want to be his friend you should take some time to process what happened and find a new place to move on from.  If he sincerely cant think of you as anything but a potential romantic partner now? Its acceptable for him to feel that way. It sucks but he feels like he feels it may be that its no more likely that you can talk him out of those feelings than he could talk you into them. But it might also given time settle down a little as the moment subsides and he remembers what hes missing. Theres nobody necessarily at fault for that. It just happens sometimes. However if as is the impression Im getting hes holding his friendship up like a bargaining chip? Thats not really the action of a friend Id want. Nor would that sort of gameplaying be something Id want in an SO. If you can tell him that you should. ,relationship_advice,cmqz0hn,2,t5_2r0cn

2554471,0,t1_cmrzgr7,gtYour feelings arent caused by me? What sort of ridiculous existentialist bullshit are you reading?If they were caused by you they wouldnt be called MY feelings now would they? You can call me names but depending on how I interpret that determines how I feel about it. If I care about your opinion Id internalize them and feel hurt. If I dont give a shit about your opinion it wouldnt affect me at all. The control as to whether I am hurt or not is not your words but my interpretation of them.gtIf you spend your life moulding your emotions to match someone elses views youre going to be miserable and have to deal with all sorts of issues. What are you talking about? Apparently my point went completely over your head. You dont mold your emotions to match someone elses views... You examine which reactions of yours are warranted and which ones just cause needless suffering. And you work on the reactions which cause needless suffering.  For example If someone has a fear of tigers thats understandable if someone has a crippling fear of copper pennies that is a reaction you should work on curbing as it has no basis in reality. gtPeople are allowed to have viewsfeelingemotionswhatever that dont match yours.Yeah absolutely. I never suggested otherwise. The point is to selfmaintain those feelings so that they dont cause you unnecessary suffering. gtIf he was posting saying I cant take the fact that my girlfriend isnt a virgin maybe youd have a point. He essentially posted I cant take the fact that my girlfriend isnt a virgin and has had friends with benefits in the past.

As a person who was married to a verbally and emotionally abusive man I can assure you there is a very high possibility that this is exactly what happened verbatim. If I had a single dollar for every conversation I had with my ex where I was calm collected logical and reasonable in my words while he was screaming about trivial bullshit I would be a millionaire. The thing you have to understand about being in a relationship like this is that you LEARN to approach every single discussionargument like this. You LEARN to never ever raise your voice. You LEARN to respond to every crazy thing your SO says with only carefully modulated and wellthought out calm rational responses. You LEARN that even what seems like the simplest discussion about the most asinine thing WILL turn into him or her just for me it was a him losing his shit and verbally berating you and possibly physically touching you in a harmful way wiping off OPs makeup after being asked to stop.What OP has described is basically text book when it comes to interacting with a person like this.  ,relationship_advice,cms9zk5,2,t5_2r0cn

Beyond that he does not have a right to your thoughts and feelings and you should share them as and when you feel that you want him to know.  If there are things you want to tell him but dont know how there are a couple of methods to make things easier.   Is to write it down in a short letter or note.   is to set aside a regular time maybe when you sit down have some coffee and each of you shares something on your mind.  You can start with mainly with quite small things and the occasional more weighty one and as you get used tot it it will be easier. If he feels like he is forcing you to talk he should take that as a sign to back off. Also it is important that is you share something difficult for him to hear. that he not get angry or hurt as that will simply shut down your future interest in sharing.,relationship_advice,cmv2fad,1,t5_2r0cn

She can say I appreciate how you feel but I am not willing to get involved with you romantically WITHOUT ending your friendship.. To whom exactly is the age thing an issue?  The obvious answer is YOU.  You said you want a relationship with her.  If thats the case what does her age have anything to do with it?  What is it about her age that gives you pause?  Are you just afraid of how it will be perceived by others?  If so then you are probably not ready for this relationship.  Age is a number and if you really care for her should be no barrier.Now the hard part  your job.  You should try and find out about company rules.  If she wanted to have a relationship with you you could try transferring departments your company might not mind or you guys can keep your relationship a secret but be careful.Once you consider that you should absolutely tell her how you feel.

2610231,0,t3_2pr5p5,You are going to have to be very careful for your own best interest and health how you frame this friendship. Because you feel you are becoming too attached to her romantically you will need to change the context in which you interact with her to one that cant promote romance or give you false hope. Need to have a heart to heart with someone about something serious? It cant be her  opening up to her like that would cement her as a pillar of trust and confidence and emotional support that you cant start needing from her. Need someone to go with you just as friends to that amusement park or that concert or god forbid that wedding? Nope. Dont create romantic memories with her youll only torture yourself. Hang out in groups. Have lunch with her. Work on a school project together. In daylight. In public under strong lights. I know that sounds petty but you dont want to treat her like a girlfriend or youll keep wanting her to be one. In the meantime develop friendships outside of her. Talk to lots of people give lots of people a chance to get close to you. When you havent had a relationship yet its difficult to let things progress organically and you can easily latch onto one person and try to force a square peg into a round hole  thats not exclusive to you everybody does this when theyre inexperienced. But getting to know lots of kinds of people will show you that whether as romantic partners or friends or colleagues lots of people can be good for you and make you happy not just her. And your life will be full and diverse and entertaining and you wont be unhappy alone. This will eventually free you up emotionally to be her friend without wanting too much from her. Hang in there. And dont cave to the siren song of an imagined love with this girl  she might be great she might be terrible she might be anything under the sun as a girlfriend but you are not going to find out so dont waste your life dreaming and dont encroach on her happiness with someone else. Remind yourself that its good to have met her but the world is full of similarly awesome people that deserve your attention and any number of them might be better suited to love you back. ,relationship_advice,cmzamc3,6,t5_2r0cn

What makes it harder for me is that I had the chance to take one of his summer fling girls she was asking to go somewhere quieter with me and I didnt do it out of respect to him. So I feel a bit betrayed.Ive been pretty much set on the idea  that the girl is not worth my friendship so Im glad we agree there. I also agree that ignoring her was petty.Also I tried to resolve  understand her side of the situation at a party not the best setting I know but where else would I see her at that point? She gave me nonanswer answers and gave off a disinterested nonverbal cues. During the end of summer she texted me twice around am saying I have a problem with you we need to talk now. which I would ignore and then I would receive a follow up text saying how it was Rude of her to do that and she was just angry... which I also ignored.

I also have exes that are just friends. There are many good memories and they are often amazing people who for one reason or another werent the person Im going to be with.I would recommend ignoring the advice to talk to him just because it makes you feel uncomfortable. I think what you should do is think the problem out dont feel the problem out. Do you want to be in a relationship where you have the potential to be hurt? Of course you do thats a relationship. Do you trust your boyfriend? Apparently only so far.If I was in your situation I would let it go. I might ask that he at least delete his search history. Its not a problem that you talk to your exes in the capacity you do I talk weird sometimes I guess but thats how I would word it. I trust you and I want to know if youre talking to them more than you are now but seeing their names in your searches sets up all sorts of jealousy that I have to force back down and itd be easier for me if youd delete you search history with regularity not just when you search for exes. I dont want to tell you what to do just respect that I reasonably handle difficult emotions and you can prevent them from occurring at all. Besides lets pretend hes missing his exes. Lets pretend that its more than just good memories and good people. Have you thought about other women? What is he going to say? Sure. If hes looking them up with a plan hes not going to go offplan just because you have a suspicion. You got this. Invest in your relationship offer some trust. If it works AWESOME. Your relationship is stronger! If it doesnt you did it right and can bring that mentality to somebody who deserves it.I cant emphasize enough Take your feelings and think about them. Dont just Feel and then throw feels out there. He cant reason with feelings and shouldnt have to. He can reason with what you think though even if hes wrong.

2657178,0,t1_cn56v1n,Yes but the woman is taking a risk by taking time of work to have your child. She contributes to the household and the care of your children and puts her career back years. So if the marriage does end her financial prospects are slim while you had the benefit of a child carer housemaid etc while still building your career and you begrudge the women needing support to get back on her feet? I always believe in  shared custody and I guess where I live that is generally the preferred option but its ridiculous to assume its the man that is taking all the risk and how dare a woman want to be compensated for the years she gave you to help her get back on her feet. I dont believe in alimony forever I believe if a woman gives up her career to care for the children and household then she should be entitled to some support to get back on her feet. As she is saving the family and you money in childcare and housemaid services. But I guess I was lucky. By the time I went through a divorce I was back in a career I was actually expected to be primary carer and primary housemaid while working full time lol. But we both were level headed enough to know we built everything together so we halved our assets mostly even stuff i brought jnto the marriage and refuse to use the children as pawns. Im not saying there arent people who are out for everything they can get but it isnt just women.But if you are against marriage and are upfront about it with your SO then thats fair.

2660713,0,t1_cn5vldx,Then yes you are over reacting. In fact I would say it is more accurately that you are being needy. She is giving you reasonable amounts of time by giving you time on weekends and slightly more now that you went through rehab and spending her time during the week on other things. Usually at her age that would be school sports or other social activities. At your age weekends should be sufficient amounts of time.As for not inviting you over for Christmas maybe she has a reason considering you were in rehab. Then again maybe she just wants to spend quality time with her family on a day that is meant for that. My suggestion is to rethink what it is you want from a relationship in terms of time and see if this girl can give you that.

In this case and assuming that it is common practice to actually have a rehearsal dinner before every wedding I dont live in the US so I dont know the etiquette they probably have this in mind and know that theyre expected to pay for the rehearsal also.

2682368,0,t3_2qqq7i,I was engaged to the father of my son and at first was blissfully happy but after a couple of months into our engagement I felt completely trapped and started panicking about the prospect of being with this man for the rest of my life. I however did not cheat on him. I left him a few months before the wedding and  years later we are both extremely happy with new partners and we get along great. We just clearly werent meant to be together. I think its difficult for couples to admit when its time to call it quits on a relationship especially after years together. I dont know the ins and outs of your relationship none of us do only the two of you do but I would be inclined to say that you should let this relationship go. She clearly doesnt respect you that much as she went and slept with an ex just because she couldnt take the pressure of planning a wedding amongst other things. With regards to the cheating and getting over it I dont think you really can ever get over it. Im pretty sure my ex cheated on me with a coworker during the last couple of months we were together although I have no proof. He is now with this girl and has been since I left him. Although I didnt really suspect anything whilst I was him as I was preoccupied by my feelings of overwhelming dread at being stuck with him forever now that I think back to it it hurts me. I have no feelings for him whatsoever and am ridiculously happy with my new boyfriend but it still hurts to think he possibly did that to me. The decision is yours.

But until then if you say anything to her it should be positive you dont want to come off needy or jealous especially when she didnt do anything to elicit his actions. Its very unattractive to girls when their boyfriends get upsettry to be controlling but dont be a push over either. If it bothers you I would bring it up to her but not in an attacking manner. You could again ask her how she feels about it and then tell her that it makes you uncomfortable that someone else is sending her gifts but that youre not surprised that her ex or anyone would do that because shes such a great catch. Up the ante she is your gf now the balls in your court. If there is one thing Ive ever learned that Ive done wrong in a relationship its that I didnt tell that person how much I appreciated them while I had them. If she does something nice for you say thank you but dont forget to pull her aside or take her upstairs to thank her again.

2834332,0,t3_2sitfr,First you should get some help a therapist or counselor to get a plan together on how to address this situation. It is going to be tough. You have to decide first if his drinking is a make it or break it issue for you. Will you stay with him no matter what? What if he stops driving while drunk but continues to drink? What is your fear? If he quits will you be willing to also maybe for a few months maybe always? Once you have decided on your own where the line is then you can speak with him. Therapists are much better at helping with this but I think bringing this up will take several conversations. No ultimatums no fighting. Just asking him questions. Seeing how he reacts. My personal experience as someone who has dated an alcoholic and as someone who has quit drinking is that it is a lot of baby steps. First seeing how he feels after not drinking for a week. Going through quitting and relapsing.  Learning to live without drinking. Im sorry you are going through this but it can get better. Good luck!,relationship_advice,cnq9chb,1,t5_2r0cn

Now him being a photographer he probably has a buttton of pics and it probably is a pain in the ass to find them all and delete them. So heres what you doYou sit him down and make sure he knows just how important this is to you. He has to understand that it isnt the time for jokes. That this really hurts you and you cant live with it. Theres nothing wrong with you feeling that way even though I DO believe youre overreacting  you still have a right to feel that way. You sit him down and ask him if he will spend  full night with you deleting those pictures. If he agrees then you guys should do it right then and there if at all possible. If he says no then you have a choice to make although to me the choice would be clear  leave UNLESS he tells you WHY. I know that sounds stupid. . . but some people really do attach themselves to things and as much as it might piss you off he might have a good reason. . . but I dont think anyone would blame you for leaving him at that point. Anyway you go through ALL those pictures with him. . . make a mental note of the pictures. After its all saidndone. . . forget about it. Flush it from your mind altogether.

And we can debate who is right and who is wrong all day is not going to fix the problem. The problem is he snooped and did something disrespectful and she did something that he thinks is disrespectful. I myself would not be comfortable with my wife talking to a male friend about her hopes and dreams I think that is my area. So yes he should not have blew her off when she wanted to rant and rave. But the fact is he blew her off and she talked to some guy and hes not comfortable with. Is he immature  it sounds like it but at the same time everybody has insecurities that they are trying to overcome. And she should not have talked to her guy friend knowing that it would have upset her husband. So yes both of need to make concessions and come to the middle ground but I dont see that happening.

If you guys are right for each other just enjoy that you are so incredibly lucky to have such an amazing connection that you think you want to have it forever. In time if you are right for each other maybe you will marry him. Think about if it makes sense right now. Do you guys live together? Living with people changes a lot and really shows you what kind of a person they are. Do you have the funds to drop several thousands on a wedding?

I would only be alarmed if she tried to hide it from you which she didnt you didnt get a chance to see each other often which it sounds like you do or if she had a previous history with this guy.Its totally normal to be jealous but I think if the feeling persists you should just straight up explain your feelings to your girlfriend and see how she reacts.

Whatever youre into is fine. Whatever other people are into is fine. Whatever youve done in your past is fine. You dont owe anyone an apology for anything youve done before and you most definitely did the right thing in being upfront. Dont ever lie about yourself just to suit someone else itll never end well.Similarly if thats not what shes into then thats her prerogative too. You guys are just not for each other and thats gonna sting right now but you did yourself a favour by being upfront and regardless of anything else  well done. xx,relationship_advice,co3pins,12,t5_2r0cn

2953790,0,t3_2tz5ak,Im curious as to what kind of affection you shower her with? There are lots of different angles to affection. Maybe in your mind youre showering her with affection when youre taking her out buying her dinnerdrinks and maybe even gifts. While maybe all she craves is more verbal affection or nonsexual physical affection etc.? Either way it honestly sounds like you havent had a deep conversation about this and she probably has no idea what she truly desires. A  year old woman will have a hard time figuring out what she wants in a long distant relationship.

I am sure that hurt like hell and walking on sand must have really been awful did you let your wife know the extent of how much it hurt or did you put on a brave face and kept walking to please her while secretly seething that she doesnt seem to care how much pain you are in? If its the latter then no wonder your wife didnt see it as a big deal to keep walking because you were trying to make her think it was fine if it was the former well then she has serious problems and its probably best if you do leave her. Honestly it seems like a lot of your problems are communication problems. If something your wife is doing bothers you dont just go with what she wants and then resent her for it like the apartment for example say something let her know how you feel and what your wishes and wants are make then abundantly clear to her dont just drop hints.

Think about that you are hoping to overcome some hurdles in your relationship by running away from them rather than trying to work through them together. What you explained is the unfortunate misconception a lot of people have when it comes to breaks and why they are so rarely successful. You are both young and have a lot of things to learn about relationships. Im not going to try to convince you one way or the other when it comes to the relationship but I absolutely wouldnt go on a break. My suggestion use this weekend to think as well. If you are both moving in different directions then maybe it is for the best. I know I broke up with a girl when I was your age for similar reasons and as hard as it was it was one of the best decisions of my life. On the other hand maybe there is more here. My point is figure out what you want. Define that write it out even and then talk to him about it. If you two dont line up on the crucial aspects of moving forward then say goodbye. Just dont assume you can work through problems together when one of you isnt even there. ,relationship_advice,co5cedm,0,t5_2r0cn

2967157,0,t3_2u5lr8,Sacrifices are part of a healthy relationship. That being said those sacrifices should be things like well I wanted to see this movie but I also know youve been really excited to see that one so lets go see yours. You are the only guarantee that you have in life so its important to check in with yourself every once in a while and make sure that you arent sacrificing life goals for the sake of preserving a relationship. Its also important to keep in mind that LDRs even when theyre easy take a lot of emotional energy. Breaks and break ups are always gonna be really hard but I would say breaks tend to be harder because youre constantly spending energy thinking about how youre gonna repair things or if it will work. Long term relationships are also tricky. Especially when youre very different. A lot of times much of your love comes from just being together for such a long time. Which is not to say in any way that that love is any less real than other relationships. But I think in the long run youll be happier with someone youre more similar to.

Other than that its a virus that causes an occasional irritating rash in  of the people who have it and causes no symptoms at all in the other  and its totally manageable with cheap medication.

2989100,0,t3_2uenrj,I wonder if you should have told her sooner. I say this because Ive been in a similar situation which I will proceed to tell you about now in the hopes that itll help you! I fell in love with someone a few months before leaving the country for a year. Even with the guarantee that I would come back after that year was up it was still hard for me to establish a relationship with that person. Granted wed known each other for a little less time than youve known this girl but part of the problem is keeping up with a longdistance relationship. Its not for everyone and my problem is I need a pretty strong history with someone before I consider a longdistance situation. Not sure if that applies to you.If you had told her sooner and she had reciprocated you mightve had a better sense of how to proceed. Im saying that just so that you can consider it and decide if it will change how you approach relationships in the future!  No criticism intended!Either way its cool that you have the will to tell her now. Hopefully it wont surprise her very much. I imagine youve given hints about your feelings no matter how slight.So how do you bring it up to her? If youre quite sure youd move back for her you can say something like I really like you and Im kind of disappointed that Im moving away from you. It might open a conversation for a tryandsee longdistance relationship or maybe shell even encourage you to move back!Just be careful okay?

Then talk to her about it and decide if your number and that number are that big of a deal.If it is a big deal then it means yall just have different values associated with sex and probably wont work out.

And I can state for a fact that to the extent that your SO doesnt understand your POV you dont understand his either.When you grow up in a town where everyone looks the same race IS a nonissue. You literally dont think about it. Race issues are something that happens on the news to other people... people who cant seem to get along without federal intervention. I used to think the rest of the world needed remedial kindergarten. How the hell is this even a problem?! Is having dark skin any different than having dark eyes? People fucking fight about this?! Seriously? Do they not have anything better to do in wherever than talk about peoples melanin levels? Ugh! Change the channel! That was my inner narrative more or less. Still not sure if I was immature or if everyone else was.Anyway your SO is probably more or less color blind. And this is probably a very good thing overall. If I were you Id approach the issue like thisI love that you see past race. It hurts that so many other people dont. Some people really suck. I need to talk about that.

I seriously think shes cheating and full of excuses. Id try really hard to find proof basically demand to see her shit. If she refuses what kind of relationship is it? Yes its bad that it has to come to that but she wont properly explain why the heck shed want to hide texts from you. Its ridiculous and shes obviously attempting to cover something up. If she has to lie to you about something theres no relationship.Show her how you can prove that it was searched from her phone. If she stumbles around and tries to claim someone else did the search on her phone she is just stacking the lies higher and higher.My boyfriend dated a girl for  years. She cheated on him blatantly slept with other men in HIS bed and when he found out she dumped him and told people that he was abusing her. Yes it can happen  years into a relationship.The evidence is blatantly obvious that the searches were made to hide evidence from you. Dont be a softie on this this is how girls use men for a really long time and cheat on them for a long time. If what she was doing was perfectly innocent shed confess. Its outright BS do NOT buy her crap. Its very easy for a girl to emotionally manipulate you its just a common fact between men and women in my opinion.,relationship_advice,coere0e,1,t5_2r0cn

3087598,0,t3_2viftc,Shes chosen to be with you at least for now.  So dont fall into the trap of trying to figure out whats best for her and unilaterally making a decision for her benefit.  Instead think about whether you are happy in this relationship and if you think that the problems can be addressed.  If you are not satisfied you can end it.  You dont need an excuse.  But if the problem is that you feel as if youre failing to live up to her expectations and you want to meet them you can address that instead.A lot of people are not intuitive or good at figuring out what other people want without being told.  That is why communication is so important.  If she wants you to come over she should ask.  And you should answer honestly dont say that you want to be there if what you really want is some time to yourself.  Although you might consider if theres a way that you can be together but still get your alone time for instance if you are in the same apartment but in different rooms.As for romantic gestures you can work on making those happen.  If you really dont think of it on your own why not schedule it?  Randomly put one romantic gesture event in your calendar every month.  Draw up a list of things she would like mostly small things like bringing her chocolate or a card but some larger things and on the day youve scheduled the gesture for pick one item from the list at random.  You could also put her period in your calendar and schedule bringing her chips. There are ways to be attentive even if you arent spontaneous and naturally romantic if that is what you want to do.,relationship_advice,coi108a,1,t5_2r0cn

3092895,0,t3_2vjaf1,My wife is vaguely similar to you in that she considered herself straight through high school and university.She slept with many men and felt very little emotionally then ended up in a couple of meaningful lesbian relationships when she moved to the States.  After five or six years she broke up with the woman she was with and started dating men again.  Well me actually and weve been together fifteen years now are married and have kids and couldnt be happier.She too reached a point where she questioned the lifestyle and the path she had chosen. She decided that to answer the questions that she had she should ignore the gender of her partners to some degree and try to see where that took her.  It wasnt until she could look back at it that she really felt comfortable with her decisions with regard to her sexuality.  Interestingly enough she doesnt consider herself bisexual and she avoids labeling herself in any way.I have a feeling that she could end up in a relationship with another woman should our relationship end just as easily as she could end up with another guy.  In some ways I think that you have thought about this more than my wife ever did.  I think that you have managed to put some concrete and well defined questions to yourself and youve been able to answer them pretty well even if your answers are influenced and biased by the lifestyle you are already leading.  I think that the current relationship is probably doomed regardless of how you end up viewing your sexuality.  If you do end up dating and choosing a straight lifestyle do it because you love him not because he fits into your new world view.As far as what to say to a potential partner be honest.  Tell him that you are bisexual and have only ever been in relationships with women up until now.  ,relationship_advice,coiksev,1,t5_2r0cn

On top of that sexual bravado is easy enough to muster behind the anonymity of the internet and texting but must be quite intimidating for a relatively inexperienced  year old.

Played Settlers of Catan a game she bought me because she said it sounded like something that would be fun.I dont care how hot or sexy she may be OP  if you stay youre settling.

The fact that he locked you out of his office and wont talk to you is pretty shitty. I understand that people need time to cool off and gather their thoughts sometimes but it seems kind of excessive. Maybe let him know that you love him and trust him and in order for this relationship to continue he needs to make some concessions like no longer reading all your messages and monitoring your internet usage. He also shouldnt be hiding his laptop and safe contents from you but you already know that. I wish you the best of luck in sorting this out.

Having another will make it even more difficult and it is not something that you should try to force on him both for his sake and for the potential future childs so that the father doesnt resent it.Also the scenario you laid out doesnt change if you have a child with him it just makes it worse. What if he has the child with you and then decides he wants another when you cant? If he would leave you in the first scenario he would in the second too there would just be another child involved.I understand you having these feelings in your situation and I am sorry that you are going through it but it just isnt something that you can reasonably force him in to.Edit I would also like to ask if you are so sure he would just leave you so quickly instead of exploring adoption or something like that are you sure he is who you want to have a child with in the first place?,relationship_advice,cp5j0r2,2,t5_2r0cn

3324955,0,t3_2y80io,I would like to weigh in because Im a bit of a relationship whore who has also moved to new places alone and had to make friends from scratch I think online dating is great but I also know loads of really nice people who havent had much success with it. I would say not to automatically assume that the problem is with you. On these sites you are matched to people based on what I think is fairly arbitrary information! I know plenty of people who I share interests with who I wouldnt want to bone and in the other direction me and my SO only have a few common interests but I get on with him so much.My advice would be to get out and try your hardest to meet new people...but not necessarily just in order to date. As pantsface said what are your hobbies? Do you like playing any kind of team sports? Are there any political groups you feel an allegiance to? Are you dead in to music? Join a clubgroupteam and try and meet new people that way. Also couch surfing is a good shout  find out if they have any representatives that run meet ups in your area. You dont necessarily have to host though my friends did that and it was a blast meeting new people! and you can go along to the meetings and it is basically a social. Im not sure what your current job is but depending on how much spare time you have you could try and pick up a bar job just doing a couple of shifts a week. People who work in bars tend to be quite social types which can be a really good way to connect with people. I know you said you arent in to the bar scene but as someone who works behind a bar  the kinds of people who are in to picking up people via the bar scene usually are completely abhorrent to those who actually work in the industry! Go for a place that suits you  one of my really great friends was like Hang out in a real ale pub you get lots of nice people there  he was totally right.You say that you already have a few friends before they leave you I would recommend trying to meet some new people through them. Try and tag along to some of the stuff that they do outside your social circle  read some not all because you dont want them to get annoyed with you before they leave!And as pantsface said give the yos a chance! Ive recently moved to a seaside town in the middle of nowhere and I was pretty ageist against people  years younger  years older but I came to realise age hasnt really got much to do with it it is whether or not you get on with them!I wish I could say that it is as easy as that but at first you will face a bit of disappointment not finding people you completely gel with. But then soon enough youll start receiving invitations to things you actually want to go to.And it is usually through friends that you find people that are good to consider dating. You meet them at parties or because they live with your mate or maybe you go for some kind of social and meet them that way. You are in a surrounding where you are comfortable rather than literally just sitting down with someone completely new. You are more likely to meet someone who wants to date that way too rather than in a club. In a club for the most part people just want to get laid! I think if you start out with the objective of making friends it looks a bit less desperate.Good luck! tldr Make friends first thats a great way of meeting like minded people to date ,relationship_advice,cp79toj,2,t5_2r0cn

3337895,0,t3_2yebet,Hi there I can see that there might be an objective right and wrong here but Im inclined to say that if you feel uneasy about it its probably better to tell him. Sure if he ever finds out you can argue that you werent technically cheating. But I think its always better to follow your own moral compass. It seems to be on your mind so why not clear the air? Would you want him to tell you if the tables were turned? What happened happened. You cant change the course of events but the way you handle them can change their implications. You dont owe him an explanation and in my opinion you dont owe anyone anything whether youre with them or not but I always think its safer to trust your gut. And it sounds like your gut is telling you that youll feel better telling him. Personally I think that kind of honesty and openness is a better ground for your relationship to be based on.

3363166,0,t3_2yi8zz,UpdateI just spoke to him and he told the followingHe was very confused about what I was talking about I started with questions like Is everything okay with you and your fiancee? or I heard something from your apartment on Monday that confused me. When I told him that Im sure I heard a woman moaning in his room and them talking English the girl he hangs out with a lot is not native and they speak English he convincingly said that that cant be. He said he was in bed watching House of Cards and fell asleep.Since I didnt put my ear on his door to hear better that wouldve been creepy this story could be the truth. He assured me that he was alone and didnt cheat on his fiancee. He said it straight to my face and as far as my intuition goes he told the truth.So either I completely made a fool of myself or he lied to my face. I have some doubt left because I was very sure that I heard his voice and footsteps after the moaning stopped. I hear the footsteps at night drives me crazy when I want to sleep.But my trust in him is big enough to believe him and my doubt is too small to dig further.Either way I can stop thinking about it. There is nothing more I can do here.Ah but I did tell him that just to get it of my chest if he was lying to me right now that I hope they used condoms and if not he should get tested for STDs. He found it funny but said he tried to imagine the situation the other way around and understands my doubts.I didnt find anything in the rules on how to update but I thought  as a comment the replies to that are grouped better.Thanks to all of you for the comment and ideas even if I dont agree with all of them.,relationship_advice,cpbmjs2,1,t5_2r0cn

3375780,0,t3_2yts9t,gtIn my eyes as a girl it seems like if youre satisfied with me sexually then you wouldnt want to masturbateThats a nice sentiment but lets look at it from another point of view. He grew up without you learning to be self reliant and masturbating when he wanted to. Then at some point you came along and there was the sex and thats great but he is still the same self sufficient guy he was before.In a sense masturbation is a baseline and yousex is an add on. Masturbation is the self sufficient option. Masturbation is generally quick and uncomplicated. It is a biological function like urination but different. You wouldnt argue that you are really good at helping him pee and his aim is always better when you help him so why would he ever want to pee alone?Why? Because you dont see peeing as a social activity an intimate activity but you do look at sex that way. For men it is generally not that simple. Sex for men generally fills a physical function and also an intimacy function and while they are simultaneous they are not necessarily connected. Masturbation is a no nonsense fulfilling of the physical need. It is quick efficient and uncomplicated. Sex is a negotiation an interaction generally takes longer and is definitely a social activity. I still have great sex with my wife if I dont cum it is completely separate for me. Just as masturbation is also separate. Sex and ejaculation are not equivalent.,relationship_advice,cpd2b7a,2,t5_2r0cn

Like you spent a week indoors studying for a test and you get so on edge and depressed after a while that you need some social time in order to feel normal again?Its the exact opposite of that to be introverted.  I can spend a whole week cooped up in my apartment and feel  fine actually more energetic than normal so better than fine. However if I spend every day hanging out with my GF even if its just being lazy and watching Netflix I feel stress and strain from being around another person for so long.  I feel low energy tired stressed and it shows in my attitude.  I snap at her and so on.Extroverted people lose energy when they are alone and recharge when they are social.  Introverted people lose energy when we are social and gain it while alone.  Its not that we dont like being social its that theres a cost associated with social activity.  So extroverted people enjoy alone time but must be careful to limit the quantities introverted people enjoy social interaction but need to limit the quantity.  ,relationship_advice,cpdx7a3,1,t5_2r0cn

3409152,0,t1_cpgtco3,Well you have tons of people giving advice saying it sounds like a manipulative situation.  Thats why they have laws against relationships between underaged kids and men her dads age  to prevent manipulative situations from developing between people who are in a very fragile state of their development.  So I dont think its fair to just poopoo peoples comments  saying well its different for us.  Maybe but thats the point  anyone in that situation would say its different for us.  Its something to at least consider.  I mean your last post was a picture of you entitled Unattractive  year old Should I just give up?.  Where are these selfesteem issues coming from?  A husbands job is to build you up.  So yes it continues to sound like a relationship that has a difference in power that you are on the short end of which again makes perfect sense given the original age gap. Another example  he knows the Bible and just twists it and twists it until it says what HE wants you to believe.  How can you distort that verse out to be anything other than what it means?  I mean I know you can distort the Bible to mean whatever you want it to say but through manipulation just like here.  You are a person and your needs and concerns are valid.  So says the state.  So says the Bible.  So says Reddit.  So says human biology.  So says everyone.  I hope you get what you deserve and will stand up and require it.

3412071,0,t1_cph6atz,Doing it once doesnt mean that you took responsibility.  Honestly it doesnt sound like you really owned it.We all fuck up all of us. Owning it and seeking help to prevent it in the future is what works.  You fucked up there are no excuses and you forfeited the right to get defensive when you broke your gfs trust.  You hurt her A LOT!  Did she handle it perfectly hell no but thats mostly your fault.  You engaged her Amygdala by your actions and made it so it was nearly impossible for her to engage her frontal cortex because of how deeply you hurt her.When people are hurt they act more like animals because blood flow decreases to the rational part of their brain.  Your actions caused that.  Do the crime pay the time.  Again we all fuck up but a lot of empathy should have been applied here.  She was hurting just like a wounded animal.  Of course she lashed out.  Remember this in the future and dont put someone you love in that position.  And if you do suck it up and be willing to fall on your sword time and time again for a while.  When you hurt her it should have been all about her.  Defensiveness automatically means you are worrying about yourself.  In a relationship people mostly have two questionsDo you love me?

Maybe hed rather deal with the pain of your condition than the pain of living a life without you. I realize now that your self worth is at an all time low so it might seem unfathomable to you that he could prefer that choice. I also completely understand and dont disagree with what you are trying to do. I just dont agree with how youre going about it. But then we werent privy to your last conversation so maybe you did explain it well enough. Side note Our family is going through a terrible loss from the untimely and sudden death of a  year old. I am almost  sure he had no idea how much he was loved by nearly everyone. It is strange how I personally would go weeks without thinking of him or seeing him for months but now that he is gone there is an irreparable hole in our family. Please realize that you will never know how much you are loved but that you are loved more deeply than you can ever fathom. Even by those you rarely see or talk to. If you were gone tomorrow there would be a gaping hole in this world where you once stood. I dont care who you are or what youve done in your life or how little impact you think you have on others. You deserve life and whether you notice it or not you have love. ,relationship_advice,cpj2pbj,2,t5_2r0cn

Its entirely possible he has sexual needs that just arent quite on the same page with you.. maybe he likes those threesomes.. maybe you can look at porn together.. maybe its something else.  But Ill tell you from experience.. you just cannot help what fundamentally turns you on.  You just cant.  And if you make someone ashamed of it theyre going to hide it going to lie eventually theyll start to resent you and youre going to get a lot of passive aggressive conflict.  Im betting you get that all the time.  Now sure you have your desires wants etc.  And you can compromise.. it doesnt have to be totally giving in to how he wants to do things.. but you just CANT bury stuff pretend it isnt there and treat him like a naughty child.

3436553,0,t1_cpjzhlc,No neither.I mean use your charming aloofness to instill a sense of dread in her from knowing that you still have plenty of options that plenty of attractive women still would want to have sex with you. Women cant really make decisions by themselves. They need their group mentality to guide them. They also want what they cant have and dont what they already have until someone else wants it.Implying you may cheat is the WRONG thing to do her. That will piss her off. Mentioning casually that that some girl came on to you after work yesterday before you said no I have a wife Im happy and telling her so with kind of a laugh about the absurdity is kind of what you want to happen. Maintaining that you have done nothing at all wrong but putting it in her head. Even better if she sees it first hand other women wanting her man.That should give her the kick she needs to realize just what a great guy you are and how much worse off she would be if she lost you.Some may call me an ass hole for advocating emotional manipulation or some bullshit but lets be honest women OWN emotional manipulation. This is just using their own tactics against them. Which actually works better since they are such emotional often irrational creatures.  ,relationship_advice,cpjzqob,-2,t5_2r0cn

If she gets upset let her but comfort her and let her know that you grew as a person while you were with her and that she taught you a lot.

3449806,0,t3_2zomeq,You have gotten some good advice. I would find out if hes lost attraction to you because youve gained weight andor stopped dressing up etc or whatever the reason may be. If I were in your shoes however I would find out if he says yes to all this  then split up with him anyway. lol I know a bit harsh but this is why. Like others said already you are not married dont have kids you have only invested  years although that is not exactly small change but...cut your losses now. Also not sure if anyones brought this up but there is a possibility hes in love with someone else if hes told you he finds others attractive and well I would hate for you to make all these changes and still be left out in the cold if you are making the changes for him I mean.I think you can lose weight and dress up but deep down you will always be wondering what else he might stop liking the way you eat your personality your taste in music etc.. For me that is way too much pressure. Having said that I think its important to note thoughwhat makes our partners happy. And yes its also important to note that actually love is more conditional than we admit. I mean would anyone be with a partner who didnt do anything at home and not work spend all the money etc? No of course not. We all have our conditions but there comes a point where you have to feel that given reasonable circumstances that partner whom you chose will love you and stand by you for the most part. I would say that the most important thing is to be yourself but be honest with yourself too. If you are like  pounds overweight and you quite like yourself that way welleff him. If you know deep down you are not happy with yourself for example perhaps this is a kind of wake up call to see what  you really want to dobe still doesnt mean you should lose weight and stay with himthis is about how you feel about yourself.

I can see it especially being useful if youre up and its past midnight when she cant get the tube and it would otherwise be too expensive for her to get a cab. Having said that its at your discretion when to do her a favour and when not to and if anything her claiming she should get lifts or else youre selfish is just making it harder to want to help her out. You need to sit down and talk to her about it and explain why you got a car and that you cannot always chauffeur her around  say that you are happy to help out when youre free but that her expecting lifts is making it harder to want to provide them.

It seems like you are waiting for an unwritten unspoken expression of interest.   Not everyone works like that.   A lot of guys just arent that complex.     Tell him what you want what youd like to know or hear.   Im from a different generation  but today there are a lot of conflicting messages for expressing sexual interest.   Social and mainstream media sensationalize stories about sexual harassment  generalize stories about feminism and catcalling  and have pretty much defined consent as something that varies from moment to moment requiring an ongoing verbal agreement to avoid doing the wrong thing.   Without a healthy role model or prior experience I can easily see younger men being unsure on how to proceed without becoming percieved as creepy or aggressive. It is conceivable that hes just giving you a healthy dose of respect combined with a little sexual uncertainty.   If you feel direct discussion removes some of the fun amp mystery  maybe start by leading him.     Ask him if he prefers to be touched on the cheek or the arm before you kiss?     Tell him something about him that crossed your mind while apart.      Maybe hell take the cue that you like more expressive dialog.   ,relationship_advice,cpy18fp,15,t5_2r0cn

3656963,0,t1_cq92lbd,gtFirst of all you yourself are racist no matter what you try and say. Great analysis you really put a lot of thought into that explanation. F instead of just an F. Now try again explain why it is RACIST when the RACE OF WHOEVER IM INSULTING IS IRRELEVANT. gtSo how is it relevant if you acknowledge shes using it in a racist way. Help me out bruh. Because OP suffers nothing from this. Its the same as her hating some random chick OP doesnt know who the fuck cares the people she is talking about are strangers. How does this affect OP in the slightest? It doesnt except for maybe the thought of oh god she thinks unpopular opinions. To which im saying its just an opinion does it really matter that much especially since OP is not black and she wont call him a nigger?. How is this complicated?gtI have no idea what youre talking about. What is this even supposed to mean? Are you saying because some people say nigga it means the same thing was gonna like what are you even trying to imply. Simple language evolves nigga  nigger because of this nigger  black slave and is now subjective because word is so mainstream in use. gtClearly the fact that she avoids gyms because there are black people there implies she she maaay be a public racist.Except that no one else knows WHY she avoids certain gyms. Youve never heard a person lie about why they want to avoid something or someplace? This is the problem with talking about race people forget that racists are no different than you and me. They dont publicly wear an SS uniform or walk the streets going i hate niggers and jews ans spics and... on repeat. They try to fit in and when theyre behind doors open up. Have a sense of how normal people act if you want to even begin discussing this.gtAdn even if it is private so what? Racists are scummy people and I have no idea why you would want to be with someone who hates people for their skin color. Again youve never really met a racist have you? Go hang out with some Russians for a bit have some vodka and if the language doesnt trigger you to death you might actually enjoy yourself. Im serious my russ friends say nigger and faggot like its going out of style i couldnt give a shit as Im neither but i enjoy the company the stories worldwide opinions political discussion on global events not everything is race related and even the act of drinking itself most americans cant hold their liquor very well. I take it you havent spent much time outside the US. Am i right?gtA reasonable different opinion is I personally think peanut butter is better but she likes mayo. This is literally I think brown people are inferior. If you cant see the difference theres something wrong with you. But again how does this affect OP. There is a difference but IT DOES NOT MATTER BECAUSE IT DOESNT APPLY TO OP. OPS GIRLFRIEND DOES NOT THINK HE IS INFERIOR SO WHY THE FUCK DOES HE GIVE A SHIT. If you believe in tolerance then this is the proper stance to take instead youve gone on a witch hunt without the slightest rational thought. You read what i wrote but you understood nothing.gtRight. Just an assumption so completely unreliable.Just like your assumption on how racists act is also completely unreliable. Youre also not OP and are in no position to tell me if that assumption was accurate or inaccurate in any way. Get off the high horse Napoleon I see past the painting.gtPeople who spout anti racism are not pro tolerance silly. Have you heard of the KKK? Nazis or Skinheads? Come on man. How is the KKK antiracist? By definition they are proracism. You know that anti means AGAINST right?gtIm going to assume youre white and you dont really understand. Because Ive been called a nigger BECAUSE Im black. Again the proper response is ok whatever dude go away. Its literally no different than being insulted with any other word it only hurts you as much as you let it. Im assuming its a stranger that told you this if it is then doesnt that drive my point home so much more? How much happier would you be if you could literally just keep on walking as if you didnt even hear it? You certainly wouldnt be bringing it up online thats for sure. So while you toss in the race card btw i have been racially called out and discriminated before. By the parent of a friend. I kept talking to my friend i just chalked her mom up as an asshole and moved on. I have never brought it up until now. Its a word it only hurts you if you let it. Grow up.gtThat shits racist and messed up at the fact that you want to argue that its all ok to be racist is disgusting and makes YOU racist.  It is ok to be racist its called the first ammendment of the united states. If you dont like it go to england where a racist tweet can get you jailed. It also doesnt make me racist to support the first ammendment it does mean you just made another completely inaccurate and illogical assumption which YOU bitched at me for making btw you fucking hypocrite while failing to grasp the most basic points. Trying to win this by going IM BLACK AND WAS CALLED A NIGGER OMFG YOURE SUCH A RACIST is not only sad but perpetuates the very same culture i spoke of. Failure to accept responsibility instead you fall down into hysterics about being oppressed when nothing of the sort has happened. Im done arguing with a child.

3681210,0,t3_32jjma,gtNo traumatic experience has ever happened to her to make her this way. She has had a completely normal uppermiddle class life. She has never been abused or hurt or seriously insulted. She is just the most soul suckingly apathetic dead weight insecure person you will ever meet.Wow. With a sister like you who needs enemies?OP I bet youve always been your parents favorite child by a mile. You probably have a lot of awesome qualities which your parents recognize and appreciate and reward you for. You and your parents probably get one another whereas your sister has always been the odd one out. Whatever qualities she has they are ones that are undervalued in your family. So your sister has been unfavorably compared to you all her life. And heres the thing That hurts. Its like Chinese water torture  no single event is traumatic in itself but the accumulating effect of the regular events is traumatic. Your sister has probably learned from a young age that she is worthless because no matter how hard she tries she is never rewarded with seeing that proud shining light in her parents eyes that her sister constantly bathes in. So she has long ago stopped trying.As you have learned the way your family has been helping her has resulted in her living a life of complete apathy. The way to actually help her is to get her out of the home environment where she lives without love or respect and into another one that might be more appreciative of her and stimulative of whatever ego strength she still has left inside her. This means that you need to convince your parents to kick her out. They can and in fact should support her from afar by paying her way wherever she chooses to go but she must get out of the house. It sounds like she might not be ready to meet the demands of college but some kind of structured schooltype environment where she can meet peers and have contact with supportive adults would be a good choice.,relationship_advice,cqbvrf0,-10,t5_2r0cn

3685262,0,t1_cqc61pd,Well youve said shes expressed an interest in being more healthy  but shes having difficulty with it. For some people its easy  they learn the tricks and they keep it up. For others  its more difficult. I for instance am a recovering bulimic perhaps why I reacted so strongly to this post  I started off as a successful weight loss story  I ate super healthy walked about  miles a day up mountains! and the weight dropped off and my body looked incredible. Then...shit happened...its hard being so focused on lifestyle if youve got other things going on in your life that are worrying you  for her it could easily be the sense that you dont think her body is what you want... which would just perpetuate the cycle. I spent years knowing exactly what I had to do to be healthy  I could tell you the calories and nutritional info for most food items in the western diet without looking it up from memory. I could tell you roughly the calories youd burn by undertaking most exercises for different periods of time and be pretty accurate taking into account your weight and fitness level  and STILL  I was unable to control my own habits... I didnt chose to  I just couldnt manage them with the pressure of life and the pressure of trying to look hot in order to be higher in the social hierarchy which is essentially true  look up beauty and success in google and youll see beautiful people are much better placed in life to be successful than average looking folk. Dying inside  because..well..its shame isnt it. The one thing about being with someone you love is you know they love you  even when Ive not been in great shape Ive been comfortable being naked around people I love because I know they love me for me. Incidentally Im better now and my body is much better too...but a lack of selfconfidence in being naked around you means that she is ashamed of her body. She doesnt like it  and she doesnt want you to see it because she knows that you dont like it..Feeling like youre not in control of your body  is kind of explained above  when you know the theory but the practice proves too hard or unmanageable and your facing someone who can accomplish it with ease is really really difficult. Youve got to remember youre a guy and shes a girl as well  youre at an age where your body is able to build structure  where as her body is at the age where its starting to be more difficult for her to lose weight and maintain muscle tone google brown fatwhite fat  women and men weight loosmuscle gain differences. A more sensitive way to deal with it is to tell her that you love her just as she is  and she doesnt have to change for you...to support her in exercising rather than judging her efforts  go for runs with her  go swimming together  take a class together. Tell her its not that you want her to lose weight or change her body shape but that being healthy and doing exercise is part of your life that you love and you want to share it with her  you want her to be spending more time with you  and you can teach her stuff too. Its probably a case of her finding something she enjoys doing exercise wise  its very difficult to motivate yourself if you dont enjoy exercise  maybe try a Tai Chi class together? Or Yoga? Or pilates? Also eating healthily  cook for her...cook together  make it a thing. Why buy junk food when you can make a date out of putting together some really awesome healthy food?And actually I was... I was losing a lot with one of them and I didnt feel different at all... the only time Ive ever spoken up about a partners body is when theyve started to drop to a really dangerously low weight because they stopped eating and looking after themselves.. but gaining it wise  I understand that thats just what happens when people get older  they either make the choice to change it or they dont but you cant make that choice for them and pressuring them into it is going to harm your relationship.,relationship_advice,cqcceqk,7,t5_2r0cn

They try and hide it by saying its because they have good personalities but they dont! Some of them are douchebagsSee  every woman at college has rejected him not one he really liked or even a couple or handful ALL OF THEM!!!Ive never said his feelings are invalid I said that a man who doesnt seem to agree you have the ultimate say in whether or not you will sleep with him is terrifying. Again I also never said his mistake his in only going for academic circles I said that him asking out any and every women who happens to be in his current social circles is creepy desparate behaviour. He doesnt even say he likes them any of them is it just me or is that wrong? Thats what I call the machine gun approach  asking  women out in the hopes one says yes  and who with any dignity will do that??If youre expressing yourself wrong youre doing it repeatedly. Personally I think its a difference of opinions but thats fine thats allowed in the real world. But yeah if you basically tell me you think you have a right to a chance with me that to me and every woman in hearing distance is a scary idea. If you really think you dont have to be in any appealing and this goes for woman as well and as people not just walking holes  then you seriously dont get it and probably never will.

3691716,0,t3_32no76,Honestly it seem like you are being a bit greedy because heres the thing there arent many people who youll find suitable to date that are also passionate about your fetishes as another poster mentioned. You say that you feel its one sided but then mention that you should be happy with her. Have you ever stopped to think that maybe she feels that way too? Not trying to be harsh but from what youve explained it seems like you dominate what goes on with fetishessex life in the relationship and shes likely yearning for a different sexual experience as well. It goes both ways. Just straight up ask her if shed rather your fetishes not always be involved or the next time sex is initiated dont even do anything fetish related and see how she reacts. Doesnt mean you have to completely give up your fetishes but they also dont always need to be involved. Compromise is just as important in the sexual aspect of relationships as the nonsexual. Theres times I dont feel like being on top but the guy Im seeing is in the mood for it so I do so because I know that in the future hell make the same consideration for what Id like.,relationship_advice,cqd2vky,4,t5_2r0cn

This is often referred to as the honeymoon period and as far as i can tell it is pretty standard. If shes not desperate to spend time with you now when youre supposed to be in the honeymoon period whats it going to be like a year down the line? I get that she has other commitments but the fact shes committed to a relationship with you means she should be wanting to spend time with you and actively seeking to make time for you. This may be a case of right girl wrong time. You may like her alot and share a lot in common but your needs are not being fulfilled. If she cant successfully balance work familial obligations and you then it may not be the right time for a relationship because relationships require time and hardwork and you deserve this from a partner!

Reminding him that while yes you are past that honeymoon phase your relationship it is okay to go out on dates or even plan dinner at home. It is a healthy thing and gives you time to both settle now and reconnect and remember why you both are together.

3789107,0,t3_33t9em,She can call the police and explain the situation that her daughter is living with George and she wants to know if he was recently reported for what Joe told you. This should be a pretty clear way to tell if Joes story was fabricated or not. Ultimately she is aware of the rumors and is a capable adult who can monitor the situation and make her own determination. At this point all you know is there is no evidence supporting these stories that you are aware of. The fact that you are an ex and getting this involved does seem rather opportunistic more than helpful. My suggestion let Samantha deal with this. You should probably consider distancing yourself from her and this situation at least until you have real proof. To answer your question protecting children is everyones business. However when there is no proof that they are being harmed then all you are doing is hurting a potentially innocent person. So with that you need to be very careful how you proceed. Dont just go in throwing around evidence lacking accusations. If you want to help do your own digging in a way that doesnt perpetuate the rumors. ,relationship_advice,cqo6sdt,4,t5_2r0cn

3828338,0,t3_349e2f,Thats a rather strange notion that a man wouldnt be able to be a father because of his career though I suppose its healthier to admit that he couldnt be a proper father and would be neglectful than to have the kids and then be a neglectful parent.Youre at the age where you can date and be planning for the longterm.  Especially when its something as important as whether youll have a family together.  So yes its perfectly fine to not want to stay in a long drawnout invested relationship with someone who you know is rock solid in being ultimately incompatible with you.It doesnt really make sense what youre hoping to accomplish by having a  week honeymoon with him though.  I hope youre not holding out hope that a weeks long sex romp and intimacy would change his answer or lead to an accidental pregnancy which would rope him into being a father regardless of whether he wanted to be one or not.Any other use of those two weeks where you could focus on yourself and getting over the breakup would be better for you than what you have planned and would have less potential to cast a suspicious shadow over your motives and intentions.,relationship_advice,cqsnv6w,2,t5_2r0cn
3833768,0,t3_34c214,You live together and she didnt let you know shes not coming home? I would be more questioning why would I want to live with someone who didnt think that was a problem? The problem here is that you dug yourself into a hole right from the start by overreacting so you lost control of the situation. And now you dont really know if she cheated or not as result. These could be crocodile tears because she cheated and feels guilty or really being hurt because she didnt cheat although shes a bit naive in her actions yet saddened that you dont trust her.In times like these anything you do to try to fix things is going to add fuel to the fire. Id suggest sending something short and quick saying Im sorry I overreacted but I was a bit hurt given the circumstances. If or when youre ready to talk about it Im here.

3855785,0,t3_34j09n,thanks for the feedback everyone! It was late last night when I wrote the original post right before I fell asleep so I didnt think to include more detail. Weve been together for nearly  years we used to have sex at least daily and if we missed a day wed make up for it and have sex twice the next day. It was super intimate and was at least half making love and half straight up fucking but about  months ago she just lost interest or something? We last had sex like  weeks ago and when we do she doesnt kiss me and it feels like shes trying to get it over with almost. I have tried taking the initiative and she hits me with the its really late or I have a big day tomorrow but they were never issues before. Obviously those arent legit reasons and Id love to know the real reason why but she just wont communicate with me about it. She checked all her hormones stuff at the doctor but when all that came back normal she stopped being semiproactive about it and just let it all slow down. When we do have sex she gets on top and gets herself finished pretty quick and then kinda rolls over and its like theres a subtext of Im done now you go. Its super weird because if I was reading someone else post this Id be like theres definitely something else going on that we dont know about that causing it but we get along super well enjoy the same things have similar world views can disagree on things without fighting about it. Super healthy mature communicative relationship.... aside from the sex. I keep telling myself that I should stick around and work through it with her because ive been with her so long Id always imagined my future with her but its making me feel like a a shit boyfriend when I try real hard to be a solid guy b less of a man and c like Im gross or unappealing or something.

Consider he told you he was having a party with very juvenile but innocent things going on would you try to stop him? You might and feel justified telling him how to live his life much more to a degree than his desire to control yours. My GF at the time could not differentiate between what she wanted and what was universally accepted she thought they were one in the same. He probably wanted to not have to choose between cancelling plans that he knew you would not approve of or have a big confrontation with you and then probably still not have the party he wanted. You cant have your cake and eat it too if you insist on controlling your boyfriends behavior you can expect him to choose between lying or a fight neither is prefererable and hell eventually leave. If this applies great take a look if not so be it. You may be controlling him and he is trying to resist.

3942342,0,t3_35lhzk,Sounds like your boyfriend put his foot down a while back or was this you that pushed the issue?Anyways you both really need to establish boundaries and do things in the correct mature manner. But you also cant just keep telling her this and you dont want her to lash out and do anything rash. I assume your BF has a lawyer etc. You need to document or simply print out the phone records for as long as this started happening. Highlight her number and timestamps. Send this to your lawyer and ask what he recommends. The way I see it shes interfering with your custody times. Another approach is to absolutely  NOT reply. Let her call as long or how many times that she wants to. If you do talk to her then he needs to remind her that she cant keep calling like this and you have to go. Do NOT answer her questions. You may want to notify the new husband of the harassing calls or texts. However your BF responding only makes this worse. All drama can be stopped and prevented. But not making changes will only add fuel to the drama fire. If this were me Id file a police report and threaten a restraining order. Showing the police officer the documents etc from the past weekmonth. She may threaten less custody and such but with your police report and proof of the calls and bad texts the judge will laugh at her. Another thing if the phone records show calls as ANSWERED amp for  minutes long then it shows nothing is wrong. But the ignored calls and texts will help your case. ,relationship_advice,cr5nsmr,1,t5_2r0cn

If your  year relationship is solid you will find a good balance between your friend and SO.  If there are underlying issues talk to your partner about them.Inviting your SO out for drinks with your friend shows him that youre not hiding anything.  It allows him to see that everything is above board and strictly friendship based.  Inviting him out with you also gives him an opportunity to tell you how he feels.Knowing that you spend so much time with this person at work already could really play up and activate any insecurities your SO has.  If he declines to join you for drinks listen to his reasoning why first and then decide if you want to skip a night out and make your SO feel like theyre the centre of your universe again.  If youre making special time for your friend ensure youre also putting the same effort into making time with your SO.  If he sees you planning nights out for a buddy and not him I can appreciate his feelings of being left out of your life.There are lots of things you can do to include your SO in your life while continuing the Bromance.

3982695,0,t3_362vxt,Im curious as to what you do for her outside of the bedroom? Are you still courting her? Taking her out? Giving her nonsexual affection? Compliments cuddles gifts going out of your way to do chores even.Oftentimes women show love and want to receive love in ways other than sex. While a man often views sex as the main showing of love. If she feels like youre putting in no extra effort outside the bedroom then she may put none inside.Perhaps plan something intimate between the two of you. Surprise her with a night on the town and a hotel room after. Or a trip to the ocean or riverside hotel with an outdoor hike and romantic dinner? There are plenty of options. Has it been a while since you have shown a gesture like this? Tell her over dinner what you love about her and ask her something that hasnt been talked about in a while. Listen to her. Im not saying you have been doing anything wrong. Im simply saying after  years you still need to treat her like a girlfriend just like she needs to treat you like a boyfriend. If you have been then perhaps she needs to talk to someone professionally. But really look at what youre doing too. You may think youre doing a lot so may she but youre both probably not. One of you needs to get the ball rolling and its probably going to have to be you.,relationship_advice,cra9gla,1,t5_2r0cn

It wont happen overnight and youll find a few duds out there in your search but it will happen eventually. And as for having kids there are plenty of women out there that are going through a similar situation and thinking the same thing. Of course there will be some women who arent willing to take on the role of being a mother figure and it wont work out but I assure you there are plenty of great women out there who would love to be in your life and include your boys in theirs. Dont give up hope! Just remember to let this experience refine you not define you. Im so sorry youre going through this its so much harder than you can probably explain but there is something so much better waiting for you on the other side of this experience. Someone like your wife will never be truly happy because shes obviously looking for satisfaction in temporary situations. Shell learn her lesson but by that time youll be happy without her. Again Im sorry this is happening but I think once the fog clears youll feel so much better and be much more optimistic about your future with your boys.

You let your SO get away with shit that you should of nipped in the bud from the FIRST and now its too late to fix it.Explain the concept of propriety to her and let her know its your way or the high way.  She will NOT comply because young people who arent already into propriety will not change to suit their SO Ive seen it so many times before.

Having all of your money to buy things to impress other people that you dont care about is one of the worst things you can do. You can still have your Mercedes nice house nice vacations and such. gtbut the truth is that I keep telling him he should be more ambitious and aim higher in lifeCar dealers have a rough time. But his salary definitely means hes a go getter. And does very well for himself. Sales is not some scrummy job. Wow. Are you joking? Its one thing to not be in love with someone but to rule them out because their high salary isnt monumental as theres is very shallow. You should definitely break up with him because youll rule his life sooner or later. And believe me your racism is definitely met with others laughing at you thinking some symbol on your car makes you better than anyone else. What a joke. Think outside the box.

And have fun raising brats that only love you for your money . TIL Im racist towards persians!! Youre a C. Buying materials like fancy clothes with fancy labels doesnt give you style. Having someone come to decorate your house doesnt give you artsy craft style. Buying vacations doesnt mean youre fun or adventurous. Paying for fancy meals doesnt mean youre in good shape. Paying for a tow truck because youre stranded on the side of the road doesnt mean you made it. It just means you forgot to put gas in the tank. Paying someone and being ripped off doenst mean youre luxurious it means you dont have street smarts. These streets arent eh back alleys either. People laugh when they see someone with Nike Shoes rhinestone jeans flaming belt fancy labeled shirt and a logo printed hat. Shows youre insecure or dont have any style. You have blinders on so bad that its only going to hurt you. Just because your family popped you out of their vagina doesnt mean youre successful. It means your entire childhood or life is full of tainted  hopes and goals. Im all for nice things but its rather sad going into a house and being given a tour to show off your toys or k rug.

Although i have been married for  years and have a  year old daughter and a  year old son I am more affectionate and sexual than I was at .  I know father time will turn me into a wrinkled old man in  years so I have this desire to express my sexual nature whenever the opportunity presents itself.My marriage has since the birth of my son in  been a series of  reluctant commitments between us both.  Me to her Yes if I have to I will go to your work happy hour.  Her to me  Yes if I have to we can have sex if you finish in  minutes or less. And then you come along....  You smile when you walk past my office door.  You compliment the new shirt I wore on Friday.  My wife would never notice if I bought a new shirt.  At  I am not dead in side.  In fact although I have a few extra pounds and my biceps dont bulge like when I was  I know what women appreciate and can carry a fascinating conversation for hours on end.But dont get me wrong whether you are  or  you still make me tingle when you give me that demure glance and flirtatious flip of the hair.  Every man no matter the age wants to be wanted.  We notice that.  In fact I notice it more now than when when I was .But here is what restrains us.  If we corner you in the supply room if we approach you at the holiday party if we invite you out to happy hour we put our job at risk.  A much older man approaching a much younger woman in the joint workplace is career suicide.  So we flirt we come talk to you we ask you to perform inane analysies just so you can come sit in our office and we can be near you without being too creepy but we know it isnt right and we cant take it to the next level.  Also if I were to fall in love to someone else I would have to pay  a month in alimony to my future exwife.  That changes my economic reality immediately.,relationship_advice,crg3l40,6,t5_2r0cn

All human want to fuck other humans and sometimes we mess up in a monogamous relationship.  All of us mess up in relationships one way or another and no relationship can survive long term without a lot of forgiveness on both sides.Depending on the situation and the work he is willing to do to fix things see if it would be possible to try to be understanding and forgive him and work on the relationship.  If this is something that is not possible break up and one of you moves out.  Couples do this all the time.  Its a pain and theres a lot of shit to take care of but its very common and banal.

This seems like a kid who really needs someone who actually cares in his life. Show that you give a shit about him that you really care about him. When he tests this by lashing out dont give up on him. Discipline him when you can but also reward him when you can or just do something nice just because. Like take him out to his favorite fast food place. But if he starts whining turn around and go home. If you want this kid to listen to you hes got to respect you first. One way you can earn a kids respect is by fair and honest rewards and punishments. Another way is whats called unconditional regard.

As long as you continue to communicate and respect each other the change will be good. One thing that is difficult when moving in with an SO is remembering that your lives dont have to be linked in every aspect  hes allowed to go bowling with the guys and youre allowed to have ladies night out. You dont have to always be watching TV together cooking together shopping together. Although all of these can be awesome just not all the time.   My biggest piece of advice for you is dont resist the change. Facilitate it nurture it help it along in the right direction. Dont view it as change  view it as growth. Growing together as a couple is a wonderful exciting thing.   So yes your relationship will change.

She is acting the way a depressed person would.What can you do?Help her regain her sense of selfesteem. Help her regain her sense of agency. Look at natural ways of fighting depression and use all of them. Our lifestyles encourage depression. We sit in all day dont make or talk to friends outside of work avoid nature and are sheepish when it comes to failure or confrontation. She needs to fight for what she loves but she first has to believe that its within her reach. Agency and self esteem. Good luck to you both. I am where she is and her reply is hilarious to me because Ive used it plenty of time or something along those lines.She cares enough to tell that shell try but when she looks at herself and her life she doesnt see the point in trying she thinks its guaranteed to fail so she wont. Its hilarious to me because its the most sincere bowl of crap depression could offer. Well start the attempt but then lay back down for a nap. Thats easier. She has something on her mind I think. Something in life shes afraid to face or something that shes running away from. Something that she never dealt with emotionally maybe. Deal with that and youve tackled the true issue. Everything else is a symptom. Our environments can encourage the symptoms to get worse so do fight the symptoms as well w everything I mentioned above. The symptoms add to the notion that our idea is true and perpetuate further symptomatic behavior. So if you do not show symptomatic behavior to an idea then you dont believe the idea to be as bad as you once thought. It didnt create symptoms so it cant be that bad right? Sorry if thats confusing. If you perceive your future to be terrible due to a challenge but your future is enjoyable then the challenge cannot be as difficult as you once imagined. Had the challenge truly defeated you then you would not be enjoying yourself.

However theses tests are only effective as early as  days after being late i say two weeks to be sure. Therefore your only option to be sure is to wait. I cant tell you that  shes not pregnant though I can say she has a probability of  of being baby free. What I can tell you is that if you rush and try a test now its probably not going to be accurate. I suggest that you talk to your girl and make a deal that by this Friday if shes not a weapon of mass menstruation ask if shes willing to take a pregnancy test.This is where it may get trickyfrustrating because no matter how stressed you are no matter how SCARED you are. You can not can NOT force her to take the test. When all is said and done its her body and she has the final say on what shes going to do with it.

4241986,0,t3_39hln2,I like the letters idea someone posted! As for what to do before what does she enjoy doing? If you live together you could decorate your room so that its romantic when you come back after a date. You could go on a weekend trip to the beach or a lake or something. Just go on a date and walk around and spend time. Have a picnic. I think the most important thing is that you get time to just be together and spend quality time before that time is put on hold.,relationship_advice,cs3s0zj,2,t5_2r0cn
4242597,0,t1_cs3u3t9,Yeah I mean you can pick holes in the hypothetical if you want sure. But notice that you have an understanding of how the world is that you use to distinguish the cases  to you the deciding factor in this case is whether youre sharing the space. You imagine probably correctly that OPs concern is about having to share this space because she feels good in a clean space and if hes messing up the shared space all the time thats not working. And so to you the car example is different because its separate spaces so it cant affect the car husbands feelings. Cool that makes sense. Another possibility is that OP is deeply concerned about people coming over to their house and she imagines those people will have a negative reaction when they see the mess. So maybe shed be fine with the bedroom being a pigsty as long as the door is closed since no one would see that. In that case the car example is identical because hypothetical car husband thinks that both cars in their shared driveway reflect on them as people and he is deeply concerned about other people seeing that mess because he imagines theyll have a negative reaction just like OP might imagine a visitors negative reaction to the house mess.Whats important here is that everyone has values and perspectives and they are all valid in that all make sense to themselves. There is no ultimate truth about how clean houses or cars should be or what reaction other people will have to how clean your stuff is or how you should personally feel about your stuff or other peoples stuff. All of this is just perspectives and I find that we do better when we try to understand each others perspectives from the inside and work with them from that place of understanding rather than from a place of judgement and blame. Thats what Im advocating here.,relationship_advice,cs3uinj,2,t5_2r0cn

If its a state that requires a class or something I can pay for it. I can fly him out for interviews no problem.If we knew that we were going to be apart for one year and then be together again Id be less afraid. One year is a finite defined period of time not that long in the grand scheme of things and with frequent visits it wouldnt be too terrible. What freaks me out is that lord knows how long how many years it could be before he can find a job and join me. He says he tried for three years to get a teaching job in a city about four hours from us in state and couldnt. If its a state that requires teachers to have a masters degree were S.o.L. He already said he doesnt want to let me support him while he gets a masters. Even if were married by then. I just cant understand why he wouldnt jump at the opportunity. Hes always wanted to go back to school and get his masters and PhD. Im offering him the ability to do that without worrying about working at the same time so he can just focus on school. But he says hed feel emasculated letting me take care of him. Its  plenty of women are in highpaying careers that let them support a spouse and theres nothing wrong with being a man whose female romantic partner can support him while he goes to school. I want that opportunity for him. Hes worked so hard his whole life he deserves it! Im trying to hand the man his dream on a silver platter and hes not taking it. I dont know what more I can do. Oh and I dont consider it downgrading myself. This man is the one I was meant to be with for all of my life and Im willing to make sacrifices for our relationship.

One level is just to be kind to a fellow human while the other is to win their favor and attract them  youre likely doing the latter. You cant be polite and hope to get something in return the key is to disconnect from the outcome. The days where I am able to do that are the days where I get the most interest. Two things have radically changed this for me  I meditate every day and highly recommend the Headspace app as its what I used to get started. This has allowed my to tell when Im allowing an external influence how someone sees me to change my behavior.  Every day before I leave the house I remind myself I am fulfilled.

But I have gotten a lot better about the jealousy since we first started dating and a few different things helped me.  Knowing that this is just what guys do.  I was never able to wrap my head around it but they can separate sex and emotion better than most of us women can so that when they watch porn its really just about getting their rocks off and not about wanting to be with that girl more in any way. . Even if you did look like one of those girls he would still keep watching porn and looking at other women.  Humans in general just crave that variety but a good person will know that looking and not acting on it is the way to go.. My boyfriend isnt my complete physical ideal at all. I see men who are closer to that ideal all the time.

She is on GAPS gluten and grain free. Eats only organic high quality food.I feel like even though we are living together we are good at taking time for ourselves.

4375322,0,t1_csiltyb,Maybe you changed into the person you THOUGHT I needed. Years ago when all of a sudden you became more distant didnt respond as much to my efforts of affection etc I didnt need that. I needed someone who would be tender affectionate loving and warm. Someone who wanted me. And I told you those things many times. You were trying to be the head of household but all I ever wanted was a partner in crime. When it didnt change after our first year of marriage or the second or the third or the fourth I decided I was the one who needed to change. So I grew a shell. I realized some of my expectations were unfair. Just because you were that way when we met didnt mean you would always be that way right? Right. So if I wanted the marriage to work and be happy I was the one who needed to have different expectations.Now its all turned on its ear. Im still struggling to catch up. Im so sorry you havent been happy for a long time. This is one of those things where my instinct is to blame myself. If you havent been happy for a long time what have I been doing wrong?I feel terrible that youve felt this way and that Ive made you afraid to bring it up. I love you. I want you to be happy.

4388211,1,t3_3b9xva,Agree with the other commenters thus far . Stop all physical intimacy. Heroin is nasty as fuck. . Get her help to get her clean. As an individual youre free to run away and hide. Thats totally your call. If it was me though and I loved her which you stated you do I think you could be a good influence for her to help get clean and stop using. Obviously you cant force her into anything but if she doesnt comply then you can rest easy knowing that youve done all you can. . Regardless of whether or not you decide to stay with her or help her help herself you should contact her family or friends basically whoever shes close with. Getting someone clean shouldnt be a oneman operation and you might need to get her family or friends in on the intervention committee. Most addicts are willing to change at the drop of a hat but having a united family front might just do the trick. Im sorry if Im not much help because Im not a doctor or an expert in any way just some asshat on the internet. But Ive had a few family members have serious issues with addiction and I wish I wouldcould have done more right away.

There are obviously positives in the relationship as well focus and build on those. Also do probably the hardest thing of all and talk. Tell her what you like about her but also what is irritating you. She wont adjust her behaviour if she doesnt realise it is an issue. In this conversation be ready to hear her criticisms also and dont get defensive just listen acknowledge and work together to resolve or compromise.

This will relax him enough to be comfortable with his and your naked body. skype calls where you guys get each other off. This will help him get more comfortable seeing you as a sexual creature while hes in the comfort of his own home and you can tell him your erogenous zones and what turns you on without him having the pressure to perform. watch porn together. No judgments! If hes been alone for a while and is more comfortable with porn its a great way to open him up in the bedroom. When you guys do have sex blindfold him and let him relax while you play with him and perform oral sex on him. Get him hard enough then ride him. Again this takes the pressure off him to perform Of course eventually hes gonna have to contribute in the bedroom so hopefully by this point hell be comfortable enough with you and know you well enough to be able to perform sexually in the bedroom. Try new things toys positions and places to have sex. Last resort  Viagra.Source I dated a guy with erectile dysfunction and managed to improve our sex life to a point where he could regularly get up to hour erections without meds!.

4399351,0,t3_3bcgjc,I had a similar situation with my dad when I was  though the ruined object was much less sentimental. I had a nice expensive bike that had some unpainted metal bits. It looked good but my dad was insistent we paint over the metal bits to prevent rusting. I was adamant that that was not acceptable since I would be using this bike a lot and wanted it to look good. One day I was at his place with it my parents are separated and my mom was the one who bought me the bike but couldnt take it home for some reason I think it was raining so we drove but it wouldnt fit in the car. I did not trust him one bit so made him promise to not touch it while I was gone otherwise I would be taking it home despite the conditions. He did but of course broke the promise and painted over the metal with a disgusting purplegrey. Eventually he tossed me  to buy myself a new bike way less than it was worth after I refused to ride it anywhere but still does not admit he was wrong to do it. Im still angry with him for it. I couldnt exactly break up with my dad but the resentment I have about the incident still  years later may be a clue to you. And my item was replaceable  with enough money I could have bought the same or a comparable bike. You cant do that so I can only imagine the deep pain and anger you have. I dont trust my dad with my stuff and that will never change. Think about how much you trust your boyfriend to respect your wishes in the future because of this incident.If he shows remorse and realizes just how much he hurt you  and admits that he should have listened to you about what you want with your stuff  he may be worth forgiving. But if he calls you ungrateful for his efforts I know I would not stand for it. ,relationship_advice,csljhxd,1,t5_2r0cn

4400915,0,t1_csllawa,Hello I would just like to add a couple of words regarding your post. I think the advice given is sound and I also think you are on the right track with waiting for him to come around. Money can be a huge distraction in a relationship. I have been there done that. However if he has a massive inheritance and theres still money left after your travels there may be another reason for his commitment issues. Take a look at your day to day dealings with him. Look at your emotional and physical attractions. Is it the same as before when you were both traveling together? It seems that is where you were happy. Maybe try to get that feeling back by taking short weekend trips from time to time.  to  jobs are a bit to get use too. If your weekends are free try to use that time for short trips with him and see if it helps. Another thing if traveling is one of the things you two love to do thats great but shouldnt be the only thing you two love to do together. Try to find other things you two can enjoy. Build on that because it may be cheaper than traveling. Bottom line if you truly love him and he loves you then eventually he will come around. Try not to nag him about marriage. Let him figure it out. When he gets to the point where he gets it he will propose. Continue to provide him emotional and physical support as a partner until such time as you feel your not getting the same in return. If that happens then thats a whole new can of worms. ,relationship_advice,cslpufj,1,t5_2r0cn

4404581,0,t3_3bh7mr,I have been in your shoes before the weird thing was that she was a bad backseat driver she would panic and yell  I would talk to her and talk to her about it always nice about it but the last straw was when she scared the shit out of me and almost causing an accident. I did stop the car and yelled at her told her to get out of the fucking car it was my car and walk home. we were a few blocks from home when she got home I had to lay it on the line either she drives or I drive and shuts the fuck up.So it may come to this stick up for yourself.But is this the only micromanging behaviour ? if its not then I would think twice about marrying a micromanager they will make your life a living hell . If it is the only thing then every couple has a thing pet peeves you need to work through or agree to disagree.Micromanagers cant help themselves so with something like driving you may need him to shut the fuck up because you likely wont get him to stop thinking about it just to keep it to himself.,relationship_advice,csm4qdz,15,t5_2r0cn

Sounds very typical of it its the first thing that came to mind.Let me know if this video reminds you of herGood example of the culture. Note its WAY more popular out east but is gaining popularity out west in north america and etc. It originated in Japan and has been spreading like wild fire.Also chances are if this is the case her boyfriend enjoys it and finds it fun and respects her lifestyle.Also its not a sexy thing most likely.

My bf has mentioned in the past NOT wanting to get married at all and since marriage is the only reason I date it caused a huge rift. I could see how she could worry if he doesnt know in  years will he ever know? I would suggest a modest promise ring. In school is not the right time to get married. But I promise you are the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  and then set a date.

4474462,0,t3_3ccz1g,Abuse can happen years down the road just because it hasnt happened yet doesnt mean it wont. Its a comfort thing when a abuser gets comfortable around you and feelsknows that you love them and wouldnt leave them they start showing their true colors because their comfortable. You basically are walking on eggshells now due to this event because if you ask him and he gets offended you dont know how hell react he might get offended or feel pressured which could lead to another event like this one and if you break up with him that too could lead to an event. So get out while you can. Do it secretly change your number block him off of all social media and if you leave it is probably best not to tell your friends where you are because in the end it would do more damage then good for them because he could hurt them trying to find you but do warn them to contact the police if they even see him at their door. The red flag wasnt when he was choking you it was him not stopping after you obviously made it clear you didnt like it breaking the door down and not allowing you to gather your thoughts and making sure you werent alone and last but certainty not least he begged you not stay with your friend. He knew if you had time to yourselfwith a friend that you would be considering leaving or possibly going to the police. The breakfast was just a Please forgive me it wont ever happen again Im so sorry well at least that is what he wanted you to think but really it was him manipulating you and fooling you to believe that he felt bad about it which the first time they do feel somewhat guilty but if you stay you are letting him win and proving that you will forgive him if he says Sorry It will never happen again. but it will happen again and continue happening then the next thing you know your in a abusive relationship. It all happens very fast and it all could be prevented if you show him that you will NOT stand for it. The only way to show him that you wont stand for it is by leaving a abuser gets his power from a weak women not leaving. Make him get some help I know leaving someone you love is hard but if you can get him help maybe you dont have to stay away from him forever but you certainly do not want to live with him showing this kind of behavior. Leave dont give him the benefit of the doubt and risk your life because it hasnt ever happened. He prioritized his needs before your safety which is already a good enough reason to leave everything else that happened just added  fuel to the fire.

I even find it kind of ridiculous that you could interpret it that way. Clearly you have an agenda and getting advice is not it. That chip on your shoulder is blinding you from the reality of what is being said.gt but the fact I have mutual friends who agree he is wrong for her is not okay  how dare we want better for her!Again not even close to what I said. Let me copypaste what I actually wrote about this topic in hopes you will be able to follow alongFriends who talk behind each others backs arent really friends worth having.andTalking behind her back or even humoring it is a very immature and hurtful thing to do to someone you call a friend.gt I honestly dont understand that logic but okay.The logic is that judging someone and talking behind their back is not a friendly thing to do. It also gives you no moral high ground over your friends judging you. gt I dont think youd like her either as she sometimes talks about people behind their backs.Her being a shitty person doesnt justify you being a shitty person.gt I do love her and feel she deserves a man who can refrain from stealing and boozing and trying to fuck me.Thats great. Now find a way to express that to her that doesnt come off as immature and rude.gt  I see your point he is a great guy and im total shit as a friend. OH WELL It is really sad that you feel so entitled that you need to invent arguments to feed this growing chip on your shoulder. You have an unhealthy obsession with being right that you cant see when you are wrong. It is causing you to lash out at people who arewere genuinely trying to help you. Just because the advice wasnt exactly what you were hoping to hear doesnt change that nor does it make it wrong.You wanted advice you got advice. It is time for inward reflection because the reason you are single is you. It isnt your standards it is your personality. That gigantic chip on your shoulder is stopping you from moving forward and succeeding in certain facets of your life. Until this chip on your shoulder is removed you are far from a catch for any potential suitor. It sounds like your friend and sister have realized this just dont want to hurt your already fragile emotions. They have to deal with you a lot more often than people on here. Thats why you are hearing a lot of repetition about the problem being you and your attitude. ,relationship_advice,csyiohb,2,t5_2r0cn
4505614,0,t3_3csq5b,This happened with me and my best guy friend in college Im  now.  He was in love with me all of college despite both of us dating other people.  In the midst of our freshmen year he made his feelings clear to me but I loved him like a brother not a significant other.  It broke my heart that he was hurting but he wanted to continue spending time with me as a friend and for the most part that worked.  We never fooled around or anything of that sort but he would do little things for me like when I was sick he would randomly show up at my apartment with soup amp water.One day after returning from winter break our senior year I walked over to his apartment to say hey and he was gone...his apartment was cleared out.  He never said a word to me over break except occasional chats and wishing each other Merry Christmas.  I freaked out and tried to get a hold of him worried that something happened to him.  Even though I wasnt in love with him I still deeply cared for him.  No response for six months...and then out of the blue he called me and told me he had flunked out of school completely hid this from me.  He also told me he could no longer be friends with me that it was too painful to spend time with me or talk to me.  I was crushed...Its been about  years since the last time we spoke.  Found out via facebook he married his longtime girlfriend who he was with for a couple of the years he was in love with me.  I do still miss him but at the same time I understand why he had to cut ties which is what you need to do.  The only way you can move on from this girl is to completely cut her out of your life.  I have no doubt that will be painful but you deserve to be happy and give yourself the chance to find someone who will reciprocate your love.,relationship_advice,csyl054,3,t5_2r0cn

There must be another thing beneath that  I cannot believe that you will make his life such uncomfortable because of doing work at home for only two days while he apparently is having a bad time for whatever reason in his life.He is letting himself go see debit card and while that may be a problem maybe it is because you are making such a big deal of all those petty things.He told you to get help a month ago and yet you nag about him not coming home etc. etc. Maybe he needs just some air to breathe dear. And even though I do not know any of you there might be a chance you two get your shit together because initially you were on a talking level and you agreed on seeking help with your relationship.He is drunk he is not himself  he is very unhappy and you as well. Breathe a little bit think about the points that have gone wrong and how you could improve your relationship  also your wishes for his side. He seems to have given up trying for now but you are asking here for advice so I assume you have a bit more strength now.Let him sober up give him some time to breathe and think about how he feels and thinks about your marriage and then talk.

4534436,0,t3_3d5mpz,Hey man.  Im sorry you have to go through this.  Having been through a divorce myself Ill offer you a little advice.First thing you need to do is find an attorney who specializes in family law  even better if they specialize in fathers rights.  Google is your friend and fine one in your state and even your county as laws around divorce can change even from county to county.  If you have any MALE friends who have had a divorce ask them for recommendations.Request a free consultation.  Go in tell them EVERYTHING and leave nothing out.  They will tell you what to do.  You do everything that they tell you to do.  I know you said you dont want to fuck her over but remember there is a difference between protecting yourself and hurting her.  Only give her the legal minimum for your state and county in child support and alimony and request shared custody.  Id consider that generous for what she has done.Do not move out until your attorney tells you its okay to do so.  Do not discuss what you are doing with your wife.  If possible put on a face like nothing is wrong but do not give in to her physical advances.  You suddenly have a case of migraines.  You are a rock now and you let your attorney steer what you do.  Heres the thing about all divorces.  They suck.  They are hard they hurt and you will go through depression.  When I went through mine I lived by one rule.  Everything I did everything I said was in the best interest of my daughter.  Shit is going to get stirred up.  Dont get sucked into it.  NEVER say anything bad about your ex in front of your children and do not let your friends or family badmouth her in front of your kids.  She may be a lying cheat but she is still their mother and those kids have a right to love their mother even if you do not.  And if she tries to hold your kids hostage as mine did you take it to your attorney because you can get a temporary visitation order declared.Your entire world is going to be torn apart.  It is not going to be fun.  Having little ones involved is going to be hard.  After a while though you start to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  You find a new life without the cheating ex.  You can find happiness with your kids.Good luck brother.  Stay strong and focus on those girls.,relationship_advice,ct275lq,62,t5_2r0cn

I have a mind that tends to obsess too. The thing Ive learned to do is not feed the monster. What I mean by that is if you are feeling insecure or empty inside dont try and fix things by snooping or looking for evidence. Turn your back on it and say Im giving her the benefit of the doubt until something happens that is blatantly off. Even then you should ask her whats going on. You need to learn to trust more and stop trying to control the situation she is either going to be a loyal caring partner or she will not. Time is going to bear that out you will be OK no matter what happens. Let it go.

4563965,0,t3_3dgv7x,Well and what do you mean a condition similar to epilepsy? Does she have seizures? And what type? And what is she refusing treatment for? The epilepsy or the issues she had in her last relationship? If its her seizures then that is super dangerous. Not having some sort of treatment can be really damaging not only to her brain but also to her body. I know I have fallen and hurt my shoulders and damaged my face and had to get stitches and Im on medication. On the flip side one of my greatest fears is that someone would not accept me because I have a seizure disorder. That they would view it as a large burden. Yes we want to be respected as a normal person and not just seen as a disability but understand there are things you dont go through. Ways you could never be affected.

4576712,0,t3_3dmypz,Not cool.In fact it is borderline emotional abuse.It isnt even all that borderline.I would say he has a point if you have part time work.  But you dont.  You work full time.  He works full time.  So while it is nice that his career lets him bring home more cash he isnt actually working any more or harder than you are....which implies to me that the home life work the chores ought to be split somehow  exactly seldom works but it ought to be pretty close.  I particularly dont get the cooking thing because my mate and I either alternate cooking sometimes one us has just had it and needs a night off and the other will dive in and take over the meal prep or more often we prepare dinner together because we both love cooking and we love doing it together to the point that I got us a pair of nice chef knives so we can both chop stuff at the same time.  Ditto on the cleanup  we both work in the kitchen together putting stuff away and washing up until the decks are cleared and ready to go for the next meal.  Its nice to have the together time after work.Thats us though  nevertheless a more equitable division of labor should be the order of the day.

Our generation is quickly rushing into this growing world many with set goals and the possibilities are so endless that one can get discouraged and feel down because they are but a small voice in a sea of people. I can say that I am among those that will postpone everything due to the sheer fact that when I am faced with this overwhelming obstacle as life I try to avoid it and pretend that I am living in the moment. Thats what I think is happening as well. The realization that your life is quickly translating into an adult independent life and simply not knowing how to handle it or what to do with it.Im still dealing with it hell I dont think Im even close and it has been eating at me because I feel so unfulfilled amongst those around you.

Am I missing some legal thing here or is she unable to provide for those kids? Will she be able to regain custody of those kids? If shes a basket case and couldnt care for her kids that would change the risk calculation for you.This is really complicated stuff so theres no way to tell how dangerous the situation is for you. If the husband is determined enough to get to her a restraining order sure as hell wont stop him  but I feel like it cant be THAT easy for a guy fresh out of prison to get across the Canadian border.I cant guess her feelings towards the guy either and that makes a big difference especially in abuse cases. Its a good sign that she broke the cycle of abuse and sent him to prison though. If youre going to pursue this I would take things really slowly for the first several even  months until you get a feel for how ready she is to move on with a new man.

4655516,0,t3_3ep03u,My brother took SEVEN years to propose to his nowwife. Lucky for him she waited until he was ready. Everyone is different and everyone has their own timeline. Your SO and his friend are not the same person dont paint with a broad brush. Plus children of divorce can have a really rough time jumping into such a commitment when they have lived with a very dark and messy side of it. Your SO didnt grow up with his aunts and uncles did he? If not dont use them as a reason to make your case it just looks pushy. My parents are divorced and it took me YEARS to even want to be married. For me in my teenage years marriage was husband cheats on wife wife is bitter and cold about it husband is mean to wife when hes had a few drinks wife calls him an alcoholic couple fights constantly about money. Forgive me but it has taken a LOT of time to get past my first impression of marital bliss.I would ask your SO how he views marriage. In general. If I were waiting for a ring Id want to know what reservations or fears my SO had that was keeping him from popping the question. Not out of a hurry lets get this thing over with mentality but out of concern and unconditional love. He might open up a bit about whats really bugging him. That said you also get to decide who you have a relationship with. IF he wont even try to communicate or its a matter of wanting the chance to see other people etc. you dont have to wait a decade for him to figure out what he wants. I agree with the other poster if is a perfectly good way to subtly put your foot down about playing pretend. If all he gives you is an occasional when we get married I wouldnt see that as a commitment at all. Without directly stating that he sees marrying you or at least talks about any baggage he has about the subject it just comes across as appeasing you intermittently so he can keep on with the life he has. You have concerns and without something concrete to go on he shouldnt belittle or avoid your feelings. Id start with asking him about how he feels as if youre a third party. And stick with it for as long as you can part of in sickness and in health is looking out for their wellbeing over your ego. If that doesnt work assert yourself. If he cant man up and talk about it then woman up and tell him you worry that hell never make up his mind.

4667813,0,t3_3evd28,Three months after a very painful breakup is much too soon to start a new serious relationship.  There are no hard and fast rules but given that the breakup wasnt your choice and you were presumably still in love with your ex at the time it happened three months is very quick and its likely you were still grieving.A new girl appearing in your life whom you could focus on was nothing more than a rebound relationship for you.  You were able to take those feelings of attachment you still had for your ex and project them onto your girlfriend.  You assumed she had all the good qualities of your ex.  This is what an emotional rebound is.  Youre dating someone while also not really seeing them for who they actually are.  This is why it sucks so much to be the person who is unintentionally a rebound that person never cared for you as a person they cared about how you made them feel.  Many people think a rebound is something you intentionally set out to do.  The whole to get over someone get under someone new.  Thats a physical rebound and thats a choice.  Emotional rebounds are not usually a straightforward choice but it is still using another person to help get over someone else.  People dont usually know that theyre in an emotional rebound which is why theyre so painful.  There are no villains to blame the only thing to do is to learn from it and not do it again for both people  rebounder and reboundee.gtShes tried to break up with me a couple times now during especially emotional fits and sometimes I feel like the only reason Im still in it is a combination of physical chemistry and a fear of my life falling apart again if we were to break up.Id also posit that given that she is uncertain it also makes you want to win and hold onto her in order to preserve your ego.  If she were  certain about being with you its likely youd be less interested in holding this together.  I think you just dont want to be left again.gtTheres a lot of positives to dating her but Im having a really hard time appreciating them.Because youve got no reason to appreciate them.  You dont value her so you dont value what shes bringing to the relationship.  Theres really nothing that can be done about this once the toothpaste is out of the tube.  gtNow the thought of my ex gives me the same anxiety that I had last summer. I cant really log on to FB or I start panicking. I started ignoring her emails and contact but that hasnt really made me feel better. To be feeling this anxiety a year later isnt normal.  Im guessing your girlfriend helped you stall your grieving process which felt good in the shortterm but was bad for you in the longterm because youre still stalled.  Grief doesnt just go away if you manage to temporarily escape it.  Its still there waiting for you.Block your ex everywhere.  You need the control over her suddenly poking her head into your life to find relief from your anxiety.  The uncertainty is driving it so do something to help yourself and make it so she cant pop in and out of your life.  This isnt a selfish thing it is a matter of taking care of yourself.  Once someone ends a relationship with you their feelings about your choices are no longer your concern.  Tough shit if they want to be friends and you cant handle it.  Your priority needs to shift to only taking care of yourself and meeting your own needs.  Otherwise you extend your own grieving period and why would you want to do that to yourself?gtI cant really give my current GF the emotional satisfaction she wants i.e. romanticism and I cant tell if its because I cant let go of my last relationship or because thats how Ive always been or if Im just not capable of a healthy relationship. Because youre in a rebound relationship havent fully grieved your past which means yes youre not capable of a healthy relationship at this time.  You cant be romantic toward your girlfriend because now that the honeymoon period is over youre no longer able to project who you want her to be onto her.  You see her for who she is and its not actually that appealing to you.  The things that attracted you arent really there because they never were.  This is a textbook emotional rebound.  And it totally sucks for her but keep in mind that she was adult who made a choice to leave one relationship which was dead it sounds like and it was her choice to end it and get into one with a heartbroken man three months out of a breakup.  That wasnt good decision making on her part either and youre not responsible for that.  She made choices and though she couldnt see the consequences at the time these are the consequences.  Do not stay out of any guilt you feel.  Guilt is ultimately a selfish emotion.Both you and your girlfriend seem like youre more afraid to be alone than you are into being with one another.  Id urge you to think long and hard about whether you see a future with your girlfriend and if you dont end it soon.  Dont hang onto one another like the other person is a life raft.  It doesnt work that way as youve seen. Then be aware that because you went for dating someone new to escape your grief from your breakup youre probably going to sink back into the grieving process once your life raft is gone.  This is something scary that youve been avoiding with your new relationship but it is something you need to do if you ever want to heal and be able to move on into a new healthy relationship with someone you want to be with.Breakups are a fact of life.  Almost everyone has had their heart broken.  The ones who go on to find happiness have dealt with their grief in productive ways that helped them to grow as people.  The people who seem to be perpetually unhappy or choosing inappropriate partners over and over are people who are avoiding dealing with their own issues.  ,relationship_advice,ctixjmu,1,t5_2r0cn

4715333,0,t3_3figry,Have you spoken to your girlfriend about how it makes you feel when she hangs out with K?  The first step is making sure that your girlfriend knows that you think there is an issue you cant expect her to make any changes if she doesnt know that youre uncomfortable with whats happening.  It sounds like she is trying to open the conversation by asking you if you are mad.  I made this very mistake with a girlfriend once she asked me directly if I was mad and I said I wasnt even though I totally was because I was too afraid to have an honest conversation about what I was mad about and what it meant for us.  Dont be accusing try something like when you hang out with K it makes me feel upset and hurt.Your girlfriends reaction will be the determinant here and you have to prepare yourself for the possibility that she may give you the answer youre fearing to hear.  If you tell her that it makes you feel hurt when she hangs out with K and shes apologetic and offers to not hang out with K or agrees to make sure shes finished talking to K for the day before whatever time the two of you have agreed to hang out then great!  You have a girlfriend who is interested in putting your relationship ahead of her friendship with K and who is willing to listen to and respect your boundaries in return of course you should listen to and respect her boundaries as well.If as you probably fear your girlfriend says anything like you cant tell me who to hang out with or youre overreacting or youre just jealous or otherwise indicates that you are in the wrong to want her to limit her time with K or that youre misunderstanding the nature of her relationship with K then bad news.  You have a girlfriend who is controllingmanipulative or who is more willing to take Ks word for what people are like than to trust her own judgment or who really does value her friendship with K more than her relationship with you.  If this is the case you will need to ask yourself to what extent you are willing to take a back seat in this relationship or how long youre willing to put up with it for.  You might think that you want to be with your girlfriend so much that youre willing to accept whatever time she gives you after shes done hanging out with K but I tried this once boyfriend had a close female friend who obviously meant more to him than me or any of his subsequent girlfriends did and it made me really really unhappy and he still dumped me in the end.I encourage you to do some reading to get a grasp on the difference between healthy boundarysetting in relationships and controllingmanipulative behaviour in relationships.  This is a mistake I made more than once in my early s.  Yes every good relationship is going to require some compromises but if you find that youre the one compromising to keep the peace every time thats not really the same.,relationship_advice,ctown8q,3,t5_2r0cn

4733834,0,t3_3fr8ts,I disagree with the other posters.So you went through an emotional upheaval and went through a slutty phase to get over it.Its something you want to put it behind you so put behind you and leave it there.I would tell her you dated casually and didnt find the one until now.I dont see it as lying I see it as privacy I made the mistake of danciing around something like this and it sounds vague so she will know your hiding something and wont let it go.But if you use a definitive white lie then the door is closed and leave it closed.See the thing is the people here strangers looking objectively understand what you went through many people do exactly the same thing then get back on track just like you did and you learned a valuable lesson as a result that in fact might be benificial to your relationships moving forward. So this new girl is there and she will say WTF you slept with  women before me ? im  I seriously doubt she will understand she wont see things objectively.So I say protect your privacy and tell a white lie I think there is a thing called discretion and this is when you use it.I will add a story of my own when I was young and naive and engaged with a marriage date set I befriended a girl in a class I was taking we all went for drinks after class we hit it off. She was a bartender she invited me to drop by sometime just as she gets off and we could have a drink. So I took her up on her offer but she made some excuse to go home so I went home with her she then said why not stay in since its raining and pulled the old let me slip into something more comforable with was a transparent nighty.She then proceeded to have a melt down and wanted me to stay eventually she made a move on me and I turned her down flat although she was very attractive and I would have fucked her in a second if I wasnt engaged. I left and when I left I was proud of what happened i faced the worst possible temptation and still turned it down. So I told my then fiancee she fucking flipped out and was freaking out at me for doing something so immoral going home to some bartenders place at  am and laying in bed with her. She threatend to break it off but eventually forgave me we married and then for the next  years she would pull this incident out of her back pocket and threw it back in my face.I regretted ever telling her if I could have done it all over I would not tell her.  ,relationship_advice,ctr8q9n,-1,t5_2r0cn

It sucks that she wont just be honest with you but unfortunately that seems to be a prevalent symptom of being young it wears off a little with every birthday. Really your very best bet is going to be to keep hanging out with her keep showing her how awesome you are and how awesome you two are together and let another opportunity present itself. Go out to play mini golf bowling play pool try geocaching the zoo find a hookah bar an aquarium... Id try and shy away from movies only because you cant chat her up and show off your awesomeness when youre sitting in silence in the dark  You mostly wanna do things where you guys are talking and laughing and joking together so she associates all those warm fuzzy smiley feelings with being around you.

Sometimes you just want to sit down and do absolutely nothing.The coffee is a much better date idea anyway.

What acts constitute cheating will vary between you your boyfriend and everyone here.The commonality of cheating is the lying.   Your boyfriend is trying to avoid the lying part and was upfront with you.Now you two need to decide what is cheating what isnt and whether this conduct is permissible.  You might say no and he wont do it and respect your wishes.  If he does those actions fall under cheating.  If this is minor and you can trust him not to act on pictures then its not cheating.  This type of openness may not be what youre looking for in a relationship. Adhering to conventional notions of cheating might not be his.  you two need to communicate and decide what those boundaries are.,relationship_advice,ctzkglp,1,t5_2r0cn

4901949,0,t1_cucbcxv,gt youve heard one side of the story and leapt to a conclusion. you also seem to presuppose that an affair is the worst possible situation in a relationship. it can sometimes be the lesser of evils.All we ever get on this site is one side of the story and you begin by blaming her because you dont have the whole story.  What happened to expecting him to talk to his wife if he was unhappy?  On a relationship site what is worse than a  year affair?gtShe talks shit about their father and she only victimizes herself. How does sabotaging their relationship with her venom and anger help anyone? No you are the one victimizing her.  The girls are adults and can assess the situation for themselves.  They can clearly see that their father is a piece of shit that cheated on their mother and had a child by another woman.  Where do you propose she put her anger which is a natural stage for a wronged spouse.gtAlso it is unlikely that this woman kept every promise she made in her wedding vows sex notwithstanding. so who are you to judge which commitments are ultimate and which are lesser.There you go again assuming that she is partly to blame for his affair.  This is a massive and very presumptuous assumption on your part.  In most cases of cheating the partner does try to balance out the good and bad over a  marriage but in this case  year affair child by mistress and asked to have his mistress move into his house there is clearly no balance.,relationship_advice,cucfgak,6,t5_2r0cn

4917069,0,t3_3i8zbs,Thats very frustrating to have to deal with. My advice first and foremost is you have to talk to her about how this makes you feel. Try to avoid you language and use more I feel language to avoid coming off as a bully such as I know you are very close with your mother and I support that relationship but I feel uncomfortable with the fact that you go to her about our issues before coming to me. We are married now we have to put in the effort to deal with our problems before involving other people. What do you think? versus You text your mom too much your mother talks shit about me you keep turning your phone away from me etc etc etc. Focus on the big picture how this is affecting your marriage and avoid the small details. Details are easily explained away or argued against...not so easy to do with big picture stuff and feelings. ,relationship_advice,cuec1td,1,t5_2r0cn

Of course her ego is blown shell have worse days before she has better days. Im a  plan for the worst kind of guy and it would make more sense for her to move in with your mother keep the k so she can afford her please be a worthy nice german and not some new Ford car so she doesnt have to sell that. Or would he rather be broke AND have to live with someone else? I dont think you can put rent on a credit card can you? If so maybe wait  months. She should be hiring at least  recruiters to look for jobs for her in her field. Applying by herself is NOT enough. She needs to contact her people on LinkedIn and search high and low on Indeed and every other platform. In the mean time she should be taking a part time internship in her field. Sure they pay low but itll help get her foot in the door. If places say no then she should ask if theres a paid internship. This speaks volumes. And she can always jump ship when a job comes along. Not to mention why not get a job at a restaurant or her favorite store to get some money rolling in. After  week she should be getting antsy wipe up her tears put on a pad and get our there applying to anything that pays. Its only temporary.BUT lets say you move in with your mother. And she only has k and some change. She can only afford her shiny car for about  months. If this were me Id either sell the car or move in with your mother so I wouldnt have to take the hit.If this were me Id wait  months  judge how much effort shes put into finding a new job. I dot thin kits wise to come home and ask her what she did all day or ask how many jobs she applied to. Shes a big girl. Maybe offer her a contact and phone number if you know someone that can help but this is her responsibility. Shes an adult. Yes shes your fiancee but some action needs to be taken.

4970870,0,t3_3izvgt,His behavior is inappropriate and bordering sexual harassment. You need to make it clear that you are uncomfortable with his actions or he will continue to treat you in a comparable way. Next time he texts you something inappropriate if you do not feel confronting him faceon then text back something like how would your wife feel about you texting me things like this or hint that his words are inappropriate. I do not think that you should avoid confronting him and stopping his behavior if you are uncomfortable with it to avoid the possibility of damaging your work relationship. If he cannot maintain a working relationship amicably once you confront him about his behavior then I say just get rid of him. He is a family friend and your family owns the business and you should not be made uncomfortable in your own place of work every day. I do not think you should need to be polite just make it understandably clear that you find his behavior uncomfortable and let him know he is not in change of you he does not have power of control over you. Be assertive. Honestly if he cannot maintain a professional relationship after being called out then I doubt that your parents would want such an employee working for them.

4990211,0,t3_3j9cyg,If you open up to him about a sexually abusive ex hes going to have questions and very little time to formulate them so be aware that its going to be difficult and awkward for both of you in different and probably some similar ways. Ive been there and youre never sure what to say do I comfort do I ask questions so I share a story too?.. Ones mind races. As with any ex talk there summations and stories its up to you to decide which this is. If hes a mature and decent person it wont be a deal breaker or whatever for him I mean I would hope hes a safe person to talk to eh.If your ex is going to be around it doesnt serve anyone to bring it up with friends you believe cant keep their teeth together. Worst case scenario as your expert said something made it online before the deletion process and now they or tertiary friends know to Google it. Best case it turns into a hesaid shesaid with the ex unless you file a police report but not charges something evidentiary anyway. Thats a no win game within a social circle. Even though hes clearly the creep someone will be dumb enough to stick up for him.All that said if youre feeling like this is something youre tired of having in the closet so to speak then yeah get ahead of it. Make sure the story is truthfully told and the fallout is his. Its your trauma you get to handle it however helps you sleep best and damn anyone who has anything else to say on the topic.As a final note. Revenge Porn or sharing sexually explicit stuff without consent is illegal now assuming youre in the States and a handful of Euro nations. The laws specifically regarding recording are muddled and buried under sexist bullshit so if he did share them youve still got that stick. If it blows up into a heshesaid thing you can remind them that jail time is a potential repercussion of acting on whatever ill will this might engender.Ultimately if its a case of just wanting him to be out of your space and social circle Im not sure those things are the most important things. The reality now is that hes a creep and you dont have to have to deal with him or the merging of social circles. So if it comes up with the friends tell them just enough to know what kind of a creep he is but not enough to cause it to become as big a thing now as it was then  avoiding a full resurgence ... hopefully. If your friends hear you out and still chum around with this dude they arent your friends. If youd rather have nothing to do with him but also not share these events with possible gossips just remind everyone that you used to date and the relationship ended poorly they dont need details its not their fucking business.All said and done the level of disclosure is directly proportional to your comfort and need to talk it out. If that means just a brief description of yeah that relationship was horrible and we drifted apart and he became a creep then thats it. If you want to talk about it more do.

You could also send her recipes you know shed like get her in on a TV show with you and text comments on the latest episode or send newspaper or Reddit articles she might be interested in. A dog would be a FANTASTIC help if shes into dogs as it would force her out of the house provide her with company and encourage possible new friends to approach her. Hell maybe even tell her about dating sites. This could encourage her to reach out to others and feel hopeful about her future. Its not easy escaping depression and frankly when youre depressed you dont always want to. At a certain point the sadness becomes addicting in its own way. I have dysthymia which is constant underlying depression and have been unhappy most of my life sometimes for good reason sometimes not.

5225419,0,t3_3mkn88,Hi I hate posting this but this is the only place I can really talk about it. I feel bad about it but Id like to know what other people think.So my boyfriend and I have been dating for  years. We started in senior year of highschool at . When we graduated we went to the same college. I went to a year of CC and then at  we moved in together. Even before that we basically lived together because I was constantly in his dorm and slept over a lot since it was a private room.No problems at all. Literally. Never fought amazing sex life always happy to be together but give each other enough room to do our own hobbies his is gaming mine is writing. Healthy social lives outside of the relationship too.I love this guy. I know people change a lot in the next few years but Im ready to tackle it together. I never wanted to get married as a kid until I met him.But another part of me still wonders what its like to be single in college. I want to be able to go to a party and flirt with a guy or have funny awkward first date stories to share with my friends. Im attractive and people hit on me and I reject them but part of me wants to flirt back and see how it goes. I never would I love and respect my SO too much but it nags at me sometimes and I feel like Im missing life experiences that all of my friends will get before settling down. Rationally I know that the grass is greener and everything and its really not as great as it sounds but I cant help but wonder.I guess I dont have a specific question just hoping for reassurance that these feelings are normal and Im not crazy. Will they go away eventually? Is this something most people get out of their system before settling down or is it all in my head?,relationship_advice,cvfurf2,3,t5_2r0cn

5235367,0,t3_3mprvs,I think its pretty normal when you are first starting out learning about relatonships to feel threatened by your partners previous bfgf or feel jealous of them. You dont have all the details about how close they were how that felt the kinds of things they did how that felt if they loved each other how that felt and if there are residual feelings left over and how that feels. Overcoming those insecurities simply comes with experience. The more experience you have with relationships the better you will be at them. Right now its new and youre inscure. Thats ok. Just acknowledge it and tell yourself that she wouldnt be with you if she werent interested in getting to know you better. Her past is her past...you will learn that everyone has one. I learned with my most recent bf not to bring the past into my current relationship...its never a good idea and itll only create more drama and feed your insecurities unless you are emotionally mature and stable enough to talk about it and deal with the fall out appropriately  asking about STDs and when they were checked last is ok and encouraged. The best advice I can give you is to not allow yourself to sabotage a perfectly good relationship just because she has more experience...you cannot punish someone for the things they did before they even knew you existed. Create new memories with her...dont focus on someone elses. ,relationship_advice,cvh1vsu,3,t5_2r0cn

5240776,0,t3_3mrnii,I responded to you and Im embarrassed it was so long. So here it is in hopefully a condensed form.  You have to take some time apart. She cant figure this out if she is living with you. I know you want to fight for her you simply cant.  You have to love her enough to give her what she needs to find out what she wants. You cant do or say anything or make romantic gestures that are going to convince her she still feels the same. She cant create emotions that are gone or have changed. No matter how perfect and understanding you are you do all she asks you make her your top priority it means nothing where her heart is concerned. She simply cannot be convinced to feel something she doesnt.     She behaved in the kindest possible way possible when she came to you. The respect she has for you is apparent. She didnt hide a romance she didnt lie and she didnt do something she couldnt take back. She behaved like an adult. She thought of you and she didnt tarnish your lives together by hiding her feelings lying to you and leave you feeling like a fool.  Now you have to do the hardest thing imaginable you have to let go. No she might not change her mind. There is no way to know if this is the end. What you do know is you loved her and thought so highly of who she was that you had to let her have the chance to find whatever it is she needs to be happy. You also need to get some perspective decide on some plans for you.,relationship_advice,cvhpc1c,1,t5_2r0cn

5276847,0,t3_3n96uw,gtIve even tried avoiding the particular issue by saying things like Im sorry and that stinks but its just not enough for her anymore.What is her response when you take that route??Because reading the first part of your post I agree with others that she doesnt want to be told she was wrong she wants support and understanding. Which I dont think is necessarily a bad thing in itself. There have been times where Ive felt the same way I screw up and something goes terribly wrong and I go home and vent and my husband says well you should have . Which just makes it worse because I know that I just want some understanding that I feel crappy about it and maybe a hug. But when youre already doing that... I mean what more can you do? Besides offering advice or offering sympathy I dont see what other response she could possibly be expecting from you. What would she do if for instance you just gave her a hug and said Im sorry is there anything I can do? Maybe that would help her realize no theres nothing you can do thanks for trying though. If that fails too then my conclusion would be that she just wants to take out her anger on something or someone and youre the easiest target at the time. ,relationship_advice,cvm6e7f,2,t5_2r0cn

5302707,0,t3_3nl7hw,This would be my advice to your friendMarriage is a business contract nothing more nothing less. Your business product are children. Marriage doesnt guarantee a loving committed relationship and a loving committed relationship can be had without marriage.The biggest mistake both me and my cousin made in our marriages was not just accepting a rational solution to the problem of having sex with someone for over  years it becomes boring after about  years. Preserve the family unit and have an open marriage. Her husband cheated on her. My ex wife cheated on me. So our lifestyles and children suffered the typical divorce and divorce aftermath of court battles which the lawyers knew was coming the day we signed our marriage licenses.  Its called nesting. You end take turns being parent on duty. You both find love and good sex outside of the marriage. But for appearances sake the kids wont know whats going on. In most marriages this happens. The sex gets stale you find other people interesting. New sex with new people is like a drug that makes life more vivid.Second marriages end in divorce more often than firsts. Youve heard the phrase the honeymoons over? The  year itch? Save your time and money and stay married. Preserve the family unit. Dont allow your children to be bounced from home to home its the most common cause of child molestation when kids end up in homes with strangers step siblings step parents boyfriends and all that nonsense.So thats my advice. Let her cheat you do the same and you both partner to finish raising the kids. Dont trust wills and prenups. If you both divorce and remarry all your assets are not guaranteed to go to your kids. Im not a lawyer but I know plenty of people who lost out due to the circus of nd and rd marriages.Whatever you do dont get married again. Second marriage rates are higher than that of first marriage divorce rates  or  in  and  in  respectively. When you walk away with a fist full of cash you want to go back to the trouth over and over. And if you marry a woman with kids you end up having to pay child support on her kids when the next divorce comes up.,relationship_advice,cvphdzv,-4,t5_2r0cn

I have never even once messaged anyone for a meetup sent a nude chatted online or made any real move to be unfaithful.  I have watched porn that I would be ashamed to admit I like and used some of those other things as a way to make the fantasy more real for me.  Really though I love my fiancee and wouldnt be unfaithful to her. I do get it that if she found any of this out she might have the same thoughts that you do.What I really want and am too ashamed to admit to her is to be able to ask her to peg me maybe with a bit of femdom thrown into that mix. While Im usually the take charge dominant one in our sex life and I like taking that role occasionally Id like to be relieved of that. Id like her to tie me up sit on my face and get herself off ride my cock solely for her pleasure fuck my ass and make me eat my own cum from her hand her pussy or in another way. I know I should just let all that out but Im scared Ill be rejected or that shell think Im less of a man or too perverted for her.

Of all the women he has been with if he were to rank all their qualities you might not be the smartest or kindest or most generous or funniest or most flexible or smarmiest or most creative or sexiest or have the most athletic thighs or roundest ass or be the best at back rubs or best cook or have the prettiest singing voice or softest hair or most reactive nipples.

5383388,0,t3_3or5mk,You are way overanalyzing this. He said you were abusive because he knew how to push your buttons and he knew it would bother you and he had to have the last word. Stop trying to figure out what the relationship was. Its over. You SHOULD learn from it but dont go back.DO NOT try to defend yourself. That is just giving him an opening to engage in the debate again and if you werent successful before you wont be now. You need to stay away from this guy. If you want a label for it call it dysfunction. And realize its the reason you broke up. And the reason  you felt so light after he was out of your life. Because he was BAGGAGE.  If you want ways to cope with conflict without being abusive look for reading material on that. How to argue without being demeaning or insulting. How to respect your partner. But do it in a self educating way and not because of what he said. You should do it not only to learn how to behave yourself but so that you know what is not acceptable for others behavior. You might also look into therapy if you arent sure how to relate to people. Re your last question. When I think of my BF doing things for me he recognizes when I have had a bad day and brings me a glass of wine without me asking for it. He surprises me with little things cleaning the snow off my car because he leaves earlier than I do. Offering to make dinner. Going to a chick flick with me when hed rather see a shootemup. Just generally being tuned into what I might think and need and not making it all about what hes getting from me. For your BFs moving forward only you can know what they might need but you have to pay attention to them to get what might make them happy. And its kind of trial an error you might try something and it fails miserably but at least you are trying and will know not to do it next time. This is all a learning experience. No one gets out of relationships unscathed. Just keep moving forward. ,relationship_advice,cvzse6e,1,t5_2r0cn
5384641,0,t3_3orw4o,Its hard for me to understand how you can relate to what happened as sabotage? From your post here are the facts that we know. You think you do a thing that were calling know it all  youre trying to be helpful but you know something about it rubs people the wrong way.. Your boyfriend thinks things are pretty good except the knowitall thing but you two are working on that.. You agree with him that its a problem and that youre working on it.. Your mom when prompted by your boyfriend bringing it up confirmed that you have this thing and youve had it a long time and it does bother others as well.   It sounds from my perspective like you just do a thing that bothers many people and youre blaming your mom for a thing thats not really her fault? Its certainly easier than facing the real issue but it wont solve anything. Its a hard thing to face issues like this especially when youre doing something wrong with a positive intent.

If this man has no qualms cheating on his wife with one underage girl he met at a gas station how many other girls has he taken advantage of in the same way? How many will he take advantage of in the future? You should tell your parents everything as soon as possible. Your sister will be angry with you at first but the fact that she has kept this relationship a secret from the rest of the family speaks volumes. On some level your sister understands this behavior is not right and her telling you about the relationship could be her way of attempting to determine if the not right feelings shes having about this relationship are true.

She is his mother. And yes you all need therapy. This is a very traumatic situation and there is no way he could have consented to it. I dont care what he says either. He is a very scarred man and you are both living with an abuser. You both need to get out of there asap.,relationship_advice,cw70fxw,6,t5_2r0cn
5440757,0,t3_3pirwi,Wanted to come here with some insight to the first question everyone will ask why does he still have them? to which I have no idea. I just know my boyfriend has old videos like this of his exes although completely consensual which he always made a point to start out with the girl stating her consent just in case smart guy he is. I dont ask about it much because I dont understand why he would keep them... So I guess I cant offer much help. I dont think he still watches them. His are on tapes in a safe somewhere he keeps stuff he doesnt want laying around the house for guests to find or whatever but I dont think he ever pulls them out to watch them. The only time Ive seen him or heard of him pulling them out was when I asked to see some out of curiosity. I know it is different since what your boyfriend did in my opinion was very violating to these women and I have no idea how I would handle that kind of situation or even trust him after that just wanted to give some insight and say that just having them isnt THAT far out and to definitely focus on being upset specifically about the nonconsent.,relationship_advice,cw73yll,2,t5_2r0cn

Do you take their wantsneeds into consideration and do things they enjoy? Not to say women need a constant reminder of how much you admire them but its always nice to hear. Maybe they felt that they had not heard this enough from you.Did you take these ladies on dates to see things they enjoy spending quality time with them and taking a personal interest in their wantsneeds? I wouldnt put all the blame on you for this as its obviously a two way street. All I would say is maybe take a step back when you find someone new and put the focus on them for a while.

5474105,0,t1_cwbcmez,He sounds nice too nice to be exact and as a person with some experience I would view this whole affair a bit differently. First of all you handled the situation proficiently given your experience but I would have concerns regarding his integrity. You were vulnerale and took what was said as truth and at face value. What he said may or may not have been true. A girl always falls really hard for her first that is a given and he knows that.Was he a virgin also? maybe yes maybe no probably not. He had the opportunity to show how worldly he was and you were not that is a huge ego boost for a man any man of any culture. If he told me you know knothing at all instead of recognising that I do know things but perhaps different things then him I would not see him again. I would be dissappointed.I would feel that it was a good learning experience probably better then most girls first experiences but in that relationship he is not treating you as an equal on any level. I would focus on education and carrear. When not seeking a relationship one will be found. You deserve respect no matter what disfunctional family background you previously had. The very fact that you had help to overcome issues and accomplished such means that you are very intelligent and have gone really far with working on self. Give yourself a pat on the back.

I would not continue having intimacy with him and permitting him to push me away so to speak in public. Thats just not right. I would break that off and wait it out. If he asked what is wrong I would say well  I will not have intimacy with someone who will not kiss me on the mouth when were not in bed!

NEVER date someone as a fixer upper.  If your goal is to change them they are not right for you. Find someone who is more compatible. NEVER date someone who disrespects your rights as an individual person. Every relationship has boundaries. One person cannot set them all up and expect the other partner to toe the line. Relationships are supposed to be about equal partners loving and respecting each other. They set up relationship boundaries they both agree on.NEVER date a person who controls who you see what you watch what you think about or who you talk to. This is abusive behavior and you should find someone who treats you with love and respect.I realize that this situation is  immaturity and insecurity on her part.

5502449,0,t3_3qfhko,You really should have dealt with this before ever accepting the ring. Now you have a building site instead of a nice solid foundation for your marriage. You need to find a counsellor and start marriage counselling. Now I know people say You should never take your partner to break off contact with a friend but I believe in making breaking points clear. I did reach such a breaking point a year into my relationship with my partners ex. She was manipulative and got off on the ego boost. He was trying to avoid cross fire by lying by omission. After a year of battles I said that this relationship was only going to have two people in it and either I was going to leave or she was. He chose me and broke off all contact...and you know what? We were fine. We had to work through the lying and it took me some time to get past the resentment but we have no skeletons in the closet that poisoned the rest of our relationship. If you literally can not put up with things anymore tell him that. You are his wife and his best friend. He should want to put you first. If he can not do that may be you can not be his wife. May be he should look into polyamory and partners who are okay with his secondary. Again premarriage would have been a better time but better late than never. If he doesnt want that and one would hope he wouldnt! then may be his friend just needs to go and he needs to pick up hobbies where he can make normal friends without subtext. May be if he has so few friends it is his free time that really needs a work over. TLDR Dont be afraid to put your foot down. Get counselling and hubby a hobby. ,relationship_advice,cwezmjy,7,t5_2r0cn

Second there must be delivery of the gift as in him handing it over. Third you must accept the gift which you already did. You should have nothing to worry about dont let him bully you.

He still lives with them and they see him as a child and theyre conservative people who think youre not supposed to express your anger so he has a lot of bottled up anger.. A friend of mine told me he will change once he moves away from them.. He has never slapped me or punched or anything too severe..It was manhandling and it was a maximum of  times over the  years together and there was always deep sincere regret and self loathing for him after its happened he doesnt enjoy doing this crap... hes sad about it and hates it.. hence i said abusive traits not full on abuse...we get a lot of fights which we work through. And I dont exactly walk on eggshells Im very expressive...but there are times when anger becomes scary coming from him .. and I didnt come here for people to tell me to stay.. The best advice thus far was someone saying I should force him into therapy.. and someone asking what has been done thus far? Thus far weve only talked and reasoned and he knows I have a breaking point where Id leave him if he continues with this. He reads books and tries to change but I guess his parents always get to him. They behave like assholes. When I finish University next year the plan is to move in together I have a strong feeling moving away will indeed remedy the situation... and I thought someone would understand that no relationship is perfect..and this is a problem that I wanted a solution for not the solution to abandon him as Im the light in his life...Were both smart peoplebut I just needed a little guidance as to how I should deal with this.. Thanks. Ill figure it out. Im not one of those people that runs from a problem when Im faced with one I try to deal with it in a way to make it better. But yes Im strong enough to leave him eventually if it comes down to it. But for now Im trying to see what will make it better. Thanks for the advice. ,relationship_advice,cwo1sxc,1,t5_2r0cn

If my SO says I want affection and I am really in the mood to lay down or play video games it really is difficult to go straight into being romantic especially if it is something that is expected of me to just turn on and off. Try this. Let him know that you want a little time with him after he has had his time to himself. He may appreciate it a lot and probably will come and cuddle with you. From what you say it seems like he shows romance more than often but that instant you wanted him to turn it on when he was in the middle of playing games which may have been hi time to festers.

5668078,0,t1_cwznxms,Weird so I assume the idea of a prenup has been brought up already if assets were a concern of his?Thing is its best to marry a guy who is damn sure he wants to marry you and very committed to make a life and future with you. So much so that hes will to bet his life on it. When you have a guy who leads you on and contradicts himself frequently then thats going to be a major trust breaker. It makes it impossible to tell if he would ever want to marry you if its because he truly loves you and wants to make it work or that hes gotten attachedcodependent to you and really doesnt want to watch you leave.You guys seem to need to have a real heart to heart discussion about why he is afraid of getting married to you. Not the idea of marriage why he isnt willing to commit to you in writing. If hes sold on the idea of spending the rest of his life with you otherwise but is reeling from a piece of paper then hes got concerns and fears that he is not telling you that need to come out. If you guys have to hash out some sore spots then thats what needs to be done because the future for the both of you really depends on how you work this out.,relationship_advice,cwzoih3,3,t5_2r0cn

5706774,0,t3_3t9018,It sounds like your mind is made up so at this point its really just about the practical ties that bind.  Make sure you give timely notice to your landlord when your lease is almost up or in the alternative after you have had a heart to heart with your boyfriend you could explore whether he and the landlord would be willing to do a buyout of the remaining term of the lease at some reduced cost.If you have any joint cell phone plans or insurance plans cancel those.  Any joint accounts split the money and open up your own.  Basically the hardest part coming to the final decision to stay or go is over.  Now you just have to tie up the loose ends.There is absolutely no way for an easy divorce.  You can either be honest with him about your reasons so hopefully hell get that fire lit under him or you can be vague and hope he figures it out on his own.Lastly your story is very onesided.  That may ultimately be the case but its been my experience that when relationships fail its always a twoway street even if somewhat imbalanced.  You might use the final discussion with him as sort of an exit interview for yourself so that you know what you can improve upon for future partners down the road.,relationship_advice,cx4hbn5,1,t5_2r0cn

5713165,0,t1_cx48hcm,I would do it as soon as you are ready for the situation to be resolved one way or the other. The longer you put it off the longer you are going to be in limbo and thats not a great feeling to be in but at least you dont have to deal with rejection. And that can get to be a habit and pattern for future relationships that you do NOT want to fall into. With my first serious relationship that lasted almost ten years I got to the point that I was so afraid of making her mad and possibly losing her that I lost all of my self instead.  I let her walk all over me. And this has been something of a problem in my current relationship with my wife because I thought that was how men were supposed to show they loved someone but women do want you to stand up for yourself and not be nambypamby. Im just now learning how important it is to be yourself in relationships and not try to customize who you are to fit the expectations of the other person. And as for your side note no... I was with a girl from the age of  till  we broke up after living together for five years then I met my wife a year and a half later in . I also do KIND of know what you are saying about not being a challenge after the relationship gets established and the girl looses interest. If you think this is what has happened in this case let it be a sign that she is still playing little girl games and not mature enough for you to expend much effort on. I know this is going to come as a shock but at nineteen your brain isnt even fully formed much less your relationship skills. Thats why legally there are some decisions you cant make until youre . But trust me on this youre a guy you are ALWAYS going to be a challenge to women. In the end Id just tell you to do what you feel is right dont kid or lie to yourself. If you are getting feelings or vibes from this lady that she is not interested in you talk openly to her about it and do what you think is right. And please understand she will not be the last one if you two do go your separate ways. She may surprise you and tell you youre being a putz and yes shes crazy about you. In that case do the same thing what YOU feel is right. And be cool. Dont act like a douche but be comfortable and decisive take action and be firm. You both are still learning this dance and its great fun to dance in this life. Let me know how ya do ok?,relationship_advice,cx59vi0,1,t5_2r0cn

5722567,0,t3_3tigv5,First you need to tell her that you cant keep up with all the phone calls texts app messages etc. throughout the day. Its too much for you and you feel like you never have time to yourself as a result. She might think that you dont like her anymore so youll need to stress that you love her very much and thats why youre talking to her about this because you want to make the relationship work. While youre at it you might want to say that its unfair for her to calltextetc. only to decide she is angry you dont respond sooner and avoid talking to you. Its not healthy. Its not mature. You wont always be able to answer every call. You have to make it about how you have things in your life besides her and while you want to make her happy and prioritize her you also value independence.On that note Id suggest telling her that you will try and let her know if you wont be able to talk in the future. The way to do this is to make it about being around friends or family if you constantly text around others now might be a time to try not doing that and not wanting to be rude. Tell her that when you two are together you try or youll try to focus on her and you want to do the same for others in your life. Shes important but there are other people who you value and she has to be okay with that.If she isnt okay with this if she demands that you never refrain from contact if she tells you that you dont get time to yourself for any reason because she needs you available at all times it is time to cut your losses. If she tries but has issues then I think you need to focus on those issues shes having. Additionally it might be worth asking why she texts you so damn much.

And thats not even accounting for the additional difficulty of your age gap and hiding this from your parents.Keep in mind that its not forever and make your decisions based on that knowledge. Dont miss opportunities like going to the right college to keep this going. Realize when it has run its course and youre not getting enough out of it. Break it off early dont waste time trying to keep it going if youre not sure.Most importantly talk to your friends and parents about your relationship. If something seems weird or makes you nervous ask people you love for advice and listen to them.

I wasnt in school anymore. At the time we were dating I was into party drugs much like your girlfriend. I was into raves and drugs so much that I didnt care what my boyfriend thought. When I was on party drugs I was happy. I felt like I found my escape from reality. It felt so amazing. It wasnt until he got tired of it and gave me an ultimatum. Him or drugs? I chose him but what he didnt know was that I was still taking drugs without his knowledge.Now Ive been sober from drugs for  years now. Id have to say its quite hard to stop completely from drugs. I stopped because I found out that I have arrhythmia though I still drink alcohol excessively. Up until recently Im having this strong urge of using mdma again..Shes either going to hide it away from you and still use drugs without your knowledge or shes going to break up with you if shes having too much fun with her party life.But Ive also known a handful of people who has passed away from excessive drug use..

She printed these writings on paper and made these cute covers from harder paper and bound them into a mini book.

5900878,0,t3_3w3wns,I think that you two might be too different to be compatible. I dont think its just because of the religious issue I think that hes simply in a different place in life than you. The difference between  and  is huge especially if this is your first ever relationship. Think how different you were even a few years ago and how different you will be  years from now. As much as you want to make it work I dont think you living at home with your grandparents and him on his own raising children are a good match at all. This is especially true if you are just about to move away to start a new life in college. I think compatibility is more than just getting along and communicating he has to have a practical place in your life too.

Ive been wanting to reach out to him ever since but I know him all to well his fucking pride. I know he misses me and knows he has no reason. His mom is going in February to visit him.

You do love her and the best thing I can say is to give her what she needs.  She is seeing a therapist and working on herself so give her as much relief as she needs to help her grow and heal. Depression is a horrible thing and difficult to deal with in a marriage. Talk to her tell her you are sorry she is struggling and you want to be there to support her healing and growing.  Help her get the safe space she needs to sort herself out and let her know you love her and want to help her even if that means things not in your best interest.  Loving someone often times means doing things that are not in our interest but help the person we love. Help out as much as you can with the kids housework bills take on responsibilities around the house she normally does and let her have as much time as you can give for her to get out of the daily grind.

5995375,0,t3_3xkyex,A very tricky scenario it is good that you have the maturity to recognise it and not take advantage of it though.Honestly I would urge her to seek counseling if she isnt already. Ive dealt with a few people that were abused during their childhood and no matter what degree of functionality they seem to have superficially there is always the damage underneath. This can lead to a lifetime of issues if it is allowed to. So long as you cant be comfortable that what is driving her romantic feelings is genuine affection and not the byproduct of that abuse I suspect you conscience will not allow you to go ahead with anything. As it stands it seems likely this will continue to make you more and more uncomfortable but I know it will be hard raising the subject with her. This will continue to cause you anxiety because you happen to be a good person but could you imagine this scenario if she was dating a jerk? Honestly it is a pretty scary world out there. There is no easy answer to this but I would feel the same way as you and I think because you do you might be able to help. I know this is a huge burden but then again it never gets an easier. Perhaps speak to her mother though be aware that she may not react well to it either. ,relationship_advice,cy5iw1r,2,t5_2r0cn

However this could also just be the way things go and a little space could also help you in the long run to protect yourself. Sometimes you dont know what to do and you just have to wait it out until it either settles itself or you come to a decision on your own. In the meantime you should read a bunch of books and smile even when you dont want to even though its really hard because you will be okay and you dont know what will happen yet so stay positive and keep yourself as happy as possible. ,relationship_advice,cy7en4k,1,t5_2r0cn

6031457,0,t1_cya863y,Well Im f now  and until I found my current fellow I had a pretty finicky approach to SOs similar to your current mood towards girls. Honestly  it took a lot of dating different kinds of people and through dating in high school and college sometimes for multiple years sometimes for a week I learned a lot about myself. What keeps me interested in my current fellow going on  years so far was the knowledge I gathered from past bfs  I like hiking I like skiing I like making jokes all the time and when I found someone who shared my passions weve been able to keep the spark alive and enjoy doing what we love together. It takes a lot of trial and error   and I dont say that to discourage you. I say that to give you hope! Youre going to date a lot of people some youre crazy about some who are crazy for you some relationships that only last  hours and by doing that you can look back and say wow  I really like that or jeez I know I never want to date someone like that again. But back to your original question gt  What keeps you interested in a person when youve been in a relationship for a while and already know everything about them?Sexual compatibility is super important. I really enjoy sex with my guy we like to work out together and be healthy and that really jives with our sexual appetite. That keeps us interested  and because were able to share new experiences like camping in Yosemite or skiing in Tahoe that only makes life more exciting together. If you find someone who blends well with your own passions youll be able to live life together as an adventure and when someone makes you feel like youre becoming a better person and feel sexually free with them  those are all aspects of staying interested and happy with someone.

Why ? from dictionary.com FAMILIARITY BREEDS CONTEMPT The better we know people the more likely we are to find fault with them. Long experience of someone or something can make one so aware of the faults as to be scornful. For example Ten years at the same job and now he hates it familiarity breeds contempt . The idea is much older but the first recorded use of this expression was in Chaucers Tale of Melibee c. . So divorce happens.Marriage doesnt guarantee a committed relationship and a committed relationship doesnt require marriage.

Ask her why she felt that it was appropriate to do what she did on Tinder of all things. Tell her that it really isnt unreasonable for that to ring an alarm bell.

What had destroyed it totally for me was that he kept pressuring me to have the same feelings for him he would always get so argumentative about it and would always figuratively beat himself up about the fact that I couldnt. I wanted to though but he just wouldnt be patient like I needed him to be. Prior to that I was also in an abusive relationship with someone whom I was also in love with. I feel like he killed any emotions in me. Its like all the emotions up and packed their shit and left this building. I tried to explain that to the recent boy I broke up that its incredibly difficult for me to even think about allowing myself to love someone again but he just wasnt having it. His response  of the time was basically Im not him and arguing with me about it and guilting me.

6117001,0,t3_3zbg6j,When I met my husband we lived  hours apart. I had just started a new job that had a two year contract and it would habe been very unwise to give that up for a guy I had just met. So we did the long distance thing for two years. We knew very soom that we were meant for each other and started discussing how to make it happen so we could live at the same place. I can find work everywhere so I moved to his town after two years. I think there are some things that make a LDR easier . of course its a sacrifice in every day life so you habe to be very sure that the other person is worth it.. Different relationships have different priorities and strengths. Our relationship always relied on being able to talk to each other and we both enjoyed talking for hours with each other. I think we talked way more back then than we do now. .  hours is a distance you can travel on friday night. It meant that I could leave after work and get to my then boyfriends place the same night. When I would work the late shift on monday I would go back on monday morning and we would have  whole days. It would have been way more difficult had it been a distance you cant travel after a day of work. . we knew it was temporary. I think thats the most important point. You are both young. No need to get married and have kids right away. You can totally do this dfoeteli a while. But it really helps to have a perspective. A plan on how and when things are going to change. If you say now that it will never be possible for you two to work in the same region that makes things incredibly frustrating.

Ever since he met the girl he really didnt respect me anymore.And I admit I made mistakes in our relationship too. I never ever went behind his back and cheated on him lied to him etc. I have said some messed up things during one of our fights at the beginning of our relationship though. I also made a big deal about something really stupid last summer that resulted in us not speaking for a couple days. He threw this in my face to try and put some blame on me. Nothing Ive ever done compares to what he did though. But no matter what I did whatever it took to work our stuff out  and so did he for a long time. He put a lot of effort for the most part. I never just let him go.The most messed up part of all of this is he did not say he was sorry. He said he was sorry that it happened this way But he did not give me a true apology. The only thing I can say from his actions is that he didnt love me anymore. But he loved me enough to sleep with me the night before. He loved me enough to tell me I was the perfect girlfriend just  days before he broke up with me.Either he hasnt been happy for a long time and just didnt know how to tell me up front or this woman is a  and hes just fallen hard for her and thinks hell be happier with her. I asked him what he liked so much about her and why she is so important to him and he just put his head down in frustration lol.

Trust your instincts. If it doesnt feel right it isnt right!Dont sign any contracts with this man and dont let him convince you that you are a secondclass citizen! Things can change in an instant and you could very well end up in a better position than him. The fact that he wants you as a partner in his business should tell you something about your perceived potential. My rule of thumb is not to accept anything from someone that I wouldnt offer myself. Would you propose this inequitable agreement if you were the one with the financial upper hand? Of course not! This is a perfect opportunity for him to gain complete control over you. He may be all sweetness and nice right now but a couple of years is not enough for you to get to know someone well enough. The fact that this prenup caught you by surprise is testament to that.Bide your time. Pay no more towards the equity of his home than you would pay for your own apartment. Get a rental agreement from him so that you can establish credit should when you find yourself needing to move out. Forget about the ring the wedding and giving up your freedom and identity. Instead be frugal and live below your means despite the lifestyle that he may want to live and save save save!

If I were him Id not be so sure you were even into me. Have a sitdown with him talk about what you both want and dont be afraid to lay out that you do want a future with him.

6168374,0,t1_cyqp3lp,I doubt she developed either of those attributes because of you.  She is  years old and those things are usually pretty deeply ingrained in a person from early on.  Also from your description she doesnt sound introverted at all.  The fact that she needed friends goes to prove that.  An introvert would be fine and would be less likely to be the one reaching out.  She may be quiet but it isnt the same thing.I want to reiterate the lifestyle she likely has.  Look at the patterns in her life whether she has ever been in a long serious healthy relationship or one that has taken the next step if trips like these are common if none of her friends are married or committed or she trades them in for younger friends who still like to party.  Decide whether this is comparable to yours or something you are comfortable with and understand that there is a good chance this is always how it is going to be no matter what she says she wants.  I say all this coming off a long relationship with a former party girl who claimed she was ready to change.  She did in a lot of ways but not enough that it didnt cause an unbearable stress on the relationship that couldnt survive it.  It took awhile but a slow leak still sinks the ship and just wastes more time.,relationship_advice,cyqs3nf,7,t5_2r0cn

Of course it depends on the context and how she says it but Ive been on trips before where Ive called to chat with my bf and made small comments about not doing anything so he doesnt worry especially at the beginning of my relationship.

6190798,0,t1_cyt9h65,Couples need to be a united front if not kids grow up knowing they can just turn to one parent and get out of any consequences. An extreme example is the Ethan Couch the Affluenza teen. Reading through his story things like his dad would take his truck away then his mother would loan him hers. It was always like that with him apparently. And again what is happening now is he broke arol and his mother took him to Mexico to hide. Now his mom faces  years in jail and hes still in Mexico in a Mexican jail awaiting extradition. An anecdotal example is my wifes nephews. One is  now hes never held a job spent seven years in junior college and still doesnt have enough credits to transfer into a major no core prerequisite courses taken. One parent has always tried to discipline him but the other lets him do whatever he wants. He quite literally said to us once that he doesnt do reality. In other words consequences or work. He has been extremely lucky in that he has had so many opportunities fall into his lap but hes rejected them because he has had to do something to get it. He says that they should just give it to him.

6200356,0,t3_40idmf,Maybe she doesnt like you. Or maybe she just has a really shitty demeanor and attitude in general. Her gorgeousness is blinding you to that fact. It may be that her gorgeousness is WHY she has been able to get away with that shitty attitude right up into adulthood. Less has been expected of her because shes attractive. Lifes unfair that way but if you think about it Im sure youd agree its true that attractive people have it easier in life. When attractiveness is ALL someone has to offer what happens when that attractiveness inevitably fades? What happens once youve become used to how good they look? They get boring really really fast. The good news is that there are a lot of attractive people maybe including you?  who DONT have shitty attitudes who dont just coast by on their looks but actually have more going on. Attractive women who are also cool who dont just assume life or a man owes them something because they are pretty pretty princesses. Maybe give this woman a pass and look for one of them instead?

Activities you could do together and things do to alone and such. Bring it up in this conversation that you want to end the visit after your vacation is over. Also consider why you are friends in the first place. What do you normally talk about? What is it that made you connect? Create some structure and familiarity for your time spend together as it were.

Hed sit in his car in front of her house at  am peering at her bedroom window wondering what she was doing. He turned really creepy. I waited  full years after they broke up to go out with her. He lost his shit over it. Threatened me insulted her ruined any chance at friendship with either of us both of us lost friends over it. But heres the thing as it turns out he found someone else and did just fine. And me and the girl were married  years later.  years later with  kids she is my wife and were doing great. The point is sometimes we cant see it at the time and it hurts like hell and angers us but certain outcomes are just what are meant to be. It totally sucks to hear that if you are in love with her but its the truth. Anyway I know it sucks but youre right about growing up and realizing the fallout can damage even the chances of being on good terms with her much less romantically should the opportunity arise.

6235990,0,t3_40zfzg,Many of the comments here are saying that because he is threatening to break up with you that part of him wants to break up or that it is a possibility. Unfortunately Ive pulled this shit before on my own girlfriend. Im not saying its justified its not using the break up threat is wrong but I can only tell you how I felt and why I ended up saying it.I used that threat in the past in the heat of the moment it happens after hours into an argument where neither of us seem to be getting anywhere near a resolution. In these arguments it was always about how I did something rather small I accidentally forgot to like a facebook post or I was distracted by something and didnt hear what my girlfriend said and because both of us were really stressed that day it ended up escalating far beyond where it should have gone and wed start bringing up old arguments and problems. Both of us have had issues with self confidence however while she gained more confidence after dating me I lost confidence in myself for various reasons outside of dating her and also because im coming to an age where I have to think about providing for a future pressure from parents to be a success etc. So when I threatened to break up by saying why dont you just leave me if im such a little shit to you it was mostly out of stress defeat genuinely not knowing if Im good enough and not knowing what to do in an argument where I never seem to get anything out of. I said I wanted to break up not because I wanted to but because after that argument I felt at my lowest and not deserving. Because after all of our fights it always seemed that i came out of it at the bottom where i had to apologize and she didnt. So the stress builds up and there is no outlet. It wasnt because I didnt love her or that i wanted to break up or that I was okay with not being her it was because I felt like i was pushed into a corner with no way out but too tired and exhausted to find a way out. Im not saying i did the right thing Im still ashamed that I took that route but coming from someone whos felt like the only option left was the break it off I can only tell you that sometimes the issue isnt as simple as hes too immature or that hes manipulative or that he isnt relationship material etc. Give him some breathing room the next time you fight maybe find a time to just tell him how much he really means to you and how you appreciate him for who he is. Figure out how he feels when he makes those threats and try to address it. If that doesnt work then sure maybe he just wants to break up but if hes committing to move in together the problem might be something deeper than that. ,relationship_advice,cyygq5q,1,t5_2r0cn

I dont want to sound arrogant but I do know we have some of the best sex shes had. We were friends for a couple years before we started this relationship and were open about a lot of things. For example Im the only guy whos ever brought her to climax with oral her exes never even bothered.Ice heard the same words from her Im not with them anymore. Im with you. And logically I know that. I trust her. But the back of my mind seems to like torturing me with these thoughts. Ive never liked the idea of cuckolding so I dont think its some underlying fetish either. And its just the sex. I know shes had past exes that are more financially successful or better looking neither of those bother me though I am trying on both fronts for my own reasons. Ill try your idea though.  Hopefully itll help. Thank you. ,relationship_advice,cz4c5if,1,t5_2r0cn

6302925,0,t3_41vylg,OK. What you just described as for me it looks creepy as fuck and Ill tell you whyAs for clearance I am not a psychiatrist or a psichologist I just want to share my opinion as a regular  yearsold guy.Youve been dating for over two years unless todays your aniversary and by this time you should know each other quite well. I can tell from when my girlfriend wants or not to get in a sexual intercourse and I as her partner should always be aware of that. You may have not as much privacy as before but unless you have sex once every quarter I dont see a problem I think  times a month is just OK however under no means Id ask my GF to let me masturbate in front of her or to suck it off just because I am in the mood and she is not which from my point of view is a disgusting thing for a longtimepartner to ask.Thereve been some times when I get pleasure and give none because she does not feel like having that kind of pleasure but would like me to have it and would rather want us to cuddle for a while sometimes I give her sexual pleasure and receive none because I am not in the mood and thats itwork sometimes overtakes me but I want her to be happy and then we can have dinner or watch a movie... or cuddle some more time .gt He storms off bringing things up such as that all other girls would do it and I shouldnt have a problem with itI dont thing thats normal in the vast majority of relationships.Being me I would thing this guy is seeing some else or he has done it on different ocassions before being with you and in either case you should not feel guilty I would rather feel mad because being compared is not nice all less if I am being compared to onenightstands or previous relationsships.Again I am just a regular guy one you can find walking on the street or maybe in the line of a suicide machine however one can never expect to have someone to have a GFBF and that they are gonna be sexual machines and horny as fuck all the time. Thats why we have emotions feelings and a body that constantly change sometimes we are all in for some wild and loud sex sometimes it would better be silent and take it easy and sometimes we just dont want to have sex at all and thats something every human should learn sex is pleasure not an obligation.I advise to strongly analize your situation with your boyfriend and starting thinking by yourself do you want a real lovely boyfriend or a hornyasfuck manipulative man that makes you feel insecure as a person to make you do things you dont want to for whatever reason? He is not invading your privacy he is invading you.Sorry for the long post and the maybe scrambled ideas it sounded good in my head ha ha.

6308489,0,t1_cz6eauw,Agreed. OP because she keeps bringing up the fact that you eat for free but refuses to accept money from you likely means that shes not looking for money. Shes looking for appreciation. Shes looking for gratefulness. While you may say that youre expressing gratefulness Im willing to bet its being expressed less than she needs.  Or its only expressed when she brings it up and shes looking for affirmative action from you. Sit her down. Ask her what she needs. What she wants to be okay with this. If she tries saying that you should just know remind her that you are different people and youre not a mind reader. You feel like youve been expressing gratefulness enough but it appears that its not enough. Tell her you ARE honestly grateful because you dont have to spend the money yourself. And remind her that you arent mooching  you buy extra ingredients and whatever else you guys need to finalize the meal. And you dont ask for money because you recognize what her dad did was so helpful. But that youre out of ideas and need help figuring out where her head is so you guys can be on the same page. ,relationship_advice,cz6pd9c,6,t5_2r0cn

6451212,0,t3_4413ho,Its called dependency. Her poor treatment of you and even boredom is all a method to manipulate you into continuing to enable her. It is basically her being immature and insecure and relying on you to escape those things. No different than how an alcoholic gets mad at their enablers when they arent enabling them. You need to treat it that exact same way as if she was an addict. My suggestion is to take a few days. Let her keep her current tantrum going if that is what she chooses to do. Ultimately she just wants you to apologize give her attention and whatever else she is looking for. Dont. Take this time and space and figure out what it is you want for yourself from her and from the relationship. Write it all out. If you want  nights per week of alone time or want to be treated with respect and not verbally abused. Once youve figured out what you want write down possible solutions. Taking a few nights alone per week is simple. Not being abused the way she has been doing is a little more involved and could even involve her going to anger management or some other type of therapy to help her overcome whatever issues or missing skills that are causing her to act that way. Once you have all of that figured out sit her down and talk to her. Get a sitter for your daughter for the evening and remove any other distractions i.e. TV off etc.... Then make sure you both remain calm during this. If you get upset take a short break before continuing where you left off. In this talk explain to her what it is you want from her and the relationship. Tell her how you plan on achieving those things. Be open to compromise if she offers that. Just make sure it is something you are happy with. Then most importantly tell her that you will not tolerate her speaking to you the way she has. Then stick to it. If she insults or condescends you remove yourself from the situation. Keep doing that. Make it very clear that when she acts in a negative way your response will be to remove yourself. Make her know that she needs to apologize for acting that way not you. Do that by telling her during this conversation and then not apologizing when it is her who is being unrealistic. The lack of communication also seems to be an issue and you two need to learn how to talk to each other like adults and work through problems the way adults would. Both of you should research and make efforts to do this. A counselor would help but it is possible on your own. Just make sure it isnt just you putting in the effort here. If that is the case then consider that the end. Make that very clear to her.,relationship_advice,czmlhh9,43,t5_2r0cn

I saw her literally every day during those  months we lived two blocks away and went to the same school. I really thought she was the one turns out we broke up and  hindsight it was the best thing to ever happen to me. I got caught up in the fact that I just liked having someone around to hang out with and act like they loved me I never realized that she wasnt right for me at all. I would say that this could be a really good thing. Youre young still and you have plenty of time to meet someone else. I dont think that we only have one person out there for us. I think there are multiple ones and we just have to find the right one during the right time. Best of luck to you. Break ups suck especially when its a first serious relationship.

If you are interested in pursuing more than just a friendship with her you should look into moving to a different floor that way theres nothing that could get her in trouble in regards to her job or make it weird for you guys if you do start dating.

The only future I can envision between you two is a potential open relationship where the two of you are free to seek physical intimacy with others while remaining emotionally faithful.

I personally have livedlive this first hand just look at my post history a bit if you really want to know. Those things you described all really help but dont cure it. You need to get to a therapist or else start learning cognitive behaviors that will provide you with anxiety coping techniques asap. There are books podcasts lectures on and on but your best resource is really going to be a therapist you can trust a real will and drive to change and learn and grow and a willingness to do the work.

You need to be prepared for the reality that most relationships do not last forever.  People change a lot and youre right at that point in your life where youll probably be changing the quickest.If you do break up give yourself some time to grieve but try to remember that theres so much more to life than a relationship.

After you have established that you both want a LTR you ought to share your previous experiences with her to mentally prepare her. Its unlikely that she will forgo the LTR because you shared your experiences and condition but if so you have avoided heartbreak for the two of you early on. You can afford to go a bit slower from here. Just keep your eyes peeled for red flags and always maintain good communication with each other. ,relationship_advice,d0am30j,1,t5_2r0cn

6710172,0,t1_d0asg9m,Thats wonderful that you are getting therapy. I think it could help to disrupt some circuitous thought patterns that are not having the best effect on your life. Id look specifically for therapists who use CBT cognitive behavioral therapy as it can be very results oriented. As you like to think deeply about each action you take this form of therapy might be very helpful in terms of making concrete and helpful changes in your thinking and some actions.As to your friend. I really think you are unfairly demonizing him because he doesnt THINK like you do. You keep saying you wished he was as sensitive to you as you were to him. What if he didnt like your sensitivity? Why should he mimic your actions? I think he was straightforward and honest with you and didnt want to have another circular conversation about your relationship. Thats fine and shouldnt be discounted. Forcing someone to communicate especially after you have just told them that you loved them but would never date them is very unfair. Just like you process things a very particular way so does he. He shouldnt to have live up to this crushing level of communication that you seem to be having. In a weird way it feels like you lack real empathy for others. You expect them to live up to a very high and particular standard  that might be comfortable for you but for instance would not be comfortable for me then castigate them when they dont want to do that. Real empathy means thinking in the way THEY think. Try this why do you think your friend did not want to talk more? I can thinks of LOTS of reasons.  He feels exhausted by the amount of communication you are forcing on him.  He wants to have a relationship that is more about shared activities rather than intense self relational talk therapy  He is hurt by you saying you would never date him now  He needs time to process and wants to know you can continue a normal friendship while he thinks about what has changed  He feels that your level type of extremely emotional communication is actually toxic for him and creates interpersonal drama.edit spelling,relationship_advice,d0de0wy,2,t5_2r0cn

6764693,0,t3_48ept4,He loves her and therefor wants to marry her? Thats like saying I want a  chance of being with this woman for the rest of my life.  Marriage is like saying I want to join the union so I can slack so I can get away with being paid more than Im worth and they cant get rid of me.  No offense to union workers.  I want to join too!! Oh god its gets better. They work together!! How do you spell drama sexual harassment lawsuit and unemployment?  Office romance.  Thats why I tell men to never get married.  Women in the work place? Ashley Madison internet dating?  Marriage is a farce.  Its the new going steady.   We men are idiots.  Theres no denying new love and sex is like a drug literally google it.  It releases chemicals in the brain that make colors more vivid food taste better its litterally a drug that gives men a new lease on life especially when life includes sitting in a cubical  hours a week to go with those   hour a week commutes.  Me? I dropped out.  Been there done that with that whole American dream myth.  You have a kid to raise if marriage means nothing else it should mean stick together for the kid that way some douche stranger doesnt end up with your kids inheritance.  If wills are anything like prenups I wish your children luck in ever seeing a dime of you or your husbands labor fruit.  Have an open marriage.

Babies marriage dead bedroom divorce alimony child support child custody battles you get forced into working a mind numbing and or back breaking jobs to keep yourself out of jail because that where you go if you dont pay your alimony and or child support. This has been going on for decades. They even mention that in the  Jack Lemon movie Odd Couple. But we men are idiots. Oblivious! Spend a couple weeks down at your local county family court. Its the best crystal ball you can buy and its free! Well actually its your tax payer dollars at work. Its a good education and sometimes its sadly entertaining when good family men snap as they get schooled in family law like OJ Simpson. So whatever you do dont get married especially to a woman with kids. Under the Presumed Fathers Act these corrupt family courts can make you pay child support on her kids even if you dont adopt them. Why? They get kickbacks on federal taxes paid. Its a conspiracy to defraud and incarcerate men. Its tyranny. Check out the San Diego county family court racketeering case. The family courts are corrupt a cancer on the American family unit. They send your kids off to live with strangers when your baby mama shacks up with someone new....the leading cause of child molestation. If marriage was a good thing for men it would have been made illegal like prostitution marijuana hemp. Marriage and children are like signing over a blank check to a stranger.

If she were to be more dominant over you then her experience would probably turn into a positive and at the very least stop bothering you so much. Alternatively if youd rather she remain submissive consider the idea that she was promiscuous and youre good enough to have satisfied her and change dhe rnature.The philosophy behind that idea is that if its a fact about her you might as well try to find a way to like it.

But many people believe looking to other people for sexual needs is inappropriate. Some might liken it to mental infidelity but I see it more as throwing away energy that could best be put toward the relationship. Sort of training the mind to expect variety and others instead of being happy with your SO. This is why I think its more than reasonable to ask a partner to consider giving it up.

6830841,0,t3_49aoyg,The cause of your distress may not be the presence of an intrusive thought but your guilt about it. Everyone gets intrusive thoughts and its normal. Who hasnt fantasized about sex with someone other than their spouse? Or turning the wheel just the slightest bit towards oncoming traffic. The difference between normal and abnormal is your reaction to these thoughts. Most people accept them as the normal quirks of being human. But some people react with excessive guilt and question their very character for having these normal thoughts. This is also a common finding in OCD. The guilt and self doubt of course keeps bringing you back to those thoughts which only makes them stronger. My suggestion is to accept that being attracted to someone other than your spouse is entirely normal.

6845377,0,t1_d0s4qku,A future for who?  Either she takes BOTH perspectives into account or shes controlling this stampede.  Shes already threatened the relationship over this  and see how he reacted?  She has to decide whether or not her financial opportunism outweighs her love and commitment to the relationship.And if it does then she will leave him.  In which case his premature distancing makes a lot of sense from his perspective.  She already threatened hes not going to change significantly and this has been a persistent enough problem to come up over and over.  So she will likely dump him over money.  And lose her adopted family and his friendship in the bargain if he has any self respect not just a relationship.  Hell do fine of course  a man his age doesnt have any problem finding a new woman and hes hitting that sweet spot where he will appeal to multiple generations.  The money thing isnt that big of an issue to him personally either.  Plenty of men dont hit their stride until a little later in life.  And simply having a job and a career makes him a HUGE winner for a significant portion of women in the world.  So it really is up to the OP.  Either she will punish him and ultimately herself with her rigid ideas about financial responsibility lose her adopted family and lose her best friend all at once or she will learn to relax take a more EQUAL perspective in the marriage and stop threatening to blow it up over money.  You shook his ideal in your commitment vocally.  You might never recover from that.  A man loves idealistically and you not only found fault with him as a provider but you threatened to dissolve the union over it.  That kind of hint of disloyalty has a way of undermining years of otherwise positive work.  You think not having a good credit score is a bad thing?

6854779,0,t3_49ki4m,Is it possible your wife was peacocking to her friend and sort of made up the scenario after the fact? Maybe she was speculating on what could have been an easy way to trick you. I also must say your mothers attitude is confusing and angering. She is the one who raised you to believe that marrying due to accidental pregnancy was the right thing to do yet she is going to implant paranoia and secondguess the decision you made based on her principles?? Or perhaps she is projecting her own golddigging tendencies onto your wife.In addition now that someone has mentioned that your mom and sister may be plotting the story really doesnt make any sense. You have a prenup so your wifes plan to dupe you and dump you would not have worked out right? So this sounds like a fake or manipulated story by your sister. Even if it were true it includes your wifes admission of truly being in love with you. So what would that revelation accomplish? Id recommend you seek some marriage or individual therapy to tease out some of this confusion.

6881090,0,t3_49yuaf,Personally I dont feel that there is a need to confess your romantic feelings to a girl or initially show your romantic feelings for her by asking her to be your GF right off the bat and definitely DONT tell her you love her.The best way to show you have romantic feelings for her is to ask her on a date. Just tell her that you think shes a great person youve enjoyed hanging out and you would like to go on a date with her. It doesnt need to be anything too fancy but be clear you want to go do something just the two of you and plan an activity. This establishes that youre interested in more than hanging out as friends. Early on in the date breaking the physical barrier in a VERY conservative manner will further establish your intentions for her. Open doors for her and place your hand on the small of her back as she walks through. Do not follow the advice of the poster below who suggests you try to take her somewhere and kiss her.  Always respect her boundaries in this department. If the date is going well you can increase the physical contact to whatever you both are comfortable with  not sure what sort of rapport youve already established with her as friends. Once youve gone on a date or two and if things have gone well then might be the time to ask her to officially be your GF or whatever the high school norm is these days. ,relationship_advice,d0wac23,1,t5_2r0cn

6889472,0,t3_4a1wkp,First off sometimes things just come up and plans change. Secondly your friends may not realize the importance of this to you. Usually a crawfish boilcookoutBBQetc. with friends is not that big of deal. This why they may not think much of trying to reschedule it you can have the boil any weekend but this weekend is Xs th birthday party and thats a big deal. Birthdays are traditionally events that friends get together for. Wedding anniversaries are not. Thats great that you want to celebrate it with them but its not the same type of obligation as going to a friends birthday if that makes sense.As for being dramatic honestly you kind of are. Like you said you and your friends lead busy lives and scheduling is difficult. Your friends wife went to the trouble of planning his birthday party and you expect him to tell her she picked a bad day and has to call it off because of your crawfish boil? You are just making things all about you.When everyone is really busy its hard to find a good time to get the whole gang together. And even if you do those plans may fall through because stuff happens. If you want those friends to be a part of your life then spend time with them. You dont have to have some grandiose party with everybody there just do stuff with one or two of them when you can catch a game have them over for dinner just hang out. gtI feel like this speaks how they feel about me maybe Im being dramatic and maybe I should start engaging them less. If they are important to you dont engage them less because they couldnt make your crawfish boil which is frankly not that important. I dont think they are disrespecting you or anything I think you are just failing to realize that compared to a friends th birthday party a weekend crawfish boil is not as big a deal even if it is to you.In short yes Id say you are being selfish and dramatic.,relationship_advice,d0x8m3j,1,t5_2r0cn

6917525,0,t1_d10dcf8,Heres the full story please take time to read. Me and my girlfriend are together for  years. i never cheated on her although im so bad before i met her. im his rd boyfriend and shes my first girlfriend. we have lots of happy moments and also lots of fights because of my stubbornes before but ive changed. time goes by while im busy keeping myself change for the betterment of our relationship. last year august  that was the time that shes chatting with a guy the guy that i also knew and trusted during her board exam wayback juneseptember  to accompany her while we are in a long distance relationship. after that august  i feel the change she doesnt have time for me  when shes with me all she do is sleeping. but when in her friends plus that guy also their friend shes not tired shes enjoying. i think to myself what did i do wrong i dont want to lose her.So i told her to stop chatting with that guy and she told me that he is just her FRIEND theyre BFF she said. So ok i gave her the opportunity to continue communicate with that guy. December  we fought again because i really with that she doesnt need me anymore. she told me that she want to have space . so i gave her space. after  days of giving her space i really cant imagine if shes not with me or maybe she dont want to love me anymore. i go to her house every  in the morning straight for  days from december  to december   bringing her food chocolateslove letters . on the first day i came to her house i really thought that we are now ok because we talked  she cried i cried and we hug each other and kiss each other before i go home. after i went home i opened my cellphone and have twitter notifications. her twitter logged in on my phone  maybe she forgot to log it out.i read the twit with her girl friend  she told her friend that she cant sleep because a stalker came to her house early morning and its me. after i read that message i felt like im a useless boyfriend. but then again i just accept it and continue visiting her on her house early morning. december   is the time that i really thought we are completely back to normal. I boost my efforts made a lot of efforts and acceptance to love me more even if my school is affected my health is affected  i dont eat sometimes just to buy him a nice food to make her happy or telling her to have some hanging out just both of us. February   she then again forgot to logout her facebook on my phone i was really curious what do they talked about each other so i opened theyre conversation and i found out december  the time when im always visiting to her house early morning to fix our relation. the guy is asking her to watch movie and up to the point the that he is asking my girlfriend to have sex with him. i really cant believe it that the guy i trusted during her board exam and till now is asking her for sex. so i immediately texted my girlfriend to come to my home to have a talk. when she came i show her the messages. and she told me that nothing happened. and she told me that shes keep answering it theoretically and keep saying sorry to me.and i ask her why did she did that to me. she told me the shes tired of me since june or maybe she fell out of love to me. she hug me kiss me and then i accepted her apology . and told her that we should start again but sad to say that problem is keep popping out of my mind.few days goes by that happening is keep popping out on my head i cant sleep i cant eat i cant do whatever i want. i told her again that she will keep distance for a little bit of time because its keep popping out on my head. she told me okay. but still they still have conversation hanging out . she didnt listen to my favor . march   we faught again and she said that she is tired same as what she told me the last time we fought. after hearing what she said i feel like all my efforts to make her happy efforts to make myself change for our relation is a waste for her .i told her that we still didnt fix this relationship because your attention is in your friends and that guy not on me she didnt care on me as she care on her friends. i told her that i really cant take it if that guy is still at her side. i told her just month  month of keeping away distance to make my mind clear and focus on our relationship until it is fixed. she said okay ill do it ill stay away from him. we say sorry for each other again. but after she went home her mood changed. it feels like shes telling me that the favor im asking is wrong. till now i dont know what to do i dont want to lose her eventhough it really hurts,relationship_advice,d10fao5,1,t5_2r0cn

They were together a long long time before they got married. But Im not going to talk about this or my emotional damage I have from being raised by this type of man. No. I want to talk about his last girlfriend and how I felt about her. She was  when he brought her home and I was a kid. They were together for  years! Up until he met his current wife. We hated her. She didnt really do anything wrong. I mean she could be a rude woman but she wasnt awful to us. She represented my dads skewed priorities. She was a living embodiment of his fetish for young women. She made me feel crappy for just existing. Dad of course put her first. She liked chocolate so for my bday I had to have chocolate cake even though I hate chocolate. Her needs came first. Dad couldnt give her up until he got someone younger so hed literally sacrifice us if he had to. She died after they broke up and I still hate her. Im close to the age she was when she died and I still hate her. I cant shake it. It isnt her fault not really. My dad is to blame here. These kids probably wont like you. You represent a few unpleasant things for them. Thats how it is. I wont say that you shouldnt be with him. My husband is a little older than I am and I have heard some unfair comments  so I wont do that to you  but I will tell you the truth about how the kids will probably feel. PS.

6954737,0,t3_4ax6if,Bluebellsss really described it well. They only thing I would add from my experience is the feeling of intense guilt whenever you do something independent or on my own. This may have been specific to my experience since the girl in question constantly demanded my time. The most defining thing is the feeling that everything is your fault and you can never do anything right. It sounds like youre in a classic case and owe it to yourself to get out. This will be very hard but you can do it. You will feel like the other persons life will fall apart without you and that that too would be your fault. They may even say this explicitly among other really unfairunreasonable things and you will be strongly compelled to believe it. This is however more of the same emotional manipulation. Learning to identify these manipulations for what they are will help a lot but it will take practice. You can also start by cutting out some social space that is just for you a hobby maybe something you do for yourself. Really you need to steadily define yourself on your terms again and remind yourself that it is okay to take care of yourself first because no one else is responsible for you. Conversely you can care about someone else but youre not responsible for them. Ultimately you can never really love someone unless you know how to love yourself. This last one will make sense in time. Best of luck and take care of yourself.,relationship_advice,d14ni56,2,t5_2r0cn

6962020,0,t3_4b0pk9,Hey uClingyhelpme   It seems youre getting a bit of the reddit witch hunt going on here. Your post is a bit negative and frankly I see a lot going on in it. Please read everything Im about to say before you dismiss it.  First off you are both quite young still I still fit in that category compared to many but Ive got more than a few years on both of you. My biggest suggestion is to grow up a bit. Stated more harshly than necessary but done so for shock value.  It seems that you understand to an extent that depression is something bad. Yes it is it is really really bad. Worse when not treated. It sounds like your husband could use some help both in terms of counseling and mental health treatment. This is not something pleasant for anyone to do and furthermore male pride often gets in the way of treatment. However from your description of how things are going things are going to keep going to hell unless treatment is pursued. A possible way to ease into treatment may be to do some relationship counselling and hopefully get the counsellors to in the gentlest way possible encourage him to seek out individual treatment.Another suggestion that may be helpful is to actually sit down and talk to him. This is something that has to be done with a lot of care it is very easy to over emphasize one aspect or another. I.e. end up playing the victim card end up attacking him in the conversation etc. Things to focus on are meI statements for instance I really want to be here for you during this process I also need some me time. or It hurts me when you criticize me. This conversation may be best done during some form of relationship counseling so that they can facilitate a neutral exchange of information to hasten understanding and avoid hurt feelingsescalation. One thing to understand is that learning how to discuss things in this manner and being able to talk in this manner will be one of the biggest accomplishments in your marriage and likely the single biggest thing you can do to preserve and strengthen your marriage over time. Its worth the investment to make it happen.I know whats going on now is rough Ive had the chance to see couples go through similar things. Find a friend that you can confide in their job will be to help build you up and give you strength to continue would be best to find a female friend for obvious reasons make sure it doesnt turn into a complaining session or the like. Youre not trying to complain your seeking out some venting and emotional support to continue forward. But rest assured with a bit of help youll both be in better places and have a much happier marriage!,relationship_advice,d15hbe7,1,t5_2r0cn

Then listen to him especially because about what happens in the past. Does he understand your matter? What does he want to do to make the situation better and in general to avoid to hurt you?And of course it is not irrational. Not only because thats a topic to discuss in a relationship but because about the past too. Go talk and discuss with him. Try to be as calm honest and easy talking as possible. Its not about winning an argument but about finding a solution which you both can accept. Care for your relationship and fight for yourself.

The most hopeful thing is that you think he can change for the better  about which I have doubts his hypercritical attitude is not only bullying but suggests a deepseated dissatisfaction with you as a person. To save yourself further grief down the line I think you should put your relationship on the table so to speak and say that if he doesnt like you then the two of you should part amicably but if he does care then respect for your feelings is required as proof. This is an ultimatum and may not be to your taste nor compatible with your personality but I think that a relationship on the path you describe is doomed unless there is a change of behaviour or you are content to be bullied.,relationship_advice,d1csb1n,1,t5_2r0cn

7060153,0,t3_4cb8r3,At your age it is pretty normal to want to explore relationships. It was unlikely that your high school gf would become your wife and the mother of your children  couples usually outgrow one another as they bridge the gap from teenager to adult. It sounds like she wants to put her efforts into someone new. Not saying this is the right thing to do  she should end the relationship with you first if she isnt interested anymore. I would start by asking her if she is still happy with you or if there is something she wants to talk about with regards to where this relationship is headed. ,relationship_advice,d1gmngp,1,t5_2r0cn

I actually had the flu a few weeks ago and she made me homemade soup and came over and read to me while I fell asleep then later we just played Risk or tried to it takes too long and we both ended up getting bored.  It was really sweet and about that time is when I realized that I missed that sort of interaction.  The intimacy but minus the sex you know?  Obviously I dont want to never have sex again just... a little less often and a bit more of the reading books together or snuggling and watching TV.  Thats one of the reasons Im concerned about telling her I dont think it comes from a place of needing affection I think she just genuinely likes it much more than I do.

7150948,0,t1_d1qyu3n,I used to be verbally and emotionally abusive in my past. On rare occasions I would become physically threatening. It was very scary for my current partner the couple times I completely blew up. There are about three moments that I almost cant believe I got so bad. We would talk about things and I would work on it. Some of this stuff is kind of like bad habits it takes work to develop consistency  and with mental health in the mix sometimes it requires more than working on your behaviors. After regressing several times she told me that she didnt think she could handle the up and down cycle  we were talking about these problems to end them not have them come back after a few weeks. I believed my ex when she said she would leave me if I couldnt make a consistent change  she doesnt really fuck around is very direct and honest. Your husband might have a wake up call when he realizes that you will indeed leave him if he wont make changes. Its scary being alone but so lovely not being abused by someone at the same time  you and your daughters wellbeing is more than worth it. I would be sure he knows that a serious change is needed  if you leave and end up giving him a second chance I would encourage you to have essentially no tolerance for any of that behavior resurfacing.

Dont fb message me ask me out on a real date using that phone number you keep asking me for and not using and him somehow taking that as me making fun of him somehow and also thinking I just wasnt interested.

Luckily it was only about a  hour drive so visiting was possible about once a month. I guess my first point is that these things can work but it takes a very strong relationship. Do you seewant a future with this girl? If not I can tell you right now its not going to work out.Secondly if you are going to transfer to this college because YOU want to for YOU then thats great.

My boyfriend and I moved in very early into our relationship because things felt right and it just fell into place that way and weve been living together ever since. I would talk to your SO about your concerns. You dont have to go through this alone or figure it out alone. See what he thinks about how youre feeling it could bring clarity. I dont know if you necessarily have to end the relationship for what happened but you clearly still have a lot of healing to do and that is completely understandable.

7209410,0,t3_4e7epg,Its hard to work off of limited info and speculation but from what I read in your narrative Im not seeing any point at which in recent history shes indicated that she wants to be in a relationship with you.  This definitely sucks for you but maybe you should take note of the indicators here and either aim to just be her friend or if thats not possible then back off a bit and redirect your interests elsewhere.If you do nothing else then at least respect her space and wait to tell her how you feel.  If you just barge into her solitude right with something like Imsosorryyouweredumpediloveyouwanttogoout?  Well then you are showing her that you lack in social skills or selfcontrol or both.That said the fact that youve held back so far and are trying to think this through before acting is a good sign.  But even if you do everything right you cant make her want you.  If you smother her with poorlytimed confessions of love you may just lose her as a friend.But hey do what you gotta do.

What Im saying is do you think enough time and healing has happened between that previous relationship and getting into a relationship with you?Do you think its fair to ask whether she got into this relationship before taking the time to be alone to really rediscover herself and heal?To me it sounds a little bit like she was alone hurting still trying to recover from that relationship then got with you even though she wasnt ready likely because she didnt want to be alone then and only when she realized she might be alone if she didnt pull the trigger with you did she decide to be exclusive with you.

If you feel like you need to do more or less listen to that feeling. Ultimately you want her to love who you are so I recommend showing her who you are more and strategizing less. Ultimately she is the only one that can decide what she thinks about the real you. You each have the job of trying to be as real as possible with each other so you can see clearly and make good decisions. If you find yourself strategizing too much you may be thinking about what you think that she wants which may be totally off base when you should be thinking about how to be true to who you really are and communicating your true feelings so she understands you.Yes you can learn how the other person sees you and yes you can learn how to do things differently to please your partner thats all good stuff as long as you are doing it because you want to and not because you think you should.,relationship_advice,d23czfh,1,t5_2r0cn
7261866,0,t3_4ev1ck,Hey man Ive just passed the one year mark of my relationship the first one ever to last this long.What youre describing sounds a lot like the end of the relationships honeymoon period. In the beginning you were excited as you and your girlfriend discovered each other. You tried new things and learned what worked and what didnt. Now you guys know each other really well and the longterm part of the relationship is starting to set in.I bet you got butterflies in your stomach the first few dates you went on with her or really felt alive the first time you guys kissed. Your emotions were working on overdrive but those feelings arent sustainable.You mention all of the big things in the relationship are going really well. Dont ignore those. Its too easy to get caught up in the little things but theyre just that  little things. Everyones bound to get annoyed eventually just be glad youre getting annoyed about the little things and not the big ones.Heres my advice get into the habit of doing little things for each other. Thank her when she does something thoughtful. Bring her flowers every once and awhile. Every so often just compliment her on something shes doingwearing. Surprise her with a date to someplace shes never been. I found the little things are a great way to keep the love alive when the excitement begins to simmer down.From reading your post it sounds like you might benefit from having a little more you time. Make sure you can go out with just your friends once or twice a week. See if your girlfriend can pick up a hobby at home. Everyone gets these feelings. Your girlfriend is probably going through something similar. Its happened to me and probably your parents too. What separates great relationships from those that fizzle out is how you deal with it. You can quit jump ship and find the next hot new girl but the magic there too will fade.

7296754,0,t1_d27kprw,The frequency to which he talked with this girl is what made me initially uncomfortable. They talked a lot on snapchat which I didnt think supported his initial explanation of talking to her because she needed advice about her relationship I ended up deleting snapchat because of this bothering me this was when we were in college he has also since deleted it I found the pictures because I looked through his phone after not trusting him. I regret this and he has forgiven me and I havent done this again. I found out he was still talking to her after that because he eventually told me through interactions between her and his friends and from being with him when she contacted him.I havent always been the most secure person in accepting me for who I am.. I am a perfectionist.  I am working on this by reading selfhelp books changing my expectations for myself talking to a therapist etc. I have been working on this for a while and it is certainly improving but the scenario with this girl presented itself as a roadblock. He has told me he will not lie about these things anymore and has been more open when I ask questions but it does not seem like he has made large efforts to regain my trust and is still often reluctant to talk about the full story of what happened with this girl. ,relationship_advice,d27lap1,1,t5_2r0cn

Like I said this happened a bit ago the fact that it caused her pause to reinstall contact with him means it was somewhat serious at least.It could have been serious but for a large number of reasons that make a hell of a lot more sense than rape.gt At the same time though what if its just something that fizzles soon?Then you are still a fallback plan and will continue to be until she finds someone else to devote her attention to. gt  Do people who have fallbacks put that much effort into them?Yes they do. Its how they keep them as fallback plans. That effort increases as they feel they are losing their fallback plan but only enough to keep them there. The reality is that if she wanted to be with you you wouldnt be referring to her as your GF with quotes.

As far as loosing her no she is losing you. You seem like a selfrespecting man who is concerned for what has happened. You dont have time to be checking her phone and worrying about her nonsense about trust her when she met in secret. I think if she cares about the marriage and about loosing you she should break off the communication with her friend or only communicate with him when you can see what is going on. Otherwise if the shoe was on the other foot she would be upset with you. This is a serious situation and you should check out I hope you are doing okay man.

7321685,0,t3_4fnqo4,Overall it does seem like youre overreacting. It sounds like your bf is not allowed to talk to other women and especially if theyre attractive and that is crazy. There are so many women out there! He probably meant nothing by talking to the first one and you snooped for no reason according to your post. It was platonic they didnt say anything inappropriate right? After you fought with him over essentially nothing he probably figured itd be easier if you didnt hear about interactions with other women so he didnt broadcast those either. Can you blame him? Is he supposed to pull up Facebook for every woman that he happens to talk to in a day and show her pictures to you? Thats silly. The thing thats kind of weird is him continuously looking at a hot girls Facebook. I assume he knows her in real life and is potentially using her pics as inspiration for private time. I would take issue with that. Sexualizing a real person you interact with is pushing boundaries.  Unfortunately youre coming from what seems like an insecure and unreasonable side so he may continue to brush off your overreactions as ridiculous. You should work on relaxing about him talking to other people. Your self esteem needs work. He is with you for a reason! Not every woman will be able to steal him from you but if you act possessive and super jealous that tends to be a big turn off for many. That may be what actually pushes him away from you. ,relationship_advice,d2afbiq,2,t5_2r0cn

Your situation is sounds like he isnt brave enough to tell you its over. I did only skim this but the sense is that he is completely over your romantically but still wants to have a friend around that he can shoot the shit with if he needs to. Whether you arent facing the music or he is friendzoning you into thinking things arent over through emotional manipulation either way I think the sane thing is to at the very least take some time off from them.

It made me feel really shitty about myself. He made these comments two years ago and I honestly still think about it til today. I joined a gym and Im now getting mental help for exercise addiction and it all started with him liking big butts and me taking up weight lifting trying to grow mine. Im saving for breast implants I always use fake tanner and Im eagerly waiting for Australia to approve a new surgery I read about that can change your eye color from brown to blue.

When I was  I dated a girl  years younger than I who had been battling bulimia and body dismorphia since she was .The short answer to this is there is nothing you or her family can do to help her. She needs treatment for these disorders. My ex had a dual diagnosis  bulimia and alcoholism. She was bulimic to try to maintain her lb thin figure at  but then would feel extremely guilty so would need to drink and get drunk to feel like all is right with the world. When she got drunk her inhibitions would lower she would eat whatever then would throw up and the sick cycle would just continue.My exes family spent WELL OVER  OF THEIR OWN MONEY TRYING TO HELP MY EX  ALL TO NO AVAIL. My ex had been to HALF A DOZEN treatment centers and she still hadnt gotten a handle on her disease  in part because she didnt want to. Maturity of a person stops when a disorder such as bulimia starts which would also explain why my ex was extremely immature didnt pay her own bills and did not take responsibility for her own actions.Do not waste your time with this girl. As hard as it may be you need to strongly consider just ending things now. I chose to stick it out and try to work through the issues with my ex.

So it is not like he does not have some desire to he is more talk than do though. But I suppose that is his problem bot mine. We live together which means we eat mostly the same foods. If he doesnt want to stay with this lifestyle change with me I am more than willing to accomidate that when it comes to planning meals. My main gripe was his complete disregard for my feelings during our discussionturned argument. While I was explaining why its important to me he was mocking and being sarcastic which I found pretty insensitive. And then while Im already upset he is out getting drunk at twelve in the afternoon. So the root of the problem is not me wanting to change his diet but his lack of empathy towards my feelings and then going out and getting shit faced. ,relationship_advice,d2mt6r1,1,t5_2r0cn

If you are truly healthier now then your capacity for dealing with pain from the breakup should have increased. I would be real with yourself. Why not.... be single for awhile? Not date anybody at all? If youve fought so hard to overcome your difficult past why settle now? You deserve to be happy so does she. Its one thing if youre crazy about someone then you run into rough patches later on. It sounds like you were never crazy about her though. You sound like you love her but youre not IN love with her. You deserve to find that and she does too. She deserves the chance to be with someone whos just headoverheels for her.

7441658,0,t3_4h7g9j,You can dislike relationships with PDA while she can not be with you if she doesnt like your opinion on the subject. The thing that seems out of place is that you clearly told her how you felt and she completely ignored it and continued doing what you told her you didnt like. That is not healthy. I think you need to sit her down when you arent upset with her and calmly discuss this. Tell her how it makes you feel and more importantly offer solutions. Things like keep your hands off of my face in public or no making out in checkout lines. Then discuss these solutions with her until you find a solution that works for both of you. If you cant find a solution that you both agree to then this relationship isnt going to last without one of you eventually snapping. If you do find a solution then make her stick to it. If she starts touching your face be firm when you tell her to stop. Increase the firmness or your response to stop her the more she pushes it. Really it all comes down to you not enabling the behavior you dislike even if that hurts her feelings. ,relationship_advice,d2o2hso,2,t5_2r0cn

7486378,0,t3_4hwvxl,Well and truly. Even ignoring the sexual assault the reality is that he has been emotionally abusing you for pretty much the entirety of your relationship.The constant hot and cold the lying about and distorting of very obvious truths the other women screaming at you blaming you for his mistakes undermining your esteem... all of it is classic emotional abuse. It is practically gaslighting given he was trying to pretend he wasnt emotionally and potentially physically cheating the entire time with multiple people.The worst part is that it took its toll on you made you become more negative. Taught you to raise your voice send nasty messages. That isnt you. Hes left you wondering if you deserved this and rest assured on no level do you deserve any of this.Because even you raising your voice at him is part of how he operates. You notice that it is even easier for him to sidestep the bad shit he is doing now that you shout at him? He can just say well you were mean so thats why I am doing this ignoring that you were being mean in the first place because of him doing things like this. It is a feedback loop and you are on the wrong side of it.As for the charges I cant offer much legal advice... we are probably in different countries anyway. I would say pursue it if you really feel the need what he did was wrong and will likely both continue and get worse in time. If nothing else it may be a wake up call for him.You have to accept that he is a person who uses abuse and put downs to control other people because he is weak and scared. He needs a sense of control so he cheats and lies and manipulates. But he is terrified of being left of being abandoned so he is fuelled by a near endless amount of anxious energy it is like he is always desperately fighting for his life. You got caught up in that he near destroyed you because he is terrified of nothing. None of it was you. Nothing you did or said warranted the responses he gave you. I doubt he even listens to people most of the time. You have to remember that you are worth more than that and that you are worth being loved. Try and undo the damage become the caring and positive person you were before him and move forwards with a newfound understanding of just how sad some people can get.    ,relationship_advice,d2t5shh,2,t5_2r0cn

7541300,0,t3_4im3r2,I seem to be in the minority sometimes on this issue but tbh I think a LDR is a BLESSING in college! It lets me have my own life. You said your schedules will be busy so being at different colleges will allow you to do everything you need to do without worrying about spending time together which sounds super harsh but a relationship is a huge time committment if youre physically together. I honestly cant imagine having to go out of my way every day to see my boyfriend when college gives me eight million things to do. I love him and we text a TON but with ROTC obligations and my premed classes and volunteering I feel like itd be SO hard to make time to hang out with him every day if he went to my school without something else like grades being deprioritized.Long distance is not in my opinion that difficult. I dont know exactly where you and your girlfriend will be but surely youll still see each other on holidays when youre both home with your families? Thats a few guaranteed visits throughout the year and depending on how far away she is you guys could take turns visiting each other on weekends. If you have a busy life being at different schools lets you have those lives and then at the end of the day you get to relax and talk on the phone. My boyfriend and I have a tradition of syncing up Netflix and watching something at the same time while we call or text. The distance will make or break your relationship but if youre both committed to each other and are truly determined to make it work youll be just fine. If shes worth it the distance wont be too big an issue and youll both be that much happier when the distance is gone. ,relationship_advice,d2zer33,2,t5_2r0cn

7570866,0,t3_4j0zs7,I feel like you do have a certain point in feeling worried and feeling like this is a red flag especially since you say youve had trust issues in the past but from the information youve given it feels like there just shy of enough facts to make proper assumptions with.My advice is to wait it out for the next thing to happen. If anything similar takes place then youve got to take serious actions because then it turns from something that might be a problem to something that definitely is a problem.To me it almost feels like shes desperate for others to know about her new relationship. Perhaps her past events andor relationships have made her be this way?Its clear that this is bothering you and so it feels like something you might want to do is sit her down and talk about it. And yes I know youve already done that but maybe you should try to discuss it in more specificity. Think the conversation through beforehand. Think about what specifically about it bothers you mainly the lyingtruthfulness aspect bring up the conversation with Manager again and how it concerns you that the stories were so vastly different hers compared to the managers etc etc.Youre the only person that can make a final decision on this obviously but if this bothers you enough to the extent that you dont see the relationship continuing this way then maybe a solution you should think about is splitting up and making it clear to your coworkers that that has happened if thatd help.But as I said for now best to wait it out and see what happens next and only take serious action if something similar happens again.,relationship_advice,d32rr0o,1,t5_2r0cn

I am a divorced man and have four teenagers including a daughter your age. I learned a long time ago that its useless to try to win an argument with a teenager. I just say my piece and let it be. My kids make mistakes and learn from them. So Im going to say a couple things you dont like. Im not real happy about your MOMS inability to respect your fathers wishes and her just doing whatever the fuck she wants. Thats not parenting thats giving you everything you want if it sticks a pin in his eye and thats just wrong. Or shes irresponsible which is also wrong. Im not real happy about your fathers inability to resolve the issue with you peacefully and work out a solution or at least have a conversation that you can respect. Im not real happy about the parents whose goal it is to be cool and let kids drink at their house. Thats illegal and its really smarmy  waaaaaaaayyyyy toooooooo many parents today are DESPERATE to be friends with their kids and their kids friends instead of parents. You wont fully realize what that means until you are a parent of a teenpreteen. And you are you balancing the cost of a couple underage beers vs your fathers respect a four years of tuition today? Maybe youll gain independence from it. Maybe one day as youre writing your rd student loan repayment check youll feel a tinge of regret about this one act that put you in that position. Maybe not.

He seems frustrated because he IS trying to make things better for me and he doesnt understand why exactly I keep getting so upset. And on my side Im tired of telling him the way I feel and him not changing anything. To be fair I thought we were progressing after our last discussion when he agreed to stop texting a few of the girls that had crushes on him the weird thing is that he didnt actually care about them personally he just NEEDS to be the nice guy all the time and hes afraid of hurting anyones feelings. ,relationship_advice,d3l2b8w,2,t5_2r0cn

Im sorry but thats stupid as hell.No he shouldnt let a piercing be that big of a deal to begin with. He shouldnt let a piercing be a reason to think less of his girlfriend or make her feel bad for having it or even thinking about it. gt Relationships are about compromise.

I really dont want you to do this is not abuse or controlling at all.If you stopped cherry picking bits and pieces of what is said I would agree.

You cant just tell her to write but maybe you could gift her a nice journal not too nice that shes afraid to write in it and make errors with a really nice smoothwriting pen. That should at least make her a little excited about writing again. You could start the cooking thing together before you leave for your vacation.

7788385,0,t1_d3qmrwr,She is not choosing between you and her family. Rather she is choosing between a love match and a randomish guy selected by her parents for his conformity to their cultural norms. He will look a certain way talk a certain way be educated a certain way. If the go to visit India or her future inlaws come to USA she will be expect to help in the kitchen for hours every day and to let the inlaws makeimportant parenting and financial decisions for the family. Sure she can say no but they will keep offering input.  years ago in India few women were educated and marriage was a financial necessity. Divorce was rare but some women chose to live apart from husband or one example that i know of the house was in two parts and husband was restricted to one side wife to the other. Presumably she cooked for him still.  years ago a newly married woman lived with her husband and the inlaws.Today arranged marriages are much less common in India. However there is a strong motivation for a young man to have an arranged marriage with a usacitizen woman  immigration to usa. With arranged marriage the young lady looses the opportunity to get to know her fiance for an extended period of time and vet his personality financial choices parenting values etc etc. ,relationship_advice,d3rgz39,1,t5_2r0cn

Fun times indeed s.About bottle can she pump and leave a bottle for you at night? Ask her she may be open to this if it gets her a full nights rest.About changing the baby we had good luck with Pampers Baby Dry. They arent as nice as Swaddlers but they stay dry much longer and dont need to be changed at night. They may not be good enough for the advertised  hours and I wouldnt want to leave my baby in wet diapers for  hours but they have no trouble staying relatively dry for  hours. During the day we still change him every  hours but at night he pretty much is asleep when he stops eating.Finally with gas and burping Philips Avent is awesome at reducing gas again useless unless shes pumping and Little Remedies Simethicone gas drops have been a miracle worker for us when he is gassy and wont burp. We still try to burp him during the day but he doesnt need as much burping as before and at night we dont burp him at all just put him right back to bed.Then again hes our nd baby so were not exactly going through our first rodeo.,relationship_advice,d3rq8ho,1,t5_2r0cn

7793990,0,t3_4m2m42,Is it hypocritical of him to not be OK with you submitting pics when hes looking at them? Maybe. Is it different? Also maybe. I recently got out of a relationship with someone for various reasons one of which was him sexting other guys on Craigslist. We had had the discussion before about how porn was OK though I didnt want my nose rubbed in it but things like camgirls were not as there was personal interaction. He agreed. He says sexting wasnt cheating because it was typing instead of talking. Please. He insisted it wasnt cheating right up until I told him I was taking nudes and putting them up on Craigslist and sexting with whoever responded and that I expected him to be OK with it since he said sexting isnt cheating and isnt a big deal. Suddenly it wasnt OK with him after all. If theres personal interaction on this page at all I wouldnt be OK with it. And honestly Id probably have a problem with him being on the page even if there wasnt. I cant really explain why theres a difference between porn or sites like Gone Wild and sites where its local people but for me there is. I dont see why he needs to push the envelope to people in our area and cant just stop at porn. However if you havent communicated with him that you have a problem with this site if youre OK with porn I dont see how he can be expected to know that especially if theres no interaction. He may not get why its different to you than porn but he should respect it. To me viewing a page of local people nude is different than submitting. Especially if you didnt tell him it was a problem for you. My biggest issue with my ex was that I insisted he tell me exactly what he did and I couldnt be touched by him without picturing him exchanging nudes and jacking off with other people. And wondering if he was picturing it too. The knowledge of personal pictures exchanged provided a surprisingly insurmountable roadblock in our personal intimacy. I couldnt get past it. If both parties are in on one submitting to a site like that great more power to you. But one doing it as revenge for another viewing the page without their knowledge is concerning. Others may disagree but yes I feel its wrong. Particularly if you havent communicated that the page makes you uncomfortable. And yes Id personally also find it concerning if hes seen you on this site and hasnt noticed Hey that looks like my girlfriend. Or at least Hey that looks like my living room. Wait a minute.... It could be a sign that hes not invested in these nudes at all that he doesnt even fully look at them beyond Hey titties!. Which could be a good sign. Or it could be a sign that hes not invested enough in you or your relationship together which is obviously not good. I honestly have no idea which way that could go. The obvious answer is to talk to him about it. Let him know the page bothers you. Let him know that you submitted nudes there. It may change both of your perspectives. It may end up you decide its a deal breaker on one or both of your ends. But communicating about it is so so important for the overall health of your relationship. ,relationship_advice,d3s3pkg,1,t5_2r0cn

I should believe her . Just because. no explanation needed.The day before she left we saw one of her close female friend in the subway and they starting chatting a friend I had always been in good term with.

7847591,0,t3_4mt8mv,Hm. Youre not being very informative. How did you guys say goodbye the last time? How much did you talk about a break and its implications before? What are the basic rules you came up with? Still breaks do suck. Im in a similar situation. Based on her motivations for this break I dont think theres much for you to do. How confident are you in your relationship being able to make it through this?For me personally the first   months were actually good. I gained some distance towards the relationship and I gained lots of insights. For instance I understand the small conflicts we had better I understand what I could change to make the relationship more fulfilling but I also made out some things that I can expect her to work on. The time was pretty hard anyway. Youre being bombarded by friends advice and opinions on the situation even though they may not know they dynamics in the relationship too well. Theyll tell you theres another guy or that she just wants to try out many things and so on. Eventually the things they say get to you and you develop all these potential scenarios in your head of what shes doing and what you should be doing etc. So keep an eye out for that. Trust in her intentions and remind yourself of the things you said one another the last time you saw each other since those are the real things everything else is just anxieties insecurities and outside opinions messing with your mind.Its a horrible situation no matter how well on thinks hes prepared for it. Especially the question if you should work on moving on already or not when theres a possibility that youll be back together...this can largely be answered by the earlier question How confident are you that shell want to get back together after the break?One more thing. Dont torture yourself too much. If you notice that youre obsessing over this whole break thing so much that it has dire consequences on your psyche and daily life then its better to give the other person some kind of ultimatum than floating around somewhere in nowhere. For my gf and I the break time hits  soon and thats when Im going to message her and tell her that I wont accept another   months for the sake my well being and selfrespect. ,relationship_advice,d3y4zx3,1,t5_2r0cn
7849662,0,t1_d3ycl8m,I see your point but I think the reason for her being upset is because last week when she spent the day with him I texted her a few times and I know she felt like I was keeping tabs on her. We argued a little about that and I think she was likely trying to test whether or not I trusted her enough to not do it this weekend. I honestly did I really didnt want to check up on her. I just wanted to know she was alive but I think she took it as me not trusting her. Her mother wasnt worried just trying to get ahold of her to invite us to something. She told me she has just ignored these texts from her mom in the past and nothing has come of it. Her mom is not a worrier. One of the reasons I am so doubtful about something having happened was because things were really good when she got home from both last weekend and this weekend until I started getting on her about not responding to texts. I think the awakening is that even when shes out of town she cant completely blow me off and she sees that as a lack of freedom. Whether this is fair and mature or not is irrelevant at the moment. With regards to the space I feel that the space was working. Its not like we didnt speak all week I just played a few extra rounds of golf and she went out with her female friend one night and to a yoga class the other. We still came home to one another and talked about our days. I may have exaggerated the space. I think she is capable to giving that compromise but this week was about trying to go to the other extreme not go right to compromise. I can honestly say that i felt blindsided. Two weeks ago we were looking at houses and feeling on top of the world visualizing our life in a few years. She did a really good job of not showing that she was bothered. She didnt get flakey or distant she seemed normal.I agree with you that my fear of abandonment is something that I need to address. Its not severe but its significant. I still dont want to let it go I am truly happy and feel confident that I could work out my issue inside of the relationship.

In your eyes hes perfect to him he doesnt want to ruin that perception.Deep seeded insecurities are difficult to be honest about. Any sort of affirmation can be helpful but it comes down to his own beliefs and what he was to affirm through himself. Selfdeprecation can riddle the mind with incessant criticisms of himself. He has to start training his mind to do otherwise whenever he thinks youre out of his league. Tell him he has to start believing that that is more so of his troubled thoughts of being so vulnerable to you someone who he adores so much and someone hes terrified of since he knows how devastated he would be if you left him. Tell him how it affects you and how theres only one league that really matters.

He did abandon his kids and chose her over us it was light at first but then absolutely snowballed when half his brain got fried. Tracey is the reason why I spend most of my disposable income on my fianc taking his son out. I never want to be a stepparent whos partner chose them over the kids. I will never let a child feel the way I did. To see their loving parent they once had a close bond with put them on the back burner. True fact before the stroke happened he spent all his Christmas money buying her jewelry and he bought my brothers and I radio flashlights that recharged when you would wind it up. I am not a materialistic person in the slightest. But when you see your dad buy his girlfriend gold rings necklaces earrings and a Pandora bracelet you feel a bit fucking cheated.I have no idea what this woman did to make such a wonderful familyoriented man put his children on the backburner. Shes not even a trophy wife. She literally looks like an average woman average weight limp hair never wears makeup smokes like crazy. But the fact of the matter is yeah. He made his choice even before the stroke so its not even like the brainwashing was new. It certainly didnt help and if he hadnt had the stroke it would have been much easier to bridge that gap between us. But yeah shes just... Shes just a mean mean person.

As a result my own business hasnt been able to take off because I simply have not been putting anywhere near enough time on it. In fact during the busy months I cant work on it at all. Just recently  days ago Ive decided that I wont put my life or my own business on hold.

What makes it really hard is that he is so damn nice. He tries to go out of his way to take care of me whenever he is capable of doing so. Its just that I know that I dont need it. He always lets me pick everything we do but also requires me to be available to answer him every  or so minutes because he gets intensely worried about me otherwise. We also dont really fight much. Its mainly just me having an opinion and him folding.

I would find someone more suitable.Theres a book called I love you but Im not in love with you about what to do with a relationship like yours. Your concerns and worries are very typical and many relationships reach this point. Self help books or counselling can likely get you out of this rut. However your doubts have been going on for a LONG time. Almost half the time you two have been in a relationship altogether and the entire time you have been living together! That doesnt mean you couldnt save the relationship but it greatly puts into question if it is worth it especially as it will be a lot of work and no guarantee that fundamental things about her will change Such as her social awkwardness introvertness and lack of interest in hobbies. Chances are you will learn how to compromise better work around it better and do more things apart but she wont fundamentally change.

Im guessing deep down you dont.But even more this is about you. not about him. jealousy is a reflection of insecurity. you feel vulnerable so you lash out with jealousy. So why are you so insecure? what about yourself is lacking? do you feel that you dont deserve to be with him because he gets so much attention? What do you think you bring to the relationship that other women cant? what does he like about you?or alternatively are you projecting your own feelings? maybe you cheat often and think that he could easily do the same? you havent provided enough info to really get to the root of this issue but maybe Ive asked some questions to get you more on track. if you want to stop feeling jealous you have to figure out why youre so jealous.

When youre comfortable in your home trust me youre the worst part of yourself.Renting may be a waste agreed but you need to live together by yourselves to get the full living together experience. Share responsibilities get to know and work around both of your quirks develop mutual teamworking and coexistence skills etc. Trust me at least  months are truly worth your money even if you have to pay it yourself. If you cant live together well... You wont live together!If he doesnt listen to you in bed you must be adamant and assertive. You have a safe word make him respect it. Use your safe word and if he doesnt stop either move away or shut down yourself completely until he agrees to respect it. And do this until he starts respecting the goddamn safe word!Managing your times like gaming sleeping socializing etc. its something that can only be worked on if youre either living alone or at your house. Since hes gonna continue living his way in his house. Of course if you go to live to your parents dont make the same mistake.Try to find ways to take him out yourself. Check if theres a movie hed enjoy or a convention about gaming or maybe take him out for shopping something he likes? Something as mundane as I dont know getting paperwork done could be a good excuse to go out and while youre at it get some ice cream have dinner outside just walk while talking I dont know anything.I think you can work this out no need to break up or anything like that if anyone tells you this. But you cant fix a relationship by yourself you both need to put some work on it. And thats something he has to understand as well.

8193882,0,t3_4ri87u,Have you read that thing on the  languages of love? I ask because it sounds like he grew up with gifts being a big way to express love and affection. He probably wants something small on his birthday because THAT is the auspicious occasion and he wants something about that day to stand out. The only reason I think this way is because your boyfriend sounds a lot like me. I see gifts as a way to show that someone was thinking of me as a sign of affection. My boyfriend isnt big into gift giving and although he is never ungrateful he never seems as overjoyed by surprise gifts as I do. But when I go out of my way to DO things for him in the languages of love thing this is called acts of service he really appreciates it.My advice is to talk to him about it and for both of you to take a look at that website. If not that then try to understand why he behaves the way he does. For example when he asked you if you could buy something else small instead of getting upset a natural reaction ask him why he wants another gift. Maybe ask him if hed have preferred that you bought it for him secretly and made it a surprise for his birthday. The same gift when presented differently may have been received differently.If he is a gift person ask him how hed feel if you gave him gifts that didnt cost money like if you made stuff for him instead for example. If he has a problem with it Im not sure what to do. But some of the best gifts Ive received have not cost a penny. Personal gifts are the best. Of course you still want things to be relatively even. You dont want one person spending a ton on the other because that feels uncomfortable for the person who spends less and makes the person who spends more feel like theyre getting less out of this. But he has to be practical if you cant spend and honestly if he cant either you cant be buying thugs willy nilly. Hope this helps OP. ,relationship_advice,d51scfe,2,t5_2r0cn

8210657,0,t3_4rpv13,I really empathize with your husband I know how he feels cause Im going through this same thing with my boyfriend and his tone of voice. Hes like you hes big on bluntness and while his words may have no intended hostility behind them they definitely sound that way sometimes. Bluntness is fine with regular peoplewhen done tactfully of course but it doesnt work so well with a significant other that rightfully expects a certain level of kindness and sensitivity from you. A lot of the time he sounds annoyed and since hes talking to me at the time I assume hes annoyed with ME and it ends up hurting my feelings cause WTF I didnt do anything to him. Lots of times when I call hell answer with this exhausted what do you want tone in his voice and it makes me think hes mad that I called even though he swears hes not. Ill sometimes ask if hes mad at me and he tells me no why would I think that and hell sound even MORE annoyed which makes me worry even more. I end up feeling like a stupid annoying child and Ill refrain from talking to him as much cause that sharp edge in his voice just stings too much.It sounds like such a trivial thing to cause problems but when someone sounds pissed off all the time you start walking on eggshells and your guard goes up automatically whenever youre around them. Especially with a romantic partner a strangers harshness is easy to shrug off but it hurts coming from someone you love. Defense mode is difficult to break out of too once someone has been trained to expect sharpness from you and any existing sensitivity and insecurity on their part gets heightened.Im not trying to attack you or anything you probably just dont realize how you sound to him. Not using you statements is great but your overall tone really matters too. I work in a call center and one of the things they harp on the most is tone of voice and sounding like youre smiling. Sounds silly and I kind of rolled my eyes at it at first but Ive noticed that it really does make a HUGE difference. If I get an upset customer and I sound apathetic and emotionless when Im talking to them they lose all confidence in my ability to help them and they demand to speak to a supervisor. If I sound empathetic and sweet they calm right down and thank me for my help even theres nothing I can do to help them. Take your dinner statement for example you said I dont know I havent had a chance to think about it yet.. Completely neutral statement but Im willing to bet it actually came out more like I dont know I havent had a chance to THINK about it yet. My point is that tone can turn a completely neutral statement into an expression of anger. I would suggest recording yourself and listening to it later and try using affectionate terms like honey or sweetie when youre talking to him. Sound like youre smiling. Maybe he is oversensitive but I bet you sound a lot less calm than you realize too.,relationship_advice,d53vy4r,1,t5_2r0cn

This is after  days of little communication apart from each other. she acknowledges the silent treatment is a big problem and she has been trying to work at it when conflicts come up. She says silent treatment is difficult but so is talking when things go bad. Im her first boyfriend and she said she didnt want to burden me with trying to figure out how to solve her lack of engagement during conflicts. I told her I loved her and I wanted to help figure out solutions with her. She isnt interested in counseling not that I could even afford that right now haha. When the good times are good theyre great. If I date another girl she may not give the silent treatment but she could be different in others way too. Grass isnt always greener on the side. What has worked so far is giving her space for a day or two and then talking with her for about an hour while she puts articulates her thoughts.

First off try to make her feel beautiful and sexy kiss her all over during foreplay tell her how much you like her vagina... Remember that the core of the problem is that shes learned through experience with this asshole ex that her vagina is ugly and gross. Show her thats not true. Ask to finger her externally or internally whatever she wants and at the end lick your finger or something to prove you like it. Then the next time or after a couple times of fingering ask her if you could please go down on her. If she says no then bring it up the next time.

It sounds that he knows everything but still he does not want to accept it that you are doing your part of job. You have to tell him firmly that you are hurt when he says you lazy and call you other names. If he does not change his behavior then you have to take harsh decision to make him learn the lesson. Make him assure that if he has any plan to take care of your son and he is willing to share the responsibility of household work then you are ready to work full time. He needs to share half of responsibility in every work that requires maintaining the house. He should have not expected too much from you. ,relationship_advice,d62akcq,3,t5_2r0cn
8488963,0,t1_d62hbrj,This? Why isnt this the top comment? If youre talking about a relationship ESPECIALLY at  why are looks the most emphasized characteristic? OP Felt the need to explain and provide evidence for being attractive but she didnt provide any evidence for the personality characteristics. Maybe thats an indication that she focuses on looks and isnt humble when relationships start out about looks but she wants the follow through and personality is what gets you follow through and commitment.Edit I thought this entire post was a troll until I saw sincere comments. Edit II I saw where OP said shes new to daring. Well youve got some catching up to do so slow down. Dont rush looking for the one. Most of the people out there spent many early years doing that and youll be an easy target to use. Focus on what you want and who you are and it will take time. Youre going to have to be patient about that. Otherwise youll get exactly what youre looking for an attractive partner who only cares that youre attractive and meet the other checklist requirements.

8494854,0,t1_d63eait,I think youre wrong in saying Ive missed the point. I was just commenting that he is unwilling to give any financial support whatsoever while expecting you to cook for him like a fifties housewife. He seems so afraid that you will somehow benefit from living together but he thinks he should. Im a single mom myself and I know that if I lived with a partner in a combined household and paid half of the household expenses plus extra for groceries to make up for the fact that I bring kids into it Id still come out way ahead. Its just that hard to maintain a household as a single parent.You are making it sound like you want to live with him without paying any expenses which confuses me a little. It sounds like youd still benefit by combining households even if you paid your share. But him thinking you then need to make him dinner bothers me. None of this really matters though if it is as it seems he wants to be your boyfriend only when he can completely ignore that you have children. It doesnt seem like thats going to change and its not fair to you or your children to keep going like this. ,relationship_advice,d63eo2a,1,t5_2r0cn

8504823,0,t3_4w794v,It sounds unlikely to be anything to do with you. It may be tempting to get drawn in to take some responsibility so you feel a sense of control or importance but I would try to keep the focus on how to help him understand his behavior so it does not repeat in this manner regardless of how you or anyone else behaves. He may be experiencing a form of depression or other mental health problem and so getting that checked seems to me the obvious first step. Depressed people may paradoxically push people they love away to avoid hurting them. As they see it. But this is all speculation. Start by recognizing none of this is your fault. Your power to help him is limited. This is also not your fault. He can probably do with your support as long as there is minimal blame and negativity from you. You can probably also benefit from emotional support from family and friends but not from him not until he gets much better. ,relationship_advice,d64no52,1,t5_2r0cn

And you would know from actually talking to them about this exactly what kind of support system and life your child will have.But if you truly were ready and prepared to give this kid a good life your entire focus right now would be on questions about how to take care of this baby.  People who are ready to be a mother arent questioning whether or not they should get rid of it.  They arent afraid to tell the father about the baby because the father wont want it and they wont have the fortitude to stand up and have it anyway.If you were ready to be a mother you would have come into this thread saying Im having a baby with a guy and I dont know whether or not he should be involved in the babys life.  You would know important details like where you will be working for the next  years to provide for this child where you will be living and raising this kid how you will be able to pay the thousands of dollars a year you need to pay to keep the kid fed clothed and happy.You want to keep this baby because youre an emotional mess right now.  Thats fine.  But is that really the best life this baby can get?  Thats the question you gotta ask yourself.  Is what you can offer truly the best life that this baby can possibly get?There are thousands of people out there right now looking to adopt a kid who are in stable loving relationships with good jobs and stable households.  They wait years for babies to show up often go across the world to get them and are VERY sure they want these babies.These people arent ever sitting around like Oh I hope the adoption agency calls!  But if they do Im not quite sure if well say yes...  They are  sure they want a kid because they pay a lot of money and spend a crazy amount of time and effort to get them.If you really think you can offer this baby a better life as a young single mom then more power to you.  But think long and hard about it and think about it from the perspective of the baby.  Because being a mom means you dont get to be selfish anymore or worry about the opinions of some random guy that you are casually fucking.Whether you keep it get rid of it put it up for adoption...the only decent thing to do is to tell the guy though.  And the fact that youve gotta come here and ask whether or not you should is just another in the list of reasons why you arent mature enough yet to have a child.,relationship_advice,d6hnr5v,29,t5_2r0cn

8613433,0,t3_4xt1nr,I am close with some people who deal with ADHD  I strongly encourage you to get diagnosed and get treatment. The people I know their medication makes their life a lot easier and their idiosyncrasies are a lot more tolerable when they dont have as much struggles with their attention and they have more faculty to deal with their behavior aince they are aware of what they are inclined to. You are young start now in understanding your behavior and issues  the difference between a person who started later in life is glaringly obvious. Sometimes comical too but in a theyembarassthemselves kind of way too sometimes. Get diagnosed if you think this is a serious personal issue it very well could be. And about your girlfriend...  When she gets defensive or irate and you give her wjat she wants communicates that being defensive or irate is reasonable behavior for getting what she wants. If you dont like a certain behavior dont enable and encourage it. Do not allow it to make decisions for you.   When you clean for her you show her that you are willing to do it and that she doesnt need to take responsibility for her own mess. Her parents are untidy and so is she. This is the normal for her. If you start cleaning for her now shes going to expect it in the future from you. If you want a partner who is more tidy you need to have a conversation about that. Someone who understands your struggle doesnt treat you poorly because of the uphill battle you face. Similarly I understand the resentment if you think you have a problem and arent doing anything to improve it  like getting diagnosed and potentially getting a prescription. If your condition is affecting your relationships and your life you need help in overcoming your struggle. Dont be surprised if she loses interest in supporting you through this battle  some are empathic of the struggle while it ends up a deal breaker for others especially at younger ages and that is if they choose to emapthixe in the first place.  Can you elaborate on feeling like she is suffocating you? Do you have to explicitly say we in order to suggest something you want to do with her? Whats this about? Or are you wanting to do things without her? If you rarely get personal time it makes sense you would feel overwhelmed.   Dont make jokes about things your partner doesnt like. At the same time she might get upset about these jokes  because you two have a serious issue going on when it comes to sexual compatibility and she doesnt want to discuss it. I masturbate when my wife and I dont have enough sex most people do this. You need to decide if you are OK with the current frequency. You need to ask her if she is OK with it. Nit talking about this is not an option. This is a conversation you must have at some point  continual resistance would make me question remaining in the relationship.   Expand on your opinions and her disagreements with examples. Is it everything? Even trivial things? Is she resentful rude disrespectful? Continues to go on even when you two have agreed to disagree? ,relationship_advice,d6i9yey,2,t5_2r0cn

Youre not going to learn a language by not speaking it so try. If you can tinker on your phone you can google translate some phrases to at least try to communicate.

8624544,0,t3_4xzifc,Im guessing that instinctively you are feeling a bit used a bit like a wallet to your wifes unilateral oneway personal ambitions. If you are given the circumstances I would not be surprised. There is a recognised phenomenon not much talked about called  the professional student. Is that too maybe at the back of your mind?Do you think she is being downright selfish at the cost of your marriage your relationship and that with your daughter? Has the thought crept into your mind that she wouldnt be able to do any of this unless you had bankrolled it? How would she have paid for it? Do you wonder sometimes is that the only reason sh married you to have the child she wanted and to pursue her sole dreams? What about you? What has it cost you apart from a lot of money? What dreams ambitions have you given up on as a result? Have you had a discussion with your wife about any of this or have you feared doing so for a number of different reasons eg being seen as being selfish or meanspirited yourself? And what about your wifes attitude towards you? Do you feel she takes it all for granted and has not really given any true indications that there may be some benefits to either you or the relationship long term? Do you even feel she truly has a long term objective with all of this that she truly and honestly wants to achieve or do you feel that it is maybe all a bit of a game more about the process an neverending process with no real endgoal?I dont know what the answers to any of this is but no you are not asking too much of her in general terms rather than the specific question about now pursuing the PhD. I am not even sure the question has any relevance.,relationship_advice,d6jo51p,23,t5_2r0cn

8625292,0,t3_4xxr7v,As everyone else has said...huge red flag.  If he loves you he should take your input into consideration. He should be interested in making compromises.  If you end up living with his family theres a good chance that almost every disagreement will result with them stacked against you.  Youll feel smothered and oppressed and youll live in constant resentment.Tell him why its important for you both to form your own unique bond outside of the influence of either his or your family. Tell him what concerns you about living with his family.  Tell him what you want  where you want to live why thats important to you etc.If he wont budge Id suggest counseling with an impartial rd party. They can help you clarify your wantsconcerns and help him clarify his and ultimately help you both reach a decision that is best for you both whatever that may be.Ultimately though if he wont budge on this very big demand of you this raises questions for me on what else he wont budge on in the future.

8647779,0,t3_4ybe11,I know the place youre in in your life. I know because Ive been there.  My ex husband had called me every name in the book threw things and I never knew when the next blow up would happen.  It was like sitting in a boat during a storm and trying not to move so the boat wont tip. Its a constant walking on egg shells around them.  I stayed because I grew up in a religious family Dad was a pastor and didnt want to bring embarrassment to my family. When i would tell him that this is not how its supposed to be... he would tell me I grew up in a Brady bunch house and thats not real and this is how real marriages were.  So I put up and shut up to the point of me having no self worth.  I got to the point of knowing if I stayed I was going to die.... not from him physically doing it but because I was so low I would take me own life. I truly believed I was the problem. He had already isolated me from my family and friends and I truly felt I had nobody to turn to.  It wasnt until someone Im his family that said to me they knew I would leave him and they wouldnt blame me that I felt like I wasnt alone. So somehow I mustered the courage to run.  Im telling you all of this because I want you to know I truly do understand and you dont need to put up with this life with him. You deserve to not be scared of making him mad or saying the wrong thing and setting him off. Thats not a life.  As far as your wedding celebration goes I think friends and family would understand if you called it off.  Youre  going to need your friends around so let them come and be with you through this.  Dont stay with someone because you have history or youre hoping they will change. Sure my ex and I had some great times but all of that was ruined by the emotional abuse. Everything he ever said that was nice and sweet was tainted.  I truly believe people can change but they have to want it they have to do the work. That is not up to you and it seems he has made it clear that he has no plans to change himself.

8684407,0,t3_4yxfgo,This is an awful situation that I can relate to. My fianc m and I f have argued many times about where we are going to live. His dream is also California and we currently live in Wisconsin. Years ago before we were together I moved to Arizona on a whim and those several years were a struggle because I missed my family so much so I can see where she is coming from. Its really hard for some people. I also have zero desire to live a California life and it sounds like she feels the same. We havent moved out of state yet but hes open to other states besides California especially after looking at housing prices which has opened me up to the idea of leaving Wisconsin. We kind of sat down and figured out citiesstates we could both agree on. Maybe she would be open to living in another big city you could also be happy with? Although she could decide she still wants to go back home and then you moved for nothing. I dont think theres much else you can do about this besides parting ways. Seems like you both have to decide if living where you want is more important than being together and make that decision sooner rather than later... before you get married.,relationship_advice,d6r6dez,1,t5_2r0cn

8687678,0,t1_d6rkwqm,Thank you for this.  To answer the first point we have definitely talked about a lawsuit..  the problem we have with that is the owner of the daycare is a very nice lady.  She has treated our kids like gold.. like her own grandchildren and we love her like a grandmother.  She was not at the daycare at the time of the incident her negligent worker was.  She is not without fault though we understand this.  She did chose to hire the worker and the worker has since been fired.  It is tempting to get a quick buck out of this but it would be at the cost of ruining the owners life.  I have known her since I was a child.. she babysat me and my brothers even.  A lawsuit would not change what happened it would only destroy a relationship we would rather not.  On the second point  I would LOVE to stay at home with my girls.  They mean the world to me.  The choice for me to continue working was purely a monetary one.  I make nearly x what she did and would be fiscally irresponsible for me to give up my job.  I really do appreciate what you said and i dont disagree with you.  In a weird way it sounds like im not standing up for my child by choosing not to follow through with legal proceedings.. for the sake of the owner.  She made a poor judgment call on the choice of worker but we do not feel like that mistake warrants a lawsuit that would destroy her.  Does this sound crazy? ,relationship_advice,d6rl59j,1,t5_2r0cn

ALOT! In all honesty id get pretty turned off and isolated if my SO was constantly up my butt about what they want being more important than what i can handle. and  times a week seems to be a happy middle for most couples. but its for sure you two are not sexually compatible. your drive is way higher than his. he cant change that neither can you. so either A youre going to have to ease up on him or B decide if its a deal breaker.,relationship_advice,d6xwfdg,3,t5_2r0cn

8743453,0,t3_4zsxn8,Falling in love with someone outside your sexuality is a rite of passage for those of us with minority sexualities. But the truth is unrequited love happens to literally everyone. Its a tale as old as time and never easy to deal with when it comes up. My primary advice from someone who has been through this is to stop indulging yourself. At this point you are continuing to talk to him even though you know you have feelings and you know those feelings arent reciprocated or even reciprocatable. If you think of your crush Google the word limerence describes it well too as a physiological state what you are doing is positive reinforcement.gtwithout ruining a perfectly fine friendship.Theres a problem with this statement. What you have isnt a perfectly fine friendship because you are hiding stuff from him that is pertinent for him to know. Feelings intentions fantasy. Its no longer an honest friendship and its no longer equal. Theres a reason you have the inkling that telling him this stuff could end your friendship. Thats you gut telling you that what you are doing is wrong and he would reject you for it. Now would he reject you for the secrets or for the feelings themselves thats the part you cant know.It doesnt seem like this guy is gay or ace so you will never likely be on his radar in that way. You need to stop talking to him until the magic spell that crushes of this nature have breaks. I highly recommend cold turkey. This is an addiction treat it as such. Whether you tell him why is up to you. If he knows you as well as you say he will respect your decision and withhold judgment for your reason.PS this has happened to me personally twice. The first time I lived with the crush and stayed her best friend and it tore me apart. I got more desperate and obsessed and eventually it nuked our friendship mega heartbreak and no chance of ever even talking to her again. The second time I told the person soon after I recognized it took a step back and went no contact with her for  months. The crush faded I found someone else amazing who this time reciprocated the beautiful delusion we call love and the friendship was saved. ,relationship_advice,d6yl23e,26,t5_2r0cn

Since I dont live there I dont think I could get a second opinion but I can do more research to check it out which could be helpful just for reference.

8764182,0,t3_4zodpl,And if I chose to do so and maybe play along is that such a bad thing? It wouldnt be cheating would it? Because what makes cheating cheating is the lying secrecy sneaking around betrayal. What makes a relationship unhealthy isnt cheating not at its base anyway its dishonesty and disrespect. Since we dont lie to each other and we talk to each other and communicate we arent unhealthy. Flirting is only playing with fire if one person or the other is dishonest about it doing it knowing that they are hurting the other person or crossing lines or if its making someone uncomfortable and they dont want to speak up. Lying is bad disrespecting your partner is bad. And realistically flirting leads to cheating the same exact way that riding a motorcycle leads to wrecking on it. Not everyone wants to ride motorcycles or is comfortable with someone they love doing so but if youre going to ride you should follow the rules for your own safety and respect the situation youre in. If youre careless or disrespectful and dont give the situation the credit it deserves you run a much higher risk of getting hurt.I like riding motorcycles and I like flirting and as long as I keep my self control in tact and my husband is comfortable with it theres no reason that doing so is any more unhealthy than getting on a motorcycle. ,relationship_advice,d716nbt,1,t5_2r0cn

You are wasting your summer being heartbroken when you could be out enjoying yourself at the pool.Trust me I know it sucks. I have been there many times. Its ok to be sad and its ok to be hurt. Feel all the feels. But do something fun every day just for you.Tell yourself that hes going to want you back and then live your life as if he still wants you but is out of town. It sounds like youre more hurt that hes having fun than about actually being with him? If thats the case then youre giving him way too much power over your feelings. Join a few dating sites. Not to actually find a new relationship but to meet new men and explore your options. Dont talk about your ex on your dates. Just get to know the guys as friends. Enjoy the single life. Thats the best revenge and its actually the best way to get your ex to want you back. He wants to think youre at home crying over him. Thats going to make him feel comfortable and that he doesnt have to hurry back to you. Dont contact him. Go out and play. Build a life so that if he does want you back you wont be putting all your happiness on him and youre fine walking away if he doesnt treat you right. ,relationship_advice,d739gdy,1,t5_2r0cn

8795919,0,t1_d753o4g,I see your medical ethics issue. And the pain the OP is in over not being the primary go to for her childrens care. I also see the reality as a caregiver that situations dont always drop neatly into the ethical boxes taught in school. And the timeline here by the OP says that the SIL has been assisting since she was   long before any medical training was an issue. And if you check the OPs posting history the SIL has apparently explicitly declined to provide anything resembling medical treatment because of ethical concerns. That doesnt sound like the SIL is providing therapy.I am concerned about what seems like a Im the mother therefore I must automatically be deferred to with the highest respect as the expert position while simultaneously admitting that some of her decisions have apparently had serious negative results. And with her violent rejection of the suggestion that she get tested for Aspergers after apparently multiple people have suggested it.To me the SIL appears to be navigating a complex issue as well as she can. The OP has stated that the SIL has helped her compassionately without judgement and respected her boundaries when the OP requested the SIL back off while also providing social cover for her. I dont see that the SIL is actually doing anything wrong.,relationship_advice,d755et5,9,t5_2r0cn

8809467,0,t3_50td4e,It sounds like youre just going to have to deal with it not the way that you are currently or decide to have a relationship primarily based on friendship and smiler interests. This probably sounds incredibly harsh or closedminded but you are dating a child trying to micromanage her and wondering how to get her to grow up wout becoming an authority figure? Not possible unless you let EVERYTHING youve described go and allow her to receive the consequences of her actions.What in the world made you guys think moving in together to another State no less would be a good idea? Im actually curious. What kind of previous experience with relationships do you have?Stop asking her to clean up after herself. Dont even think about going behind her and cooking cleaning up and doing everything for her. Her parents obviously did a lot of that for her and you currently see the result.So how do you get her to do the things she needs to do in order to achieve her goals? Let her fail. If she comes to you for advice give it. If she blames you for her failures hightail it outta there. Theres nothing wrong with needing to grow up a little bit and relationships like this CAN work  but only if youre able to set clear boundaries mostly talking about wyourself not enabling her and shes willing to take full accountability for her actions their consequences and learn from mistakes. ,relationship_advice,d76s0et,1,t5_2r0cn

This is something that teenage girls say.... maybe early twenties.  But honestly a mature girl would have no problem meeting and getting along with other females no matter what the personality.  This kind of attitude is ridiculous and shows a lot of immaturity.  Shes a grown up and is friends with who she wants to be friends with.  I just cant help but roll my eyes at people who have this kind of mentality.

8833603,0,t1_d792h0o,Your issues with your partner expecting you to provide for her financially might be outdated crap that should make you question if this is the partner you want to keep but it might have merit. A successful household has labor needs money must be earned errands must be scheduled and carried out supplies must be found and purchased food must be prepared and stored the home itself must be cleaned and maintained.  If shes providing all of the services of a personal cook a maid a butler a personal assistant and a personal shopper and shes paying half the bills you are not being fair in asking she also labor to earn  of the money too. If you are splitting those labors as well then its probably a case of this person being wrong at least wrong for you. If you split monetary labor needs equally you should split the other household labor needs equally too. If you guys have never discussed division of labor now is the time. To answer your original how to deal with bills question there are  standard methods that are really effective Go all in pool your money into a joint account make a budget together and live with combined finances.  This is best if your longterm goal is a marriage with combined finances but if you are already having fights about money you might want to work on communication skills before trying this method.  This works especially well for oneincome households or traditionalists who prefer a relationship model with a more stayathome partner and a more workoriented partner working together. Split down the middle split everything mutual bills food etc .  This works best if your income is similar.  Attempting to split services like she pays internet you pay gas is clumsy and breeds problems.  Either split every single bill down the middle or agree upon special circumstances i.e. if she wants premium internet but you want basic she could agree to pay the difference for premium plus her  of the cost of basic beforehand. Split by percentage expenses on a split thats weighted by income. As an example if you made kyear and she made kyear your combined income is k a year.  That means she made  of the combined income and you make .  So she would pay  of the bills and you would pay . In your case this method is really close to  but if your incomes grow in disparity at some point this is a good option because it lets you take advantage of a higher combined incomes advantages without forcing the lowerincome party to suffer trying to keep up.,relationship_advice,d79ob9s,1,t5_2r0cn

You deserve better than that but she wants to try out a few different guys and see if she can do better.  If you dont let her do this shell always wonder find more guys and talk to them on burner phones or whatever.Heres the thing you glossed over in all this life isnt going back to the way it used to be and you have kids.  Stop wining about the consequences of moving too fast and start thinking about giving your kids the stability they deserve.

Anyways she said it was a guy that hit on her and she just didnt tell me so i wouldnt get mad yet he was her bestfriend on sc theyre friends on facebook and im just wondering if it was a random guy who hit on her why all that? When weve had petty breakups before shes said she will not allow a dna test if i want my child in my life i will undoubtetdly accept her as my own. These things scare me. She has admitted she chated on every guy shes ever been with but i was different.

Him being interested in someone else could be the cause of him being unhappy or it could be the result of unhappiness in the relationship.I guess people are just too afraid to be truthfully honest and tell their partner in fear that theyll leave them and cause they dont wanna be alone. Or theyre just afraid to say something because they really dont wanna hurt you. But Id rather know the cold hard truth than to be in a fake relationship...

8894241,0,t1_d7gvbjk,Agree . I also had an ex with mental issues for over  years. I felt so guilty breaking up with him and going no contact but it was the best thing for both of us. At first I did try to be there for him and be a friend but it was too soon. I started dating other guys and he would call me in the middle of the night upset. Trust me you dont want that. It hurt to see him so upset because he really was my best friend and I miss him so much but he needs to fix himself. Theres nothing I could do about it at this point and I think the same applies to you. Just give him space. ,relationship_advice,d7gylsd,4,t5_2r0cn

Thats why you should never get married.  Its merely job security for divorce lawyers.  And since the marriage rate is so far down they gotta get the gays on bored to save their shrinking business. Heres how it plays out after you get the Hey where is this relationship going? speech.  You bust your ass in college to get a job you have no idea whether youll like or not. By the time youve figured out it sucks youre straddled with kids a mortgage and a wannabee stay at home Mom then when the honeymoons over and  or  kids arent enough she talks you into adopting an Asian baby and you go along with it just to keep her happy while you slave away at a mind numbingly boring job. Seven or so years later the last kid is fairly independent and she goes back to work and meets some tall douche whos sweet on her. Then you get the I love you but no longer IN love with your speech.  Then its off to divorce court for YOUR education on what SHEs ENTITLED to !! That is alimony child support and you sharing a  bedroom apartment with two other dudes in the same boat who steal your cheerios when youre not looking.

I dont think any other people know of the cheating husbands so if I went the anonymous route there is a good chance they would know it was me. One is a good friends of hers that she confides in even about my relationship with her when we were dating. Also the proof is actually from her iPad because her iMessages from her phone came through on it. Thats how she got caught the first time so I checked again. I have pictures of a couple of the detailed conversations detailed sexting and talking of the last time they slept together. Also many erotic picsvideos back and forth to each other I did not take pics of those. I took these in case she wanted to delete and deny and try to call me out as a jealous liar.So I havent done anything yet and not sure if I will. I dont know any of the wives personally and I only know one of the men pretty well from working together. There are several good points made throughout the comments that I need to consider.

I tend to come off cold when I first meet people  its usually cuz Im just trying to figure them out first before I talk.  I also never had an SO when I was in college  I finally started dating at . Sometimes it just takes people longer.  Now looking back Im happy I didnt jump into things like some people. One of my female friends was dating and screwing around since highschool. Now she hasnt had any meaningful relationships  picks men who use her and abuse her.  She never learned to live herself and be ok with being alone. Ive had  actual relationships  the first was over  years  the second  months but tore me to pieces  this third one was well worth waiting for. Now to meet my guy now I had to wait. He was in relationships and a different state while I was in mine.  So I see the points in life where you are alone as just waiting for the right person to come through at the right time. Meanwhile screw your friends  join clubs like bowling or hiking to meet other people.  Even while youre out doing everyday things keep an open mind and just talk to people.  Find something about them you like or find interesting and comment on it start a conversation. You may just make a new friend. ,relationship_advice,d7ryo56,1,t5_2r0cn

9031191,0,t3_53yqgc,So look. You both are still quite young  early s is a very common time for both sexes to still be working out how a mature emotionally healthy relationship looks. Its a common time for both sexes to be working out how they work as people! So first thing I want to say is that theres nothing necessarily wrong with either of you. But there are definitely some larger issues going on here. Rather than look at the small issues look at the big issue thats causing them. The first big issue is obviously communication. I would ask why is your girlfriend telling you these types of things in the first place? And I meant that literally  in a calm nonaccusatory way simply ask her what shes thinking. Maybe shes telling you these things because she feels insecure and wants to seem desirable in your eyes. Maybe shes trying to make you feel jealous. This is an important thing to suss out. The next important thing is does she really not know that telling you these things will affect you negatively? She might be disingenuous but she might also just be immature. So figuring out whether shes coming from a place of real ignorance when she says that or whether shes coming from a place of deliberateness is also important.You wont learn these things by fighting. You wont learn them if she  or you  are on the defensive. Youll only learn them by communicating in a calm way probably over the course of several conversations.The next issue is obviously how to handle conflict. If telling your partner something bothers you is somehow tied in to power dynamics someone here and its not clear which one of you it is has a really disordered way of understanding relationships.A relationship in theory should not have any emotional power disparity. In other words each partner should be considered equal and emotional power struggles shouldnt be happening. There is no giving up power because neither partner should seek to hold emotional power over the other and neither partner should understand the emotional dynamics in the relationship as one of power. gtI am too butthurt about these things but doing it so with passiveagressive sentences that are hard to point to as evidence for something at allThis is about communication again not about power. Its not a weakness to confront someone about passiveaggressiveness. Its about being the partner who can act maturely take the high road and attempt to be productive. Thats where confidence  not power  lies. In allowing the behavior of others not to affect your own selfcontrol or sway you from doing what you know is the right thing.You can walk the high road and she can choose to join you. If she does not choose to join you and communicate about these things like an adult then you can choose to walk alone.gtAm I being little bitch about all this or am I rightfully annoyed?No youre rightfully annoyed. And again part of establishing healthy boundaries in a relationship and good communication is being able to say to someone Whether or not you think I should be annoyed about this I am. And we need to work together to find a solution to this problem and I need you to be able to hear me when Im expressing that I have a problem. Whether or not she is mature enough or ready to hear that from you is a different thing altogether. You cant control her or her responses to you. What you can do is establish those boundaries now and allow her to decide whether or not she wants to be a part of themgtHow can I tell my SO my feelings without it turning into an argument or at the very least not feeling like such a pussy for doing so?Just tell her them. SO you are consistently breaking your word to me when you tell me things like when youll be home. I need to be able to count on what you say. Lets work on a way to make that happen. There may not be a way to stop her from turning your words into an argument. Thats on her not on you. Your job is to communicate your issues to her clearly honestly and in a productive way meaning not yelling or something like that. Her job is to listen to your issues and engage with them  she doesnt have to agree with you but she does have to respond and hear you. Its not your fault or your problem if she refuses to do her job. Let go of responsibility for her maturity or her reactions. They dont reflect on you except insofar as you have chosen a partner who is argumentative immature and not yet ready to communicate or engage. Shes young. She may or may not learn those skills. Youre young. You may or may not learn those skills. But now is the time to start trying. Edit a typo,relationship_advice,d7xemzc,4,t5_2r0cn

9034113,0,t3_5402xj,I would NOT say right off the bat you are being played.  I think you can take his confession about smoking pot as a good sign he went out of his way without prompting I am assuming to tell you something that honestly is really minor would you feel the need to confess having beers with friends a couple times a week?  Smoking pot hardly warrants a confession to me and more seems like he just wants you to be aware of what hes up to in general and make sure its not going to affect your feelings for him.  As for the women on instagram I dont really know how that thing works I think that you just need to have a very neutral not accusatory discussion about it.  Tell him you arent judging or assuming but that you dont understand and it is bringing up doubt.  It is perfectly ok to bring up something like that to clear the air so long as he knows you are not doing it to be possessive merely to keep your relationship healthy and avoid any undo stress.  We cant always help the emotions that are evoked in us and the best thing we can do is address them calmly with the intent to settle the matter and move on.  If he is a mature individual who loves you he should be totally okay with having that talk and putting in some energy to making you feel safe and secure especially since you are longdistance.  You both need to understand that issues of trust and jealousy will be exacerbated in a long distance situation and it will take more effort than it might otherwise to keep those things at bay.  This is simply the work required to keep things healthy between you.  Dont let fear of his reaction keep you from confronting issues just make sure you are calm understanding and have all your ducks in a row before you bring things up.

In normal relationships be it romance or friendship your absence of reply would be easily interpreted as I dont miss you and dont care you are hurting and you would be cut off for good. As this relationship does not look very normal and she sounds a bit desperate she reopened communication by herself. Frankly speaking it seems she has feelings for you and that message was a try to be honest about it.

Just their mental health when they cant get it and their wallets when they do. Im sorry to hear about the neuropathy I dont envy you in the least.Begging him to stop just wont work  he has lost a job injured you and let you down  if it were a case of being able to make the right choice he would have made it by now. He is unable to make a choice for whatever reason. Im sure he wants to do the right thing but thats filtered by his need to rely on his crutch. Does he have PTSD? Some times its self medicating which turns into a habitual addiction. He has to want to stop himself or have something important enough in his life that makes him need to stop. I smoke too much imo  largely for pain relief tinnitus relief and because I dont drink alcohol its my wind down but when I have obligations they take priority. I just know I cant and I wont. Thats not an issue in my head I dont even think about it.When I was having a really bad time in my life though it became something I had to do. I HAD to smoke to escape for the crutch the ritual made me feel safe etc. It was easier to hate myself than help myself. That still pops up from time to time. I took up a very creative and inexpensive course and that helped me channel my pain. Plus therapy. I had a lot of therapy. Failing that and this is tongue in cheek maybe move to a state where its legal and he can get help at the same time. But thats really really... like terrible advice. Like dont do it.

I have also suggested counselling this is something she absolutely refuse she doesnt see the point. I dont really mean to ask reddit to rescue my marriage but some times it can be good to get some neutral points of view on things... People on Reddit has nothing to gain or lose by giving me their honest point of view. And dont get me wrong. We are not enemies we talk like friends and we can do stuff together as friends but it doesnt go beyond that any more. As it is we live together mostly because it is convenient and because splitting up means that we most likely have to sell the house and this house means a lot to her. I would be happy to give her my share but on one income she cant afford to keep it.  And you are right about one thing living like this prevents both of us from moving on and progressing. I am not really looking for a new romantic relationship but I feel that I need to move on in other areas. Being trapped like this isnt making that easy. And I know that she feels the same way.

You seem so anxious to find a better guy than your exes and a consistent and exclusive relationship that you might be willing to go fullfledged with a guy youre not attracted to.For some women attraction grows once they get to know a guy better and his personality.  If youre one of those types then this latest guy might work.  But relationships lacking that spark or that strong attraction right out of the gate usually dont have staying power.You cannot force a guy to have all of the qualities you want.  He can still be someone you chat with or confide in and not be your boyfriend.  He might not be interested in that but becoming a friend is not the same thing as someone being friendzoned.  You dont have to fall in love with or sleep with every guy you meet.  You connected with a person that sounds like an excellent baseline for a friendship.Based on how you describe things I would keep looking as far as boyfriends go.  Its not fair to this guy that hes trying to catch up to his looks with his personality to be good enough for you.  Dont settle just because youre tired of the casual dating scene.

9149157,0,t3_55ljbm,gtWhat would any of you girls on here do in this situation?Putting on my female friend hat for a second personally my relationships with my friends are not based on my friends sexuality.  To me you would be the same after confessing as you were before and nothing would change.  If youve never shown attraction to me before Im not gonna suddenly expect our dynamic to change just because you felt attraction to some other person.  Youre still just you.That said I dont personally believe in wholly straight or gay people.  I think that everyone has a bit of flexibility in them deep down if theyre really honest and presented with the right person.  To me sexuality is fluid and evolving and personal and really doesnt need a label if you dont want it. People with a more rigid idea of sexuality which is probably just as valid as my own idea might be a little uncomfortable but I think that getting it out in the open is the best way to avoid hurt feelings.  I can tell you that if I were in your shoes I would not want my good female friends to find out I wasnt really gay in a roundabout and negative way you know?  I would want to be the first to tell them that I had this new experience.Honestly I hope theyre good enough friends to be happy for you!  A new lover is exciting and it shouldnt really matter what their sex is and I hope your friends feel that way too.

9167717,0,t3_55vo2i,First of all I think its great you are seeking help realizing there is a problem and committing to change. That is a huge step that a lot of people never take. It takes strength and is something to feel good about. You are doing the right thing for yourself. Ultimately it is her choice what she can and cant accept. If this is all too hard for her to move past that is so hard and upsetting but its important she is able to realize that about herself and do what she needs to. Everyone has different limits and hers might have been met. You cant force her to stay which you know. What you can do is be honest about how you feel. Have a talk with her about what she needs to feel more secure and comfortable in this relationship. Get all the awkward questions insecurities etc out on the table and talk about them open and honestly. Tell her you want to work on the boundaries and ask her input for what is okay and not okay. Likely you will agree but talking about it and working on it together makes it more clear more real and more certain. Instead of just hoping the other person is on the same page you know. Let her know how much she means to you but also let her know at the end of all this youll respect whatever decision she makes. If she is willing to give it a longer chance work on building trust. Be open and honest dependable and predictable be there for her be accountable for your actions and check in on how things are going what you both need etc. Since you are putting work in she likely does see that. This is a good thing and something you should continue with no matter what happens. For some people the hurt is just too much. She might need a break from it space to think or she might know she cant get past this. If you really think she wants it to work and she is saying things like she is holding you back it is important to let her know these changes are ones you want to make that you want a relationship with her that it is worth the work for you and all that. She might need to hear it. Sometimes we think because we feel something it must be so clear to the other person. It might not be. Maybe gestures that show you care. A meaningful gift a date night really listening to her doing something she loves with her etc. Things to show you are really interested in being with her. If she does want to end things continue to work on making yourself better and healing from the situation. Hopefully it will work out for you both. ,relationship_advice,d8e2pxo,1,t5_2r0cn

Dont plan the conversation because it wont go the way you plan for. Find a common interest shouldnt be hard you go to school together then expand on it. After  minutes ask if she wants to do the common interest together sometime and get her number. Those are my basic tips they work pretty well for most people if you are confidentcan feign confidence.

Why he would suddenly block my number after telling me he was trying to figure out his life I have a tendency to repeat the same things over and over and asking him questions about his divorce was one of them so Im not crazy when he told me he was divorced.I wrote a post a few years ago about how hes the only person in the world I hate because of how badly what he did affected me and the only thing he had to say when a friend of his saw it and told him what he had to say to me was this You never wanted me anyway. I can have sex with whoever I want I had a rebuttal to everything you said but your not worth the time or effort Despite me not having sex with him I sent him pictures he asked for and stuff like that. Apparently though because I was squemish when he tried to have sex with me it meant I didnt want him and it justified him fucking his wife he told me he divorced while lying to me about it and treating me like shit.

9245402,0,t3_56wr1x,For what its worth I dont think this was the right decision. You still have feelings for him and he has them for you. But you BOTH need to stop acting like children.Should you have warned him about your family and their friends? Yes. Is it his fault for talking about politics? Yes and no. Your family and their friends started the conversation and if you wanted to avoid the confrontation you should have asked your familyfriends to not talk about politics as well. If your boyfriend was ever going to be a more permanent fixture in your life hed become a part of your family eventually so he should be just as permitted to talk about a topic of discussion at family events as they are. In what universe is he to blame for something your family did first? If anything you should be more upset at your family if you truly disagree with them. I mean it depends on where you draw the line but to me it doesnt matter what youre doing but if it makes someone else uncomfortable in a friendly environment all parties should stop. However if person A makes person B uncomfortable and its okay for person A to continue doing it anyways person B is just as allowed to. Not really fair to him imho.Now that may not have been the same situation but from what you described thats all I have to go off of and thats how it seemed. If you two loved each other you should be able to integrate with each others family. And if you cant get along with them then you have to choose whats more important. Ive had to finally excommunicate my mother and her side of the family for the terrible things they say way they act and things the do. But hes not entirely off the hook either. He shouldnt be issuing ultimatums the way he is and not expect people to not take the least desired option. Hes acting like a child that doesnt get to have his cake and eat it and youre acting like one who doesnt approve of the way the other kids are using the toys they shared with them.Best choice here is either stick to your guns or try and resolve the conflict with words reach a compromise.,relationship_advice,d8nx7cy,1,t5_2r0cn

However I also think that if so its ok for her to have friendships with other guys as long as you have boundaries in place on what you both feel is  is not acceptable. Again that just helps clarify shit and ALLOWS you to build trust in a relationship.  Basically how the hell do you know if youve crossed a line if you dont know where the line is?I wouldnt make it an emotionally charged convo and she shouldnt feel defensive.

9324517,0,t3_58660g,Its difficult because even though a relationship like this is a fantasy ultimately people really do invest a lot of energy into them especially at her age and given she sounds as if she is pretty anxious in general.  It certainly doesnt make this less abusive a scenario. Confronting people in this state is tricky because often the shame and confusion they feel means that instead of just letting go and accepting it is silly they instead get stubborn heavily invest emotionally and dig themselves deeper. Say you confront her and tell her that she needs to get real about the toll this is taking on her and that a love that is so straightforwardly toxic will have lifelong repercussions... the reality is that she is just as likely to cut ties with you and vilify you as anything. So I suppose this comes down to what you are willing to accept. Condone the misery and continue with the friendship or take the stand make it clear this cant continue and risk her hating you. I dont know which is the right choice Ive made both choices and they are both painful but that is the reality of people stuck in abusive relationships. ,relationship_advice,d8xy9b6,1,t5_2r0cn

9355694,0,t3_58nyz4,Heres my takeIts clear your wife and this guy are looking to do shady shit.  She had no intention of visiting her grandfather.  She was planning a trip to see this guy and stay with him.  When you called her out on it she agreed to let you go visit her grandfather knowing that it wasnt going to happen.  She did so in order to put you at ease.The fact that she took your children in the middle of the night and put them in the car with her while she was drunk is grounds for divorce.  Your wife is obviously looking to fuck around behind your back and is bold enough to message the guy she plans to cheat with right in front of you.You need to get out of this relationship and you need to do whatever you can to take those kids with you.You should head over to rlegaladvice to find out how to do this.If this isnt an option for you the two of you need counseling.  In addition to that your wife needs to delete her fucking Facebook account immediately.  Like today.

She doesnt get preachy about jews or anything like that. Anyways...I realized she gets this way because she doesnt know how to gauge herself and slow down drinking  when buzzed.

My response was in regards to that. gt I honestly think it is misplaced passion.As it almost always is with extremists. gt I dont want to make it seem like she is stupid or naive but I think her passion has clouded her judgement significantly and she is blindly angry about subjects that if you look at objectively just make no sense.This statement is very contradictory. It seems like you arent clear on what the word naive means. Blindly angry about subjects.... that make no sense is a pretty clear example of exactly that. It is also one of the more common reasons I mentioned in my original comment. gt  If this is a phase she is going through then I am willing to ride it out but I really dont want to lose her to this.Thats why you need to have that talk with her now. Getting wrapped up in these ideologies is a spiral that gets worse the longer it goes unchecked. gt I think the best option is a focus on building our relationship and emotional connection to one another and gently challenging her ideas when they arise if they are stupid and maybe get her thinking deeply about it like you said.

Honestly being aware of it and making active efforts to overcome it is usually enough with younger people. They eventually grow out of it. If it is serious and causing you relationship issues then it is likely something that needs a lot more attention. I think the easiest way to look at it is to understand that she chose you and her past doesnt matter.

I would suggest couples counselling where you two can find a solution maybe that entails the therapist saying youre making improvements and its not helpful for wife to put on added stress or maybe therapist says you need to do more visibly so your wife will trust you to continue to make improvements.At the very least sit down and talk calmly about what specific things she expects of you and try to ask and understand why she feels so strongly about it.

9419854,0,t3_59n6gt,You put a lot of thought into your post and I will do the same with my response.  Forgive the length I tend to respond in longform to be clear and detailed.You both have some issues and blaming yourself isnt the same as acknowledging and personally owning your responsibility.  I was depressed most of my life and it made my exgf feel undervalued and incompatible with me.  From the little youve described about you and your girlfriend the roles are similar.  I was negative cynical and insecure and that was only the tip of the iceberg.As it pertains to you though via projection of my previous selfstate you must address your selfworth and ability to selflove.  If you are truly as logical as you sound it stands to reason that people make decisions.  They are generally out of selfinterest and that selfinterest is benign to you in many ways.  That is to say it is not intended maliciously.  It is also true that her choices made in selfinterest hurt you that is not untrue because youve taken the personal intention toward you out of her actions.  What then is the common thread between her actions and your inability to trust her to feel secure in a relationship where you know you love one another?  As I mentioned it is your selfworth and ability to selflove.Truthfully everything in a healthy relationship matters.  It is a lifestyle of relationship wellness that is just slightly different than you are currently thinking about it.  Sure you dont have to have everything in common and those things you dont are relatively unimportant compared to the things you do.  I suspect this is what you think you mean when you say the stuff that MATTERS.  But given our similarities I caution you that your negativity is wearing fast on her.  You must grasp the truths with both hands and do not allow yourself to move backward.What that meant to me in practice was culturing a mindset around positivity.  Coming from a negative place and moving to a positive place meant I had to remind myself as many moments a day as necessary of very simple ideas and I had to challenge and question my normal mode of thinking.  Your framework of thoughts determines your ability to internalize vague emotional concepts like belief.  Belief in yourself belief that things and people are worth it belief that you have the capacity to be positive and love yourself in turn loving her more completely.  I often have to come to grips i.e. accept and release expectations of what I think I know for what is actually there right in front of me.  When my mind worries I distract it by being present and while you think meditation is bollocks for me its doing exactly what Im telling you to do.  You must actively think positively and be determined in your effort to internalize it.  If you hold no other belief while you try to nurture this framework of thinking believe that you have a choice even if that choice seems impossibly difficult.  Mindfulness is the practice I spoke of for being present.  You close your eyes for a minute or five minutes or even ten to twenty and you breathe slowly.  You focus on your awareness of your body and breath and by doing so you are able to increase your mental acuity to the specific kinds of thoughts that you tend to have automatically.  Thats when you openly say to yourself something like maybe thats not true.  Its definitely not true for some people or for the person I love the most why does it have to be true for me?  It doesnt.  I have a choice.  I can love myself.Soon I can love myself becomes through your intentional changing of your language to say I love myself.  I am secure and confident.  I am happy.  I love my girlfriend enough that I know I should be important to myself.  I accept past and present circumstances exactly as they are and I will work to make it better because I have a choice.I am not exaggerating when I say this is literally the most effective and best advice I can give you.  It is up to you to change your negative nature despite any justifications as to why you are that way.  Otherwise you will push her away.  You will likely be alone.  You will always place your value in the hands of the people you care about which is just too big a burden to bear.  You will be unable to fully enjoy things because theres always that little voice that says you cant love her or yourself for one reason or another.,relationship_advice,d9a15ax,1,t5_2r0cn

9446560,0,t3_5a2hnb,There are so many red flags in this post that Im over here like woah. Like when I got to end and hes talking about going to an ex coworkers party. I mean why wouldnt you guys go to the party together? Wouldnt she be like Hey you and your girlfriend come to my party! not just invite him. I dont think his behavior is appropriate and honestly you need to figure out for yourself how much bullshit you want to deal with because from what your saying it seems like years of a constant headache and being on edge because hes not being honest with you and being secretive about these all these other females that he keeps chatting with and whatnot. Stop making excuses for him and trying to make it like youre being irrational. Confront the issue and be straight up with him about how you feel and why this is not ok. All in all though however it turns out its your choice whether you want to keep dealing with all this bs or not. I wouldnt.

He might lean on you or put his head on your lap  diffrent strokes for diffrent folks. If you get uncomfortable dont think its awkward to say you are uncomfortable. Hell want you to be comfy as well so Im sure a change of hand position or something will be met with understanding. Youll find a position together that will be good for the both of you.Etiquette? If something doesnt feel right tell him. Felt weird kissing during a zombie mauling scene? Tell him.

You can tell him you are from a conservative background and Im sure hell understand. If he doesnt understand no or Im not comfortable then get out of there.Oh and sexual moves?

9551099,0,t3_5bnpuu,And then I cant help but wonder why a  year old man would want to be with a  year old. Typically its never a good reason. Maybe he just had me fooled.I can answer this because im a  year old male that dates younger women. Its gonna get a ton of hate.Women in their s are fun. They are generally excited about life and the future. They love to get advice from me and it is the best thing in the world to see someones life improved because they listened to your advice. They arent baby and marriage crazy yet. They rarely nag. They like to do fun exciting and adventurous new things. Nothing ever seems too serious to them because they still have time to rectify mistakes in life or to generally steer their ship in any direction they see fit. Its fun to joke about the age gap but at the end of the day both people are learning new things.The list goes on.Now everyone says that there must be something wrong with the guy because he is dating a younger woman. Hes controlling manipulative mentally ill unstable emotionally unstable. And a  year old woman trying to get married and have kids within  years isnt? I personally do not give a shit about what anyone thinks or says but it is funny to see that the hate  is borne out of jealousy. Its amusing to see the venom and hate.The thing is shes happy im happy.Women in their s and s are generally not fun. Are no longer excited about what the future holds for them. They are in a rush to catch up and keep up with the Joneses.Within three to six months of dating a woman in her s and s she starts on the we should move in together. So you do. It goes well for about a month before the we should buy a house together. Then the we should get married starts and is quickly followed by the talk of children.It sucks the life out of you. It never follows the natural timeline that it should.Constant power struggles lecturing expectations shifted responsibilities shifted blame and if you dare to offer advice expect to get crapped on and have a massive argument etc etc.For me with younger women its exciting fun adventurous and mostly pressure and obligation free. Just two people who enjoy each other choosing to spend time together. Simple and pure!And it feels far more equal in terms of power.  with younger women as opposed to  in her favor if she is in her s or s.As opposed to two people in a constant struggle because one wants or needs something from the other. And if it doesnt happen within  months its over. Which one would you choose? Remember guys are logical and rational and far less emotional. These are just a few of my reasons for dating younger women. ,relationship_advice,d9qdbza,2,t5_2r0cn
9552215,0,t3_5bqhyz,Here are a couple thoughts that may help. Guys base attraction more on physical looks so that you arent as ambitious as he is and you live with your sister probably arent even negatives in his book. In fact since he seems very ambitious he may like that you are shyer and less competitive. A recent study showed that while women typically get into relationships with men higher in career status than they are men will get into relationships with women of any career status if they are attracted to them. A lot of guys and people in general take shyness and awkwardness as signs of lack of interest. He may assume that because you clam up and are quiet around him you arent interested.

You cant help if other people try and push an agenda you are the polite type so you just sidestep it and your bf has to acknowledge that is the reality of the situation. If he has it in his head that you were actively flirting he is both naive and thinks very little of you both are problematic. Once you move past the fact it wasnt a flirting scenario you can start to approach the idea with him that for him to trust people again he has to stop agonising and snooping and get upset and instead calm down and think logically. He has a long life of jealousy and resentment ahead of him like this and part of that will be him pushing you away which has already started.If he refuses to even acknowledge what you are saying then you have reached an impasse you have to be very realistic about. ,relationship_advice,d9v3ubz,1,t5_2r0cn

Simple things like hand holding and simple kisses or intimate jokes are not rude. And maybe I feel this way because of living in North America where PDA is common.

She goes into bad relationships because she feels bad about herself those relationships make her feel bad so she gets into other bad relationships its a feedback loop. But the reality is that by constantly being there for her you are unfortunately counterproductively reinforcing that loop. She knows that if and when she messes up you will pick up her pieces she gets sympathy from people she might even be using those times as pure catharsis. Enabling that is not only bad for her though it is also tiring for you and as youll note every loop dulls your sympathy until one day you will burn out entirely and either ghost her as well or shout at her thus starting the cycle anew. A victim complex like that needs therapy she needs to work out why her self worth is so non existent she needs to escape the loop. From your point of view all you can do is put your foot down. Advise her taht as a friend patting her hand is no longer something you can do you are happy to support her in therapy or whatever she needs but unless she opts to change this will never change.

9709814,0,t3_5e62wt,The fact that you have written this post leads me to believe youre still on the fence about divorce and want to try and forgive her even if you dont see a clear path for doing so.First know that you dont have to forgive her or divorce her today.  You already have couples counseling scheduled and this is going to be a long process regardless of which way you go.  But dont think that youre on the spot and have to make a decision to forgive her today.  You do not.  You can try and if the process is not working then you can tell her at some later point that your trust was irrevocably broken and you will be filing for divorce.The next step would be to decide what hoops you would want her to jump through to begin to reearn your trust.  In your post you state that you suspect more has gone on than you know about.  So one of the hoops is probably full and complete social media transparency.  Of course she could have secret accounts but you have to choose to trust something to begin this process of trying.You should visit www.survivinginfidelity.com to read more directed posts about overcoming what youre going through.  Shes likely still in the fog but even if she is not she will have to identify for you what problems exist in her mind relating to your marriage.  Do note that none of those problems justifies her cheating.gtShe still doesnt feel that sexting is cheating but I completely disagree.She will be alone in that assessment and the counselor will likely tell her so at the risk of her feeling ganged up on.  Shes crazy if she doesnt think its cheating.  This alone might be enough to throw in the towel because at the end of the day if she doesnt show complete remorse and appreciation for how deep she has hurt you then youre likely swimming upstream on trying to fix your marriage.,relationship_advice,da9xyyd,5,t5_2r0cn

Same scenario with light course load and minimal work hours I was paying the majority of his bills for awhile and he helped out with housework but showed little motivation to better himself or make good use of his free time. He pulled himself out of the slump recently and landed his first big job today. How did we make this happen?Well i wont lie I got on his ass. I nagged him a lot. I gave him tough love. People will say it doesnt work but it has for us. I always made sure to include that my nagging was because I cared about him and our future. Be her motivational coach.

If he decides to be with you then stay trustworthy with him and never lie but he has to forgive you honestly. Do not try to justify your lie because he has to accept it as a fact. Do not run after him after telling him that you are sorry but give him surety that you changed a lot after realizing your mistake. If he decides not to choose you then you have to move on learning from the experience to be better person for the future.

They can recognise that mummy and daddy hate each other and may even realise they are only together because they are parents.

9720914,0,t3_5eaj6r,Im sorry but he is trying to have sex with you. I mean hes a  year old teacher youre a  year old student...hes not talking to you because you have so much in common or because you can offer advice and support based on your experience. He is using his time with you to get you to see him not as a teacher but a person you like...he knows more about talking to women than boys your own age so knows how to avoid seeming creepy or focusing on sex but he also knows how to seduce young girls with less experience.Hes not a nice guy. He knows how to pretend to be one to get what he wants. Because what he would like to do will end his marriage career and possibly lead to jail time. He needs to make sure you think he is the nicest guy in the world so that if he does do anything even forces something upon you you will feel like you dont want to ruin his life or worse will blame yourself for giving him the wrong idea so he gets to continue his career and abusing students. You need to report him. Not to punish him but to protect yourself and other students. I have no doubt he has or will try with other students. The creepy teacher at my high school had six years of trying to sleep with his students until one of them said yes in his mind it was okay he waited until her graduation day when she was  to the school it still mattered. He will go after someone else if you are too hard to manipulate maybe someone younger who isnt as assertive.And then theres the risk to yourself. Because many guys have difficulty handling rejection. And while mature guys can handle themselves mature guys do not try and date children half their age. What are you going to do if suddenly he starts marking you down ridiculing you in classmbecause you rejected him?

Otherwise if you two need to establish what you guys both want. Wanting things for now is totally fine as long as thats what you both want. If one of you wants something more long term though...then its not gonna work out.As for me Ive broken up with gals because I couldnt see it working out long term.

9772144,0,t3_5f50s2,Here is the secretyour gf may be withdrawing from sex because she doesnt want to sleep with a man who wont marry her. To a woman you not wanting to marry her is rejection and she doesnt want to continue to sleep with a dude that wont marry her. I dont think you should marry someone with whom you have doubts. That is never a recipe for a strong marriage. Are there any other relationship issues? Any fighting? Any jealousy? Do you even talk? People settle into relationships and get comfortable and when things are showing signs of wearing thin people want to keep the comfort even at greater long term cost. I think there is some greater problem in her mind if she doesnt even show affection in any way to you. DO NOT MARRY HER! I think she could be holding out because woman sometimes harbor resentment that way. Being tired can account for a drop in sex but not the LACK of sex. And it certainly cannot account for no physical affection at all. I think ending this relationship should be considered but first you both have to really talk this thing through. If she is not forthcoming then you have to decide to change something. Temptations will only grow for you the longer this goes on and you become disaffected.,relationship_advice,dahmsw7,1,t5_2r0cn

Its inappropriate and it hurts your feelings. If she does  you will be forced to take yourself out of the picture. Do that and be firm on your promise. Secondly  once thats out of the way  get into couples therapy immediately. You both have conditions that seem to hamper lines of communication  connection. You guys seem to be going with the flow and that flow may very well pull you apart.

9785828,0,t3_5fd7ek,Considering you are emotionally cheating on him maybe the insecurity causing him to be controlling is very justified. Not that being controlling is the right way to deal with that but it does say a lot about your major role in that. Regardless of what youve done to his esteem or insecurity your option in these situations is to cut all contact with the other guy and focus on your relationship. Whether that means fixing it or breaking up. You need to deal with that before even considering anyone else.

I wont tell you not to do that but Ill only say that theres no good outcome to you asking that flat out. If she accepts obviously the vibe would be more than just friendly. And she accepted to hang with an old fling that she just closely befriended while in a fresh relationship with her boyfriend. Thats weird and a bit inappropriate. If she declines shell understand what your intentions are and youve now made things awkward since she has a boyfriend. Or shes just not interested in that way.I would instead either . leave it alone and wait until shes single. . stop talking to her as much as you are now hit her with the well whenever you make it back in town Id be down to get some coffee to catch up! and if shes interested in you on her own accord then shell hit you up herself. ,relationship_advice,dakm2fo,3,t5_2r0cn

9800465,1,t3_5fjjqq,At the expectation of being thoroughly razed for this I want to offer you only the perspective of a man who is currently having an affair on somebody he loves.This man has questioned many times why hes doing it.  How it even started or got to this point.  This man loves both his wife and the other woman.  Its fucked up and he knows it.  Its unfair and he knows it.  He truly didnt intend for it to happen but since it did hes thought so many long hours about how and why.His wife is a good woman.  Kind to her core.  Would never do this to him never.  She has given him  wonderful kids and is generally a good mother to them.  She does things for him works her ass off and makes his life easier.  And better.  Over the course of  years she has inspired him to be a better man and yet here he is carrying on an affair with no intent of ending it anytime soon.Why?He has come to the conclusion that something is missing.  Has been for awhile.  Hes looked past his own fundamental needs and some  incompatibility with his wife because she is such a wonderful person.  To put it succinctly his emotional and mental needs are not being met.  There are no deep talks about thoughts and feelings.  His wife is a poor communicator and internalizes everything.  There is an intellectual gap.  He never recognized this incompatibility and thats not his wifes fault but there it is nonetheless.  Hes communicated that this door was open felt hopeless at times that nothing seemed to change and carried on for a long time feeling that way just trying to be the best husband and father he could be.Then somebody surprisingly found that open door and walked through it.  She offered him the exact platter of things that he needed.  It was irresistible to him as he had felt starved for so long.  And their relationship grew and turned into more.  The guilt was a plague but the happiness he felt from having his pitcher refilled was able to subside it.  She gave him something that his wife could not.  She was the best worst option to staying married to his wife as strange as that might sound.He fully expects that his wife would leave him if she found out and he wouldnt blame her a bit.  If she wanted him to stop the affair stay and work it out he would.  He doesnt think that hed have another affair but he also doesnt know for sure that his wife could give him the things that he needs and close that door.Plenty if not most people in this sub will vilify him for what hes doing.  Rightfully so I suppose in most regards anyway.  Ill invite the ones who read this and incensed by it to keep their hateful comments to themselves.  I dont know what you should do OP.   I only wanted to offer a differing view of it for you.  Im sorry youre going through this.  I know its unfair.  I guess my only advice to you based on what I wrote above is to consider how broken the trust is at this point.  If its shattered I dont think staying together will ever make you happy again.  If its only fractured well time and counseling and complete transparency may be able to rebuild that trust.,relationship_advice,dal4a23,-2,t5_2r0cn
9800824,0,t3_5fkx41,I think its better to just hold onto the thought and make this a surprise gesture after your first meeting. The main thing is you havent met in person yet and I think this is the kind of thing thats more meaningful AFTER youve gotten to know each other better even though youve talked to her before over skypephone. OR if your visit to the US is limited you can send them right at the END of the stay. Ask the florist to include a card and write a short note how youre on the way to the airport but just remembered about it and wanted to send it to her. The impact and romance level of it will be much bigger. Basically I believe will be better timing. Because if you send it then itll be as though meeting in person basically reinforced and confirmed your attraction to one another and the flowers will be like the seal on that. ,relationship_advice,dal5v9r,2,t5_2r0cn

The responsible thing to do is to politely tell her that you cant set aside your feelings and because of that and out of respect for her and yourself you can no longer maintain the friendship.You will find other friends ones that youre not attracted to.

Part of the responsibility is yours for getting into this situation and apparently hoping it would work itself out but youre not the one who made someone else your priority while continuing to hook up with a FWB.  Youre not the one who exploded at your friend then turned around and suggested getting a few more bones in then tried to manipulate said friend into pitying him and feeling guilty over something that was largely his fault.If you want to keep tabs on the girlfriend so you can try to salvage a potential friendship and commiserate when he eventually fucks her over too thats your call.

9824225,0,t1_dang4s7,Hey thereFirstly I just want to thank you for this response.  Its thought provoking direct and has a substantial amount of information for me to think about.  I also appreciate the direction your advice is coming from with the limited amount of information you have on the scenario  which admittedly is all I gave so I couldnt ask for more.  So  firstly I appreciate it!I want to address the response section by section just how my brain works.I want to address the first two I will absolutely believe someone but for that to happen the stance and advice needs to be accurate to the situation.  I acknowledge the information I provided is limited so that isnt anyones fault but my own.  However I havent yet received a response that is accurate.  I also do have the ability to see similarities  absolutely.  Im not ignorant and I dont want this relationship to work so badly I wont see the reality of my situation.  Ive had enough hardship in my life to avoid such a thing.  But a similarity which in this case is only timeframe isnt mutually exclusive to the same thing.The comment around my impulse control is something that really cannot be ascertained without asking for further information which has not yet been done.  Im happy to expand upon this if you wish.I absolutely got married to young and had children to youg.  Not arguing that!  Fucking dumb decision that has negatively affected my life in every possible way.  You got that bang on.  Not going to argue that  hands up and white flag! I was an idiot.I also think either I misrepresented the situation or you misinterpreted the situation  I never thought MY feelings would overcome her past desires to never have children of her own.  She is more than happy to be involved in childrens lives  but she does not want to bear children or have children of her own.  There is a difference there I probably didnt highlight properly.  Additionally I was more than happy for her to never meet my children and that step wasnt initiated by myself.I agree that after a marriage ends time to heal reflect etc is absolutely necessary  however there isnt a defined timeframe I only mention timeframe as this is the focal point of your advice for this to happen.  I can honestly say I have done this and that includes electively going to a counsellor several times and once strictly about this person I was seeing too see if it was stupid to sort out my emotions and organize my thoughts and reflect on my past.  Youve assumed that I dont realise that I needed that  but I have.  I cant help but to think youve assumed a lot of other things that would make you draw your conclusions.  I admit again that I only provided a certain amount of information however  so you can only do so much.  But a question goes a long way.And youre right.   years ago I probably would say that.   years later I would be and have given the advice that its a dumb decision.  Im more than open to reflect on my decisions and make corrective action to not repeat the past.  Expecting the same outcome is madness.  Live and learn.Again Ive already addressed the last section with my prior one.  But I think you have incorrectly classified who I am and what steps I have taken in my personal emotional life.  I admit this is my fault given the information I provided.I also want to end on this  with everything I said Youre probably right.  The statistics are against me and everything it what it is.  Im not foolish enough to think I will beat the odds  because I WONT.  I wont beat the odds because they exist.  And I am no one special.  As Ive mentioned this relationship is a day by day thing  if it ended tomorrow both parties would be perfectly fine with it.  I dont know if you know much about software development but we use the agile approach on our relationship consistent evaluation communication implementation and correction.  What works what doesnt what can we change  and should we drop this before it gets to hard?So far  we havent.  But we are prepared to.Again  thank you so much for your feedback your thoughts. I know they come from a positive place. Thank you.edit a word,relationship_advice,dao480a,1,t5_2r0cn

9859489,0,t3_5ghbrv,Ok I think I can relate. When I was dating the man who would become my first husband I knew I really didnt want his immediate family in our lives. Luckily they all moved across the country before we married. His father was a drunk  brothers had been in prison for stupid stuff and I feel his mother also allowed all of this. I blamed her for the destruction of that family. I didnt hate his mother but was happy I didnt have to deal with any of it. We did have one child and was so happy she didnt have to see any of it.

He cant stop you from seeing them but I think you should really try to keep you relationship with your family and your husband separate. Try not to talk about them to him and meet them other places then your home. He shouldnt have to deal with these people he married you.,relationship_advice,daspqaa,1,t5_2r0cn
9859520,0,t3_5gi19c,Were all human. We all make mistakes. Whether they had sex and shes afraid to admit it whether she started the kiss or whether he started it and she just didnt stop it  all irrelevant. What it boils down to is trust.If you want to stay in a committed relationship with her you have to trust her that it wont happen again. If youre willing to trust her then forgive and forget and move on. One mistake is not a breach of trust its a mistake. If the mistake happens again and again... thats a breach of trust. You know the old fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me.My advice? Forgive and forget. Trust that she wants to stay in a committed relationship with you which means no physical pleasures with other men. Trust that she will do what she needs to do in order to make that happen. And youre allowed to forgive her more than once! But if it becomes a habit or a pattern SHE needs to make a choice  seek professional help to help her stop or say goodbye.,relationship_advice,daspvin,1,t5_2r0cn

You can read all the self help books thatre out there craft your language and tone down even further but untilunless he recognizes on his own that he has issues I dont think itll help.

You and your fiance are going to be dealing with this woman for a long time because you all share children. Your kids need to see their siblingswhether the siblings are full or half it is family. Even the kids not related to your kids are family similar to cousins. These kids will grow up together. They will see the parents being horrible or nice to each other.

10048983,0,t3_5jkvgi,Okay when you choose to marry someone you make the promise to never ever be unfaithful or seek sexual contact with anyone else. You make that promise and you are certain of it.But your sexual drive never agrees to that. It will still be firing off whenever it can to whomever it can. And feeling guilty just makes those thoughts stronger.So....first off do not blame yourself. You arent a cheater and you arent going to cheat if you protect yourself. Youre a guy who notices an attractive woman as attractive join the club! Next you make sure nothing will ever happen. If you are worried about saying or doing the wrong thing around her do not be around her in situations where you say or do the wrong thing. Youre worried about cheating but be honest youre not going to have sex with your wife around nk matter how turned on you are. Avoid being with her one on one and definitely avoid drinking with her. And sadly that means thirdly put off hopes of having a close relationship for a while at least. The last thing you want to do is get close to her. You dont have to be rude but treat her like you would anyone else no worse and more importantly nk better. Its not the relationship you want with her right now but its the relationship you can have which wont mess up anything.Next up...look into your relationship with your wife. Is there something not  about it? Something the can be improved? There may not be but in many cases thoughts of infidelity come from missing out on something in your married life and instinctively seeking it elsewhere. It may not even be sexy it could be just missing having someone interested in you or having someone to care about you. Either way devote time with your wife. Lastly vocaluse to yourself about what not to do. If nothing else is working or you need more help when these thoughts come up if possible tell yourself clearly why it wont ever happen. Dont leave it to just be I will not cheat on my wife there are plenty more reasons than that. Recognise her faults recognise how it would ruin not just your marriage but her family and also point out that even fi you were single nothing would probably happen between you ,relationship_advice,dbhep8n,4,t5_2r0cn

10055662,0,t3_5jpupx,Ahh the  year itch mixed with a relationship that started when you were kids. You want to fix it? Really? Ask yourself that first. Make sure you really want this in your life and that you think it really will work. Dont bullshit yourself with lameass true love talk. Look at her personality her wants your wants both of your goals etc... Then if you really want to make a plan. You tell her yes you do want to work on it and that requires commitment fully from both of you going forward.  That means communication where you both need to feel free to talk.b that means you relearn how to talk argue compromise. You have rules on this stuff where you both listen actively where you never argue after a drink where you agree on goals.  Counseling will help with this and a lot more. Dont just say you want to do it find a counselor and her rates and suggest a week to start going. Talk about where you want to be a year from now. Engaged? Living together? Where?

10265369,0,t1_dc7m41y,Much clearer thanks.You may want to do a second post in rlegaladvice for clarified information but look into squatter and tenant laws in your area. Find out if hes considered your tenant if he has rights to the property etc. Once thats worked out legally evict him. Dont give him the opportunity to put off his departure with no recourse for yourself. Hell have a set date he needs to be out and thats that. You might also need to consult with your own landlord in this process. They might also be a help with whether or not youd legally owe him that rent money hes demanding.Past that dont keep having discussions with him. Remove his items from your bedroom and put a lock on the door. Avoid any conversations that delve into whether or not your relationship is over because it is or anything that isnt benign and relevant to your living in the same area. Its not going to be easy but you just have to be stone cold with him until he knocks it off. Youre not together anymore.

But it does not sound like she wanted a long distance relationship and shes taking out her loneliness on your hobby.I have to agree that she doesnt want LDR and she might be taking it out on my hobby but this seems to be a bit more personal you know? She always had tantrums before about gaming but it was never to the extent where shed start insulting me and saying Im wasting my timemoney and life.gtYou need to have a heart to heart with her and reconcile whether she really wants to continue this relationship long distance or if its better for both of you to move on from each other.I thought ahead and actually sent her quite a long email regarding my feelings and stuff since I know shes a slow in terms of reactingthinking about things and I hope email format will help her put her thoughts together. I also did pose that question to her which I will directly quote from my email. I said gtgtI dont think a relationship will be healthy if partners dont see eye to eye when it comes to these things. No matter how much I love you and no matter how much I want to spend my entire life with you I cant do it with you wanting to take away gaming from me. I would never ask you to change such a significant part of your life. I would never once ask you to stop listening to kpop or watching kdrama because I nor anyone else will never have the right to take away something that you love doing. Relationships that have the goals of marriage will take hard work and cooperation but one thing it never needs is changing the core of a person into something you want. So ask yourself what it is you want to do because Ive come to my conclusion. gtgtMy conclusion is thisI dont want to spend my life without joy and without doing something I love. I want to be with someone who understands who I am as a person and understands what it is I enjoy doing. I want to be with someone who has her own hobbies and quirks that I will come to understand and enjoy. You currently do not understand my gaming and Im begging you to understand this part of me because gaming has always been there for me through rough times. I have come to love and enjoy gaming as more than just anti depressant. I hope you have the right answer within you to find your own happiness whether it be staying with me and learning to understand my gaming OR ending things between us because you are unable to understand my gaming. I truly love you and will continue doing so no matter what choice you make but  in my life what comes first isnt anyone elses opinion or joy but rather my own. I need to make myself happy and I want to be happy with myself before trying to please others. If staying with you means I have to force myself to no longer play video games then that contradicts my mandate with life. ,relationship_advice,dc8vg17,1,t5_2r0cn

But sex is actually a need and you cannot go through life denying yourself sex because your SO has issues.Have you gone to thearpy with this girl? I think it would really be benefical for you to go with her because OCD can be a huge burden not just on the person that suffers from it but all those that are effected by the rituals and obsessions. Some therapists use behavior modification techniques that introduce the feared idea or stimuli to the person in a very controlled way as a means of showing that the fears are irrational and not founded and that the worst actually isnt happening as a result. It sounds like maybe your realtionship could benefit from this. It is wonderful to have a supportive partner with something like this but the point is partnership. She has to care enough about you to be willing to make changes for your comfort. It would be different if she was struggling and you had been selfish the whole time and harsh with her but you have also been suffering for  months over this and if there can be positive change you both need to find it.,relationship_advice,dc9jpd1,2,t5_2r0cn

10296204,0,t1_dcb3t2w,Because we connected with each other in a way I never did with anyone!In fact I broke up with my ex gf  months before I met this person and I had what you said I could eat with her hold hands and cuddle whenever I wanted and that relationship was nothing compared with this one. That relationship lasted  yrs and there was no intimacy nothing and we had each other when we wanted. With this one Ive never experienced anything like this the level of intimacy trust conversation.. Is nowhere near my previous real relationships. Yeah things are hard but  they are not exponentially harder. Theyll only be like that if you sit on your ass and do nothing for the relationship theres Skype and other apps to talk and even have dates and share meals and the feeling you get when its the time to see them again is indescribable. You hold on to that and try to work hard for that and what isnt hard in life almost none of us can get what really want or dream.And the claims people make about being doomed its no more or less doomed than any other relationship theres no more chance of cheating than other relationship everything comes down to who you really are and your principles and morals!And if you think that they can lie and everything well lies in relationships like this dont last long because you might forget what you said or do and youll be caught.The problem is mine for the most part Im pessimistic paranoid and overly attached sometimes and she has been the only person with patience enough to deal with me. I swear she doesnt gain anything from this and after a year shes still here. And thats because we really love each other believe it or not.Yes we are having a rough stage and we will have many more but hopefully in the end things will be ok.And if we end up together Ill fly you from wherever you are to show you that not all of them are doomed!Im might be young and naive but I never felt happier and my depression has never been better in my life.,relationship_advice,dcb4pno,1,t5_2r0cn

The profession of love in front of friends and family cannot alone bring that. I personally dont know what is causing you to feel how you do I am just offering a suggestion. I think you should have a serious talk with him about your feelings about marriage and about what both of you want. If he shuts down and wont talk you need to tell him how important it is that he does this for you. If he truly will not talk to you about this then I think you have your answer.

10382271,0,t3_5onwlk,How we behave in confrontation is quite deeply embedded in instinct  in the animal part of our brain that is hard wired when we are small to keep us alive. Chances are you learned very early on that responding to aggression with aggression was likely to escalate a situation and so you played it down  or else your family didnt do healthy conflict. What im saying is that it is very hard to change behaviour at that instinctive level because we are so hard wired at a fightorflight response level. Perhaps it would help in terms of communication with your girlfriend to step back after the confrontation and write down things youd like to have said your frustrations etc. And present them to her. Or you could give yourself challenges  I am going to stand up to one person this week I am going to verbally express two frustrations to my partner etc. Slowly testing the waters like this can help in terms of changing your ingrained behaviours as you will learn confrontation is not a lifeordeath thing which the irrational part of your animal brain thinks it is even if you logically know it isnt.

All the issues the physical and emotional abuse and the neglect are heaped on you so that everyone else can be comfortable. Its one of the reasons the clan system sucks so much  there are always totem poles and someone is going to be on the bottom.You father doesnt care about you. He might resent you for something imaginary for something he once did to you and feels guilt over for your mothers perceived transgressions for being visible at the moment his interest in his goals crashed. You know what? It doesnt matter why hes abusively neglectful with you he just is.So dont be that way with your kids. Dont be that way with any kids. However  feel free to be that way with dear old dad. Hes worked at putting you outside the family and he deserves his reward  to be no part of your life.Get counseling. Its great that youve noticed the disparity in treatment and are challenging the biggest lie of all that parents arent people. They are. They fail as hard as anyone are born or become lacking in empathy build up irrational rationalizations for being POSs. And then the bill for their behavior comes due.When youve moved out and are ready to have an adult relationship with your brothers make one of the boundaries that they cannot bring your dad into your life with them. No messages no flying monkey But the faamily needs to be together for Family Thing! Cool. But you are not going to play family with dad so they can with your blessings and youll do something with your chosen family.You get one of those.

10436743,0,t3_5pg4p5,So first of all studies have been done that show men overperceive sexual interest which has the effect of having men often believe that women are flirting when they are just being friendly. And women also underperceive interest causing them to believe their friendliness is being returned in kind even when it is something more to men. So when you tell her that shes being flirtatious it offends her because she isnt  at least not intentionally. She thinks shes being friendly and that the men shes talking to are being friendly back. Heres what that probably sounds like in her headgtI cant even be friendly without being accused of being flirtatious. What am I supposed to do? Sit in a corner quietly and not talk to anyone? These people are my friends and they respect me and know how much I care about my boyfriend! They know Im not flirting with them! Why is this coming up now? Why is my boyfriend trying to change who I am? It was good enough when we started dating but now he wants to control how I talk to my friends?She probably feels insulted that you doubt her and like youre questioning her integrity while simultaneously judging her personality and behavior. Her opinion has merit and you need to understand that. But so does yours and she needs to understand that. You can help by how you frame it. Right now youre focusing on her behavior not peoples interpretation of her behavior. Sending her the article I linked might help get this started.But let her know you trust her and you understand her motivation is not to flirt. Tell her you know that this didnt bother you in the past but youre more serious about your relationship than you used to be and it makes you feel protective in a way where just going home together isnt the end goal its also about supporting a strong relationship.Tell her it bothered you what your friends said not because you believe thats her intent but because you feel like it makes people question the commitment you have to each other. Reiterate that may be their problem but ask her to consider that concern and whether it doesnt bother her at all?Finally if you havent yet set your friends straight. A simple I cant believe you think shes flirting with you. She sees you as her buddy and you think because she makes eye contact and smiles at you that all of a sudden shes into you and secretly flirting? Good luck man. I guess Ill be the best man at your wedding soon right? Or something that conveys that you wont listen to them talk about her unless they can point to something more than their bias to think every nice woman is into them. So anyway this is really long but honestly try to see it from her point before you talk with her again. Can you imagine if just being nice and friendly the way you have been taught everything youve listed is on a list of active listening techniques was judged as flirting? Can you imagine if you were told that people you thought were trusted friends spend their time talking and thinking about whether they could fuck you? It sounds exhausting and like you cant do anything right. If youre friendly youre flirting. If youre not friendly youre a bitch. Both of you have merit in your arguments but if you want her to see your side make sure you also understand hers.  ,relationship_advice,dcr2q7r,51,t5_2r0cn

10472729,0,t1_dcuyrga,In a nutshell yes. However there were several factors that led to ending our engagementrelationship. I realized that after almost  years of being together we really hadnt been happy for at least  of those years we didnt want to have sex anymore he always had a lot of insecurity and trust issues that we argued about mostly he would bring up my past relationships before I even knew him he would always flake when it came to visiting my family even though I completely understood at times. My mother is an alcoholic I was the breadwinner in the household and also took on many of the chores. Our communication was in the tubes for years because I couldnt be myself in front of him and vice versa. I really didnt even know why he proposed to me after all of the problems we were having. I said yes and we were engaged for about  months before we realized that marriage is a promise thats meant to be forever. And neither of use ever wanted to chance getting divorced or hating each other. So we broke up. We got along better apart than we ever did together and some days I felt like we made a big mistake but we knew it was for the best.Thats my experience though. Youre going to have to really take a look at what you have in front of you. I always try to imagine myself as an old lady looking back at her life and ask myself what I wouldve wanted myself to do and if it was going to make me happy? Life is never too short to start over but also no relationship is perfect and as long as you and your partner are on the same team and make a true effort things can turn around. Definitely take others advice on here and talk to him now before it gets to be closer to a wedding date.Another thing In your s you may feel like you have to get married or that your time is running out to find a husband.

He is possessive and the thought of me being with a girl or having guy friends isnt on his agenda. Maybe thats why Im thinking more of it. But I guess I also just wanna be free from him and think of my own. I have talked with him before he promised he would change. He did for the first two weeks but hes back to his old self. Also.

10608171,0,t1_dda3q0l,Well my family doesnt care for her neither do my friends. She says she has a big personality which translates to a mix of charisma and moments of being a bitch. Ive been trying to give her the benefit of the doubt maybe she only sounds angry...and just expresses herself at a high volume...and isnt really just an angry person?  As for me Im quiet kind of a pushover and have never argued with anyone in my  years like I have with her. In fact Ive only ever argued with literally a few people ever.

10615560,0,t3_5rws09,You are in a fairly toxic relationship and should truly consider getting out of it. She justified cheating by saying that it doesnt count if its with another girl but you should be smart enough to realize that  is not true. She cheated. You no longer have trust in her which causes you to go through her phone and youre now extremely suspicious of her. Im confident in saying that she truly doesnt believe she did anything wrong which leads me to advise you to end it with her. Youre a young man she is most likely and even more so because of her actions not the person youre supposed to be with for the rest of your life. If you stay with her she will not only keep in contact with her friend but continue to act promiscuous whether its with her friend or someone else. She is not demonstrating a level of maturity to be in a serious relationship and judging by your little physical altercation you would benefit from some personal growth by being single. ,relationship_advice,ddawxvq,3,t5_2r0cn

It is good that he does all the sweet things with you in person so I do not think you have anything serious to be worried about. However you have to let him know how you feel when you are alone and what you think about the relationship so he can make you assure and can change his behavior over texting so depend on communication.

10646674,0,t3_5sbp3t,I think if you show up crying youll get a reaction based off guilt as opposed to how he honestly feels. I think you need to take some time to deal with it yourself and when you have calmed down and have thought about how he might feel how you would react to possible outcomes etc. then you can have a levelheaded open honest discussion.I wouldnt surprise him. Just shoot him a text. However consider what it is you really want from him. If youre honestly okay with being just friends proceed. And remember that your happiness doesnt depend on him. There will be other friends and romantic interests in your life and life will go on. Depression makes you feel like youre stuck in a moment and that however things are now is how theyll always be. And its just not true.Also youre not wrong for having the fantasy or wanting to feel loved. Just think about others feelings too.

10692504,0,t3_5sybx8,Be honest with him about what you want and need c but I do advise KEEP SOMEONE ELSE AROUND TO RELY ON EMOTIONALLY.!! If things go wrong with him youll need support somewhere. Recognize how often youll need him and in what ways and ask him if hes willing and can commit to that. There are different types of connections you have with people and they can vary depending on what side of you you share with them and how personal it is. You can google all the details on what romance is ! Id tell you but what Id want to say is better explained in google so Id advise looking there! For now Id deepen and develop your current bond to better understand each others wants and needs. No sex no kissing just get closer and see how much one can and is willing to commit to the others needs and wants and vice versa. If both of you can prove you can commit to the other in those ways without kisses or sex then Id start the relationship and wait until that stays stable a few months at least before sex c,relationship_advice,ddiuppz,1,t5_2r0cn

Like a class or something? Would this be something that Yu would enjoy? Sometimes doing something we wouldnt otherwise enjoy with people we like makes it more enjoyable. it sounds like youre happy as you are like your body as it is and have no major health problems so the only push for change is coming from your boyfriend. The direct approach is going to him and making it clear you are happy with your life as it is and aks exactly what the problem he sees is.

For example why go on the  day road trip with the door to door all based on commission job when he himself know its very hard to make a sale. This is also not the first time he does doorbto door and made absolutely nothing. I suggested him not to waste time and just do Uber since at least it guarantees something. He still want to risk the  days of making nothing. Especially you already planned to leave the job after that? Why? I think he wants to prove me wrong and hence this is probably last couple days he get irritated by me because he found out I was right not be excited about this job again. Right now i honestly just want to convince him not to go and just do Uber to generate some money. I think Uber can make decent money if he works full days and not couple hours. Lastnight he went to do Uber and stopped by a bar and had a beer? This is not the first time he had done something like that.

10767213,0,t3_5u11ji,Well to answer your last question. If youre seeing someone casually for sex but you just started talking to someone you like and you think both parties would like to explore things further its up to your discretion and how you deem it appropriate to disclose if youre fucking someone on the side at that moment. Or you can not disclose and just drop the FWB situation and work on the partner youre newly interested in. Or do both until the one you like wants to make things exclusive and then you drop the FWB. Depends on your partner and depends on how youve discussed boundaries. As for a general statement would I keep a partner around that Im not really interested that much. Yes. Unless I had someone else that I came to like then probably not. What if that partner im keeping around likes me to a good extent and has interest in taking things to a serious extentrelationshipexclusive would I still keep them around? Yes. For once again until something else comes around that Im interested in. Probably not the best move but Im only human.,relationship_advice,ddqk3vm,1,t5_2r0cn

10768351,0,t3_5u0sxn,Maybe because when a person lies repeatedly to you  you can no longer trust them. This is not your problem.. He makes you feel bad for snooping instead of owning up to his issues and doubles down on the lies. What kind of marriage is this going to be? You cant trust him at all and he has the audacity to make you feel bad for him lying straight to your face. And he keeps doing it because there are no consequences for his actions. When you catch a child lying you punish them but somehow this guy gets a free pass all the while making you the bad guy. Honestly I would dump him but if you want to save this then have a come to Jesus talk. He gets counseling for his lying and if he lies again you are done.

It sounds that the V day is the bigger for her and that is why she did complain but you are on the opposite side for that. Things would not get improved unless you both put the effort to make it work so communicate with her about your feelings to her and hear what she has to say as you both should meet the half way to make this relationship successful.

Another vital to any relationship is that the other person can be trusted to be mindful about your feelings and helpful to ensure that everyone is put at ease.

10797695,0,t1_ddtnna7,Checking his phone is abusive. Its an invasion of privacy and Im not at all saying thats ok. Ill agree with what  of your issue is with this situation. This totally should have been a conversation had at the beginning of the relationship not when its gotten to the point where OP is indulging in her insecurities and checking his phone because thats what she really is doing here. At this point she knows what she is going to find and looking for it seems like an excuse to start a fight. To be clear Im one of the few that are not ok with porn. Ive had problems with my previous partner using that and other women to replace me long story short  not trying to derail thread here with my experiences. I made that clear to my partner in the beginning of the relationship and he said he was fine with that as he didnt like porn. I would never get into a relationship with someone that made it clear they held an opposing viewpoint on porn because Im not going to control someones body autonomy and its a nocompromise issue for me. I respect the fact that other people view and enjoy porn and thats cool. I dont understand why OP is still with him when it seems like a deal breaker for her and a deal breaker for him which is what I assume as hes still using it. Not saying anything or being cool with it at first and then not cool with it later again assuming its not being used to replace intimacy in the relationship is definitely not ok and is in my opinion a sign of abusecontrolling behavior. ,relationship_advice,ddtpe65,1,t5_2r0cn

10851810,0,t3_5v54yy,gtThe deal is that Ive always been afraid of relationships it seems that no matter how hard you try no matter how much money or how handsome and buff you are no matter how much they adore you there is simply no way to keep women from falling in love and all too often subsequently cheating on you with someone else. Its like they only need to take their eye off of you for  seconds before getting completely charmed by someone else.I think you start by losing this attitude you have towards women. Yes some women do cheat  a lot of men do too. For the most part though no one goes looking for something they already have.If you cheat on your SO or she cheats on you its a pretty safe bet you can find something the other person was not providing  affection kindness security SOMETHING that they sought out with someone else.Case in point  me. Im a fat ugly troll and my wife is a knockout. Theres nothing special about me at all and in  years together weve never strayed. It isnt impossible.,relationship_advice,ddzacsf,2,t5_2r0cn

10864872,0,t3_5v8823,I personally dont believe that someone is unable to find a potential partner just because of the way they look. There is someone for everyone. Although looking and feeling good for yourself is important do not ever rely on your looks only to find a date. If you want a serious relationship just wait and have someone fall for your personality. Also I think your main issue is that youre trying too hard. Perhaps your fun texts may seem too forced and faked and that could be a major turn off. Talk to a girl the way you would talk to a friend that way she knows exactly what you are like and you guys have a string foundation. To be honest I dont think you should have an issue with that since you seem to be a nice guy though I dont know you at all lol Im basing this off your post. But yeah just chill and dont worry too much about your looks or your inability to find a potential date. The best things come unexpected. Good luck!! ,relationship_advice,de0murj,1,t5_2r0cn

I would say go with the flow of the time and see where it goes. What happens in the coming days and how you start feelings for him? If he is the perfect man for you then give it a try but at the end of the day if your feelings remain same for him then you should not make a relationship with him but right now you are in the trying phase so go for it. Keep communicating your feelings to him so he could know you well.

I spent the night and went home the next morning cause I had work.

You have to think of all possibilities and one of those is how much your comment might have greatly hurt him. Have you ever thought about how youd feel if he said that to you in the exact manner you did? Its bound to be painful to some degree for anyone. My SO sometimes uses humor to shade his hurt. So does my dad and brother. now im wondering if this is a common guy thing.....hmmmmNone the less you two need to discuss this if its hurting you that bad. Just mention his comment tell him how it made you feel and ask if he was using it to bandaid his own pain in the matter and maybe ask if he refrain from making jokes about serious topics you two have discussed. ,relationship_advice,de2voa5,4,t5_2r0cn

10890599,0,t3_5vjj3a,When talking about the human race in aggregate individuals and small selfconforming groups can most certainly be outliers but overall my description below holds you need to understand that men are genetically hardwired to be providers. To men our entire ego aside from reproduction revolves around the ability to be a dominant skilled and prolific provider. Part of this can manifest itself as being cheap although a clear separation must be made between being cheap and being frugal. A cheap person will always find the lowest price regardless of quality. A frugal person will always look for the greatest benefitcost payoff where an item costing twice as much but lasting ten times longer will be chosen over the cheaper. With that said a truly cheap person has very much of a penny wise and pound foolish form of shortterm thinking. This complicates things a lot as they are unable to see the longterm benefits of an item when compared against the immediate expenditures in the hereandnow.I strongly suspect that most forms of male cheapness in the way you described his behaviour comes down to seeing monetary wealth as provisions. Not the items being purchased but the money itself being what a man needs to collect hoard and provide. The more money that goes to things being purchased the less money that can be provided by the male and therefore the less of a man he is. In this case monetary earningssupplywealth does indeed directly correlate to the mans internal framework of masculinity and self worth. You ignore this information at your own risk. Aside from virility a mans ability to provide is the only other keystone that even comes close to dominating the male id Combine this need to provide with virility and you have in one package a reason for nearly everything a man says or does instinctively and without thinking planning or forethought.This throws a massive monkey wrench into any potential domestic bliss. If your husband really does conform to my definition of cheapness there will be a very significant possibility that he will be directly and deeply affected by your earnings. He will see himself however irrationally and uncontrollably as very much not enough of a man and may begin to act out in ways that he unconsciously feels will help him regain his masculinity including behaviours that are potentially destructive to the relationship. He will indeed feel very resentful from this emasculation and no amount of logic and reason will be able to reach where evolution dominates.I am warning you here and now that you may have to bring him to psychological counselling by a nonSJW expert on masculinity in order for this issue to be resolved. Most people men and women! have ZERO clue as to just how much our evolutionary history still affects us in this day and age which is a crapton  by some estimates up to  of our personality. The problem is these behaviours are utterly unconscious in nature and actually recognizing them for what they are much less actually dealing with them is like trying to rebuild an cars engine as the vehicle is driving at full speed down the Interstate  as in nearly impossible without outside help because you cannot be behind the wheel and bending over the engine at the same time. As such he will need professional guidance in a nonthreatening nonjudgemental nonSJWcancerous manner on how he can satisfy his instinctual provider urge without becoming threatened by your economic dominance.Good luck.,relationship_advice,de3adjv,1,t5_2r0cn

10951085,0,t3_5wcvik,Do you know why weight loss is such a sensitive topic?Because a bunch of people treat it like a religion and the remainder treat it like science.Theres a saying youll never reason someone out of something they werent reasoned into in the first place and that applies here. BTW what hes displaying is playfully termed fatlogic but really its dogmatic logic.Theres reasonable objective logic...and then theres dogma.If youve ever known someone whos say...religious and swears something totally absurd to be true how can you convince them otherwise? You cant. Because its not a belief based upon reason or objective fact.They will only hear facts that support their opinion on the matter. Cherrypicking. He wont listen to you because he would then have to admit hes wrong.And therein lies the relationship problem you have a serious serious dealbreaking communication issue. Weight loss? Who cares? This is about resolving conflicts. In a relationship there are two simple kinds of conflicts a difference of opinion and a misunderstanding of fact. With a difference of opinion you just have to compromise and take the other persons feelings into consideration.A difference of facts comes down to respect. If youre in a relationship with someone who Doesnt respect the truth Doesnt respect you when youre objectively rightYou are in deep deep doo doo. Because people like that end up being more trouble as time goes on. It goes from being playful or dumb to fullon control freaks and narcissism. People who cant give in to their partner when their partner is right are...not pleasant in a relationship. Let me ask you a question does he practise gaslighting? Like if youre about to prove him wrong does he take you down some twisted path to get you off of the subject? To confuse the issue? Change the subject? Make it all about you? Bring up semirelated facts that derail your point?Because those are classic narcissism signs. You cant be in a relationship with a narcissist as anything but an enabler. To me it sounds like he wants to worship his facts enable him and not prove him wrong damage his control and ego. Personally I think it could go either way. He could just be dumb snap out of it and go man I cant believe I fell for such dumb stuff. On the other hand this could be about control. The  lbs in a week is so absurd yet hes fully committed to it? That really bothers me a lot. Its beyond the pale. Abnormal. Too much.Just forget about the weight loss stuff. Science has already ruled on that issue and if science and religiondogma conflict what else is new? What you want to know is if he respects you. If you simply assert Im right will he say Well I love you respect you and trust you. You seem pretty convinced. Id like to let you hold the remote on this one.Or will he keep saying stupid shit diminishing you undermining you gaslighting you etc. Like you said he possesses a general ignorance.

We always come back to the same conclusion of that we dont want to jeopardize what we have just because of curiosity of what could be out there. I think if two people care alot about each other they can work through anything I know they can well at least we always do. You I think need to think long and hard about how much you care for your lady. Think of the good and think of the bad then see where you stand.

10985633,0,t3_5wvgqe,This dude totally overreacted but then you went total psycho on his ass as well. I did not sense any controlling behaviour on his part. He would just like to come to his own home after a long day at work and not have to deal with people. Thats totally fair.At the same time it is totally fair for you to have a friend over.But you kept calling him controlling and you werent sensitive to his emotions at all not one bit. He was obviously upset and all you cared about was yourself. Even when you dont understand your partner completely you still need to empathise with them.Reading through those texts made me feel really really uncomfortable. I cant pinpoint why. It seems like he was absolutely losing his mind over this. I dont get it. I suffer from social anxiety and I have an avoidant personality but if my bf had people over to our house Id simply go eat some McDonalds in my car or something until they left. Or you know walk into my own home say hi and retire to a bedroom. If he does have social anxiety it would be really great of you to encourage him to seek therapy to help him develop some better coping mechanisms. He needs to be put in his place to an extent. The home is both of yours not only his. But you need to explain to him that you werent sensitive to his feelings and that youll try harder in the future or something along those lines. Also judging by the texts it seems as if you were looking for a reason to call him controlling. Like you had already made up your mind and this was the perfect opportunity to project those thoughts. That often comes from resentment and lack of communication. If you have an issue in your daily lives together deal with it then and there.

Luckily he gave up halfway there.When Id moved he was still harassing me with daily texts and phone calls. It went on for months. So Im sorry I have no easy solution for you. For me it took steely hearted resolve and a distance of thousands of miles. I had to make myself completely insensitive to his feelings because it was my compassion that always did me in. But my sister was also in a similar situation and she was successful in breaking it off merely by moving out and ignoring his phone calls and avoiding places he might be and he eventually stopped trying to contact her. Distance makes it so much easier but really what you need is a very strong will. Dont back down even for a second. Be absolutely brutal.

11040308,0,t3_5xna9t,Hi OP I have advice for you but you wont like it.I have been very close friends with and dated people with BPD and I have noticed all of them share common traits that cannot be ignored. Obv. Not all people with BPD... but I am coming from my own experiences.They refuse to help themselves or address their problems they seek validation for not addressing those problems they only keep company of people who will enable unhealthy behaviours and refuse to accept any advice or help that means they have to make positive changes. The BPD people Ive held close have leeched off everyone around them abused everyones good will and created a comfortable bubble for themselves. The alarming thing I noticed was how they convinced everyone how helpless they were financially physically whatever when it turned out not to be the case this usually turned into everybody serving the persons needs without offering ANYTHING in return. They drain people emotionally blackmail people and turn them into slaves. They lure people in to serve their needs because they cannot will not look after themself. Once you compare where you are today with last year you will realise how much youve put in for so little return. I have a friend who lost  years of his life to a girl with untreated BPD.The biggest mistakes Ive ever made was letting anyone with BPD closer than an arms length away. Not all of them are malicious but they are totally self absorbed and never consider other people into the equation. They are at the center of the universe. If you try to explain empathy to them it will fall on deaf ears as they have no self awareness and usually try to deflect responsibility.Idgaf who I offend with this post. Ive been depressed and had my fair share of issues but i worked so very hard to heal and make progress without using people. Any sane person would tell you to avoid a sociopath for their lack of empathy and self serving nature so why cant we warn others about untreated BPD?Tldr you will work yourself to the bone for someone with BPD and it will never be enough for them. You can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink.,relationship_advice,dejee3x,1,t5_2r0cn
11042683,0,t3_5xonej,Ex aside how do you feel about him and how do you honestly feel he feels about you?Ive seen and experienced both sides of the coin. Ive remained friends with exes but as it turned out they were exes with whom the relationship was very short or not real I was with them but didnt love them and ended it upon that realization. Alternatively Ive had people in my life who held onto the past and remained just friends but then wound up getting back together when our relationship had ended. You have a right to your feelings but try to see where that insecurity is coming from. Do you think he ever loved her more than he loves you? Does she have something about her that you wish you had? How do you value yourself and how does that differ from how he values you? Try answering those questions for yourself.Alternatively if they are close and just friends it wouldnt be absurd to propose meeting her. If theyre good friends having her meet someone special in his life should be encouraged. But come at it from a genuine place too. Dont come to him and say I want to meet her to make sure theres nothing going on there but more of a shes important to you and sounds like a lot of fun Id like to be her friend too.

You had a big part of your world shut down. You have to take some time to cultivate your own happiness.Your identity at your age is very mailable so an event like this is either going to hinder you or strengthen you with the resiliency youth offers.My advice is take a step back and work on the things in your world that will help define you. If you dont this set back will hold you back for a while from pursuing happiness. Most people spend their whole lives chasing sources of happiness rather than building a life that makes them happy. You are at the starting line and had a relationship edited from your reality. Take that hit shake it off let it heal and get back in the ring.Also dont do LDR or date anyone younger than .

I tried to get her to go with me and start healthier habits but she wasnt having it. She started to get to the point where she never cared about personal hygiene too. She would wear the same leggings for a week straight never wash her hair or shave her legs and would smell awful. I lost all attraction to her. I never wanted to be intimate due to her lack of hygiene. I talked to her about it and she said something along the lines of me not loving her for who she is. If thats who she is then she was right. I cant really help that Im not attracted to slobs.I ended things with her.What I want you to understand is its okay to be unattracted or turned off to certain aspects of people you cant really help that. If you two cant compromise thats another issue to keep in mind.

Ive recently had to have a serious talk with him on how I felt about our situation.  That he seemed to be shutting me out and all he cares to do is play on his video games all day.  It got to the point where he stopped coming to bed all together and I had to put my foot down. I had an ex who took advantage of me in the same way and I wasnt going down that road again.  Granted I love my current SO weve been together for  years and I want to stand by him and support him through this difficult time.  Just makes it harder when he doesnt work with me to help fix the problem ya know?  Keep the line of communication open with him.

11181626,0,t3_5zn3s9,You beat your depression by making peace with the trauma in your past but you cant assume Kae ever genuinely got over the very straightforward betrayal you inflicted on her. That you didnt speak to her before approaching Fae even if the intentions were positive... surely you can see how she would be hurt by that. In the same way you held onto pain for people for a long time she did the same you need a little more empathy for that.Obviously she built up a lot of resentment during that time and is having a meltdown now. It is clearly all with the intent of hurting you but she might have anxiety or depression issues informing the behaviour as well. Remember despite her history she has likely cared for you for a long time as well enough to try and save the relationship despite what you did but I think it took its toll on her.So become a better person.

11204143,0,t1_df1wjun,This is crap and you know it. Trans people do not owe CASUAL acquaintances anything. For the reasons you stated above. People cant always be trusted to come through when you need them.But a six month long relationship? Sorry. That doesnt fly. Hes not playing the victim. She hurt his feelings. You not only deserve to know WHO you are dating you deserve honesty from your partner. Does that mean I think you need to rattle off every encounter youve had your entire life to someone youve been dating a week? No. But it DOES mean your partner of  months should at least know how you identity.  There are two people with feelings in a relationship not just one. And half a year of dating is a long time to lie about who you are.Imagine it this waya guy has been telling a  year old woman online for six months that he is a  year old guy with steady job and apartment.  MONTHS into relationship he says Dont hate me but Im . Now  if girl still loves guy but chooses not to date him anymore because this is a HUGE lie and a lot to overcomeis she a jerk? She probably cant have a family with him they dont move in the same sort of social circles or do the same things outside of gaming and hes not going to be what her family and friends expected. And before you say its not the same year old guy is sad and depressed because he is ALWAYS being rejected for his age. Older people in general are discriminated against... And its not his fault! He cant make himself younger and he is lonely.Theres really not a lot of difference. Im not trying to be a jerk. But she really pulled the rug out from under this dude. I can see why he feels betrayed. And even if he would have been up for dating her I understand why he might not want to now. If my husband had come to me even  months into our relationship when we were dating and dropped a HUGE secret hed been keeping it may have been ok. Because thats SORT of early timesgetting to know you stuff. But SIX MONTHS? I would have been brokenhearted. Understanding the other persons point of view in a relationship IS important I agree. But I think that she didnt give him the chance. You cant empathize if you arent given any information. It sounds like you mean he should understand why she lied. Even if you UNDERSTAND why someone stabs you and maybe even forgive them for it you dont have to give them the chance to do it again.She spent SIX MONTHS lying to him for every single conversation they had.Six. Months. Thats a lot of shit to get over. Now either youve never been fucked over in a relationship and you have no hard boundaries or you are a saint. Because anyone I know would be upset about this. This guy is taking it fairly well all things considered. The big question is if OP can find himself physically in a relationship with transF.

Then you stop talking to her.

Less chance of sex and no discussion of romantic plans and will send the message to her that suicide means people stay.  If she is suicidal you are not going to cure her.  That is the role of the professional suicide intervention workers.  If she said If you leave me Im going to kill the President you wouldnt be trying to stop her on your own would you?  You would send the information ot the relevant services.  But we sometimes think for suicide that we the individual must be the ones to stop it.

I have not yet said I love you to her and Im almost certain that she is ready to say it to me but wont unless I do.  But when I try to answer that question I kind of stumble because I want to but I also dont feel that I can confidently say yes.  She lives  minutes away from me and Im full time in grad school right now so we only see each other once or twice on weekends.  My grad school program goes for another three years.  That being said I dont know that I can be confident that we can grow enough together on that sort of schedule.  Also when I tell someone I love them I want to be able to honestly tell them that I will be there whenever they need me and that they will always come first but in an intensive school program those are not promises I can honestly make so I feel like telling her I love her not only just leads her on or gets her hopes up but also sets us up for more pain down the road.  The main reason I feel I should break up is because I am not able to say those three words right now and I cant promise when I will be able to so I feel like Im just wasting her time,relationship_advice,df77wsl,1,t5_2r0cn

11294075,0,t1_dfbv6d9,Ive outwardly said to my Mum that I have explored every eventuality and that includes being the product of a rapeabuse.  I am not looking for some kind of fairytale ending just the truth.  Prior to the DNA results she refused to tell me who this other person was that she slept with because it didnt matter apparently and all i needed to know was she had a boyfriend prior to my Dad.  Now she conveniently only remembers a first name of this boyfriend and all other memories have gone. I am  and to be honest exploring the endless horrific possibilities of whether or not I am the product of rape abuse some sort of family coverup or anything else along those lines on my OWN is worse than just actually knowing.  My eldest child has special needs and severe epilepsy what if there is a history in the other side of the family that could help give insight into his future or treatment?I dont actually even have Facebook but i understand what your saying.  I just find it disgusting that my mother cant level with me and explore these possibilities with me in a respectful way.  Instead she is happily watching me being threatened with being outcast for telling the only truth I know and that is that my father isnt who I thought it was. I have been reminded several times by my grandparents that some guy is hardly likely to read my appeal for information and want anything to do with me and again Ive explored that possibility in my head.  Once again I dont expect some Disney story ending.  If anything I already cope with having one non interested self absorbed toxic parent who has no regard for me whatsoever how bad could another be?,relationship_advice,dfc6155,1,t5_2r0cn

11300569,0,t1_dfcv95a,The weird thing is that I never wore short skirtsdresses or low cut tops or anything like that. He would get mad at me showing the slightest bit of skin like my arms or shoulders. He would also get mad if I made an effort to look good such as wear make up or style my hair. That was about a year and a half into the relationship.He would ask me very detailed questions too. I was always very open to him about everything but nearer the end of the relationship I did start lying or avoiding questions because like you I was scared about how he would react and didnt want to get into another argument. He would catch me lying too and then get mad. We ended up arguing constantly. He would also try to make me feel insecure by keep talking about other girls. It isnt great to be like that. Trust is so important in a relationship and so is honesty. It is a shame that he is making you reluctant to be honest with him. You should be able to tell him anything. I wouldnt call off a relationship just because of insecurity because everyone gets insecure but it depends on how much. It can be very suffocating. You could try discussing it with him and see if he makes an effort to change. I think that if it gets to a stage where you feel that you cant be yourself anymore around him that you have to constantly watch what you do or say because you might upset him that you have to please him all of the time... that isnt a healthy relationship.,relationship_advice,dfcwidh,2,t5_2r0cn

The fact that she is making you think like you need to choose is a Friendship Red Flag. Its possible that her tude is also what makes your SO insecure. Build some distance and objectivity into your friendship..Lastly the thing about career ranking above him a great partner would not separate you from your dreams ie your career ambitions ARE part of who you are so no need to rank them.

Another thing I would say is that since everything is normal when the two of you are physically together I think you can assume that whats happening the rest of the time is just her getting comfortable in the relationship.

Some people are better suited as friendsconfidants than life partners.You drop in a one liner about being panicky so its hard to evaluate whether thats a bigger issue than youre letting on or not.  Perhaps his exwife has a more measured take on the situation and thats what he needs right now rather than someone freaking out or adding to his stress levels especially with a heart condition.At the root of this is you comparing yourself to or competing against his exwife.  That has to stop.  You havent listed anything in this post that suggests they have an inappropriate relationship or that he is disrespecting your relationship.

11437780,0,t1_dfs4bba,I felt sad after breaking up with him and it lasted for a few weeks. He was still like my best friend just because we had been so close for so long during the dating so every time something happened Id want to tell him about it or if I got bored Id want to hang out with him. So in that way I missed him but it was just the companionship I missed not specifically him. Just what he was for me a friend. So I stopped myself from texting him or hanging out with him after breaking up for about a month and afterwards I felt fine. I dont think it means you made the wrong choice.For me it was also a fear of being alone. He had told me how I wasnt going to find guys as good as him so I was almost scared to leave him and since you havent dated others really you might not be able to reassure yourself when you think about finding someone in the future. But dont be scared and know that it takes a little bit to regroup and focus on the excitement of a different future. Its okay to mourn what you had but based on your post I feel confident that better relationships await! Also since youve been feeling like this for a while getting into a relationship soon after you break up if you do isnt necessarily a rebound. Emotionally and physically its almost as though youve been broken up for a while but have just been sticking through it almost dragging it out. Itd be one thing if it was out of the blue breakup but a relationship like that means youre probably going to be stable and ready for a new one after it happens dont let people critique you for it if you do get into one.

11499375,0,t3_643vhp,I always try to acknowledge my sons feelings M even if they seem out of proportion to the event. Who am I to tell him how to feel or to try and change how he feels about something. All of us have had reactions even out of proportion to the event reactions at times. Think about if you minimized your husbands feelings about an issue or he minimized yours. It doesnt feel very good to have someone tell you you shouldnt feel the way you feel. Sometimes we cant help how we feel even when we know we know its an overreaction.  What I do tell my son is he is allowed to feel the way he feels whether it be sad angry mad or frustrated or any other myriad of emotions. Its what he does with those feelings and how he handles them thats important. You may want to tell your husband that if he at least acknowledges her feelings and not minimize them then he might get a little further with her. As parents we know kids can be all about drama but one thing Ive learned too is I cant always expect a kid to see reason. One thing I try not to do is outright lie to my son about stuff. If its something thats too adult I tell him its a conversation for when he gets older. If it isnt if his business then I tell him it isnt his business. If its something about him I tell him Mom and Dad will talk about it and get back to him. Otherwise I tell him the truth as best I can. In your case definitely a mix of you and your husbands responses would be a good compromise. But first you both need to acknowledge to your daughter that you understand she is upset and struggling with this teacher. We are sorry you are struggling with this teacher. She may have personals things going on we dont know about or she could be struggling with the job and doing the best she can at the moment. If you could hang in there another week and just do the best you can for that time we will be here to listen if you need to vent. ,relationship_advice,dfzgcpj,7,t5_2r0cn

11500860,0,t3_6424ys,Reminds me of my sister in law and my brother. My SIL gets crazy jealous if they run into any female that has had a past relationship with my brother whether it was platonic or not. She will cause a three day fight over someone they ran into for a few minutes. If they run into an ex girlfriend she expects him to put his arm around her showing the ex that their relationship is secure. Once while on the job he and his female admin asst worked with a female hotel employee while planning a large work event at a hotel. Everything was done over the phone. When it was all said and done my brother and his assistant asked the female employee to meet them for lunch as a thank you. He purposely took his female asst so his wife wouldnt get jealous. His wife called that day and wanted to meet for lunch so he invited her to the thank you lunch. When the female hotel employee walked in she was beautiful. Later my brother got reamed out and was told he should have known by talking to the hotel lady over the phone that she was beautiful and that he shouldnt of done his job in talking to her and taking her to lunch as a thank you. That kind of jealousy has no place in a relationship. All it does is show how insecure the person really is. My SIL tends to twist and turn everything back on my brother even when shes the one at fault. Do not end up with a person like that. Its a miserable existence.  ,relationship_advice,dfzmf0c,1,t5_2r0cn

I looked at your history when you first posted this question and some of your posts are now missing along with some comments as well. some that obviously tell more about who you are than you realized. Which I assume is why you recently deleted them. You should really get help for your NPD. Its why people dont like you its why people call you names here its why people attack you its why people downvote your comments. You have a mental disorder that makes you judge the world around you in a very negative and false manner. What you see isnt how it is. But people with NPD cannot understand that the way someone who doesnt have it can. People respond badly to you because of the personality you portray outwardly. Im going to assume you dont have many friends are introverted spend most your time hiding behind a screen and cant seem to figure out why the world is always against you?

11533576,0,t3_64mcce,Dude I get the taboo around heroin and I understand because it really is the devil substance. But there really are some of us out there who are truly good people with solid heads on our shoulders who got sucked into a crazy addictive substance.  As a recovering opiate addict I wish I could find someone to confide in like that. Especially a girl would be nice. Personally I started with pills in college and it slowly grew into a decade long habit of different substances. Yet Ive still continued my career grown and promoted and made many new friends along the way. Basically I feel like I lived a regular life the past ten years yet I had to turn to a substance to make me feel normal. And really thats all any opiate is it makes you feel nice and replaces what you know as normal. Anyone outside of my very close friendsfamily would be shocked to learn Ive been a functioning addict for a long ass time and although there will always been the junkie image associated with being an addict that is not only the case.  The fact that she was able to spend so much time with you at your place speaks volumes about her recovery time. Ive never experienced heroin myself so I dont really know what its like but I was under the impression most regular users would be needing their fix after eightish hours and would have nothing else on their minds. Maybe this is part of her recovery process? Being honest and open about her past abuses will still being on the road to recovery. I know for my own personal substance it took several months of reducing dosages before I actually got off the drug  with plenty of relapses along the way. Ive never really had anybody in my life I could confide in and who would understand outside of one particular angel in my life so I could see wanting to turn to someone new for support.  OP I say if youre interested give her some time get to know her more. Maybe she just kicked the habit and wants to restart her life. I mean we cant expect her to be turned down by dudes the rest of her life because she once used H right?,relationship_advice,dg3c010,1,t5_2r0cn

11534320,0,t1_dg3bvt9,Some people on this thread are idiots thats the nature of humanity. They will say nasty stuff and call you nasty names but thats just lowquality shit posting. But yeah when everyone is an idiot and there is almost no resistance of opinion than either the world has gone horribly wrong or you have to look within. What I can empathize with you is the shame of making bad decisions and the guilt of hurting the ones that you love. I have constant doubts about how good I am as a person and real memories of harmless choices that werent. I try to make repirations where I can leave people alone where I cant. Obviously I am not a saint now but I think the important thing is to get better for tomorrow. However the number one thing that stands in between this life of perpetual wisdom and my life is how easily I can convince myself that consequences of my actions are not mine. I can convince myself of anything and if repeat it long enough I can even believe to have been true all along. But where does that leave the ones I care about? Sure I may be ignorantly blissful  but Im just as ignorant to how Im hurting others. The truth is universal but perspective is subjective and messy. The only way I can try to be a good person a good partner and content with my own morality is by answering as honestly as possible the question would I be satisfied with the way Im treating this person if I were in their shoes?Not just for decisions but the long term stuff the mild annoyances and the subtle complements. Am I treating this person as well as I want to be treated? The same amount of care compassion support trust and love? Am I doing right by them? And if you arent fix it. Or leave. Or convince yourself that they are fine and all is well and really it was their fault because of this and this and this.

11535366,0,t3_64nddh,Help me understand something If college is over in a couple of weeks and youre probably never gonna see her again after the term ends how can it also be true that you just started college this year?  Is one of you dropping out or something?If you dont have much chance of seeing her or even running into her after youre done with school then what have you got to lose in telling her how you really feel about her?  If she has a boyfriend but its more of a friendly sort of relationship then maybe shes been waiting for you to make a move.  Under normal circumstances you should probably try not to mess up active relationships between other people.  But if you make a move and she isnt into it whats most likely to happen?  Itll be awkward for a minute and then you have the rest of your life to forget about it.If there were a risk of damaging a relationship you wanted to preserve Id say think twice.  But that doesnt appear to be the case here.  Unless you find a way to let her know that shes special to you whether you want to play that friendly or romantic  up to you you might lose her entirely.

She may have plans Monday evening where she cant go to the movie.  So rather than feel crushed you can gauge things by her response for coffee.   If she agrees to go you can then ask her a bit more properly. That way if shes interested she can clear her schedule if she needs to and have more time to prepare.

I mean you have given this woman everything you can invested soooo much and she wont even blow you but she will wrap her mouth around some random dude the second you give her space? okay.Look her behavior is predictable at this point. She will never really take responsibility for what she does she will instead become such a headcase that again you have to put your own feelings aside to care for HER. So... who cares for YOU op? Who? It sure as shit isnt your WIFE whom you swore an oath of LOYALTY and FIDELITY not one of BETRAYAL and CUCKOLDRY. She obviously thinks it was the latter though.I think you need to draw the line here. This was a bridge too far and you dont owe her anything at this point. Move back into your home burn those fucking sheets let her keep the bed in the divorce. If she  tries any of her suicide nonsense call the cops. Make her sleep on the couch and keep a recorder handy just in case. Finally have her write a timeline of the affair and have her send it to your email from her email. Say you need to know everything before you decide whether you reconcile but just use it in court to file for adultery. Finally DO NOT SLEEP WITH HER unless you have resigned yourself to a lifetime of cuckdom.

He is also extremely jealous and possessive as am I. I have no idea how I could ever encourage him to meet these women in person without being incredibly drunk or high while its happeningwhile telling him to do it. We have invited other women into the bedroom before like I said. Sometimes it was fun but the more it went on the more I started to hate it. But now I wonder if doing that again will make me feel like I am more in control and help keep my own jealousy and possessiveness at bay. But I tend to think we are at an impasse here.For now Im just trying to ignore the fact that he is playing mind games with other women and just let it happen.

At that point the perceived loneliness of being single starts to feel like hope instead of dread. The hope of at least having a chance at happiness. You have to be lonely as hell now  the fact that you have nobody else but your mom is a product of your relationship too. Its going to suck to leave. Everything you do is going to remind you of him for a while. Its going to feel empty even though youre miserable. Theres no way to avoid the pain.
