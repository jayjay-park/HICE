7392297,0,t1_d2ify1g,Weird. I tried that and looked at every result but didnt get any results from wiki.,wherewasthistaken,d2igdbq,2,t5_2tr0d
7633470,0,t3_4jtjy2,Yes I was enticed to visit Foster City based on the view from the air. Nothing all that special from the ground where you cant really see the canals unless you can get in someones back yard. Ditto for Discovery Bay. ,wherewasthistaken,d39vtvi,2,t5_2tr0d
9598946,0,t1_d9w818w,I used Google reverse image search to find the same image but larger the original search didnt really find much of use then used that larger one in another reverse image search which found some sites that actually mentioned the name of the bridge... I guess the wizard has been unmasked ,wherewasthistaken,d9w9lkw,2,t5_2tr0d
10362086,0,t3_5o46mv,Well the image itself is almost certainly photoshopped... the lighting on the handcard isnt consistent with the ambient light in the background.  A reverse image search shows a couple of examples of unfinished edits of the image with a red background behind the hand.,wherewasthistaken,dcilqmg,1,t5_2tr0d
11325293,0,t1_dffost1,Awesome!I just searched for casa in that area and looked for names that could be a match for the words in the picture which there werent a whole lot. Soledaria jumped out at me as a close match and the sidewalks streets and mountains had me convinced it must be the right area.I am glad you found it! Have a great trip.,wherewasthistaken,dffpbse,1,t5_2tr0d
