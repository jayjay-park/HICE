4567500,0,t3_3dku00,Well cloning and photosynthesis were developed onboard Sidonia after most of the population was wiped out so it possible the other ships dont have access to it. However Id imagine theyd probably develop it too given they likely have the technology and would need to replace the dead. Also looking at the design for the other ship its more of a cone that a piller so I wonder what its like inside. I dont think theyd have a single residential column but its possible. It is possible though that all other ships have been wiped out given they presumably wouldnt have made the advancements made possible by Ochiai.Plus they dont have best girl Yuhata so they stand no chancespoiler,Sidonia,ct6chh2,8,t5_390fi
