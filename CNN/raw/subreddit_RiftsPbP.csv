1225306,0,t1_ci2jd4x,Son of a B! comms are down and theyre outnumbered!  I TOLD you we needed a relay amplifier for this op!  You people couldnt run IT on a tincan telephone!  Im headed out there boss and Im takin the Big Galoot! shouts Logan Kincaid back at the command center.  Slinging his old C over the shoulder of his patchedup light Dead Boy armor he bolts down to the motor pool and clambers into his baby a heavilymodified Mountaineer ATV that hes jerryrigged as a mobile communications command center.  Firing up the engine he roars out of base towards Pyro and Bull running a quick systems check on the comms and the salvaged CR Enforcer railgun turret.  Cursing up a storm he hopes to God that the extra armor plate stays glued on this time...gt Logan Kincaid hails from the burbs around ChiTown and only made it out when he joined the Coalitions engineering division.  Hes a natural with tech of all kinds but bounced around units due to his grouchy personality and problem with authority.  After some time in communications the mechanic shops and even some basic crosstraining in robots tanks and APCs he was finally bounced out and made his way west where he signed on with the mobile armor division.  His ATV is a patchwork of armor plate antennas salvaged weapons and has the name Big Galoot spraypainted across the hood and You Wreck Em We Check Em along one side.,RiftsPbP,ci7gr7y,3,t5_31v1o
