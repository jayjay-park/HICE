9367187,0,t3_58usyu, IsabellaFirst off let me state that I love Ab Aeterno. For so long I wondered what was Richards backstory and it is fantastic. Richard is amazing in this episode and the answer to Richards backstory is really well done. So why exactly am I cutting Isabella? Well the first and easy answer is that Isabella is really only in one scene when shes dying of pneumonia. In that scene its clear that Isabella and Richard love each other and that Richard will do anything he can to save his wife. But as we know she dies and Richard becomes a slave and he ends up on the island. Next Isabella appears to Richard. Since this is the Man in Black Im not sure whether I can consider this to be part of Isabella as a character. However lets do so since without it this writeup is dreadfully boring. So Isabella talks to Richard about being in hell which coinsides with Richards declaration of being in Hell in the present. Its a nice moment but lets be real its  a Richard moment. Finally Isabella ghost appears to Hurley and speaks to Richard and finally helps Richard let go of his guilt for Isabellas death. Its a heartwarming moment but even in this scene its much more of Hurley helping Richard let go rather than Isabella. And thats the problem. Isabella does fill her role in Richards arc but her character is basically nonexistent so I dont think I can justify letting her go any further. ,lostrankdown,d93cwah,2,t5_3fyki
9680913,0,t1_da5yfqn,I definitely wouldnt have Walt this low despite the dissatisfaction with the way he fell out of the narrative. He was good while he lasted as you said plus the fact that Malcolm David Kelley had such a massive obvious out of nowhere growth spurt is a huge factor in why they had to drop his story so abruptly. It doesnt absolve the faults of the character but it also makes me willing to avoid punishing the character for not living up to his potential. Still the fact that weve trimmed most of the fat from this list and most of the small characters remaining are really strong makes this cut at least justifiable. ,lostrankdown,da6dkgz,1,t5_3fyki
