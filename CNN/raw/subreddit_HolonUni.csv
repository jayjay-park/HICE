4320412,0,t3_38th96,Please link the images alone outside of google docs. You may use imgur Failure to do this will lead to the removal of your sprite from the Delta Dex.,HolonUni,cscn191,1,t5_387wr
4388490,0,t3_3b9hid,Denied for rule . Fix the resizing for the x and try to change more of the sprite so it isnt as close to the original for now focus on fixing the messy resize,HolonUni,cskbi9x,1,t5_387wr

4937748,0,t1_cugwbjy,You have really good eyes. I checked my Photoshop file again and indeed there was a white pixel above his eye which I forgot to color and didnt recognize as it look very similar to the light yellowgreenish color I used. I fixed it up and updated the images. ,HolonUni,cugxy3j,1,t5_387wr
4937823,0,t3_3iiwpf,the skull on Raichus chest looks a little weird but the idea is really cool.,HolonUni,cugyac7,2,t5_387wr
4983464,0,t1_cumoqxk,it doesnt fit the sprite to have random gray in spots though p and if you are going to make a black spot make it BLACK. pokemon sprites use a straight black its not a bad thing to actually make stuff well black,HolonUni,cumoxet,1,t5_387wr

5009451,0,t1_cuph4qc,Ah yes I see what you mean. Ill experiment with the Electrode sprite a bit.,HolonUni,cupttsj,1,t5_387wr
5028741,0,t3_3jtfqf,Its so funny Im creating a Moltres right now for the exact same reasons you did but mine will be Steel with a lot of grey tones to go directly in between black and white similar to yours. Im also using the same base sprite. I think it doesnt look much like a Fighting type though. It looks like Fairy to me due to the soft colors you used for the wings and the round shapes. I would also make the inner outline on the feet a little darker so they become more clear right now they seem a little blurry making the toes merge slightly. ,HolonUni,cus5l37,1,t5_387wr
5056675,0,t3_3k6vid,I like the idea but I think the sprite is gonna need a little cleaning up because it looks sorta plain.,HolonUni,cuviqq1,2,t5_387wr
