6579602,0,t1_czej90u,Im going down the same road as you. I bought the xsw same as xc but has a fpv stream to your phone for  more  to learn on  days ago and its perfect for st timers. I spoke with a guy at my local hobby shop in Houston and he said that the only reason he prefers the chroma over the phantom is their customer service. He said every time he sends one off it takes  months to get back from dji. My dad just got the chroma blade K but we havent got to fly it yet cause of these crazy winds lately so I cant tell you from my experience how they fly,Quadcopters,czzvurt,1,t5_2tows

10202935,0,t3_5luy5h,Im sure others might have better advice but I would suggest the Syma Xhg over the other one. If you are dissatisfied with the camera quality you should have enough power to carry a Walkera gimbal and a higher quality camera as well.,Quadcopters,dc0k5um,1,t5_2tows
