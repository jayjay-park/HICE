10173629,0,t3_5loc12,Becoming a maintenance tech at a factory is possible with only experience or if youre an autodidact and interview well or know somebody.  There are solid entry level positions out there if you know where to look.  Some places will pay for your schooling while you work for them as well.Newly opened factories are a good place to get hired on and move up.  Theyre always looking for people and management is usually still getting up to speed so their hiring standards will be looser than a well established factory thats been open for years.  I know some guys who were just running the machines before and now work as techs because they took advantage of this.  But they arent as good as the guys with real training or schooling.Experience can only take you so far.  Without the theory behind things all youre really doing is applying rote fixes that seem to have worked OK before and might work again.  A good maintenance tech knows the system well and the theory well.  This makes for a much better troubleshooter overall.So yes you can get a job working in technology without school but unless you do your own studying and learning equivalent to school then you probably wouldnt ever be as good at it as the guys who went to school and earned at least a twoyear degree.,STEM,dbx8jkl,2,t5_2saqk
