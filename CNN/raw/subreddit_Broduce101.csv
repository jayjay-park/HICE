11619492,0,t3_65sprg,Unpopular opinion but I think that all the nuest members are wayy overrated its been  years since their debut and they struggle that much learning choreography and lyrics?Tbh I was expecting a lot more from them,Broduce101,dgd2wca,65,t5_3hw8i

11689359,0,t1_dgkz1nk,Totally agree I said as much in another post though I didnt name names haha.Honestly with that said though I definitely see that hes extremely talented so Im not too bothered that hell most likely end up in the final group. I just most likely wont be able to watch any variety content with him in it..,Broduce101,dgl095q,10,t5_3hw8i

11704901,0,t1_dgmr0yp,As someone who has followed IOI during Produce  and postdisbandment Ill give my reasoning. Chaeyeons role in IOI wasnt to be the main dancer or main vocal her role was to be one of the main visuals. Its safe to say that she was one of the most popular members in IOI the fact that she was weak in certain aspects did not matter because the public loved her. Her purpose was to be a visual which helped her branch out into acting and such. Her voice isnt even that bad I like it quite frankly  Back to Haknyeon I dont see much of a problem about his presence in the group if hes able to perform succesfully with the other members and keep up with them. Well see how he does in the BTS performance. Also Sohye despite being in F class managed to improve a lot during the show and during IOI. One other thing Id like to point out is that in my opinion talent isnt what will make a group successful its public support. Despite how talented Kang Sira was in singing she didnt make it into IOI because she did not have enough public support. Despite how talented Park Soyeon was in dancing she didnt make it into IOI because she did not have enough public support.  If you look at the final lineup of IOI theyre all pretty much visuals. Theyre all good looking and were popular throughout the show.Regarding Moonbok I think hed be beneficial in the final lineup because of the male support. Nayoung was the top pick for males last season and Moonbok is the top pick for males this season so I think he has a good chance. Its fine if you dont like Moonbok but I personally support him because of his positivity and unwillingness to give up sort of like Sohye. ,Broduce101,dgmrrsp,2,t5_3hw8i

11763906,0,t1_dgtf39p,Probably all trainees voices layered on top of each other? The original Pick Me had a similar thing going on I actually cant listen to the IOI version because the individual voices bug me.,Broduce101,dgtgv6e,17,t5_3hw8i

11781039,0,t1_dgv1b4b,Yes I know full well who D.Va is and what her backstory is. However theres no evidence in the canon that she was a KPop star. Or a boy.,Broduce101,dgvf2ur,1,t5_3hw8i
11787031,0,t3_684aqx,Unfortunately Mnet has sacrificed him to make Jonghyun rise. Personally I dont think they will redeem him.,Broduce101,dgw3kzw,7,t5_3hw8i
11789654,0,t1_dgwdq4c,Donghyun! He was one of the trainees I really looked forward to when watching the previews and stuff. Hes another ex JYP trainee and Somi says hes like a church oppa too. I think the problem is that he just fades in the background a bit especially since u have sewoon and you cant have too many BNM kids in the spotlight too,Broduce101,dgweaue,3,t5_3hw8i
11799201,0,t1_dgxgrco,While its difficult to say I think with the absence of international voting I think it might give a bit of a push for some of the unpopular trainees. Theres also the fact that this season has generally been less popular than the last season? But that may be just my own experiences of personal exposure.,Broduce101,dgxhako,7,t5_3hw8i
11802134,0,t3_68dxzw,I think speculating about peoples sexualities when you arent LGBT is inappropriate theres nothing wrong with being queer and seeking representation in the media you consume. Especially in Kpop since straight fangirl culture fetishizes gay mengay couples all the time.Of course theres nothing wrong with being queer Im a queer woman myself but idols exist in an industry that is still conservative as a whole and being open about their sexualities would put their career on the line and to so many fangirls its a joke.To be honest some comments here about Daehwi have left a bad taste in my mouth saying hell bring more acceptance for gay idols. Even if Daehwi was gay hed likely be exiled from the industry. So yeah.,Broduce101,dgxt9rm,28,t5_3hw8i
11803171,0,t3_68dsyz,SubForFun is subbing ep too part   is up so far!  Edit    And this episode... Jonghyun... I keep rewatching his and Justice Leagues parts eng sub of their cut if anyone is interested. They really were the highlight of this episode and it brings me so much joy that so many agree on that. Even on Naver their performance has k views more than Avengers and more than twice the likes!,Broduce101,dgxxi8j,21,t5_3hw8i
11803193,0,t1_dgxi75i,If all it takes to be an idol are good visuals then isnt that pretty much the same as being a model? Based on what the judgestrainers say in produce  idols should be good at singing dancing and rapping in some cases and having good visuals is a big plus. I get that in any part of the entertainment industry visuals are definitely a great asset but in the end it boils down to talent. If an idol doesnt fit the visual role but is very good at singing or dancing people often dont care much about their looks anymore. ,Broduce101,dgxxlgz,3,t5_3hw8i

11806921,0,t3_68gu5d,Im literally crying... Jonghyun works so hard amp literally has never fought for the spotlight. He deserves so much more... I really want our little Wartortle to make top .
