Of course it wouldnt have any pics of me and even if it did juicy wouldnt describe them.Its a place where people are judged by the merits of their ideas the rigor of their arguments and the content of their character. That is the only reason why its vandalism was a bad thing.I spent time on making the pics because they were for my boyfriend. They do not in any way reflect my priorities or what I actually do online most of the time. I am quite well known in a certain sphere because of knowledge and insight which is why my old subreddit received as much attention as it did and its offensive that youd think pictures had anything to do with it.,jubilantjdinns,d3dwfvl,1,t5_3ep0c
7721609,0,t1_d3jty0n,Thanks for letting me know. I think its pretty common to think asian women are feminine its the genetics that give that impression. Likewise some asian men have very feminine faces and physiques.  Additionally culturally Asians have more feminine cultural traits. First impressions are hard to overcome until someone gets to know you. Even then people can forget facts about who they are dealing with so much going on.Kind of sad even if you were doing masculine activities Im not sure it would be viewed in light as a peer performance or perhaps with some contempt as being a mockery. People hold strongly their masculine feminine views. ,jubilantjdinns,d3jw749,1,t5_3ep0c
