2556968,0,t1_cms8e9b,Ha. Thanks. I got it from some random thing Master Shake said in a random episode of ATHF. Makes me laugh thinking back on it.,wintercycling,cmsc0ec,1,t5_34b5y
2747723,0,t3_2mirq1,I got some bar mitts for my bike. Today it was like F and windy. I wear very light fleece gloves and use the bar mitts. Usually about  minutes in Im out of the gloves and going bare handed. The only downside to the bar mitts is they force certain grips on the handlebars that are slightly different than my natural grip.But for the cold they seriously kick ass. Make riding in the cold so much easier. I had previously tried fleece gloves and overmitts but the issue there is heat control. The hands sweat w the overmitts and freeze without them.,wintercycling,cngekrl,1,t5_34b5y

5584375,0,t3_3r7tjf,You get much less grit on your drive train with long mudguardsfenders. Make sure they are long enough. Replace the chain as needed. Your derailler will be fine.A mudflap and a chainguard might help too but they dont fit on every style of bike.,wintercycling,cwpakqt,1,t5_34b5y
