9189820,0,t3_565pfe,This one was evocative and insightful.  It states a very real problem and provokes reflection and deep thought.  It was beautiful!Ive been studying  Cor.  which reads you are gods husbandry.  In response to some frustration about my career and spiritual growth a mentor pointed me to this verse.  He asked Is the plant only of value when it has fruit on it?  Doesnt it have value while it is still growing?  Isnt that why the farmer sprays it for bugs and waters it constantly?This also reminded me of something Im only just beginning to grasp in my spiritual walk.  I would periodically hear something in the spirit the same thing repeated but I wouldnt have any specifics on it.  The spirit would veto taking any action contributive toward it.  Once in awhile Id get the terse explanation that this was keeping me alert to what God was going to do.  But that didnt satisfy me because I still didnt understand what was going to happen or whether I would even want it to.  It was frustrating and confusing.It suddenly made sense to me when I was recently contending in faith for another person.  The spirit had been affirming one outcome then stated that the person had changed course and it was no longer feasible.  Then after a time the spirit indicated that the outcome was available again because the person had become more amenable to it.  Thats when I realized that the spirit had been sending updates to indicate my course like a radar or a GPS.  Even my loop of prayerfully expecting then accepting that it wouldnt happen and finally beginning to expect again it was all useful.  It made me ask myself what I really wanted to happen and whether I was expecting something that wouldnt satisfy everyone.  Now those pings are reassuring where before they were just confusing.  Maybe this was a truth that lay among the prophet Pauls thoughts when he said in Philippians  that he had learned in every situation to be content perhaps a part of realizing that people like Demas and Crescens and John Mark could do things that didnt favor him while still having potential in the kingdom of God.  Its given me a new perspective in dealings with other people and in my prayer life as well.,FigTreeChristian,d8gvkz3,2,t5_2xzl7
