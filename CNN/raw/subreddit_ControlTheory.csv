2312062,0,t1_clxh5ty,Okay so all the states are interconnected and they all rule over the system so that we only have one unique pole and zero locations. For the step response we only measure the states for feedback how can what we measure at the output affect the response ? In the case of single input output what we feed back is the output but here it is states and C matrix has no effect on states. This is still unclear for me.,ControlTheory,clxhimp,1,t5_2wmjc
4192647,0,t1_crvdd3l,Figure out your expected phase margin erosion due to latency sampling. Add that to your phase margin to design for. When you calculate this additional required phase margin you will quickly understand the impact on your bw etc.,ControlTheory,cry5s8l,1,t5_2wmjc
6075231,0,t3_3ynq5t,I got a little confused with your notation. Your equation for the discretized system does not look like a regular discrete system to me. In fact what I understand is that it still is a continuous system with an awkward nonlinearity. If I understand correctly in this proposed system xt will have a stepping behavior but xt would be a series of continuous time ramps. Is that right?,ControlTheory,cyfy5t6,2,t5_2wmjc
6189261,0,t3_3ynq5t,Consider the linear and timeinvariant system     xt  Axt  B utand a control signal generated by a zeroorder hond function with period T so the hold times are t lt t lt t ... with tktk T. In addition the control law is a statefeedback control that is    utKxtk   tk lt t lt tk  for some row vector K.The closedloop system is a sampleddata system which can be written as follows    xtAxtBKxtk  for all t in  tk  tk  The most simple stability results is then obtained by computing the transition matrix    WseAs  ints  eAsr dr BKsuch that     xtks Ws xtk   for all s in    Tand the next one is a discretetime system   xtk WT xtkTherefore the system is asymptotically stable if the above discretetime system is asymptotically stable that is if the transition matrix WT is Schur. The result is equivalent of considering the Lyapunov function     Vxtkxtop tk P x tkMore advanced results for the case of nonperiodic sampling are obtained by using for instance an input timedelay approach or a hybrid system approach.     ,ControlTheory,cyt5jyv,1,t5_2wmjc
