8437213,0,t3_4v6v4a,I am sticking with the program. They have done right by me so far and I have faith given some time they will fix the issues. Just need patience if they are truly a small team which I believe they are probably fixing  problem as  others pop up. Also I am sure there support que is in epic backlog. ,RewardableApp,d5w6w36,4,t5_3d7vu

9199220,0,t3_56c47b,Im not sure but you could always look into getting a business internet connection instead of a residential. business internet comes with no data caps. Its what im using so I dont have to worry about that.,RewardableApp,d8i2hpb,3,t5_3d7vu
9207434,0,t1_d8hym8v,Who knows. You asked more than one question. Only one response given.As far as I know youre allowed to have however many accounts under a single IP but not by the same user  and remember each of those RTV needs to link to verified PayPal but a MAX of  devices in total across all of those accounts. Thats the information theyve said repeatedly and imo an ambiguous chat response doesnt amount to a change in policy.,RewardableApp,d8j4032,1,t5_3d7vu

10226116,0,t1_dc312nc,i did mention it my phones say im losing acorns but if you actually click the main balance in the tab where you cash out it shows the correct amount. maybe thats just me but the acorns on the main screen are never accurate the ones where you cash out always are. ,RewardableApp,dc36rbg,1,t5_3d7vu

11380252,0,t1_dfgnpd5,Me too.  I spent money to buy phones I pay for my internet my electricity. I also have to spend time watching them make sure they are working. In addition to listening to my wife complain about all these phones I have.   My time is worth money they are making money off of us.  It is not Free Money.
