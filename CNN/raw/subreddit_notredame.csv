500641,0,t3_1zt2co,Hey. current ND biology major and freshman. From my point of view and I am no admissions counselor but taking honors and AP courses are good. I got into ND without a language AP. Also other people have said this but you dont really apply for bio. You will declare a possible major and then choose classes that will be recommended to you based on your major. If you are even thinking about bio i would state that when you apply because freshman year you will take classes that are required for your major. also as a science major you will have to take a language to an intermediate proficiency pass . The AP spanish will help depending on what score you get but either way i think you may have to take an entrance exam to place you into a language and if you place into a language higher than  you will still have to take a semester at the level you place into. Please dont take my word for this since i only placed into . Contact your ND rep or if you make a visit talk to someone in admissions. they will help you figure everything out.,notredame,cfx6d14,2,t5_2qxir
790047,0,t3_236zs6,With regards to the too in the campaign it is more of an affirmation that they have been excluded already. As to the effectiveness in bringing about unity I agree that it doesnt but rather calls attention to the sometimes unintentionally exclusionary language we use every day. To be conscious of what we say and the meaning behind it is a great step in getting rid of prejudice and racism.The fact of the matter is that there is no way to know how slurs affect an individual person. Your advice to just smile and take it depends on the idea that the words are not hurtful enough to illicit a more violent reaction in the first place.As Asians there arent exactly a lot of negative stereotypes about us. The word chink doesnt seem to carry the same weight or derogatory connotations as the nword considering I cant even type the latter.The if you dont like it why come here attitude isnt exactly a good argument. What about the first women coming to Notre Dame? If they didnt want to deal with all the negativity and sexism why go in the first place? When it comes to acceptance and equality I think that the  institution is the one who should change rather than the people feeling marginalized.You say that you hope the administration considers people based on merit. Even if it absolutely did people would still think the color of your skin had something to do with it. Is that not derogatory? Does that not belittle your accomplishments? Is that not exclusionary? Hurtful?,notredame,cgu2z16,10,t5_2qxir

4536510,0,t1_ct23wxs,Thanks for the reply! I really like the sound of ND. The only thing for more left to decide is whether I want a year abroad experience that involves spending most of my time on campus at a prestigious college in a Rust Belt city not far from Chicago or an average university in a good location to see more of the country I am studying about. I really do not know how to decide. Luckily I have a while yet!,notredame,ct2giud,1,t5_2qxir
4675562,0,t3_3evvav,I am a junior in double majoring in business and math.  To be perfectly honest I applied to ND on a whim and then visited because my interest in the business school. You can read about all day how great the business school is or how good a liberal arts education is. These are  few things that come to my mind reading what youve said in this thread. The first thing that stood out to me about ND was the alumni network is insane. Literally the day I told people I got in alumni I vaguely knew starting contacting me to tell how great ND is. Im not one to think ND is the greatest thing is every single way but I seriously think the ND alumni network is the best in the country. Literally anywhere you go in the United States you will find friendly helpful and successful alumni. From my personal experience the Wall Street network is very closenit and out to help younger alumni. You say you want a tightknit communitythis is it.Regarding Georgetown I am from outside New York City and I love being in an urban area. When applying to schools campus location relative to cities was very important to me. I was extremely worried going to school in Indiana. I was very close to going to Boston College outside Boston. With all that in mind since actually stepping on campus I really dont care about how close a city is. ND campus is very beautiful and large relative to the student body size. I can go for weeks without desiring to step off campus other than for parties lol. So yes Georgetown has DC. And yes DC is a fun city. But all things considered ND has so much more to offer I never notice the lack of a close by city. Also at the end of the day Chicago is not far away.If nothing else look at our freshmen retention rate. I think it sends a very clear message about ND,notredame,ctjwkrc,2,t5_2qxir

5298356,0,t1_cvowoyr,The usual disclaimers to this type of post I know the team needs to worry about their own games etc etc. Its stupid to talk about scenarios etc etc.... But this is what I like about college FB. That night in  when Baylor and K State lost was fun because of what it meant for ND. I like that stuff. This team is better than  just didnt have as much luck. So given that I think...SEC  loss champ is still in. Theres just no way they get left out same with Big  champ. Worst case for us and everyone else would be the SEC East champ wins their championship or Big  West does because then theyll probably take the SEC WestBig  East champ or runnerup as well eg Ohio Sts only loss is to Mich St then Mich St goes on to lose in Big  champ to Northwestern theyll take OSU and Northwestern.We could definitely get in above the Pac  champ if its Stanford or USC we need to win both those games and at least one of them pretty easily obviously need to win all our games.Unless the Big  has a really nutty rest of season which is not out of the question and everybody has  losses I bet they get a team in this year. They have to be thrown a bone.The ACC is going to be a problem for our hopes now. I think the very best case for us would be if Georgia Tech beats Clemson this weekend. I think there is actually a really good chance that happens as Clemson is coming off a high and GT is a totally different style. We are also going to need FSU and Duke to lose a few games somewhere along the line. If ND takes a spot from ACC champ they are going to be demanding we just go and join their conference which we probably will.,notredame,cvoxcop,1,t5_2qxir

6965285,0,t3_4b1v7r,Congrats! That is a great accomplishment that took years of hard work to achieve. I remember getting my letter  years ago... Wow. Receiving my letter was one of the best memories I have. I rushed home from school every day for a week waiting for the mailman. I didnt get much sleep the night before my letter actually arrived as the anticipation kept me up. Nd was my dream school but I knew I was on the edge of being admitted.  I rushed home no mail yet. I started watching a cubs game and fell asleep. I woke up an hour later and rushed outside right as the mail woman was pulling up. I excitedly told her what I was waiting for she dug through her pile and found my mail  the envelope was big instead of small! An admission package instead of a rejection letter. I think I hugged the poor mail lady who I had never spoken to before in my life and ran inside. My family had moved a month before so I was living with my aunt finishing high school. I called my parents and siblings and told them the good news. I spent the rest of the day playing pool with my buddies  so excited and relieved. I held my head high the rest of senior year. It was awesome  as were the next four years. Enjoy!,notredame,d15umyq,8,t5_2qxir

It was just property crime that was an issue.The city is such that there are some insulated nice neighborhoods but the bulk of the city is nice neighborhoods interspersed with rougher neighborhoods all within walking distance.I actually really liked South Bend and Id move back even with my family.

10595673,0,t3_5rlhf4,I just finished my Masters in Management at ND and I had to take out quite a bit of debt to get through the program. Its my understanding I could be wrong that the masters in accountancy through Mendoza also gears you up to take the CPA exam and that combined with the ND networkreputation all but guarantees you a job with one of the big four firms. Youll be in a great position after you graduate so the debt might be worth it. The student loans will be higher interest rates because its grad school but it also helps establish credit. Youll be more likely to get approved for a mortgage when that time comes. As far as socially the grad student experience is totally different. I was both an undergrad and a grad student at ND and its like night and day when it comes to policies like parietals and curfews. Trust me they wont be a problem for you.
