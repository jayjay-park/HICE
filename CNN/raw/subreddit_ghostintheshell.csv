1713276,0,t3_2e1a8c,Its the future. People are often partially or completely cyberized. The story follows a team of special police with hacker skills.Its ultimately not more complicated than that. Things happen. Some things dont resolve in a single episode. SAC has story lines that span the series. When the episode says its a standalone episode it is exactly that. When it says the episode is a complex episode it is dealing with the longer story lines that dont immediately resolve.The overall story timeline order consists of four GitS ARISE hour long releases three of four are out so far then the two seasons of SAC then the three movies GitS GitS Innocence and GitS Solid State Society.Actual release schedule was GitS GitS Innocence GiTS Solid State Society GitS SAC GitS SAC second gig GitS . a remaster of the original movie with updated computer graphics to keep the look consistent with the series and now the GitS Arise  of  out so far. They are going back in time and filling in back story as they go.If you like the future technology and cyberization this show will probably become one of your favorites. Its pretty deep though so you have to stick with it and may want to rewatch parts.,ghostintheshell,cjv4cps,1,t5_2so71

7323119,0,t3_4fofid,Most of the SAC season  standalone episodes after episode  were pretty good. Episode  itself the first laughing man episode was pretty good too. Episode  the wine bank is probably my favorite. My favorite standalone episodes from season  were  Cash Eye  Transparent. ,ghostintheshell,d2al6w9,5,t5_2so71
