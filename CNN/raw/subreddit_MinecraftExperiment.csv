8558607,0,t3_4wzx7j,There was once a forum post about a server that had scheduled uptimes in a closed map where players were let loose to try to survive.It ended in basically full destruction but served as an interesting example of peoples play styles and teamwork.uitzzmna made a post about trying a similar server and got a good number of people interested. I offered to make the map and became a coadmin. Since the first run weve done a few more each with its own variations of rules and new players.The server kind of died out however as many of us went off to collegeuniversity and the difficulty in scheduling uptimes for people across the world.Were always somewhat interested in doing another run as long as there is a good group of people to play.Ive been looking at setting up a new server but Ive been swamped by both school and professional work so I just havent had the time.,MinecraftExperiment,d6behxf,1,t5_2xogn
