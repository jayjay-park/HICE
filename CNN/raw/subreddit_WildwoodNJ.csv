1650292,0,t3_2d73ai,Dont get me wrong I understand the reasoning behind going the beach tag route. If its necessary so be it. Its just one of those claims to fame that Wildwood has  the last free public beach along the Jersey shore. One thing it might do though is to weed out people who dont want to pay for the beach making it a little less crowded. ,WildwoodNJ,cjn6lb4,1,t5_2qnqr
