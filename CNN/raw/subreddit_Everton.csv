This game was crying for Lukaku up top as Etoo kept dropping deep and there was no one in the box. I think if Mirallas had been there or Deulofeu there might have been more incision.Too slow and predictable in the attack. They stifled the flanks and got  men behind the ball. Credit to Swansea their tactics were spot on. Bony should have been sent off though and the officiating was so shite. Pienaar was poor and Naismith needs a game out. Barkley is still not  but gives glimpses of the phenomenal player he is when he makes those surging runsHOWEVER I think wed have lost that due to Jagielka karate kicking Howard if wed played that in September or August.

2784690,0,t3_2rz404,One of those ones that the performance was more important than the result. I am happy with the  but the real change is the mentality and willingness to take a risk that was shown. I feel this is the first time this season that we have something that we can really build on. Whilst we have had some decent results the performances in those games in the league anyway not so in europe were sketchy at best and whilst we made a fair few mistakes in this game we did not let them phase us and continued pressing and forcing the issue for the full  minutes. Very happy with Besic he was a star today both in closing down and distributing the ball to the flanks. Stones once again showed his maturity Coleman was back to firing on all cylinders and what can be said about Lukaku... Worked his arse off in the final third and was involved in everything both as a more direct forward what we have been asking for and also in his Big Dunc role of hold and distribute. This is progress lads. It is one point but tactically we were fantastic and if we play like that against most other sides in the league we will win way more than we lose. ,Everton,cnkly24,14,t5_2qpfg

2869579,0,t3_2sz9jy,I think before everyone tears into him its important to note that Mirallas has been playing hurt for a few weeks and whipping players off at half time in the name of minutes is something Roberto Martinez is noted for.Irrespective of what has actually happened with the penalty and lets be fair at this point its conjecture and it will probably remain so forever with Robertos now customary positivityspin the fact that absolutely nobody tells Mirallas how it is is indicative of the lack of leadership that really does tend to pervade our squad these days and I do feel we suffer for our lack of that amongst other things obviously.On Mirallas though I love him. I always have for the pearlers he seems able to stick in at will from  yards for that mauling at Anfield where he tried to drag the team back into anything resembling respectability but every time there are stories of dressing room difficulties and Im sure weve all heard them Mirallas is usually a name involved.The more I think about what Im trying to say the more problems I seem to find with this Everton squad and after that performance Roberto will call it amazing desire or something I really really cant be arsed.,Everton,cnu9suu,5,t5_2qpfg

4332837,0,t1_csdw2y2,You have to understand the significance Everton has to a lot of fans though. I dont doubt your love of Everton but there are supporters who have witnessed Evertons last title wins as well as their last FA Cup wins. They know what Everton are capable of and to see it slowly deteriorate over the last  years has been not so much angerinducing as it has been just plain exhausting. Waking up every single day for the past  years waiting for Everton to finally take its place atop England and Europes elite. For me Everton has stopped being a trivial thing. Its not just a sport I live and breath Everton now. Whenever they win I feel like Im in ecstasy when they lose my whole weekend is ruined. I wish I could enjoy Everton again and just say oh well whenever they lose but I cant. And I wouldnt say that anyone has lofty expectations for this team. This is probably the most talented Everton squad since the s and the Holy Trinity. We should be making it into Europa every year at this point if not the Champions league. We have the talent and everyone can see it which is why this is so aggravating. This guy in the article is full of shite though.

When you have a team that was as ancient as Pienaar Osman Distin Alcaraz Hibbert not that much depth across the board and other players underperforming like McGeady well most of the team in general theres not much you can really do right? But thats also the result of not planning accordingly during the summer transfer or rating the players inaccurately. However I do believe in what Roberto is trying to accomplish and Im not complaining at all unlike the original post or other commenters. I agree with you that it will take time I think were on the right track after a setback this past season due to a number of factors both our fault and beyond our control.

Which player did they sell recently that ended up being a massive loss? We made money on Fellani and sold him for more than he was worth. I thought the Rodwell sale would hurt us but it hasent at all. If by investment you mean a new ground Ive been through that argument for over twenty years now. Ive heard every argument to replace Goodison that exists and they arent realistic or beneficial. Who is going to buy this club? If you want them to sell there has to be someone better waiting to buy. We have no evidence at all that person exists. There are very few big changes of a club board that worked well. Chelsea and City are he exceptions. Leeds Pompey Forest Blackburn and Newcastle. Then you can look to Sunderland Villa and the Kopites all bought by wealthy Americans and all of them have underachieved. Even Arsenal who moved to a new massive ground and found new investment have been largely a failure by their standards.

Bringing the clubs best ever manager on to the scene is the act of someone thinking about the club and not themselves. As for Moyes Kendall himself made it clear that Moyes didnt want him aroundgtIf David wants me to give him any other tips Id be happy to go and speak to him. But as he didnt invite me to Finch Farm during his  years as Everton manager I wont be expecting an invite to San Sebastian anytime soon.Which is why it doesnt seem quite right that Moyes is now saying he used to take advice from Kendall but at the same time I would never want to stop someone paying tribute to him.,Everton,cw5iaw5,4,t5_2qpfg

Im sure everyone involved with Everton is fuming about that players coaches manager and maybe even the board. However I dont think this is a top  team as constructed. Loads of talent in various positions but most of that talent is young shows a lot of inconsistency.I think a lot of frustration is added by the fact that Leicester has been on such a good run. It makes all the teams like us look at them and wonder what the difference is. By the numbers its  fewer goals scored and  more goals conceded.

Stones cool head as got us out of more problems that its put us in this season but still people want to get on his back. We did the same thing to Barkley last season and his form was shit. Yes Howard has had a massive dip in form and Robles should be starting. Yes we should be closing out games better and taking our chances. Yes i have no idea how Kone is getting so much game time.Its easy to be buzzing when youre team is on the up its how you react when the team starts playing poorly thats important.

The problem is that you just cant predict if a player with star quality will actually perform in the environment they find themselves. Look at Falcao and Di Maria. Number one thing is for the club as in staff and supporters to make the mentality gear change up into demanding CL quality no matter who wears the jersey.

We also had a very average team and only scored as many goals as the team that finished rock bottom. Pretty impressive.I think most of us agree that Martinez first season success was due in large part to the defensive discipline that Moyes had instilled coupled with his attacking flair.As for the Europa we made the last  in  too.For the Cup although were currently favourites with most bookies still cant figure out why were ahead of Man UtdWest Ham we havent even made the final yet which we did in .

7235948,0,t3_4ejfb8,I think you are discounting that in the current  setup that the fullbacks are both very offensive. They make overlapping runs and interact with the wingers. As part of Martinez successful work in the first season was due in part to Baines and Pienaar working so well together. Baines has been out and Pienaar has declined. The left wing position has been a problem all year as Mirallas and Kone have really failed to make that position their own.As the left side of the attack has declined from Martinez first season the bulk of the attacks started on the right side of the formation. This was working better at the start of the year with Deulofeu was creating a lot of chances but neither Gerry nor Lennon have the same understanding with Coleman as Baines diddoes with Pienaar. Often times theyll both make the same run or just not really support each other and the play stagnates and they have to recycle the ball backward.As for Rom being a lone stricker I think he can fill that role at times well as long as there is some sort of support. In the most recent ManU game he was completely isolated and no one was making any supporting runs or runs in behind. And while I think Lukakus hold up play has improved some this year you can still see there is a lot of room for improvement. Sometimes his first touch is downright bad and he can be muscled off the ball by defenders that should not be able to out muscle him even Daley Blind pushed him off the hold up spot a few times. Hard to imagine Blind doing that to Drogba.I think you are right about not putting the practice on the finer points and the little things. I dont imagine that a Simeone or Mourinho would allow the side to be this poor in defensive organization and set piece defense. Its been a glaring weakness but Martinez seems to be of the Wenger school of letting the players sort themselves out and instilling belief and confidence in them to allow them to succeed. When things are going well and you have a team of leaders this style can work. When you have a group of young defenders however you get what weve seen for the last two years where it looks like the team has no idea where there other guys will be or do in any given situation.,Everton,d20ob10,9,t5_2qpfg

7359438,0,t1_d2eo6gv,See Ive been having the same thoughts as well. After going on rsoccer and even this subreddit I feel like Im been brainwashed in a sense to think that the manager takes on all of the fault and should be blamed for a loss. Ultimately yes that is what the responsibility of a manager is and he needs to take this responsibility but I keep thinking that its not really his fault at times as today. I as well want a change in management but I dont think thatll magically do anything.Its crazy how much people base results and judgements off of emotions. There have been many games where weve barely won but weve tipped off the players for a good performance. Most of our players performed superbly for the second half at least yet I still see a lot of people moaning about them and in the end it just follows due to the results of the match. Also regarding your point about whether were actually good or were just overrated I think thats an excellent point which goes along with the post the other day. Even people on rsoccer mention how were too talented to lose this much but are we actually? Do we actually have a team that should be contending for champions league? I honestly dont know because of my bias for Everton.,Everton,d2epuk1,2,t5_2qpfg

7447993,0,t3_4hb2ij,My reasons His game management is abysmal its frightening how many teams this season we have been unable to see out a game and hold onto our lead. Only Liverpool have dropped more points from winning positions this season.   vs Bournemouth  vs Stoke  vs Chelsea  vs West Ham were just soul crushing and we never learned our lesson from any of these games. It is evident that he has lost the dressing room. When a respected figure like Leighton Baines who isnt known to be impetuous or arrogant publicly states to the media that Theres no chemistry between the players right now you know something is up. The situation was made even worse when Martinez forced Baines to apologise and said the comments were taken out of context when they were clearly not. Now for some facts the  season is the year that will boast Evertons worst ever home record in the history of the club. We have only won  times at home this season  teams like West Brom Watford and Newcastle have won more. Only Villa and Bournemouth have conceded more goals at home than us this season  this is the kind of mediocre company we are with.  Martinez said to judge him over three seasons and not three months. Two successive th place finishes just isnt good enough we hadnt finished th since over a decade ago and that was when we had a severely inferior squad.   Finally the man is deluded the most laughable of all his post match comments came after we were humiliated  by Dynamo Kiev last year and refused to blame the defence saying they couldt have prevented Dyanmo from scoring because their finishing was incredible.,Everton,d2osftt,9,t5_2qpfg

If this is true which it looks to be the club have disrespected these players the fans and its history.  Hibbert and Osman were surplus to requirements especially in Hibberts case over the last couple of seasons and I did expect them to go.  This has nothing to do whether we need them as players its about respecting team members and servants of the club. This is not about being sentimental I love that the club has ambition and drive to succeed! What bothers me is that we are treating players former or otherwise with disrespect.  They both deserved a phone call to say thank you and to be told their contracts would not be renewed. Its also important to remember that these two players will have a lot of friends in the club especially in the first team!

A successful season requires the ability to pick up points late in games a quality striker off the bench to run at tired defences when its not happening for Lukaku is a huge weapon in that regard. We have Enner Valencia.But its not just what we failed to get its that the whole window seemed a bit shambolic lots long sagas for players who were never coming last minute bid for Sissoko who we should have known was never coming panicked looking loan for Valencia.

10095422,0,t1_dbnfy70,An interesting question I dont believe hes of the Gazza Cantona Henry or Messi model of player that a lot of us thought he was destined to be.I think the concern that your question is based upon is when you see Ross harried off the ball in the opposition half when trying to attack an already prepared defense.When he plays in a slightly deeper role he comes up against players who are rushing to get back in position and not ready yet and his natural ability and talent just takes over. He can run at teams keep the ball choose a simple pass or hit a long ball like today for Rom to run onto.Youre right to focus on concentration because if he is to play this role full time then he is going to have to learn how to defend for long periods too its my opinion that he can be the reverse of Gareth Barry and instead of being a defender who went forward hes going to become a forward who went backward.,Everton,dbng5o7,2,t5_2qpfg

Sure players like Barry and Williams do their jobs but they are far too old. Everyone else is either wildly inconsistent or just not that good sorry but its the truth.

With Everton have been a disaster.I actually think hed be ok as cover for seamus with a back  for short periods and I think hes a very valuable squad player a squad player whos more than capable of forcing his way into the first team too who can cover any midfield or wing back position im just not going to base it on games  years ago at semi pro level ,Everton,ddvfkt9,2,t5_2qpfg

11258666,0,t3_60p2or,Im slightly worried. I doubted he would make it as a top player but Ive been massively impressed with him recently  something seems to have clicked.I want to see us do everything we can to keep him. Hes a local lad but despite that hes not someone the fans have always shown a lot of love for so I think hell do whats right for him. Hes in a strong position to influence his contract or a move. If a champions league club come in for him I think he could force the move. Really hope that doesnt happen.,Everton,df85ikx,7,t5_2qpfg
11277905,0,t1_dfabubg,Ross played three times as much as Geri last season and they both finished with the same amount of assists despite Geri being wide right isolated and only Rom to aim for.I dont need to compare Serie A with the PL Ive seen what Geri can do and has done for us in the PL despite not being played as much as other players.Imagine someone saying oh Rom is a lazy bastard sack him off to Spain! Its stupid the likes of Rom and Geri should e in the team not because they work hard but because they create and score. Let Morgan Davies and Gana do the running.I didnt say I only watch the highlights I watch the full  of every game I said have a look at his PL highlights and youll see that despite limited game time what he has already done for us in the PL.,Everton,dfac1d9,0,t5_2qpfg
11285595,0,t1_dfb793z,Its definitely wishful think but I think we have a great chance to take a point if not  off L.P. Arsenal has to time to fix their form before we play.

11297700,0,t3_617asv,Backstory My friends and I all grew up in a small soccer deprived town but we all eventually became fanatics after getting a taste of the beautiful game. I became an Evertonian in  and didnt know much because I was  and new to watching the premier league but nonetheless as I grew older it felt like the prefect match for me. Flash Forward Its  and my best friend tells me hes chosen Liverpool as his club. Having never of had a girlfriend this was my first heartbreak. Growing up in the town that we did it always kind of felt like us vs the football heads but this choice left me feeling alone in the world. Present day I still have a lingering guilt as I feel I could have done more to save him in the months and weeks leading up to that terrible day. Im trying to make piece with it so I tell myself you cant control the terrible decisions of others. I used to pray but I feel theres no use in it anymore. Anyways were still great friends but itd be fantastic to kick their asses on derby day! ,Everton,dfcksm3,4,t5_2qpfg
