8081036,0,t1_d4o9kjz,I have fairly small cheeks and tend to prefer a light application for my blush. I find that this brush gives me a light application for both creams and powders if you care about those. It does have a pinched ferrule so it is an oval shape not a round. The combination of goat and synthetic fibers make it durable and springy. You can control the amount of pressure that you put on it to increase or decrease the surface area and it will bounce back.As far as foundation goes I think it depends. I dont personally like duo fibers for foundation because I find it can be streaky but the foundations that I use are fairly liquidy. If you like duo fibers for foundation you probably wont have an issue with this brush. I think its a good size for foundation not to big and not too small. Disclaimer I dont contour much. When I do contour I think the pinched ferrule comes in handy. Like I said before this brush gives a light application so I think its very functional for that as well. Other things I will use this for are bringing and highlighting. I think its great for bronzing for many of the reasons stated above. Personally its not ideal for highlight because I like to keep my highlight very precise but you can definitely use it.I added some pictures in for a visual comparison to other brushes that I use for blush. ,Fude,d4odtg4,4,t5_3f19b

8124109,0,t3_4pznkk,I use unscented dish soap or face wash thats too drying for my face Liquid Neutrogena Asian style foams. I dilute the cleanser in a cup if Im cleaning natural bristles but use full strength with synthetics. I find Dr. Bronners to have a gross lingering smell but Ive only tried the unscented baby version  the peppermint or tea tree ones might cut through the musky scent.,Fude,d4t80zv,1,t5_3f19b
8128243,0,t3_4pznkk,I use my disliked face washes on them and I wash them exactly like how I wash my face. I usually wash first with an oil cleanser to get the worst of the staining and color off then use a foaming cleanser or shampoo to get rid of any residue. Then I dry with a brush guard which definitely helps brushes keep their shape better. ,Fude,d4tory8,1,t5_3f19b
8333871,0,t1_d5ih5nb,Are you using the WG airbrush for blush? I found it pretty useless for blush squirrel hair doesnt blend well so Ive relegated it to setting under eye concealer but I rarely ever put on under eye concealer ha! The only squirrel hair blush brushes I deem appropriate for blush are the pom pom shaped and densely packed ones like the Surratt cheek and Chikuhodo RC because they have a lot more hairs. Anyway I was watching this video and you get to see how the Suqqu cheek performs on the cheek. Flop city D Also somewhere else in that video she shows the Suqqu L and says she loves it for a sheer wash on her lid.,Fude,d5jaf0s,1,t5_3f19b
8484731,0,t1_d61si1h,seconded i would be very intersted in hearing a review on smith brushes! they have some shapes that have caught my eye,Fude,d624ycn,1,t5_3f19b
8499186,0,t3_4w49nm,I gave mine to my daughter whos . She likes playing with makeup. I gave her a bunch of old sparky eyeshadow and stuff too. When she has friends spend the night they often get it out and do each others faces. Its pretty cute,Fude,d63y7e8,2,t5_3f19b
8504537,0,t3_4w37m8,the LQ is pretty cheap for so much kolinsky in a brush. A similarly big one i have from cinema secrets is  and is quite thin. and the frigging Shu U.  is an eye brush and Im going to need  GOLD  and i think i might try that boar hair brush. my hair gets oily too quickly,Fude,d64mdqg,2,t5_3f19b

8571171,0,t1_d6cz1l2,Oh nooooo Ill update you when I try it out! That sucks  maybe its too soft to pick up much product? My everyday blush brushes are the Haku J and Chikuhodo Takumi T. ,Fude,d6cz81e,2,t5_3f19b
8732630,0,t3_4zmb3r,After seeing your review and thinking about it more I think I will get them,Fude,d6x83wp,2,t5_3f19b
8761206,0,t1_d70sse1,Hahaha not a bad choice! Neither is exceedingly expensive thankfully. Definitely look at other reviews though. I just tried the flat shader and it picked up pigment really nicely ,Fude,d70t8f1,1,t5_3f19b
8940413,0,t3_52febt,They are really beautiful! Both these brushes have caught my eye and sooner or later theyll be in my hands.Now youre going down the rabbit hole to enter the wonderful world of fude!,Fude,d7mi7sp,1,t5_3f19b
9303923,0,t3_57dvmo,I have some Energy brushes and their quality is a bit hit and miss. The Suqqu cheek dupe is less dense a bit smaller than the real Suqqu. Softness is not soo much different although Suqqu is softer but the problem of this Energy brush is that sheds like crazy. And not saying  or  hairs but a lot more. I would consider if you are starting with make up. If you love fude not worth to try. I also have their version of the Rae Morris with red squirrel hair and those are super soft and good quality. Other than that...not my cup of tea. ShouSHouLang has better quality but then i find they have difficult to keep their quality standard. The same brush may be different in desntiy and softness so again..a bit hit and miss but overall better than Energy. Hope it helps!,Fude,d8vc8hz,2,t5_3f19b
10010195,0,t3_5iznwu,Not to be gloom and doom about it but your wife is right on this when it comes to pricing.  Im assuming youre in the US.  Expedited shipping might easily blow through half of your  budget.  Timewise its also gonna be cutting it really close for some good quality eye brushes as they often ship from Japan.  Distributors exist however this limits your options significantly and they jack up the price by a dollar or two but I suppose that can be considered a convenience fee.  What sort of eyeshadows does your wife use?  If she uses cream then a synthetic brush or a goat brush might be her best option.  If she prefers powder then goat or squirrel brushes would be best.  Goat hair is the most versatile when it comes to products so I think going with goat and squirrel for eyeshadow would be a good choice.  A smaller liner brush andor an eyebrow brush will get you some bonus brownie points. I got some stuff from Beautylish.com recently and they provided expedited shipping so you might be in luck.  Beautylish offers flexible payments so it wont break the bank too hard at once if thats a concern and orders arrive gift wrapped.  They ship from San Francisco.For a cohesive set I would suggest getting one of everything with the white handles  The GSN the GSN the GSN and the GSN would be a good introductory set.    You could do something like or pick out similar shapes from here,Fude,dbccvia,5,t5_3f19b
10129127,0,t1_dbre4or,i was going to review all of them minus the brow and lip brushes.i do have the Z. its alright its pretty and useful  the shape is right up my alley. but i feel guilty scrubbing the hell out of it whenever i use and need to clean it.,Fude,dbrtx8i,2,t5_3f19b
10253863,0,t3_5mtf8n,The Morphe and Jessup brushes look similar to the Hakuhodo J  and the Sigma can be replaced by the J  which is the softer version of Mac  only if you want a softer brush!. Theres also the Chikuhodo GSN and Wayne Goss  although they may be too tapered for you.,Fude,dc6bxxp,3,t5_3f19b
10278060,0,t1_dc8zlft,gt I think its around FML. I need to start befriending people with interest in fancy brushes so we can order together because that shipping is straight up abusive. How scratchy was Zoeva again? lol.Im green with envy at your collection! those sound like great picks. A bit of everything.,Fude,dc92ogi,2,t5_3f19b
10285627,0,t1_dc0pdsp,Hi I was wondering how soft you would rate the Shou Shou brush? Is it soft enough for sensitive eyes?,Fude,dc9xkt8,1,t5_3f19b
10481433,0,t1_dcvrp0h,The Chikuhodo Z recently increased by  yen on CDJ TT Sad... Not sure if that was Chikuhodos decision or CDJs. Also If the Yojiya kokutan eyeshadow brush is the equivalent of this guy from Hakuhodo then it has my full endorsement.asterisk because disclaimer this is an unnecessary luxury brush but I adore it and use it as a very targeted blush brush,Fude,dcw6g0a,2,t5_3f19b
11105746,0,t1_deqbyxu,I second this. I have the Wayne goss brow set and I use to use the Anastasia pomade with it. Ever since I switched to using a brow pencil and some powder my brows have never looked better.,Fude,deqtrw6,1,t5_3f19b
11359444,0,t1_dfjk8fc,No problems! I hope you guys get the WCS. They are certainly a gem especially in my collection!,Fude,dfjklx1,2,t5_3f19b
