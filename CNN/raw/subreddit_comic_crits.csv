3867350,0,t1_cqw4ek1,The other thing I wanted to say about the art is that the character design of the witch is really cool.  The breasts on the hunter though are maybe a bit too close together when she stands up the first time.  Regarding the writing Im worried that it seems a bit cliche with the tenaciouskidTM protecting the mysteriouslyweirdgirlTM.  I wonder if the pacing wouldnt work better too if chapter one started out with the kid running then instead of cutting to the flashback it cut to introducing the hunter but that section too introducing the hunter probably needs to be cut down a bit as it drags on the pace.  Then cut back to the fight then maybe go the flashback after the fight and the hunter asks the kid what hes doing out...Hope this helps.,comic_crits,cqx4126,3,t5_2s3lj

4455574,0,t1_cssar9v,Some twelveyear olds are pretty good...  I guess Im getting there its certainly better than it was when it started. Than again I have the advantage of working with something more advanced than crayons so...I think I may need to slightly revisit how I draw heads and I think youre right. Essentially what I do is I draw a circle than a Vish shape off the bottom than put the eyes where those connect.But doing it that way leads to the problems youre noticing and the general balloon shape of the head I was noting. I may just try to draw the whole head as an oval shape and work from there.I think the eyes have to lower than anatomically correct because sometimes I draw the eyes pretty large they are always way too big compared to normal but I think its easier to draw expression with the larger eyes and god knows they dont have much expression as is. When I draw eyes normal sized everyone just looks suspicious D But perhaps once the other problems are fixed this will look more normal.Edit I also think its sort of a misguided attempt on my part to define a brow. I think I need to go to brows . The more I look at it the more it seems that foreheads tend to be only very slightly rounded and more sloped down. I guess I forgot that humans are part neanderthal. I need to add in the neanderthal genes.,comic_crits,cssb327,2,t5_2s3lj
4456194,0,t1_cssdago,To be honest like everything else in the comic the opacity is a little inconsistent. Its either  or  depending on the page its not much skin off my nose to stay on the high range of that and do . Appreciate the feedback on it!I tend to mix volumetric shading with the light shadows but I dont think Im careful enough for it to work well a lot of the time considering how hard the shadows are as most of the time Im only using one shadow color. Its probably just a crutch to give the face more definition  which was discussed in another post they have some issues with. Its something Ill try to reduce.Its probably fair to say Ive gotten carried away with the fragmented style panels. Im not entirely sold on making them uniform squares though I certainly hear you what you are saying and would respect that opinion there but I do agree thats very easy to argue that its gotten a bit just plan unnecessary at this point. Reigning it to at least a little more uniform or making at least some of them square is definitely something i could do. I did put a very mild stroke on the panel outline back here when it got completely out of hand but I dont think that would help quite what you are referring to to do that for all the pages.Its something Ill think about. I think a large part of me wants to flee the page format and head for the open pastures of the scrolling comic style in which case you can ditch the panel uniformity entirely but as Im not doing that I should probably try to work within the page a little better especially as even by my standards there are some where the page flow just becomes unclear.,comic_crits,cssdvo8,2,t5_2s3lj

You know youre getting an entire update at once whenever you visit the latest page.Ivernloch I believe it was called and I probably spelled it wrong ran into the problem youre describing to a degree.

It could be especially interesting to see how things work in your universe.  Democracy?  Small council?  Etc.  I remember Gaiman had a really interesting concept of Hell where it was ruled by a triumvirate.  Its also generally useful to have at least two story threads going at the same time again  is a perfect example of this.  Any time one is getting stale or you cant think of anything you can switch over to the other one.

6717450,0,t3_47mdhh,Alright cracks knuckles lets do the compliment sandwich shall we?First off. Very vibrant colors. Has a very classic Western comic book look. If thats your thing awesome theres definitely a large target audience for that style. In terms of spelling and grammar thats not much I can see thats out of place. While it seems like something trivial to point out  of the time spellinggrammar comes up as an issue but so far so good from what Ive read so far. Where you need improvement? First off line work. Its practically nonexistent and while there are many color and even black and white comics that get away with this the execution in your case is choppy incomplete and hard to process as a part of the rest of the composition. It clashes and makes it really harsh to look at. I dont know if youre using traditional tools or digital but you should work on your line weight a little. Be bold and confident with your lines. Second your panel composition and flow. While some pages have a neat set up with the panels and flow of action there are others that are definitely lacking and breaking the flow of the action and makes it feel very stiff and lackluster Action is supposed to pop out to the reader immerse them and impress them. When youve got three panels side by side of them just punching each other it comes across almost as comedic  and should only be used in a comedic execution ex. Panel  Mary attacks Sue Panel  Sue attacks Mary tugging her hair Panel  Marys hair is revealed to be a wig with Sue holding it in her hand Panel  they stare at each other awkwardly at this weird realization that Mary is indeed bald. This is just a random example of where side by side action works and even then you still need to find a way to make it flow. I dont know if you do any life drawing but doing life drawing and studying from real people can help you learn how naturally people move. So far your characters are stiff and a lot of the action is lost because of this. In addition to the anatomy of your characters weve got panel composition. Dont be afraid to let your charactersenvironments break out of the panels or go completely panelfree or take on unique shapes to portray a certain scene. The scene will leave a much bigger impact that way and the action will flow a lot better and not seem so stiff and lifeless. Moving on the art style itself. As I said already its the style of Western comic books which is cool. However though its been said already with the point of stiffness your art is coming across very stock picture like. Sometimes characters look like they were taken from a photograph and thrown through a Photoshop filter to cartoonize them. This is adding to that stiffness I mentioned before and its just not making your work very immersive or believable. Dont be afraid to draw outside the lines get messy get that form and flow in that portrays action. Its a lot more fun that way and its the only way to improve further  Draw with confidence! Even the masters are still learning Finally text. Yes you seem to have spelling and grammar down which a surprising amount of comic creators dont seem to have but its very hard to read. I dont know what size or font youre using or how youre rendering your textfinal image but its very chalky and there are times I had to read things over again just to understand what was being said just because I couldnt perfectly make it out the first time. Again I dont know if youre using traditional or digital tools but make sure your files are at a higher resolution Photoshop automatically sets the dpi to  this is way too low most of the time set it to something like   or dpi when you draw on the canvas or scan in the work. This will allow you to not only have higher quality work but text too especially when it comes to the rendering stage. Youre off to a good start you just need to focus on cleaning up your linework and text and creating a more believable scene. When it comes to the latter this is something youll improve at as you continue. Dont be afraid to try new things and work outside your comfort zone its the only way to improve. Start drawing from life more if youre not work on your line confidence and reference library all that beautiful stuff. Good luck!   ,comic_crits,d0e550m,5,t5_2s3lj

But if you try to go professional with it it is a hard ladder to climb either way but especially with the conventional superhero stories. Do know though that basically every story was told already in some way or form but if you tell yours well enough people would listen. If you look at movies or TV shows that are current at their base the story is not unique whats unique is how well they preform it.

Think of Garfield for example most of those comics are literally just of an awkward guy talking to his cat. The thing that made it successful was the execution.I would definitely say go for it!

And you guys seem to be doing a great balance of large panels.When I hit first thinking it would take me to the first page of the latest installment I think it took me way back to the beginning of the book.I always teach never open a comic with backstory. Jump right into the action and let the reader pick it up. On the last page your hero says Hey thanks are you with aegis?This seems to casual for a soldier. Especially one that just went through a near death experience. I havent read much of the book so this may be perfectly in character for him. But generally make sure you develop unique voices for each character that really showcase who they are by the dialogue alone. Will definitely be reading more of this webcomic.Write on write often!

Ill try to answer what I can. gtwhat is the proper size for it?Where I live we use cm and AA etc. but you should Google the size thats commonly used where you live. Are you familiar with Adobe InDesign? It has a guide that shows you which area will print. You just place the image file into the printable area.gtHow many pages are customary?I stand corrected but books and comic books are bound in multiples of  so bear that in mind. gtnumbering pages on the bottom center of each pageSure! Ive seen it on the bottom right too. I dont think theres a hard and fast rule for that.Something that I find helpful is to lay out your pages on the floor in a folder or print them out so that you can see which pages will go on the right and left. People will generally see whats on the right pages first. What ends up in the middle of the book is usually the page they open onto first I made a mistake in the past where I had the climax of my story on the middle pagesgtwhere online would I print my comic?Is there a particular reason you want to use an online printing site? Most print shops can help you when it comes to sizing etc.This is an article that compares different digital publishing sites. I hope at least some of that was useful to you.
