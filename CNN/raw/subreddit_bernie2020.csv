Almost everyone at my school has a bet on wholl be the next president like five bucks if he wins or Ill wear a ClintonKaine shirt if she wins. In the overall election shes not in too much risk of losing it to Trump but the potential risk is there now with her being exposed in the email scandal. ,bernie2020,d9fpbg7,1,t5_3a1zd

Pulling up that original comment of yours on the Wayback Machine will be a good chuckle!It was much more simple and profound than the rant you turned it into.This here tshirt is the single reason Hillary won!Good lord the daftness! Whats even more amazing is your too triggered to even articulate the sentiment youre trying to convey. Its like you heard someone else discussing it but were too incompetent to understand what they were saying. ,bernie2020,dbyopii,1,t5_3a1zd
