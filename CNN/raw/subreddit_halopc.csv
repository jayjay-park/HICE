8186822,0,t3_4rdg8u,I still play halo  on pc from time to time. Its really the only game Im interested in and will make time for. I search reddit every couple of days to see the latest news. I thought halo  coming to PC would be much bigger news. It is coming to PC right?  ,halopc,d50wjwc,1,t5_2uqbz
