11780774,0,t3_68311h,Off the top of my head I recognise ARJ as being a very old archive format similar to ZIP.The danger will depend on the contents as with any file archive but if Avast says they are corrupted then they might not be valid ARJ archives at all just some files with the same extension. I wouldnt worry too much. Depends where the files were located and their origin etc.,avast,dgvdzwq,1,t5_30cvn
