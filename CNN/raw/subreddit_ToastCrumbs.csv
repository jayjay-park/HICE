I have a very close friend who struggles with food and Ive been frequently shocked and amazed at what people will say to her despite their absolutely genuine good intentions.

7757165,0,t3_4l7gw4,Congratulations!!! How exciting for you. And also Im sorry about your mum. Parental illness is such a hard thing to go through at the best of times and weddings  while wonderful  are always intense. I hope it all works out for you. Having only got married last year its all still quite fresh in my head my top advice would be REMEMBER YOUR WEDDING IS FOR YOU AND YOUR AFFIANCED. Keep whats important to you both close to heart  and test everything you come up against on it. If its not important to you let it go  whether thats the colour of napkins or whatever or whether someones new girlfriend tags along. Families are such unique complex things and its really easy to get swept up in trying to make things right for everyone. As someone else has already said  at the end of the day youll be married  which gives great perspective. Good luck and enjoy the planning and anticipation! ,ToastCrumbs,d3nxink,3,t5_3el8t

8815234,0,t1_d777cu3,I dont really mind a slightly cliche love triangle in a scifi or mystery or something where there are other things are going on in the story. For a straight romance that relies heavily on character details and interaction of characters to support the story I can understand not wanting to read yet another story about supposed good guy versus bad boy. But for anything that follows a heros journeytype arc theres often one close friend from the old world the character was living in at the start and one from the new world that arrives to shake things up. In a YA story and many nonYA stories these characters end up being love interests and the end resolution of the story involves the protagonist choosing between them and thus choosing how they will exist inbetween these two worlds.I agree that a lot of the TV shows listed drag out a love triangle longer than they should but I think this is a problem with television love triangles specifically rather than love triangles full stop. It is particularly true of American TV where any popular program is forced to stay on the air and keep running something episode seasons even when the writers feel the story has run its course or they have a good way of resolving things and closing the story out or something. Compare with British series that are often  episodes and only a few series long. The UK version of Life on Mars for instance had people speculate about the ending but because the series was written to only ever have a certain number of episodes the story was allowed to play out as planned and still felt satisfying for most who guessed what happened. When people figured out what was going on in Lost the writers denied that was what was happening and then had to keep adding in new mysteries and trying to stretch the story to try to fill in an indefinite number of seasons.This all got a bit offtopic from love triangles but I think you can make a similar argument that love triangles actually now that I think about it it feels like fewer UK shows even have love triangles to start with that they feel particularly tired in television shows where the same conflicts seem to keep playing out over and over but with slightly different excuses for them starting. Movies and nonserial novels can breeze along at a more appropriate pace or at least Ive always enjoyed love triangles more in that context.I actually disagree with the articles author about Veronica Mars though. I think the love interests are wellpaced and the writers kept the story interesting. Veronicas original love interest in Season  was Duncan setting aside Troy Logan wasnt really a possibility until the end of Season  and DuncanVeronicaLogan plays out for about half of Season  and is a bit of a quadrangle with Meg finishing when mild spoiler Duncan leaves the show because he and Veronica have zero chemistry. Veronica is then with Logan for a while which has a fair bit of interesting character stuff since Logan has no real family of his own left and when the story possibilities for that relationship start running out midSeason  the writers break them up although maybe not in the most plausible way. Its true that the viewers know that Piz is never really a rival for Logan but it still manages to be interesting as a story because Veronica is working so hard to convince herself that she and Piz could really work. She is trying to wish herself away from that life in Neptune away from the poisonous er divide into a new life and Piz could be that life. Except of course he really couldnt which is what the movie made so obvious.Again this is getting long but in the noir world of Veronica Mars Logan is the Femme Fatale. Veronica lives on the wrong side of the tracks and rich er Logan walks into her life and brings nothing but trouble. She might try to get away from the P.I. life in Neptune with a guy like Piz but places like Neptune and guys like Logan always drag her back to them. Of course its possible to subvert tropes and do something different but the excitement of Veronica Mars what drives the story forward isnt will she end up with Piz or will she end up with Logan. Those guys represent two completely different lives and a decision about where Veronica is destined to end up and what she is meant to be doing. She will end up with Logan because she is meant to be somewhere like Neptune fighting for the little guy against corruption. But will she survive living in Neptune andor being with Logan or will they destroy each other in that messed up world that they live in?,ToastCrumbs,d77gz43,4,t5_3el8t
9002217,0,t3_53i8zu,ok ranting again I ranted on clevermankas blog too so if you have read it you can skip it. Short version Daughter wanted to go back to church. We havent been she misses her friends. At  she is signed up for the Our Whole Lives program basically sex ed focusing on maturity acceptance of differences and learning how to talk about things.  She was at exs that weekend he took her to the orientation meeting. I signed her up so I went to get the info there was a parent meeting and a kid meeting. So we are in the meeting and Im trying my best to ignore him and sit next to my other friend. He makes sure to sit where I have to look at him  fucking years and he still stalks me any time we are in the same place.  He starts bragging and trying to get in with the facilitators. Bragging about being trained  years ago in O.W.L.  but trying to weasel out of admitting he never actually taught a class.  He was rude and inappropriate and stupid and I had luckily brought extra school work to edit and also wrote nasty notes to my friend her ex was also abusive and we were snarky.  Until halfway through I remembered when he got the OWL training.  weeks after I had a miscarriage on a pregnancy he caused through birth control sabotage and had a uterine infection afterward and by that weekend I was septic. My friend called and heard my voice and mental state and drove me to the ER immediately. He refused to leave the training and wouldnt answer the phone after I called from the E.R. The fucking sociopath was sitting in a room with me bragging in front of my face about when he left me alone with a lifethreatening illness.  days and  dampcs later they finally were able to turn the infection around and Im here now but I almost wasnt. And to him its just a chance to be swarmy and kiss up to someone.,ToastCrumbs,d7txdnp,7,t5_3el8t
9233092,0,t3_56tpqk,So.  This year the old lax coach is coming back and my schedule is worse and his schedule is better for team enrollment so I wont be coaching. Neither will the other momI singlehandedly kept this team alive for the first year and she and I did last year. Now its going back to an allmale coach environment. Now there are still  girls one of whom is the best  on the team who will want to play this spring.The one assistant coach is a college kid who played in high school. His sister was on my team the first year.  She tried as a HS freshman to be on the LAX team but really couldnt deal with being the only girl.  This girl is the kind of girl whos physically and mentally so tough that when I punished the team with pushups I had to make sure she was in sight or shed try to do them on her broken arm. That team cohort was an awful group worse than lax bros lax bros plus just misbehaving feedback loop kids. I can see why she quit.So the team this year will be led by all guys. I suggested that L come back to the MS and be an informal coachhelperthat would help her self esteem and give the girls someone on their side in that allmale environment. It would also help keep the antibullying feminist vibe we worked hard to build last year in play.  Head coach is worried girls didnt feel welcome wants specific examples!!!!!UGH.  How do I communicate to him that its the whole environment that needs to support the WHOLE team and just the presence of a female authority figure on the team is worth  x any motivational speech he can give? I am working with my other coach on how to make sure we keep a woman on the coaching side even just informally.  Give me words to say. Please.,ToastCrumbs,d8md1jr,6,t5_3el8t
