10961135,0,t3_5wh4fw,It makes a lot of Lucios fundamentals easier. Sometimes it will behave unpredictably but thats Lucios wall ride anyway. Its better to stick to a wall randomly than to fall randomly.,luciomains,deakaqz,1,t5_3ejub

11053277,0,t1_dekkiym,I have the same problem. I literally stopped playing comp after season  because people dont protect the healer. Between genjireaper dives getting ignored and teams trickling I just cant take it. I was top  lucios season . Season  I placed  and proceeded to lose every game down to . I will not solo queue again until I have a  man team. That may be never and Im fine with it. I dont need cancer in my life.,luciomains,dekvc03,3,t5_3ejub

11062114,0,t1_delv1bm,I never talked to you as if youve never played Lucio. Like I said your teammates are there to protect you but in the case they cant you can still escape. Its also not an excuse to not protect the healer. Its simply saying if you cant protect the healer the healer has options to escape or fight back. If they didnt the meta would be drastically different. Whenever I play DPS I make damn sure I protect our healer but when I cant I expect them to be fine if its one flanker. You having been top  doesnt give you a right to look down on people for expressing valid opinions and points. Also...gt Editgt gt You know what no. You v Genji and Pharah as Lucio. And win.gt gt Not survive.gt gt Win.gt gt I want to see it.Nowhere did he say Lucio is supposed to beat a v Genji and Pharah. He said and I quote Literally all of his abilities help him survive and get away. Not You can beat flanking DPSes as Lucio thanks to his amazing kit. Just wanted to point out a completely invalid point seeing as how you took what he said and made it into something he didnt.Final point how the hell did you drop from top  to  from S to S? Not even being a dick here its a legitimate question I have.,luciomains,delvf8c,3,t5_3ejub
11068823,0,t1_demm2tw,Exactly this. Instalock him and dont do anything the whole match except try and look cool and do something they saw off YouTube.Edit also been branching out a bit more. Been trying out more Mei alongside DVa and DVa of course needs heals a lot and when my Lcio is off speed skating behind enemies and trying to reach skylimit on Kings Row its not that helpful.,luciomains,demn2p1,2,t5_3ejub
11083846,0,t3_5y9jky,I duod with a buddy who runs a very good Zen for about  games yesterday.  of those games the people we queued in with were up for running a dive and it was incredibly fun. It was fortunate that only  person total didnt have a mic in those  games first time thats happened in the history of overwatch I think but it is a viable comp as we won those four games three being an absolute walk.  Even with our lack of hitscan we came across a pharmercy in one of those matches and we basically played around her or collapsed the discorded mercy as soon as she was out of position.  The most fun ive had on Overwatch in a while but that might be because I hate Bastion and wasnt a huge fan of  tanks.,luciomains,deoceec,1,t5_3ejub
11111508,0,t1_der7nz1,Communication and team coordination is key with lucio. Inform your team when you switch to speed and amp it up to let them know when to push. If your good at wallriding you can also get a quite good view of the battlefield which allows you to spot all the flankers.The most important thing imo is when and who to boop though.  Boop Rein at the right time Callout for coordinated teamshot  ??? Profit ,luciomains,derhah0,6,t5_3ejub

11547256,0,t1_dg4srzf,I think the intention is to use his increased mobility speed boost on wall ride in order to run around selectively healing more rather than barely healing the whole team,luciomains,dg4vtxj,14,t5_3ejub

11712055,0,t1_dgnjtp5,How much space you have for your mouse is going to be a big factor in your sensitivity and whether you move your mouse with your wrist or full arm. Having enough room to  is practically required in my mind.I cannot stress how much better I started playing when I gave my mouse and hand a less cramped playing space.I think for lucio your sensitivity should be high enough that you never underturn a corner youre wallriding. Also high enough to track an enemy in a hectic close quarters fight.,luciomains,dgnla8b,1,t5_3ejub

11767032,0,t3_67vygu,gtWhen do i healspeedamp now?Same as beforegtHow  wallride for great speeds?the burst of speed will happen when you JUMP of a wall or it ends if you let the button release you will fall without speed. Just remmember to do an extra click when wanting to leave a wall ride and master the double taps mouse well is great to double tapsgtWho do i focus if i want to play aggressive?Supports are a great play if you can flank. You can also kill tanks with ease or even DPS. Just avoid combat with heroes that have an advantage in close combat versus you. Genji Pharah Junkrat Mei TorbTurret Reinhardt Winston Symmetra. You can kill those but they have an advantage in a v combat or even the combat will take to long to be usefull.gtAnd WHEN do i play aggressive?When you see and wounded enemy running When a single hero is giving your team trouble or blocking a passage and youre sure that you can get him When you know that the enemy mercy have ult and she will be hiding next fight go to her first.gtWhen do i ult?Same as beforegtAs lucio what should i point out to my teammates in voice chat?Everything that maybe usefull an enemy flanking enemy ults to chase a enemy to aim in a specific enemy. This is basic Shot Calling Lcio had a great advantage in doing this now is just a little harder.gtWhat heroes should i be wary of nowJust dont try to close combat Reinhardt Symmetra Winston Junkrat Mei a torb with turret and a good reaper. Those you kill with distance and hi ground if possible. Some fights arent worth fighting also like Genji Tracer Pharah RoadHog or other Lcio is best to ignore those because the time spent trying to kill them could be used to kill more important targets.gtand how to deal with the current most annoying one pharah?Pharah isnt your job is a job for the front line DPS but if they arent being able to deal with her maybe swith to Zen this way you can discord and help to kill her.gtWhen do i NOT play lucio?Lcio can work every where but he could be traded by other heroes usually Lcio is best to attack and Control sometimes on defense you can use ZenSymmetraTorbjorn or other thing in order to protect the pointpayload. Speed isnt that important on Defense.gtAlso ive found myself to be great on KOTH maps but only average in attack and lacking in defense for other maps. Any tips for that?Yes Keep practicing Lcio have his advantage on KOTHcontrol to be usefull on attackcp a well used speed and taxi work is the best thing you can do. On Defense and Payload Lcio lose a little about his shine he can work but you can find easier heroes to do the job.,luciomains,dgttnm7,9,t5_3ejub
