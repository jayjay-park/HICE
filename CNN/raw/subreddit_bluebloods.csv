We dont really know what he was going to say but if the interaction between Frank and Garrett was any indication he was going to speak to the fact that most negative views of police are rooted in what people see on TV instead of actual interactions with them and that most cops are not bad people but there are a few bad apples. To me this last episode wasnt trying to put off a cops as victims vibe as much as an equality vibe. IIRC Frank said something along the lines of They claim to be all about free speech until its something they dont want to hear.,bluebloods,cx4bi74,3,t5_2s5mw

One episode they seemed to click really well I think they kissed but not sure I know they hugged though but the producers of the show almost never put relationship drama in this show. Its kinda weird and it sucks because these two seem like they would make a really good couple. ,bluebloods,cxwi844,1,t5_2s5mw
