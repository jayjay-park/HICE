I just wanted to tell you that most people I know dont actually pay attention to body types as much as youd think!

If your looking for starter stuff to get Id go to Joanns online store and price yourself out some stuff youd like to get the next time you go to the store so you know about how much youll spend on that. Id get a better idea of where to direct you if I knew the cosplays you were interested in. But for the most part most cosplays can be done with just a simple sewing machine scissors measuring tape fabric and a pattern. ,cosplayers,cgiph72,2,t5_2tocz

959451,0,t1_chda9oj,Its made out of a wood base that I cut into a heart shape and then rounded out with a belt sander then used magic sculpt bondo would work though and be cheaper to get the symmetry more precise. I probably would have been better off using that super dense yellow foam you find at hobby shops instead of the wood though. For the ridges I used vinyl tubing cut in half so that they would be uniform. Everything else was just a matter of sanding and drawing with very careful measurements. The horns are cast resin so that I could get them to be uniform without painfully sanding and comparing  horns. Making them identical that way would... suck.The heart shape alone is cm wide which is pretty huge. When you look at pictures of skull kid you can see that its really big on him the heart shape going from shoulder to shoulder. It feels weird to have it so large but I remind myself that its a kid sized person wearing an adult sized mask so the proportions are just like that.To get the curvature of the basic shape right I HIGHLY recommend a contour gage like this. pressing it down makes the pins take the shape of whatever object youre pressing it against so then you can compare that curve to the opposite side and see if you need more or less material. I would have saved so much time had I bought one earlier. Also if you can be sure to print a picture or a few in real size on the huge printers at kinkos or something. A lot of people get the heart shape pretty wrong just by doing it by eye being able to make stencils and hold up your shape to the real one is helpful. Youll also be able to measure the image for sizing things like spacing line width and eye size. But print it without a lot of saturation I ran in to problems trying to measure stuff that was just too dark. Accuracy counts!Good luck I hope that helps and ask any more questions if you have them!

1441214,0,t3_2al19g,So I scale my makeup up or down depending on my character.  A more rough and tumble type guy obviously doesnt get as much as a bishonen or female.  Remember to always start your makeup routine with a freshly washed face and an application of moisturizer appropriate for your skin type.st lets briefly cover the why for those unaware of the benefits.  Sorry OP if you find this patronizing.  Skip ahead to the next paragraph if you already know why makeup is suggested for guys in cosplay.  In your costume Im sure you want to make a good impression in the hall and in pictures.  Makeup will help with this because it will Reduce oily shine from natural oils. Bring out facial features that get diminished in pictures or poor lighting eyes eyebrows skeletal contours etc especially with colorful costumes and wigs. Even out skin tone scars birthmarks acne redness tan lines etc adjust skin tone to be more complimentary to your wig color or closer to character. Recontour your face to closer resemble charactersAll these factors means the makeup type amount and technique required is pretty variable from person to person costume to costume even convention to convention.I would say that bare minimum is a matte loose powder I use Maybelline Shine Free and a brown eye liner any basic pencil that glides on works but I use Sonia Kashuk gel liner  Make sure these are applied to a clean moisturized face.  These  products will take care of the top two bullet points above.  Powder will knock down the shine and allow you to control it as it pops up during the day.  Brown eye liner will bring out your eyes without being as dramatic and obvious as black eyeliner.  The eyeliner can also double as a brow pencil but I use a brow specific pencil most of the time for natural colors.Suggested tools for these products?  The loose powder will come with a puff that you can use to apply.  I would suggest a Fan Brush or Powder Brush to knock off any extra powder that gets deposited.  For the pencil you should only need a sharpener some even come with one.  I just have a cheap hole metal sharpener I picked up at an art store.  If you want to use the pencil on your eyebrow a spoolie brush will help even out the distribution of product.  If you chose the gel liner it will probably come with a inch long angled detail brush.  It works but I found the bristles very stiff and the handle too short to get my hand out of the way so I can see what Im doing in the mirror.  I picked up a longer handled synthetic fiber angle brush to replace it and have been quite happy.  Only other tool I can suggest is cotton swabs to slightly smudge the edges of your eyeliner to make it more natural looking.Before I get too far an important concept for you starting out is that you want products that have a matte finish.  If they dont youll get flash reflection in pictures with and look lighter you know when you see to pictures of women where their face looks  shades lighter than their neck and body thats flash reflecting back at the camera.  Shinyreflective properties in make up is not always apparent when buying or even applying.  Steer clear of products with names like luminous dewy illuminating radiant or brightening.  Other words that are tricky descriptors but more of a crap shoot are color correcting or satin maybe some others that I cant think of right now.  Powders both loose and pressed are notoriously tricky about this.  Eyeshadow is very difficult to find in matte.The next step up from bare minimum is concealer and foundation to provide coverage and color correction.  If you just have a few blemishes you want to cover a simple combination of concealer on those few spots and powder may be all you want or need.  If your powder has a bit of color as the one I linked above does it will even provide a bit of coverage.  There are multiple types of foundation and many hybrids inbetween and will probably take a few tries to find the one you like in terms of coverage color weight and finish which all tend to be quite variable even within brands.  In order of less coverage to more we have powder foundation powder to liquid liquid and cream.  I really like liquid because it tends to be buildable that is you can put on a layer let it set and dry then add another layer if you need more coverage.  While I use primarily budget or drugstore bands for my makeup I to get spendy with my foundation and dont regret it one bit.  I use MAC Studio Fix and will likely buy more when I run out.  I have a couple of different shades that I use to change my complexion to go with blonde wigs.  Im naturally black haired so blonde white or pink takes some work.  It will take some playing around to figure out what you need for a specific costume but I use the loose powder in light and medium to help me adjust lighter or darker from the two shades of foundation I have.  Beard shadow also falls into color correction.  Most beard shadow is bluish in tone.  Reach back to your middle school art class color theory and remember that orange is blues complementary color.  For our use putting one on top of the other has a cancelling effect.  I sparingly use a matte orange lipstick like NYX butter in Hot Tamale before I put on my foundation in areas where the shadow is really bad.  I much prefer taking down beard shadow with a close shave but thats because my beard shadow isnt that bad and my doubleedge razor gets much closer than an expensive ass blade monster.  Tools for foundation and concealer.  I dot on the foundation with my fingers and spread with a foundation brush  The brush can leave streaks so a blender sponge can help diminish them.  Just pounce up and down with light pressure before it sets.  Dont press and drag.  Your powder application will take care of the rest.  Do not apply your liquid foundation with a sponge unless you want to waste foundation.  Its a sponge.  Youll end up with more foundation in the sponge than on your face.  If you buy your concealer in a stick its probably all you need but mine is in a pot and I like applying it with a synthetic bristle brush for exactness and blending out the edges.  I have a lot of moles on my nose and this helps me get it on each and every one.So here we are at contouring.  Youll probably notice foundation with medium to high coverage really takes some of the depth out of your face.  It looks a little weird but can be easily corrected with a matte bronzer or dark concealer to add in shadows.  Use the bronzer or concealer to add reemphasize shadows in the hollows of your cheeks under your jawline under your brow bone etc.  Start with your own face shape and then expand your horizons. You are essentially forcing the perception of shadows and depth.  Play around with locations shapes angles to match your character.  Your character have a round face while you have a long rectangular one?  Try adding shadow at your hairline and peak of your chin to shorten your face.  Get a very light concealer and you can do even more by forcing the appearance of highlights and bringing things forward.  This is a good pallet for detail contouring and eyeshadow when youre ready to try that.  The eye shadows can be used anywhere on your face for contouring.Tools For bronzer an angled blush brush will get you some nice blend patterns and lines.  Cream concealers go on nicely with a synthetic brush or cheap wedge sponges  All said and done I suggest getting one of the brush kits from Coastal Scents ELF or Sonia Kushak. rMakeupaddiction tends to like the budget Eco Tools as well.My typical order clean and moisturize primerbb cream beard shadow concealment foundation concealer and contour powder eyes brows powder to set the eyes and brows chapstickSome resourcesGossPetriludeKevyn Aucoin Face ForwardWhew I think this is my longest post ever.

1599957,0,t3_2clnvp,A lot of people like hot glue.  I personally find it hard to get good clean seams with hot glue and any hot glue that spills out of the seam is difficult to get clean up well.  Not to mention the glue nozzle seems to be magnetically drawn to my unprotected skin.  When I build my HEV suit I tried several glues including hot glue.  What worked best for me was superglue for the main seam with major stress points reinforced with hot glue or a second layer of thin foam glued to the backside.  Of course your mileage may vary.  We all have different preferred techniques tolerances for burnt fingertips etc.  I did find that not all superglues are created equal.  I initially tried using elmers superglue and it was pretty much useless.  It was so watery it would soak completely into the foam with none left at the surface to bond together.  Zapagap superglue worked fricking great but I havent been able to find any locally anymore so for a my new projects Ive been using Locktite gel superglue and so far I really like it.,cosplayers,cjguduo,4,t5_2tocz

It should create a cast of your sneaker that you can slip right on. Also spray adhesive is a godsend.

Contact the local Red Cross and whatever the blood donation clinics are.  They often have huge rolls of stickers with red crosses and blood drops and things like that.  Kids LOVE stickers.  Headbands with stickers on them would be different and fun and the kids can make their own.How about crepe streamers?  You could get red and white and wrap the kids arms in them.  Even just the lower arms wrapped in streamers dirt cheap for rolls of it of red and white so the kids have these power arms to heal people.  You could make other parts of the costumes too maybe with dangly bits of streamer so they whoosh out the back when the kids run.  They might look like gauntlets or something.The clipon LED finger things that uNotAYam mentioned wouldbe fantastic if theyre in the budget.

5330525,0,t1_cvr9l14,yes quite often! when Im at a con i coat the wig about  times a day and brush it through it keeps it really nice and the moisture prevents the wig from being electrically charged and flying all over the place ,cosplayers,cvt19b5,2,t5_2tocz
5648694,0,t3_3sd679,Spandex comes in different weights fibers and finishes.  Youre going to want a medium to heavy weight with a  way stretch.As to fibers know that cotton breathes and nylon wont.  However nylon is shinier and fades less.  There are pros and cons to both but sewing either requires the same techniques.  If youre using a regular sewing machine sew your seams with a slight zigzag stitch with a ball point needle or a needle especially made for knits.  Using a regular needle can cause skipped stitches or cause runs in the knit.  If your lycra curls at the edges after you cut it give your pieces a good ironing with starch.  Finally have a fabric website,cosplayers,cwx9x6k,2,t5_2tocz

10924989,0,t1_de6pr42,That would work!  A couple of quick tips.  Hair doesnt grow downward it grows outward and sags.  Dont try and glue to sideways attach the roots to the skin and let it sag.  if it needs to be tighter trimcomb if afterward.  .  Using  different types of hair color adds so much.  ,cosplayers,de6u4cu,1,t5_2tocz
