While what the other users said is true about the low population the server creators are making a big campaign around their new realm Algalon.Algalon The WotLK Progressive Realm Release February th  DalaranWoW.Were you searching about one progressive realm based in WotLK with stunning quality and with the blizzlike feeling and essence of the old times? The private server DalaranWoW releases their second realm on February th Algalon. That will be the first and unique progressive realm out there. Make your home here.Official Website Facebook  Youtube  Once its released itll be as close to retail as a server can get with great scripts and being the only progressive litch king realm out there. Ive been playing their Kirin Tor realm for awhile and have nothing but good things to say about it. Once Algalons launched itll be a good rival for blizzard itself.,wowservers,cf493mc,2,t5_2t61d

You may be lonely in the  ranks but I level  have been running dungeons using RDF and have a guild that has  people online around the clock. Alliance side guild is Angry Conglomerate.Keep in mind that the huge population increase that dalaran has been seeing is all leveling at the moment. If you do some whos with level values you will see that there are a TON of low amp mid range level characters. The new molten converts which if you talk to people you will see there are a lot of havent had time to level up yet.

Before the item change actual good gear for casters was quite scarce and difficult to get while items for melee were still plentiful enough. Items with spell power before raid gear were rare and barely even existent on gear before level . On launch melee classes such as warriors and especially rogues were too strong relative to other classes. I know that a big part of that was the talent balancing for all the classes that came in I think . but the preraid gear available was a part of that as well. I do think its admirable though that they are sticking as close as possible to Blizzards original game I just think this is a bit over the top and will might cause frustration for some people.

You will encounter bugs here and there while questing or doing dungeons but most stuff works fine and their change log is pretty impressive. Important bugs like someone found a bug where class X does too muchtoo little damage often get fixed on the same day. Every single man dungeon from vanilla to cata works and all the raids up to . are available too. Only the Sunwell raid is closed right now Ive heard.As others have pointed out at EU evenings the server has about .k players which is pretty good. Even as a DPS you can queue for a random dungeon and play one in like  minutes meanwhile especially tanks get instainvites thats pretty comparable to retail.  At NA evenings most EU players probably already have gone to bed so finding dungeon groups while leveling may be harder but at level  you should find enough players to do stuff.  There are at least  NA guilds on alliance side la cosa nostra and prestige worldwide  the later actively looking for more players right now in world chat raid times  server time EST.

After Nostalrius and Kronos launched we decided to focus on the TBC. Why havent all the  mans been released yet? We go through every instance and try to make it blizzperfect. That takes some time. If you wish to question the quality feel free to log ingame and ask thr the players themselves. Our community understands that Quality  Quantity that is why they still play there despite not having all the content handed out to them.

4649300,0,t3_3el3mk,Mostly the mechanics. Personally Im not playing on primal because I greatly prefer TBC mechanics. For example think of a typical trash pack in a heroic dungeon for example. In TBC warriors had a hard time with AOE threat couple that with the fact that mobs in heroics tended to hit very hard if you werent raid geared. So often CC and a kill order was used it added another dimension to tanking as a warrior because you had to plan out many of the trash packs based on the abilities of the individual mobs. In wrath warriors had much better AOE threat and all tanks had greater survivability so this disappeared and dungeons mostly reverted to gather everything and AOE it down.,wowservers,ctglutk,3,t5_2t61d

5605442,0,t3_3rvrkh,Speaking as a Lordaeron playerServer overworld scripting is pretty good things that are truly game breaking get fixed in a swift fashion thanks to the heavily used bugtracker.In terms of raid content no one truly knows how well it will be scripted because no one gives a fuck how bad the Vanilla TBC raid scripts are since they are just a buffer for the server to gain more hype and everyone to have a level  character when Wrath hits so its even MORE hype.From what I understand WK core is pretty easy to script and since Lordaeron is heavily scripted by the AT members and not the Molten we can confirm PVP  Arenas are going to be top notch  scripted. Im sure if they put their minds to it it will be THE wrath server to play on and if you were considering rolling a toon I would do so now as it will be incredibly easier to level now while  of the server is in TBC phase while the Vanilla phase area is opened up for you.Wrath phase people will be swarming the noobie zones and it will be considerably harder to level again. c,wowservers,cwrwqs1,8,t5_2t61d
5628099,0,t1_cwufhct,Corecraft isnt exactly a great metric for measuring how long it takes to develop a server.  As for Nost ifwhen they make it is when theyre done with vanilla content and they come to the decision to A open a new progressive server to give people something to do or B continue on as is hinted at in the links only provided.,wowservers,cwupwtn,2,t5_2t61d
5661615,1,t3_3skqf3,Ultimately not very good.Lets start with the positives. It might sound stupid to spam LFG groups for dungeons. The social element is there but you have some time delays... but its not actually that bad. Because the population is so much higher gathering a group is relatively fast  particularly if you can tank. Same goes for quests getting some help for that quest thats literally furthest away from all meaningful civilization was actually possible. Great!Scripting is passable. I mean there are plenty of issues but most of the bugs I remember experiencing back in vanilla as well. Some of the issues are pretty glaring though particularly in instances. However it never gets too bad. ST and DMW are examples of instances that have bugs in them you can still run them but its less than perfect. The raid encounters work fine so far.Then well... I should say the worse things.Initially I thought there would be three kinds of people. One kind who would have played WoW in the past and wanted to relive the experience again hardcore or casual. Secondly people from retail who wanted to see how the game used to work. Thirdly people whove never played the game before.I wasnt expecting the fourth kind. The kind who have played on private servers over and over again and do so in a hardcore fashion. They minmax everything down to raceclass combinations. It just brings out the issue with an old game like this. Everyone knows what to do and if they dont its easy to find out what to do. They joined the server at release and have already cleared everything.Also while instances are certainly more manageable with more people around there are downsides. The world was never designed for k people. I played on a PvP server and it wasnt this bad. All the popular areas are overpopulated. Ganking or just griefing is very common particularly in lowlevel zones by people from the fourth category. Its not unmanageable there are still less obvious zones to quest in but sometimes less is better.Economy is garbage. On my server back in retail vanilla Golden Pearls werent commonly being sold for around g. Ive managed to sell one for g and some other people gamed the auction house to try and sell them at a higher price but generally the value is just poop and there are plenty of them on AH. Then again when you go into Arcane Crystals youre expected to pay g a pop... not to mention what some herbs cost. I did quests in UnGoro and I never saw a single devilsaur in a highpop blizzard vanilla server I did manage to see them quite often. People just know all too well what pays the bills right now and what everybody wants so they go to extreme lengths to ensure they get what they bargain for. Replies are hilarious since I doubt Blizzard wouldve left this crossfaction companionship at that back in the day.So if you dont want to pay overly high prices for basic commodities you can go and mine your own Arcane Crystals right? Well think again the node spawns were bugged for days which also skyrocketed prices but even in their presumably fixed state some veins are still in unreachable locations and youre probably hardly going to find anything. Its not just the rarity and value that sucks its that gathering professions altogether just very much blow and you dont enjoy trying to find additional veins when every zone seemingly has like  nodes. For the longest time the nodes spawned in exactly the same places with exactly the same mineral too dont know if that has changed. And dont even talk about raidclass consumables things get very ugly in that case to the point where Id wonder whether if Nostalrius themselves had their hand in the goldselling business.Overall what I feel that Nostalrius has taught me is that going to instances on bigger servers that have  population is very easy thing to do and tends to go relatively smoothly. However anything outside of those damn portals tend to be relatively scarce or barren depending on the value of the zone. Blizzard never designed their servers with this many people with more knowledge about the game than what they hd themselves. Vanilla is still a flawed game and to me it just shows a lot of potential and what couldve been if they took this into a different direction with expansions rather than being the absolute high peak of wow.,wowservers,cwyvm6w,0,t5_2t61d

But Im just posting from my experience and experience of others that I know so just think of me as objective of a camera looking from one angle I cant get the whole story.English thing is like that yeah. It will be hard for you to find english people because its  a polish server and right now with  very popular English servers itll be hard to find English people there.All in all its a good server no doubt decent scripts as well. But should you play on it? In my opinion no. Various reasons including staff members that have been literally fired from other servers for being bad shoddy practices and overall no professionalism. The other major reason being is lack of English population. I know people will say that players will come but I honestly doubt so theres  very big servers with lots of population and when you really come down to it and calculate all the odds it would be a weird decision to do so.Im going to refrain from suggesting you a server. I will just list you the servers you have on disposal other than Sunwell.  GamerDistrict  decent population decent scripts lots of custom content though and features you might not like they sell gear  DalaranWoW  decent population decent scripts website is not good with functions and stuck on one tier for a long time they dont sell gear  Warmane  huge population scripts seem to be fine so far on Lordaeron good ticket response times and etc they sell gearI think Ive been objective as much as possible I usually would shill for the server of my choice but I think in reality its up to you that will choose where to play.,wowservers,cxnm04n,-4,t5_2t61d

Not a major time sink x xp is incredibly fast which can be a downside if you enjoy the levelling process otherwise its super nice for someone who generally doesnt get consecutive hours of time in game. Tons of bugs but theres usually a way to get out of it and worse case scenario theyve got a control panel on the webpage that basically brings you back to a state before the bug. Community is angsty at best and primarily RU but if you can get through that PvP is goodish and PvE is doable if you can create a group.Long and the short There are just now starting to be good Cata and Panda servers expecting a phenomenal WoD server while WoD is still going in is unrealistic but if you can deal with knowing that you might still have a good time.,wowservers,cz2dcfz,1,t5_2t61d

Like very heavily as in he stripped out many key systems entirely but its not new new as in he wrote absolutely everything from the ground up. I dont know if I have this straight since Im not educated on that sort of thing.All content will be open from the beginning. The justification for this if you dont want to watch his video is quite sound  first TBC is naturally gated so going directly into Black Temple from dungeons is impossible. Second badge gear will be restricted so that guilds cannot get IQD epics from early raids so progression will be naturalistic. Third and most important he feels the need to prove that the realm can deliver everything immediately as soon as people are ready for it. I think this model has a huge advantage over the staggered release model myself because unlike doing this in Vanilla where AQ and ZG . gear would completely trivialize early man content everything in TBC is attunement gated.Leveling is custom... somehow. It doesnt sound like they have the specifics about it down but its not just a rates increase and the developer sounds like hes concerned about a smooth progression. Id assume its just a sexy rate increase  such as making specific quests more valuable or adjusting rest XP to increase gold values or something  because what else could it be? It doesnt sound like theyre making custom leveling content ala Corecraft.,wowservers,czheyyv,5,t5_2t61d

The amount of money is depending on how much money the server will make were planning on investing all money made back to the players and of course the server rent. Due to the fact that players are starting with item level  Naxxramas will be slightly retuned only the wing endbosses to assure that the raid will be a challenge and not just facerolled. Also we will develop one custom instance for  players with every tier that is released which will award  Man loot so smaller guilds are also able to gear up.

You also didnt google the domo fight theres a TON of vanilla strats detailing getting  healerselites low then killing them together. The only thing that heals is the HEALERS CASTING HEAL and Domo healing himself to full. Next time use google before posting because this post just REEKS of bullshit.

Currently my guild oneshots every boss in naxx but when we first got started our speed was  evening per boss... you saw that correct a whole evening  hours of wipes until we kill  boss on the next day same thing  hours wiping for  boss day after that same some of the bosses were a bit easier a couple of times we got lucky and killed  bosses for the evening the result was  days of everyday raiding for  bosses but the week after that we were already killing  bosses for  days the next week it got to  bosses for a day and so on currently we clear all the naxx  for  hours Your guild was just not prepared for a hardcore raiding you really need to be above average PVE player to successfully raid NAX.VOA tho is completely unbuffed and original so that you can raid with our maxed tanks if you still havent deleted the game,wowservers,d14j1uy,0,t5_2t61d

It just made more sense where you had to go next and a lot of the extraneous quests were trimmed. Vanilla with its level  mount and being goldbroke all the time was too much for me.Third I would recommend Atlantiss for cata or Lordaerondalaran for wotlk. Atlantiss has by far the most frequent updates and bugfixes  probably every  days and the best vision for the future. They have a progress through the expansions tbcgtwotlkgtcata server in the works and mists of pandaria in the far future. Its one of the few servers where you can actually finish a zones questline.

We will host the Vanilla realm fron Nostalrius on our realms we will allow players to merge their Nostalrius account with their account for free and we will allow them to copy their character from the Vanilla realm to other of our realms in WotLK Cata MoP or WoD also for free.

7201101,0,t3_4e1ge3,Blocking off content until you unlock it or want it availible is relatively easy.Like to block off Onyxias Lair I would add map thats the wotlk Onyxias Lair map to the table accessrequirement and set it to one level higher than max level until I wanted it availible.Spells can also be disabled very easily.If I wanted divine storm or whatever talentspell disabled I would add it to the table disables same with quests added before the patch I want to be on. You could also add maps to the disables table I guess never tried doing it that way as I wanted maps to still be available to GMAdmin  accounts.Events like the Scourge Invasion event or AQ opening are very hard to do because full sniffs of those events are pretty rare or just non existant.No core Ive ever seen has them scripted working or even spawned by default.  When servers like nost or we server does them its because they scriptedspawned the entire event themselves.About readding attunement items.. Pending on the attunement you can just add the quest into the accessrequirement table for that raidinstances map.  Some items would need to be added back into boss loot tables.Some quest edits may also be required not sure.If you wanted  the MC water thing to work you would probably have to do something like this.. Delete the boss after noting its ID. Find the Gameobject ID of the rune using .gob target. make the Object targetable by changing a flag in the table gameobjecttemplate. make a smartAI script for the object that spawns the boss when the spell  is casted on it.. done probablyI have no clue about what the best core with bots is my source is to different from the latest trinity to use them and Im pretty sure the bots are broken now so making a fresh core with working bots is pretty much not happening unless the bots are completely redone.Mangos bots might still work though.,wowservers,d1wph84,1,t5_2t61d

On top of this Warmane probably has one of the best private servers period. Lordaeron is a very populated relatively bugfree server. On top of that they shut off dungeon finder which encourages a lot more communication and forces more people out into the world.

All they had to do and yes this is oversimplifying cause they did tons of work was to recreate the scripting and fix any bugs to turn it back into exactly the way it already was once.That doesnt require much of a vision aside from guys just make it as faithful as possible to what was already made.,wowservers,d26imtt,1,t5_2t61d

And how is the server nonblizzlike? I know youre probably shilling but these guys are actually trying here and your shitposting promotes no intelligent discussion. The only point that has some weight is that they have a large Polish population.

7364151,0,t1_d2f90dd,Im just saying Blizzard has a lot of money yes different laws cant easily mesh well and if Blizzard did take another private server host to court it wouldnt take days to weeks it could take months but if Blizzard really cared to stop it then they will find a way they have so much money and probably a lot of excellent lawyers they can dispatch to protect their IP is it fair for the gamers? No its not as recent events has shown but is it fair for Blizzard? of course. If WoW as an IP gets abandoned or Blizzard say were done heres the code then that is legal do you really think Blizzard are dumb enough to let every other country in the world get a hand on their IP? Nostalrius knew that if they were to fight back and Blizzard made their way to be in a court room they would lose and this could had ended a lot of their livelihoods when they meant no harm to Blizzard. They made the right move and stopped it before it got ugly. I dont know a lot about the law and I have no facts but I really dont doubt for a second that Blizzard do not have the power to do what they want. Its like trying to put Valve in court are you crazy?

Later I played wotlk cata mop and wod.When I tried Nostalrius it was the first time I had fun in WoW in in years.

7399807,0,t3_4gnznu,HE DID NOT TEST SHATTEREDWOW as the beta isnt open yet.  However I would like to give you all my two cents copy pasted from another thread    Im not advertising it or anything just feel like it might be a good contender in the current scene.    In terms of quality it seems very good as he fixes bugs that is mostly untouched by other servers   Proper spellcaster AI LoS etc   Water elemental is working OMG O O   Blinking is very blizzlike   Trashmob linking   Proper pathing of a target being sheepedfeared  The developer has released videos that shows this quality of scripting.    The developer seems very mature and professional.  The server is also based on his old server also named ShatteredWoW which means the basics of all raids are done and I believe they will be in great shape at launch.  Also its instant .  Beta in  weeks release will be shortly after that.    I really believe in the project but I will wait for the dust to settle  before chosing a home.  If the server has raid content that is somewhat scripted then it is instantly better than LG. As LGs selling point was the raidcontent being done. But they have a lot of other issues.    HOWEVER when that is said. We cant possibly know that this mean that a lot of the content and other issues is working  he has time focusing on those bugs.  Ooooor he is just fixing those bugs to grab attention.    My two cents.,wowservers,d2jb535,1,t5_2t61d

I think the LoLcommunity like toxicity just needs to die down and both sides need to stop attacking each other in general.Best example is the video where someone compares the gameplay of vanillawhich was the SS vs TM battle during early Nos and garrison stuff on retail. The whole SS vs TM part was a fucking mage spamming blizzard all the way down  not more interesting than spamming right click to open the garrison table.I know it is just there to mock the retailers but one party has to stop this circlejerk.

Negative would have to be flying mounts as it killed world pvp. For that Vanilla is still best.

There are glaring issues that have been reported and discussed for almost a year on Kronos and nothing has been done or very little. The Nostalrius devs were infinitely more attentive to the technical side of the servers maintenance. Playing a Warlock here is much more painful than it was on Nostalrius due to the number of pet issues and from what I can see they have all been exposed for a long time with no apparent work towards a fix just as an example. Im also not a fan of the new scripting unique to Kronos namely the LoS overhaul and mob behaviorability alterations. But thats more personal preference than anything. ,wowservers,d2o728k,4,t5_2t61d

Simply that there are tremendous operational challenges to integrating classic servers not to mention the ongoing support of multiple live versions for every aspect of WoW.  ampnbspWe are not playing on legacy servers. We are playing on bugfilled lightweight emulated simulations of legacy servers. There is alot more that goes into the entire infrastructure of a retailready MMO server that is not present in ANY of these approximations no matter how good some of them may seem. Also Nostalrius which so many of you seem to hold up as the standard took them  years of development on a core system that was already in development for years just to make it ready for release to the public and it still wasnt done. Whats comical is thinking that it would be as simple as tossing some code on a server and thinking theyd be good to go. It would take YEARS of work to get legacy servers ready.

7573802,0,t1_d332fu4,I apologize for your experience. We have taken great measures to prevent a repeat of what you have experienced. You need to remember that back then there was  staff members doing EVERYTHING involved with operating the server. Now we have over a dozen staff members with  dedicated developers allowing us to work more efficiently on multiple fronts.You can clearly see this in the last month how far we have come and the fixes we have brought. Our team has now settled into its new rhythm now and I could not be more pleased. Morale is high staff are not getting burnt out and we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.We all know TBC in general is in a disastrous state. Everyone expects a perfect blizzlike experience and have been spoiled with the state of Vanilla and WOTLK  years more advanced in general. This is why there have been no High Quality TBC Servers available ANYWHERE. Our goal is to change that.There is  options that can be taken  Spend years behind closed doors with no ETA in development Develop with a community who are actively trying to help improve the server and get it into a much better condition.We feel we can advance quicker by being open and available. Player can choose to enjoy their free experience or hate it because it is not what they paid for and demand perfection.Server development is not straight forward and I say say without a doubt  of community members do not appreciate what goes into making a server. I would LOVE to wake up tomorrow and say Hey guess what we are  perfect now but development is like an expedition to the top of Mount Everest. It is all about the accumulation of small victories with everyone pulling in the same direction. This is what we are doing. The team is working together in our specialties to conquer this beast one fix at a time.I find it fascinating that players all beg for developers to work together and share their data so they can make a perfect server yet when the road that must be followed for this to occur still requires small victories they constantly rage of things not working.A huge thank you goes out to players who who DO understand that it is a journey we are all taking together. As a team we can reach those goals. I am not sure where people think that negative reinforcement will achieve anything. Players have the choice to either be part of the problem or part of the solution... what do you think works better?,wowservers,d333rmm,10,t5_2t61d

Sure Star Wars Forgotten Realms series and even witcher has some nice storytelling but in the end i always choose warcraft universe from warcraft  to all the way to cataclysm or even pandaria lorewise. I drew the line to WoD. Timetravel is not for me. In any case during your warcraft  adventures if you havent already i suggest you watch full longplay of Lord of the Clans sure there is a book also.

Honestly I am only slightly simplifying it there lolIts still possible to be a good or bad arcane mage ofc and there are still elements you may find fun but as i say the spec is mostly based around raid positioning and timing things right to get the most out of your burst phases.,wowservers,d3zy3pb,2,t5_2t61d

7894277,0,t1_d430rg4,Several actually have the population available. Sometime you just have to dig. I did a little bit of looking and playing around until I settled on a server. I never played on Kronos but from what I gathered population for vanilla went . Kronos didnt try k? I hear peak on Kronos I ?? No idea really on Kronos II both have queues from what I hear? . rebirth tried briefly  peak per faction?? from what I saw seemed solid hadhas optional? x quest? exp . ... Valkyrie  at peak I think? from what I saw didnt play there super long I feel like  could be a number of different servers...this is where population starts to get smaller and deviates less in size was normally x had a boost at one point but supposedly that was abnormal did bring back pw got rid of it briefly starting right before tried it out but think it is back to pw donor type system . Magicwow  at peak x quests during beta in open beta but pretty decent for that But these are just some of my experiences. It isnt super easy to pick that perfect server for you. It would be nice if the server stats were more readily available. I would advise to be careful of those sites that you get when you google best vanilla wow server etc.whatever because some of those sites are voting sites where people more or less vote for servers and some server incentivize their players to vote in various ways so this information can be skewed from my understanding...that being said you may want to get some lists of servers to look into so this could be a place to start.

Easy to play solo or with groups a new continent to explore a new global class death knightCataclysm  rd expansionThis is the least favorite.

You open yourself up to these type of shitposts and then grab the bait.      You now have opened yourself up to letting people judge you on what is an appropriate train ride good thing you dont take the train in the U.S cause some trips take well over  hours and dont even think of taking the bus cause youd be really screwed and wrong for taking the bus instead of a plane.   I really enjoy your server and Im not going to tell you how to act on internet.   But it would behoove you and any of your team to stop posting on rwowservers that includes you too OhMyMotherGoddess.     If anything posting about VoA Stonetalon only makes things worse.   There are a few people here who are very very very angry at you right now for the Wildhammer population leaving for a gankfree Stonetalon and at this point nothing you can say or do will make them happy.   And they are making it their mission to let everyone know how badly they think they were treated.    Could things have been done different?  Maybe.  Maybe you could have just made Wildhammer a PVE realm?   Who knows but at this point all you can do is move forward because you cant undo what has been done.So why do you even want to poke the angry players at this time?   Its the internet everyone knows people can make up whatever lies they want and it will be taken as truth.   So why even bother refuting those lies when it just gets lost in a mound shitposting.Please take a break from rwowservers.

8513147,0,t3_4wbrtd,Looking at retail WoW PvE realms have in the past and are still far more popular than PvP realms are. There is from time to time a vastly overpopulated PvP realm but when you look at median population PvE realms always outpopulated PvP ones  significantly so. Theres a reason why PvE is designated as Normal by Blizzard.The reason why you see some degree of hate towards PvE realms within the private server community is because it is a very niche nerd amp hardcore group of gamers. Even casual players on private realms are hardcorenerds compared to actual casuals playing commercial mainstream games. Such a community has plenty of great characteristics but it obviously brings some issues with it as well. One of the issues is a partially very elitist mindset of people and this is what you see for example reflected in the attitude towards PvE realms.,wowservers,d65p96v,16,t5_2t61d

People are excited because. New core taken from Ascent and rewritten from the ground up for last  years not Mangos.. Rolled back item stats and witholding .. gear like Nostalrius did.. They have proof of working clustering similar to what Nost was doing before they was shut down.. Theyre dedicated to releasing with a proper patch schedule no . catch up gear or silithus revamp before ZG like on Kronos.. Theyve said that theyre going with overtuned rather than undertuned bosses to make up for . talents. Not just a flat hpdmg buff like Feenix but rewritten and retuned boss AI and abilities.. Some of the guys from Dreamstate and NOPE are on the forums it looks like the next place the big server first race is going to kick off again.. Its releasing both a PvP and PvE server on day  so most of Nosts PvE server population seems to be going there.. Its currently being alpha tested by some well known Nost players all of whom have spoken about it in glowing terms.Thats the most salient points I guess. It looks very promising so far.

Normal Dungeons are hard killing mobs is hard. its about the same as when i remember LG. You can pull maybe  more mob  but u cant pull like more than  unless ur a tank .... Heroic Dungeons are going to be really hard Mythic Dungeons will be hard Keystone Dungeons make it so it can always get harder and will require ALOT of coordination.... even challenge modes at the beginning of WoD were REALLY hard for me i could only do silver with my group.... the difficulty is still there the difference is how quickly people become familiar with content given that people are streaming and theres tons of guides etc. almost anyone can make videos now stream etc... idk the world quests are so fucking cool they give real reason to go back into the world you leveled in engage in world pvp  and you have to do alot of them in groups and all the mobs are scaling with your level so its never TOO easy...  the class identity shit is really cool  idk i mean i love private servers  but u cant ONLY play private servers you will be let down over and over and over...,wowservers,d74ew4o,3,t5_2t61d

The guilds that did make progress were not a bunch of backpeddling casuals it was closer to  people working  days a week to make onetwothree attempts in Naxx and even then it didnt guarentee success. AFAIK no guild had Naxx on farm.Dont overexaggerate just watch original footage from Naxx and you will see immolate and all the wrong debuffs on Patchwerk Hunters without consumables and wrong specs using arcane shot and serpent sting. Its all over the place. Yes Naxx had massive gear requirements but it certainly didnt help that  were fucking terrible players compared to todays standards.

There are more than enough players in the WotLK servers to conduct a much more robust survey.  votes might be impressive but its also likely not an accurate representation of what your player base wants unless you only want those  people to play on your server which is fineAlso the most successful TBC server is x rate Excalibur and the most successful WotLK server is x rate Warmanes Icecrown. Ill restate again that Lordaeron is a x server that lost almost half of its population to Icecrown after the server mage very likely because of the extremely slow progression.Im just telling like it is man all you did was fling spittle and insult me.

I am not advocating for either one but the situation is perfectly fine for both communities. Most people will return to their Nost roots on Elysium and this gives Crestfall the time to finetune their server without people breathing down their necks anymore. If Crestfall releases with the superiority that they claim then I am sure a solid amount of people will switch over to them using Elysium as simply something to hold them over.

If you want to go to a fresh server and have a fresh start and be within the first generation of tryhards and rankers and do MC and BWL for another year before seeing other content then fresh server is the one for you. Personally I cant be bothered to do MC and BWL for so long again after playing on Feenix Nost and Kronos and would just play on old Nost PvP if I didnt have a character yet on any Nost server.,wowservers,da9h0ds,1,t5_2t61d

9721776,0,t3_5e7tw1,My favorite loot system I was ever a part of was a DKP system with a few twists. DKP was awarded for time in the raid not for kills. i.e.  hours  DKP.  This was doubled for time devoted only to progression. This helps get people to show up for progression.. When an item dropped the GM or another officer if GM also wanted the piece would link it and everyone would whisper how much DKP they were willing to spend on that item.. The winner got it for the second highest bidders price  or if they were the only bidder they got it for some set minimum price ours was set at DKP. Then once all bids were in they would paste all bids into raid chat and who won the item.  This would then be posted online to guild websitegoogle docs etc for easy tracking.This method has the benefit of not crippling people horribly for getting catch up gear or for getting gear that isnt BiS.  The only issue that can possibly arise is if the leaders collude to get items for cheap but that becomes apparent quickly since officers always get items cheaply and their  shenanigans are tracked online.,wowservers,dabf5wy,2,t5_2t61d

9847707,0,t1_dar52nc,The short answer is no.  Look at PrimalWoW.  PrimalWoW is a vanilla server setup on a Wrath client.  It is obviously a Wrath realm with Wrath questlines updated.  They have buffed the raid content but the UI abilities and overall presentation of game mechanics is pretty much Wrathstyle with a Wrath talent tree.  For Blizzard to do what you are talking about and implement it properly would require a complete rewrite of the UI mechanics and not to mention there is no Vanilla quests left in the Legion.  Not since Cata.  Even some of the raids have been updated.  I hope this clarifies the subject for you.,wowservers,dar6g9a,1,t5_2t61d

9874248,0,t3_5gptwp,To be honest theres really only three viable Wrath servers to choose from and its either DalaranWoW for PvE Lordaeron for PvP and Gamer District for high rates.I can see where youre coming from however. Id jump ship and join a massive widespread Wrath server in an instant. But the reason why I think its only happening to Vanilla is partially the fact that its very easy to build hype for Vanilla servers because of nostalgia but mainly the fact that Vanilla offers a unique interactive groupbased experience that the following expansions cant really replicate. Sure in TBC and Wrath you still group up regularly for group quests and dungeons and whatnot but its nothing compared to big community effort that the gameplay was in Vanilla. There was no RDF to instantly match you with a dungeon group raid sizes were so massive that cooperation between guilds was almost always a neccesity and the sheer difficulty of leveling encouraged players to group up regardless of group quests. There was so much group work involved people actually cared about their reputation and about making friends to do content with. Of course Im still going to keep hoping that such a big Wrath server might come out some day. After all with all the big issues that the current Wrath servers seem to suffer from its about time that we get a breath of fresh air.

At the time of Noss demise we had k peaks and were more than content with it. But we willingly opened the door for players who got screwed over and gave them a home if they so chose. Most of these vocal minorities are players who bashed our project before hand chose to come play in our community that they openly bashed the same community that opened their arms and players opening their coin purses to give these players gold and bags to get a head start amp helping hand. Then were quick to cut bait and go back to their own ways. It was bound to happen with a few of them and we as a team dont care at all. You can do everything right for someone and they still wont ever be happy life lesson right there. Theres no guarantee that should the same scenario happen again that we open the gates like we once did. I personally hope it doesnt come to that because I am a firm believer in the private server community not a private server monopoly. Bottom line is simply that sometimes some people arent happy if they arent complaining. They can poop on our project as much as they like and theyre free to do so as we find it nothing short of amusing. We know that its simply the vocal minority who troll on these forums and those arent the type of players were interested in having a part of our community anyways. Were here for our community not the trolls. ,wowservers,dcmlz86,18,t5_2t61d

You then have a flat nerf to all healing done at max level which is something commonly complained about by healers there which turns the healing end game into more of a chore than feeling like Vanilla healing.Dungeon wise many of them feel inconsequential some bugs some post Vanilla nerfs that havent been reverted. As you can see from the OP uIhasben tanks pulling  groups to aoe down trash in end game  mans really isnt like Vanilla at all.Its one of those awkward things Im not sure they could ever get the balance right WotLK and Vanilla are two very different games.The biggest issue with Primal has always been the population. Its not really Vanilla so it never got the Vanilla crowd.

10638715,0,t3_5s8hsw,I tanked heroic ICC on all  tanks in wotlk on molten. At the time warriors were bugged threatwise but I was able to make it work somewhat.Anywho druid tanking is the most straightforward and probably the most fun LK requires basically a druid and a pally. Druids have the most HP by a lot and huge dodge but good mitigation as well their mobility is high charge is fun and their dps is probably the highest as well they do very well at very low gear since they dont require defense cap at middling gear they are the most mediocre. Their lack of defense cap makes gearing flexible for resist fights and they can go cat to dps on fights like sindra but the dps increase isnt that great. Their aoe is amazing.Paladins are tanky as hell they have a tendancy to go oom if you do not maintain their rotationbuffswhat have you you can find yourself suddenly oom which can ruin the fight for you to an extent and be just aggravating if you dont mess up your many buffs mana is never a problem but yeah. Buffing as a paladin is aggravating and it felt like a checklist I had to refresh ever  seconds to  minutes. They get some integral buffs a paladin is basically always welcome especially as tank. DI is very useful as is LoH and they are more easily used than Brez. Paladins bring a number of useful buffs and are also very strong against undead which theres a bit of in wotlk. Just a bit. Ret is very good and fun dps and a more enjoyable dps spec than feral.DKs are weird they feel somewhat squishy. They have certain abilities AMS which lets them basically totally by pass mechanics which can be quite strong. They can spec a number of ways depending on if everything is working on your server overall DK tanking got a lot better when cata came out DK dps is solid and fun.Warriors are extremely tanky and fun they play similar to a druid somewhat but a bit more complicated their aoe is worse and their hp is lower and they are more gear dependant but they take a hit somewhat better. Keeping shout up is similarly annoying but not as bad as pally requirements they can fill multiple buffs with shouts so theres that.This was my experience we went  hc icc but never got LK mostly because valithria was bugged so in order to get past it we needed to cheat  tank  healers  hunter  guy at the entrance misdirected and locking healers to get past was a huge chore and so while we did get past and down sindy we never got enough time on LK to get past second transition.Hope that helps.,wowservers,dddavos,2,t5_2t61d

If you are primarily interested in immersion due to number of players I guess you never played on a low pop retail realm then Icecrown is your best bet.

It depends on the licensing of this project.  Getting Blizzards source code and releasing it is definetly theft and thus illegal IF they havent allowed you to do so.  If you write your own emulator usually by blackbox testing which is LEGAL anywhere in the EU!!! it is generally legal to host the source code BUT if you are copying nontrivial code from some other project into your own you must abide the license of that project.  Forking other open source projects like TrinityCore or Mangos is perfectly fine too though again you have to abide the license they are using in this case GNU GPL.. Nope. In general hosting a private server is not illegal BUT All emulators need copyrighted material from Blizzard to function properly maps dbc etc. and thus they are illegal after all.,wowservers,ddzhx3t,2,t5_2t61d

10887741,0,t3_5vdzkw,Ultimately it shouldnt be a surprise. On all but the biggest projects donations alone likely dont cut it in terms of both running a server and paying a useful wage to senior people. I mean if you have real devs working full time knocking out new content and bug fixes do you think theyre doing it for free? I doubt it. If donations arent covering that you always have to ask where is the money coming from you can extend this outside of wow private servers but dont be too surprised when you find out how far it goes.As Ive said before Ive never had any intention of working on a private server and this has all just reinforced my suspicions as to good reasons why not. In terms of money I already have a full time job so this whole thing has always just a hobby for me. But to me its most important that if I do something good it goes into an opensource core. Then no private server shutdown can make my work worthless. It becomes available to all. While I dont get much time to play private servers I do always find it cool when I log into a new server and spot a couple of things I did.As the OP says not all are going to be like this. Id wager you can recognize the genuine ones as the smaller pop servers with a small changelog a few volunteer devs etc.Ultimately though I think people should use this whole leakgate as a chance to reflect and decide whats more important.

How about you just make a list of all that stuff on the Kronos forums and so experienced Kronos players can evaluate this. Some might be true some have been reported or fixed already and some will be disproven. If you take a look on the bug tracker Kronos top guilds regularly report issues there and those are being worked on as well. AQ is considered as the most accurate of any server to date for a reason.

11013238,0,t1_deg3fri,The gold spam started because gold spammers go where the people are. In the months before Nost got shutdown Kronos had a peak population in the low hundreds. It was barely viable. And then suddenly with its prime competitor off the market and thousands of players without a home it became the biggest player on the vanilla field. Make no mistake Kronos needed the original Nostalrius hype and its migration that followed after the seize and desist to put it back on the map. The reason Kronos players dislike Nost players is because theyre too bitter to accept that without Nostalrius their server would have been dead and so they make up a bunch of excuses to justify their baseless hate. Sure some Nostalrius players might be toxic given that that constitutes thousands of players and in your confirmation bias you might see them as a representative of the playerbase as a whole.

11143391,0,t1_deuw9ox,Hey Im a hungarian as well and ive been playing here since .So right know its premop the cataclysm content is fully working and you can run the premop exclusive Theramores Fall scenarioit was premop only on retail as well. TauriWoW launched in like  as a tbc server and its basically like retail the devs are working on the new content to release as it was on retail. Since cata we start on the latest patch but with the first content and so on. Maybe it will be a little bit unbalanced but the devs are working on it not by nerfing classes but with tweaking the basic resilience and battle fatigue.The transfer will be enabled after every realm first has been achievedwith the max lvl  because mop content is like  weeks after the international launch. And yesthe hungarians could migrate their characters to that realm but I dont think anyone would we already have cross realm bgswith the x pvp realm and with this server cr dungeonsAH and even zones are coming so i dont see why hungarians would transfer their characters.About the cross realmSo we have Taurix rates blizzlike and Warriors of Darknessx rates funpvp with vendors for professions both realms are in the same battlegroup named Area that means we have cross realm arenas and bgs.The new realm will be there as well so you can run instances battlegrounds arenas or you can just come over to Tauri with the cross realm zone feature. There will be a cross realm AH between Tauri and Evermoonthe new server but not with Warriors of Darkness of course.About levelingThe quests are actually really good i reached lvl  on my monk in  days after they became availablewith heirloom gear. The only zone that looks bad is Northrend they had a plan to rewrite whole Outland and Northrend but because of MoP some Northrend zones still need help however you can still get the Loremaster.Cataclysmolder contentThe cataclysm dungeons and raids are scripted very well. Ofc its not  blizzlike.Sadly when we switch content or expansion the devs have to make changes to make the server run with that patch so some things are fucked from the older content but surely they will fix these later.About the pvpMost of the ppl play s s wasnt that active in cataclysm and s is just dead. We used to organise Rated bgs almost every day.But here you can check the arena stats from the last season.And you can check every players stats here its hungarian but itsAchievement pointsHonorable killsFull game timeAnd someone just said that hungarians only speak a little english. Well i dont think thats true almost everyone speaks english or german here. Sadly some retards just dont like the nonhungarian ppl on the hungarian server and this is the reason i like the idea of a new international server not just making the Tauri realm international.You can find me ingame on my monkLghtnng if you have any questions with the cross chat you can whisp from any realm just write a tauri after my name.Note that im not a developer or someone from the staff maybe i know some things wrong.Oh and Evermoon is already on the realmlist,wowservers,dev3bcn,13,t5_2t61d

People posting on this reddit does not constitute a representative sample of tens of thousands of hyped players.Keep in mind that when Elysium launched it didnt have over k steady players either it only gained the ridiculous population figures drawing from Nostalrius.

11171947,1,t3_5zgbq5,One main reason I am not interested in this server is because its at ... The main problem about this patch is that there are some permanent map changes to Pandaria which can only be fixed by either using a custom patch or using ..For example actually the main reason when you first enter now the vale of eternal blossoms it will be completely destroyed and you wont have any of the original Golden Lotus questslines and daily quests. For people who dont know I am not talking here about small things which can be ignored at the beginning like the argent tournament in wrath which is a small subzone at the border of Icecrown. I am talking here about the main zone of the game which is even part of the start screen of the client.I dont know how important that is for the rest of this sub but honestly for me as someone who has played MoP from the first to the last day it is actually my favorite xpac and who mainly loves this xpac becuase of the actual outdoor content and the love to detail they put in this kinda ruins it for me. That being said I understand that projects like Mangos and Trinity Core always switch to the newest version of a xpac and drop support for the previous versions but remember At the end of the day tauri is a company where they apparently have fulltime paid devs so I dont think this is too much to ask for.EDIT Wow thanks for the useless downvotes. What a shit subredit. Srsly why do people here downvote anything to hell?

Elysium doesnt wave that same banner.  A lot of people that had faith Blizzard might be moved to create Legacy servers had their dreams bashed against a rock called Blizzcon  and Legion.  In the meantime either a person can choose to play on their realm or move on but transparency goes a long way in this community.  Doesnt matter if someone sold gold bought gold or takes donation money to pocket to earn a little revenue as long as the community knows these actions upfront than at least people can say Well we knew this was going on but we rolled there or donated here or whatever..

Personally for the first  years I was very worried about how good I was my friends always told me I was good but the reality is I was really bad. It took me the first year to learn to use CC another year to discover macros and that keybinds could be placed anywhere.  years I started to understand the basics when to CC started to understand what stats I needed and what talent points were more beneficial in PvP situations.  years I started to understand how my class worked I knew what stats worked for my class through trial and error I started to understand how other classes worked and how they were beneficial in combination with other classes more understanding of talents.  years I knew what I was doing for the most part deepened my understanding of class comps finally invited to play with high end players started to lighten up a little bit with my stubbornness and make changes based on my teams needs started to get a light grasp what it means to work as a team was finally recognized as a skilled player by much more skilled players stopped caring about how skilled others saw me became slightly cocky. Present day I see areas I need to really work on such as communication need to fine tune my use of CC and CDs especially in conjunction with my teammates need to work on advanced use of macros. Most fights I win nowadays the ones I lose Ill make mental notes of where I made error and try to improve them. I no longer play competitively as PvP had grown continually worse since Cataclysm MoP wasnt too bad actually WoD was the last straw. Havent heard good things about Legion PvP and private servers just have too much wrong with them for me to ever consider taking PvP seriously on them. Raiding...I actually got into raids within my first year of playing started in very late BC too late to raid though raided in wrath. Just took one person nice enough to give me a chance and from then on getting into raids wasnt hard. I was never really a great raider at first as I was DPSing. Only thing to my benefit was I wasnt totally retarded. Learned quick did a happy average in DPS however I was a pretty decent healer way back was healing shit way above my gearscore from then on nobody would let me dps anymore lmao. Cata was the last time I raided didnt enjoy it tried again during MoP and just gave up.To be considered a good player? It took me  years to be acknowledged by high end players. Im still not perfect. ,wowservers,df4blse,1,t5_2t61d

Most of the time this is just phasing issue and  chance can be solved by relogging.MinionsPets can go ballistic sometimes and attack mobs that you have killed before and has respawned near you. Ctrl to chastise your pet.Those are the issues on the top of my head. Ive been playing here since January and to be honest this is the best scripted server Ive ever played.

But a lot of the people I know are very loyal to their current main server and despise server hopping yet they still rolled on HG. People are just super thirsty for bearable TBC gameplay. They levelled through  levels of badness x helped on Hellground but their TBC content was passable and the player base was of very good size.Lets see what the HG population will be like when they relaunch and maybe Ill check out Hellfire if the insta stuff I heard is true.

11291463,0,t1_dfbulrx,Ok youre more of an idiot than I thought. Im sorry I assumed you werent.World PvP ! cheating.  Giving an option ! not giving an option.  You can point out tens of thousands of comparisons where that doesnt hold.  Do you want chocolate or vanilla?  Do you like red or blue?  Does someone elses answer to those questions drive your decision or make the other answer not viable?  If  people surveyed like chocolate over vanilla does that drive the other  to also choose chocolate?  The answer is no you stupid fuck.  Do you now see how moronic and lazy it is to take logic applied to one situation and assume it can be applied to another dissimilar situation?Vengeance is the only real PvE option for TBC servers.  Making it PvP hurts the current player base that chose it for being PvE.  Also being such a small server one level  can completely ruin the experience for anyone stepping foot into Hellfire.  If no one else is online or the only others online are actually doing things instead of just logging on hoping to pug with the nonexistent players then the person being ganked has no choice but to log off for the day.  Also there are more than enough opportunities for open world PvP in TBC as nearly each zone has PvP objectives.  Open world PvP is different in TBC and Vanilla.  In Vanilla there are no other forums besides battlegrounds for PvP and there is no quick getaway with flying.  In TBC a  can swoop down and slay whoever is .  A person looking to PvP in TBC goes into Arena BG or competes for zone objectives.  Large scale open world PvP doesnt happen.  If a  doesnt want to PvP with another  they stay on their flying mount.  If they do then they can get off and flag themselves.  The ONLY people s can get a jump on are lower leveled players or other s that are doing PvE content and low on health.  This hurts their small player base more than it helps the people looking to gank.,wowservers,dfbvd85,2,t5_2t61d

However she is innocent until proven guilty and by continuing to level these unproven accusations against her you discourage leadership within the community create rifts of distrust and ultimately divide and destroy. This is to no ones benefit. Do you think that by this rhetoric you will convince people to play your preferred server instead?P.S. the reason donations go to Shennas personal Paypal the playerbase called for her to quickly restore Anathema after a  chargeback sent it offline.

Ive spent about  months on the server and the only iffy mechanics Ive run in to was the partial resist of spells and the way spell crit multipliers were calculated with the warlock p bonus however that got fixed.Considering the server is rather old youll run in to full bis guilds and elithists here and there but finding a group for KaraGruul and even BTMH will not be an issue for you.The xfaction aspect of it however is something youll have to get used to most major guilds run two guilds for each side with an addon allowing xfaciton chat as well.,wowservers,dfieoq6,3,t5_2t61d

11416271,0,t3_62ye9u,I agree that it isnt as big a concern as people make it out to be. You can always pay cash for carries no matter what the servers policy on selling gear directly is so once the raiding scene develops it sort of becomes less of a meaningful distinction. The choice becomes whether the server administrators want to get a cut of whats going down instead of just let players sell clears for loot. Its kinda similar to how people will always sell their characters its just a matter of whether the server facilitates it directly or not.The main problem is that it makes the pug scene even more degenerate than it would normally get but even then its not TOO serious. I was able to pug up a decent set of gear on both Molten and GD even when you could become a credit card wizard. It doesnt do too much damage to guilds because any private server guild that gearchecks you on application is a fucking joke.The main problem with selling gear is that after the server administration has decided its OK for them to make money off it theyre incentivized to go further. Warmane didnt have the legendary quests working for  years and you probably huff computer duster if you dont understand that the point of that was to sell legendary items for money. Hell it sometimes even happens for servers that sell cosmetic items to start rigging the game in their favor like how Freakz reduced the drop rate of the green fire tome and claimed it was retaillike while they sold it in the shop.If server owners can resist the temptation to unbalance the game in favor of their wallets then it doesnt bother me.,wowservers,dfq0u1a,6,t5_2t61d

Yet they never focus on the positive attributes of any server because that would kill their rage boner. God forbid they let some positivity into their lives.To OP Elysium is more populated right now therefore more diversity and the game feels more alive. For an mmo I think that the high population is a godsend and makes the game more fun.

How do we know Shenna didnt fake the moonlanding as well? We dont. I said EVIDENCE. gt Vitaliy WAS in fact UNBANNING PLAYERS in WeChatgt This is probably the most overlooked piece of evidence against him.gt Lets hear the testimony from Shenna herself About some unbans I can explain it  Vitaliy could unban someone but not for money. He could just go over the GM team and listen to some players in the WeChat and decide they are not guilty.COULD is not the same as DID. gt And now lets hear it from the former lead GM Haydes the logs have been removed and the accounts have been unbanned and the logs of unbans taking place have been removed.Lets be honest and not try and twist things Wutlol. The full quote is With a pending investigation of logs that have been removed and accounts have been unbanned and the logs of the unban taking place have been removedSo your quote is not even accurate.An investigation first of all indicates that something is not conclusive. In this case they are referring to the investigation that took place into the possible unbanning of players by Vitaliy that was stalled because the logs were deleted. They are not saying that unbans ever took place. They are talking about how the lack of evidence reflects badly on Elysium. They cant prove one way or the other. In fact at the very same time that he is saying this he is also saying that he doesnt care about Vitaliys statement in the chinese Wechat so which is it  is he saying Vitaliy unbanned people or that Vitaliy joked about unbanning people? But is there any suggestion of mischief in the logs being missing? were they deleted to protect Vitaliy? No because just a little way on from this discussion we also have the statement that the server deleted the logs automatically. And then we have someone second hand referencing Crogge saying the logs had been changed. But we also have a statement directly from Crogge of which we are discussing now saying that he saw absolutely no evidence of tampering. What comes across from the meeting is not evidence of Vitaliys guilt who was not even there to defend himself but of a fragmented and divided staff who are not sharing information and communicating well between each other. Each has a fragment of the picture and thinks its the whole rather the way you and I do. If you put the fragments together you dont get evidence of Vitaliys guilt.gt This is what former lead CM Suzerain was referring to when he said that We will try to reverse any services he provided though it may not be possible since the logs have been deleted.Yes because a quarter of the team had a broken understanding of what was going on and Suzerain was never party to this conversation and was acting on solely on a single statement from Asura that the logs that would have helped investigate any alledged misconduct from Vitaliy had been deleted. Which we know. Because they talked about it in the meeting. They also talked about how the missing logs were deleted as part of a routine process not to protect Vitaliy. Suzerain had no right or position to talk about what Elysium would or wouldnt do as he was not part of the Elysium team at that point but was acting as community rep for the LGN partnership. Futher you continue to cherry pick supporting points. In that very same statement from Suzerain he also supports and underscores strongly that Shenna is completely trustworthy.gt This was also the last straw that broke the camels back and caused Crestfall to pull out of LGN due to strong evidence of corruption in highranking members of their staff.Asura left but Crogge did not. So what do you make of that? And given that Crogge is now often defending Asura for the same sort of public outspokeness that is being used to crucify Shenna?There is nothing to your evidence.,wowservers,dfw6pf0,1,t5_2t61d

11705744,0,t1_dgmkc4b,I leveled almost to  between  and  I think I forget anyways I had a good experience on the realm and found only one bugged quest which was reported and fixed. Only bad part was devs and the one mod went silent on discord and the site was not updated for    weeks so a lot of people thought the server was abandoned and then all of the sudden they unleashed with a massive changelog and wiped the server. I wish them luck but Im not going back and starting over again.,wowservers,dgmvbs2,1,t5_2t61d

11727212,0,t1_dgpakan,I think thats a fair stance to take on that question. It would depend on the goals of the guild and the guilds mentality. One thing they all have in common is the fact that the entire guild has to buy into the system to make it work. ,wowservers,dgpb65i,1,t5_2t61d
