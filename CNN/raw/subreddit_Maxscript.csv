10916527,0,t1_de4esig,One of the great things about Pythons integration into Max  and Im not saying itll be useful here  is that its almost entirely very modern. The downside is that it doesnt cover all subjects the upshot being that Ive written Python scripts that are significantly more efficient than their Maxscript equivalents but which then require me to execute Maxscript from within Python in order to actually do everything I need it to do. Im hopeful that with time the old deprecated Maxscript stuff can be junked and the nice new stuff kept. ,Maxscript,de5ynxn,2,t5_30yaw
