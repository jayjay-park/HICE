115724,0,t3_1ve825,I like WNF as a name better as well and appreciate interacting with folks all over the world not just mericans D.  Timezone will make for natural connections but I wouldnt split the guild.  Again less than half are regulars so this means guild size is naturally regulated.  Of course you need to decide if this is to stay an open guild ,WarmNFuzzyGuild,cerlwov,1,t5_2z8dp
121450,0,t1_ceqyjhy,Cool!Actually it can still trigger an every turn attack of the Great Wolf Play mangy and reduce cooldown Take it back to hand with Wolfhounds abilityBy doing this you will not attack with Wolfhound and lose  attack buff on Great Wolf Mangy Wolf is not on board I think this is acceptable  More nerfing on CD doesnt make sense for me.Im quite happy with the current state of the concept ,WarmNFuzzyGuild,ces9edg,2,t5_2z8dp
165041,0,t1_cetnu6c,OK. So my choosen card is Faith Duty It lasts longer than Rangers Bane and also manipulates the CD of the opponent units. But Faith Blessing can be nice too. Especially in a healer deck,WarmNFuzzyGuild,cex8bfe,1,t5_2z8dp
