1824026,0,t3_2fgi7m,This is really too big of a question to be answered definitively. Its like asking what the best cigarette is  everyone has their own preferences some people like different ones for different situations etc. There isnt really a best its whatever you personally happen to like the most.Ive always liked bit consoles and even some of the later systems. Specific favorites are probably Genesis SNES Dreamcast PS and N. I also like to emulate some newer systems like GBA DS Gamecube and Wii. I was never really into systems like the NES I feel like most games I played were too limited in what they could do but I love me some Galaga Pacman etc. I dont really collect retro systems and instead usually go for emulation but Ive owned all of those consoles at one point in time.,Retro,ck8zgz1,2,t5_2qx9j
