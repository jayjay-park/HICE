2659433,0,t1_clm550o,Already Im liking live more than k. Whens the last time you saw a k producerrep on reddit answering customer questions??I just want you guys to know that i will be purchasing nba live  next year. Even if its not on the level on kthats okay. We understand with a genre like this it takes time to work out and refine a truly realistic experience. But you guys are tryingyoure communicatingand youre bringing MUCH needed competition. Just remember us when you pass k in salesand for the love of god dont nickel and dime us like them.  ,NBAlive,cn5psjz,1,t5_2rmw3
