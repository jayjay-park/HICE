4052991,0,t1_cri1m9g,Its quite common with male porn stars. Its the same with female porn stars too. Many of them do same sex scenes to stay in the business because competition is very fierce. This is doubly true for male porn stars if you are a woman and get semi famous you are set but its much harder to get recognized as a male porn star if you think about the porn stars you know the name of I am sure you could also name far more women than men.On straight porn the focus is usually on the women the male pornstar is just a tool to get the shots the director wants.I dont think there is anything wrong with this this is what the masses want.

11291717,0,t3_612mwi,Also look for Abroad in Japan. I took a liking to the guy because he lives in Sendai near where a friend of mine lives. A lot of his travel is in Tohoku so theres a lot of stuff most people dont see on other channels. Chris has a pretty sardonic take on things so itll seem a lot more humorous than ones like Only in Japan which are more experiential. Another YTer known as Mikey Chen just did two weeks in Japan over Christmas. His second YT page is Simply Dumpling and is more food focused. Both of his are more man on the street reaction videos.  Not as much humor but a definite you are there vibe in what he does. Mikey loves his food so if you want to see some crazy food experiences his two channels have it covered. ,JapaneseGameShows,dfbwely,2,t5_2snad
