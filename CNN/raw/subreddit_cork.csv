8100,0,t3_1u7oh8,The BA in Popular Music is actually my first two choices for college next year. Ive got some info on them from their open day as well as a sample entrance paper that I can scan for you if youd like. The building and gear is amazing and the course directors and teachers seem really cool. I know maybe  or  people doing it pretty well and they all love it.I know if youre applying in the ROI you apply through the CAO which has a max of  points and you also have to go in for a written exam audition and interview each of which is worth  points. You can apply for Vocals Keys Bass E. Guitar or Drums. Check out CITs website for a bit more information.,cork,cefcwws,3,t5_2rl9n
