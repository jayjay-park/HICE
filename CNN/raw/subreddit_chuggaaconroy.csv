7512272,0,t1_d2w14ym,His other reason one that I dont agree with as much is that he doesnt want to over saturate the channel with any one series at a time. Even so I highly doubt that hell take three years in between Platinum and BW.Keep in mind that between Emerald and Platinum were both Colosseum and XD. No other games that could be debated as main series games have come out since then so that will cut down some of the time.And he also had Xenonblade Chronicles easily his biggest project to date. Unless he plans on doing X any time soon that also takes down some of the time in between Pokemon series.,chuggaaconroy,d2w3wb7,3,t5_2upzb
