5893441,0,t1_cxs245c,Minu stood on deck clenching no of the ropes connected to the sails tightly. The sails were full with wind this made the ship rocket forward.Jaina Loosen your grips on the ropes a bit guys let the sails breath a bit more. We will need it to get at the top. And if the sails are held too tightly they will split that would be the end of us.  The members of the crew that were holding on to the ropes quickly let them slide through their hands.  Minu I hope you know what you are doing Miss Jaina. She said with a smile she had all the confidence in their navigator.  As Minu stood there rop in hand she looked over the front of the ship. The peak of the mountain was visible until she only saw the blue sky and the white clouds.Next thing Minu saw was the wood of the deck as the ship came back down. The ship splashed in the river and water got all over the crew. Minu cowered back. The water didnt weaken her but Minu had a fear of seawater just like every Devil Fruit user did. Jaina Pull up the sails guys! We are going fast enough if we accelerate anymore we will crash on the sea when the mountain ends! Minu and a couple of the others climbed the ropes as fast as possible to get the sails all up. Minu stood on top of the spar as she  tied the sails up. She placed her hand on the mast and her other hand in front of her eyes. Looking over the remainder of Reverse Mountain.Minu whispered Grand Line watch out...  The Fallen are coming and we are going to take this sea by storm! OOC uthisisnt ,StrawHatRPG,cxs5x7p,1,t5_3axaa

Ugh this needs some special sauce. Pulling out a can of paint he keeps in case of food emergencies he poured a good amount into the cup and took another drink. Ah thats better. Not good but better. he chugged the rest of the cup quickly emptying it.,StrawHatRPG,cxxobkx,1,t5_3axaa
5947098,0,t3_3ws0st,Minu had been walking for a long time on her own. She had wandered through the different shops looking for a decent cloak to buy. Her attire was a bit too exposing for the harsh conditions they would have to face on  the Grand Line. But she didnt have any luck. Not one shop sold any decent clothes. They werent in her size or from decent material and they were all too expensive.  As Minu left the latest shop she encountered two of the shopkeepers from her previous visits.  From first glance she saw they meant trouble. One was swinging a bat and patting it in his hand the other had an angry look in his eyes and he was the one that spoke.Angry man pointed You Why dont you buy anything from us! Minu Your wares are not of high standard and are not to my liking why would I buy them. Angry man Because we tell you to! Now Get her!

5951693,0,t1_cxze9qp,Marlon felt the resistance of pushing Decimus back suddenly disappear followed by a sharp pain in his right shin. Son of a blowfish must have ducked out of the way. Marlon stumbled forward past his foe dropping to a knee and steadying himself with his hands on the ground. Without a second thought Marlon ripped the spear from his wound and brought the blade to his mouth chomping down to shatter the steel into tiny fragments. That was at least one problem down.Marlon turned around to face Decimus... Well face his as best as he could. His legs were shaky his vision was blurry his side was aching and his head was throbbing. Is this huff is this just what yer crew DOES? It just uses dirty underhanded tactics to take out goodnatured folks? Well? At least say something!Tears almost started to well up in his eyes. From the anger of fighting such a frustrating foe the sadness that this might be where his journey already ends or simply the stinging sensation from the poison he wasnt even sure at this point. Marlon shot forward like a tiger shark about to home in on its prey with teeth bared and arms outstretched. He had lunged forward and was now mere inches away from his foe.,StrawHatRPG,cxzsp8f,1,t5_3axaa

The more and more he got lost the more mad he got and the more mad he got the more confused he got and as he got confused well you get the point. There was only one cure for his madness and that magical medicine of course was his bottle of gin. The farther he got into the maze the more drunk he got until his mind just wanted to rest and look at the sky for a little while. As the time went by Queequeg decided in a drunken stupor that the only way to pass time was to dance and howl at the moon. About a half an hour later he finally heard the sweet sound of laughter that he treasured so dearly as he looked down to see where the laughter came from he saw it. It was a guardian of magic himself it was Brutus Thunder blade the master of the dragon ballsat this point he was to drunk to make sense.

Noah quickly thought of a plan how he could get the giant bug tog et distracted from him. Suddenly it turned over to Alex pushing her hardly against the wall with its tongue. On the one hand that was very bad! Alex couldnt move! But on the other hand it was now his turn to strike.Wait a seconde! he yelled in Alex direction.since the bug was standing near a wall his now freshly made up plan might work. He jumped against the wall and then directly onto the giant bug monster. It hasnt noticed him doing that since it had a hard chitin skin. He enflamed his right hand again forming a small fireball above it. He tossed it at the tongue. The fireball wasnt big enough to set the whole bug on fire but it achieved  things. . the tongue was painfully rolled back into the mouth and . the bug monster got even more angry.If we get it angry enough it my charging around aimlessly!

This created a strange series of noises different to the ones Cold knew. Looking at the source he saw a man in an odd state curled up spouting ramblings at high speed before turning to look at Cold and silencing himself.This was new. Backing out from the hole trying to understand just what was happening he simply said one thing the most logical thing for him.Cadence please fix the broken man in there he does not appear to be functioning correctly.,StrawHatRPG,cy9c0x5,1,t5_3axaa

Well first she needed to find another large pot...It didnt take long to find one double the size of the last.  This should do it.  Maybe.  Pinto wasnt quite sure what test her mediocre cooking skills were in for.  She was chopping carefully as Toshi recounted his crew in detail.An entire crew with powers of transformation.  It must be quite the spectacle.More chopping.How exactly were you able to test the limits of what you are capable of with these powers?

6046043,0,t3_3yaq4z,Kite sat at the bar on Jindai Island drinking heavily and hoping to finally get drunk to forget the events of the past days.As I flew toward the island I noticed something odd. It seemed to move? As I got closer and descended I could see that it wasnt an island at all but an island whale! The whole thing was utterly fantastic and just the sort of thing youd find on the grand line.I landed among the trees and walked into town from the direction of the coast. Looking around I saw many intriguing things but none held my interest more than the tavern. Perhaps I could finally get drunk and this local sake might do the trick.Entering the fine establishment I was flooded with memories of the early days of when Id know Pinto. Id spent three days drinking and she stood next to me through all of it even splitting the tab. Did I make the right choice leaving like I did? Even if I did its too late now. Even if I could go back would they want me with how I left them?The troubles of the past days swirled through my mind as I sat down at the bar.Kite Barkeep. A bottle of the local sake and two bottles of rum.Barkeep You look far too young to have so many troubles behind those eyes young man.Kite Dont even get me started. It started with a village getting slaughtered and then ended with me leaving my crew.The barkeep placed the sake on the counter in front of me and the rum within arms reach.Barkeep Youre right young man I dont want you to get started. It seems that the less I know the better.With that he walked to the other end of the bar and began cleaning tankards.Ah well I guess its back to how Ive always lived no friends no allies and only myself for company....uGinchan uSrtnick,StrawHatRPG,cyc54vj,1,t5_3axaa
6047629,0,t1_cycbhml,Pinto seemed to be dealing with Cadence on her own well enough giving him a reassuring nod. Brickly while still heavily concerned and slightly frightened at least calmed down a little. His interruption still got him a horrifying glare from Cadence though causing him to breath out a quiet squeak.It seemed whatever this was had something to do with Cadences past. Brickly remembered thinking about this before. Perhaps whatever this was was something related to why she was crying when things were happier. So when Kite had left it clicked something in her.It seemed that to learn about her past though Pinto would have to look into Cadences mind. Brickly hadnt really seen Pinto use her powers much. He didnt even know she could use it to read minds. He was glad Pinto was on his side not that he had much to hide. However it seemed Pinto didnt know exactly how to read minds.

Pinto took not of their reactions verses Kites.  Kite who had yet to work though these experiences.  He did not have that...  advantage?  A debatable advantage.  But a need for a second chance.  He was not aware of what his crewmates had felt here what lessons they had over him.Brickly.  You must be stronger than most to return to these feelings and accept them so readily.  And I believe it is that strength from each of us that will return Kite to us.Another nod.  Even if he was sad and conflicted Brickly was admirable in his feelings.  His rationing.

6066327,0,t1_cyerj39,The visions flashed and faded one after another each wave carrying with it a more unique and intense pain then the last. Through the storm raging in his head he could hear Carths steady voice trying to call him back. Keizai he had broken down their as well. it was worse then the bad memories always brought out the darker beast. The demon of the mountains that still lingered within the pits of his very being. No matter how much he tried he could not conquer over the creature could not put it to rest. Until his hands wrapped around the hilt of Shirubadon he would be cursed with the failures of who he was.Asai. Stay with me. Remember where you are. You are a pirate and here with your crew. I can tell you went through something bad in the past but you cant let that control you. We cant afford you rampaging on our ship! The voice stern yet worried continued to press against the barriers. It was right he couldnt lose control here he had too much to protect now. With a dry heave Asai pressed against the railing purging the dismal thoughts and clearing his head at last. He listed to the beat of his heart counting for fifteen seconds before stopping.  beats per minute much higher than normal and not safe in the slightest.Ah thank you Carth. He shook his head while grimacing turning to look at the blonde haired man. I think Ill be alright now Im sorry that I let you see that again. He bowed his head in shame angry at himself for being unable to fight back against the looming darkness. Good memories brought on the pain and sickness like now the bad ones came with anger and blood lust. He looked at Carth letting his hair fall slightly over his red eye watching for a reaction. Carth simply sighed and nodded taking a sip of the drink in his hand.Just be sure to keep it under control. Wont do any good to have you break down on us. Asai nodded and gulped sucking back a good portion of his cocoa. Carth was right thats why he respected the man so much. But it wasnt easy and it wouldnt be easy but he would keep trying.Of course... Ill do my best to not let it happen again. He closed his eyes and frowned. Regret was his constant companion and its sister guilt was always nearby. Being granted a second chance here at sea had once been a dream. He would find atonement in service to the Fallen Pirates and he would protect his friends at the cost of his life. The past haunts many of us I simply fall prey to it more so than others. Keep me grounded Carth I think Ill need it in the trials and adventures ahead. Asai grinned slightly doing his best to hide the pain. Thats what Chizaru taught him dont allow the pain to show conquer it and make it bow to you. That is why he grinned.,StrawHatRPG,cyescd5,1,t5_3axaa

6099160,0,t1_cyitixo,It was dark. It was quiet. But most of all it was over. He had destroyed everything he had begun to build. He thought about the night that he had talked with Jaina on deck. The night they had watched the stars together. Right then and there he felt at peace that he could have the life he always dreamt of. All he wanted was to have a family and friends. People he could care about. But the demon took it away. No he took it away. He chose to enter the cave knowing fully of the darkness within. He thought himself to be  stronger that was a lie.Im weak. He croaked. The painful tears he had welling up inside continued to flow. There was no need to stop them because you cry when you are happy and when you are sad. They said he could come back that everything would be okay. But it wouldnt be he had shattered that. Why would they want him back after what he did? It was beyond his comprehension. So fragile was he so arrogant and so weak he could not even understand that. The image of the cliff from long ago had appeared again. As bright and alluring is his memory as it was in reality.He shuffled to his feat. He was like a broken clock. It kept on ticking and ticking but the time never changed. He made the motion of pulling his scarf up to his face only to find it had gone. He slammed his fist into the wall and began to exit the cave. At the mouth he sat and began to pry the bone out of his leg the one Jaina had stabbed him with. He placed his hand over his red eye the eternal reminder of his damnation now with an added scar. Chuckling he realized that the man who had given it to him had one almost exactly the same. He tried to pull up his scarf again.What if Jaina threw it away in anger? What if she destroyed it? He sobbed trying desperately to pull it up over his face like a child would. Thats because it was Akitos scarf the child killed long ago on the night his parents died. It was the only good thing he could remember from his mother the only thing that didnt flood his mind with agony. Bleeding he stood up and wandered into the jungle. He stumbled across rocks and trees over trails and past the trampled field where he had picked flowers with Jaina. He hadnt realized it but she was his best friend since joining the crew.Im worthless... He continued muttering to himself. There was only one future left waiting for him. He had stood at the gate so long but the hooded man was patient waiting just beyond the threshold. He wandered towards the ultimate future the one true end.Death.,StrawHatRPG,cyiwurs,1,t5_3axaa

She is nice to observe especially if you contrast against my demeanour.Stepping forwards then turning to look at her he had an experiment in mind to see if he could at least imitate without knowledge correctly. It was something that he didnt think hed try so soon but upon turning to look at her he had a smile on his face. Not a sly grin such as when he would fight and attack nor one he would give a violent thought but one to replicate Kanpais demeanour and approach to life. A simple smile not extreme to the point of the wrinkling of the eyes but more along the lines of faces that he had seen spread across town a happy smile.It was most likely too soon to try it coming across as more of a person you would cross the street to avoid and tell your children to stay away from and felt too forced giving off not a happy approach to life but more that of a stereotypical bad man he had heard about while walking about with blood on his hands glancing at the imitations as he walked by from juvenile boys.Sorry about what I exposed you to but Ill be on my way and see you on the ship with the rest of the crew I wish to see communal bounty reactions after all.Raising a hand to wave he turned around again and walked by the walls on the watch for a jumping ball of hyperactive energy.,StrawHatRPG,cyzdevy,1,t5_3axaa

He smiled kicking at the ground a bit and reaching for a drink that was being passed around. He eyed the reddishbrown liquid in his cup while sloshing it around. It smelt like coffee so he brought it up to his lips and took a sip. It tasted foul and he coughed nodding at Nialla to continue. Let me set the scene for you. Rain pelted Jindai. Thunder and lightning arced through the sky before striking the ground around me. Even nature was against me. He shifted in his seat and closed his eyes envisioning the battlefield. He furrowed his brow and took another sip he didnt remember there being any lightning or rain. Perhaps he hadnt been paying attention? He took another drink of the coffee.She described herself making her way into a seething blaze of flame and storm. Pulling ten buildings out of people wait no ten people out of a building. He shook his head and finished off the last of his drink and opening his eyes again. His head felt funny all he wanted to do was listen to the story but the strange feeling was making it haaard. Niallas face contorted into a strange bestial shape with jaw extended and teeth barred. He chuckled nearly falling from his seat before catching himself on the underside of the table. This Reese woman sounded both terrible and hilarious. Spoons? What an interesting weapon maybe he should try to get some of those. Picking up a pair of wooden spoons off of a nearby plate he began tapping them together in front of his face as he scooched a bit closer to Nialla so he could hear better. That sounds sooo amazing... He muttered as she continued her tale. All he had done was fight a bunch of goons this sounded like something truly interesting. Niallas acting and imitation was spot on embellishing all the right details. He smiled and nodded again grabbing another coffee. It was start to taste better the more he drank what kind of food or drink did that? She swung her fork in an arc sending the small wrap she had created hurtling through the air. It landed with a wet smack and exploded over the back of someones head. Akito began laughing heavily Sisisisi before wiping his face and calming down. Aaaaanyway long story short big balls of burning wood hurt. A lot. I wouldnt recommend it. Rolling his shoulder a bit he reached around for a piece of meat. It seemed to be a lot further away than it had been before. Before he could contemplate this strange series of events a small hand shot out in front of his face. His eyes narrowed and examined the thing on her wrist. A small metal watch with wooden spoons for hands. So interesting! Nialla was extremely interesting she had such a good story.That sounds amazing Nialla... He felt a bit dizzy and tried to get up but his legs didnt want to respond. You must be a really strong fighter! He smiled sluggishly at the woman curious to know more about her. Then a gear clicked into place in his head and it snapped up.II haave a waatch tooo. His words fell out clumsily as he reached beneath his bandages withdrawing a small clear crystal vial. A dark red liquid rolled around inside. He held it out to Nialla for a second before realizing that wasnt right. Oh sorry not that. Slowly sticking it away he rummaged around a bit before withdrawing his gold pocket watch. The numbers were written in roman numerals and the hands were made of a sold black material tipped with gold. If I remember rightly I got it off of some thugs in Loguetown. Thats where we got our ship err yeah? ,StrawHatRPG,cz1npx4,1,t5_3axaa

The head chef approached Decimus.Are you a new cook? Well thatd be the only reason youre in here I suppose. Whatre you doing with those things on you? he pointed at the tiara and arm braces.Oh... uh... theyre family keepsakes. I cant go anywhere without them on. Deci wondered if the story was actually believable.Bah whatever. Go make yourself useful somewhere. Hey you! Sea king meat doesnt go with onions you idiot! The head cook went off to scold one of the chefs and left the lone pirate to his own devices. I guess I could sabotage this whole operation... not sure how much info these guys have. He walked around dodging and slipping by the speeding cooks. Examining the dishes as he went by Decimus couldnt understand the point. All of these are disgusting... who would eat any of this. Id be doing them a favor. As he sidled through the room he rubbed his poison covered hands on as much food as he could.

She watched the soldiers race about they were dealing with a lot of activity at once and it would be much easier to get in and do what they needed to do.  She took the sick mask in her left hand and put it to he face as she opened the font door to walk through.

She had had an eventful day thus farshe had met up with Decimus on accident and they fought against the scary treasurer lady and the librarian Gabriel Wakespeare and then she ran into Akito and Finnegan who were just beginning a battle against the Apocalypse Pirates. She had faced off against the Angel of the Apocalypse and even had a beautiful black feather resting against her light blue hair to prove that Zratis had enjoyed his battle with hershe really wanted to meet him again and become his friend. She skipped as she walked with the three other people excited to see what other adventures were awaiting her before the day ended. They had just gotten to the other members of the Tombstones when Pinto suddenly dropped her hands grasping at her head. Kanpai looked at her captain and frowned worry etched into her eyes. She looked over at Pancake who could only shrug his shoulders unsure of what was happening and they watched as Pinto was taken to their ship Cadence leading the way with orders on what the others should and should not be doing. Kanpai anxiously waited with a few of the other crew members when she spotted the four large marines coming into view her hand grasping her hammer and flinging it out in front of her her hands grasping tightly. These four meant trouble and she smiled widely knowing she wouldnt have to wait for the thrill of yet another fight.As the Tombstones walked closer to the marines Kanpai noted that along with Finnegan there was one other person she did not know her eyes quickly glancing over the being she smiled slightly. He may not have been a replacement for their captain but the more they had on their side the better. These four spelled trouble and Kanpai was excited to take strip them of their pride hoping to at least land some crushing blows to their easily broken shinsor anywhere for that matter as long as she got to hear the satisfying snapping of someones bones. She heard the marines speaking and she looked at them her eyes ablaze with the fighting spirit of someone who wanted to hear the sound of strong men crying out in pain. She knew that everyone that she was fighting next to would fight to the best of their ability. She chuckled slightly before she remembered that she was supposed to be listening. She saw someone move by her side and she froze for a second before she realized Pancake was still standing with her. She looked at him and glared slightly before pointing at the ship motioning for him to get out of there and go sit with Pinto. Pancake could only nod with affirmation before he darted back to the ship. She heard Marlon speaking and she was overjoyed that the fishman had stepped up as interim captain while Pinto was down and out from the battle. She squealed slightly and yelled out a quick go Marlonsama.After he finished speaking encouraging words Kanpai turned her attention back on the four marines and frowned at what one of them was saying. What was with these overrighteous marines that thought pirates were the worst things in the world? Clearly they had never run into bullies or parents that wished you dead. She thought of Akito briefly before the marines attacked. Her mind was taken out of its thoughts when she noticed the way that the men attacked Yuru had slashed at the air Katze went speeding towards Marlon Baron punched the air and ran for Cadence and James ran at Finnegan his sword ready to attack. Kanpai heard Marlon yell out that she Cadence and Cold should go up against the two brutes who were utilizing their fists as a means of attacking. She grinned wildly as she cheered and nodded her head her hammer ready to attack and her eyes blazed with a new emotion. A fist fight? She would get to hear bones breaking after all and she might even get to use the new weapon she had obtained on her adventures with Decimus. She darted from where she stood and ran for Baron swinging her hammer back before bringing it back in aiming at the mans shins. She looked to where Katze was and sighed her relief when she saw that Marlon had dodged. She darted around Baron and began heading for Katze her mind racing with all the possibilities there were and what bones she should break. Coldsan Cadencesama! These two will be easy to take down! ,StrawHatRPG,czlrlpy,1,t5_3axaa
6529067,0,t3_44wspb,How they had made it back to the ship was a blur to Alex. The last thing she remembered clearly was dragging her companion with her through the base as deafening alarms assaulted them. Nialla had been completely passed out yet was still somehow holding on to the chest of treasure like it was her baby. Next thing they were on the deck of the ship out at sea. She was glad her subconscious mind was somehow more responsible than she normally was.Wincing she pulled the bandages tighter around her torso. She wasnt sure how bad the damage was but this was the best she could do on her own for now. Her arm had been bleeding badly and it definitely felt like some ribs had cracked when she took that punch. Hopefully they would heal nicely on their own otherwise she would have to find a doctor on the next island  wherever the hell that was. She looked up at Nialla clutching the eternal log pose they had discovered. The strange girl wasnt looking much better off covered head to toe in bandages and plasters. Alex may have gone a little overboard playing doctor.Alongside them she could see other mostly larger pirate ships sailing. There had been a lot of dramatic shouting about a truce and the Blitz Assembly back and forth between the leaders. To be honest Alex hadnt really been paying attention in her pain induced haze but she had been thrilled by the sight of so many pirate flags flying in unison.For the moment however the excitement had died down and they were sailing smoothly towards their destination giving her a brief moment of respite. She yawned still exhausted from the fight and slumped over the railing letting the wind push against her face and keep her awake. Earlier while she was still running on adrenaline she had tried to get a higher vantage point to see the other ships in action but very quickly discovered what a terrible idea that was with broken ribs. The deck of the ship would have to do along with her friends  a bottle of rum and some mystery pills she had found in storage.She played with the shell they had found flipping it back and forth before accidentally pressing something with a small click. Flames shot out engulfing the railing and causing her to cry out with slightly delayed alarm. As the ship caught fire she reached forward and turned the railing to stone causing the flames to extinguish almost instantly. Shaking her slightly burned hand she frowned and moved the shell away. It seemed after everything that had happened on Jindai fire was not her friend it would probably be best to hand it to Nialla who was their resident flame expert.Her resolve lasted exactly half a second before she reached for the shell again and curiously examined it. Where was the fire coming from? She activated it again watching in wonder as fire shot up into the sky coming dangerously close to their flag. Either the alcohol or the pills or a horrible mix of both was kicking in now as she played with the dangerous weapon while laughing and hanging perilously off the side of the ship.uAlpheon uDrBackFlipNacho OOC Anyone else is free to join in at any time!,StrawHatRPG,czuno5v,1,t5_3axaa
6535022,0,t1_czv73fi,As I hung in the shrouds of the ship my feet entwined in the ropes I couldnt help but overhear the conversation that had started at my feet. Deciding to kill two beasts with one stone which Ive done before I quickly stripped off my armor and boots  and dropped it all next to the railing. Now in only my pants I began doing situps crossing my arms over my chest and going a full  degrees from my sitting position so my head was level with the others at the bottom though upside down. As I trained I spoke.Finn If you want... my opinion... I think youll all..... do just fine.... Youre all.... definitely odd.... but thats not..... necessarily a... bad thing.... With Marlon youre.... in capable fins.... so dont worry... quite so much.... Cadence is.... an abrasive lady.... but a quite.... capable doctor..... shell make sure.... that youre well.... taken care of....Slightly out of breath and tired of the halting speech pattern I was forced to adopt I stopped doing my situps and simply hung there with my large arms dangling down.Finn Cadence if you look in the pouch on top of my armor youll find a bundle of red moss bound in twine. Take half of it and put it in a very damp wet box with a rock in it and youll have blood moss in no time. Blood moss is what I pack into my wounds and it absorbs the blood acting as a clot to stop the bleeding. You dont need stitches only a bandage. It dissolves in the skin providing nourishment to the wound so it heals faster. Take good care of it and it will take good care of you.Marlon I think that as payment for letting me be your stowaway Ill take a look at your ship and make what repairs I can. She looks to be in good condition but theres always work to be done to keep a ship in top condition.Cold I saw you in action during that battle on Ganseki and it seems were both swordsmen in a way. It would likely benefit the both of us to exchange techniques.Once I had finished and the others were speaking again I eyed the large hammer the mousegirl had with that thunder dial in the back of my mind. I had an idea Id like to try but I wouldnt interrupt her time with her friend.,StrawHatRPG,czv9uyi,1,t5_3axaa

Though now it did itch like hell after all that.What itched at her more thoguh was the wish to move again freely about.  To interact more than sitting idly by and groaning for coffee.  Doctors orders were decaf and Pinto spent half her illness convincing herself not to hold it against Cadence.  It was forgotten now though.  Not because of even the ascension of the Outlaw but because of how overwhelmingly relieved she was to be back.  Standing looking across the deck to her crew.And Marlons command.  She was impressed and wondered if she looked half as impressive doing as such.  If he wasnt a TombstoneEither way it looked like they could use an extra set of hands for this and since no one had noticed her yetCaptain Marlon where could you use the extra hand?

The strange facsimile scolded Hayes and put his hands against the wall creating the same stone arm covers that the true Hayes wore.Theres no way Im going to take life lessons from you! Youre boring! Hayes yelled back in a much more serious tone than the words deserved. I thought these were supposed to be fears I dont fear you. I just hate you. The two mirror fighters slammed their arms against each other repeatedly cracks spread across the stone covers in spider web patterns as chunks started falling off both fighters transformed their stone weapons into small warhammers in each hand.You were some what of a special case.

6647983,0,t1_d06ptfz,She felt like her seven year old self again.  The resolve she had told Finn about was out the door momentarily.  Its just much easier to bad mouth ghosts than when they appear right in front of you while begging for sympathy and while she always had very little sympathy for her parents they still brought up the feeling that kids can get my mom or dad is hurting and if they say it is my fault then it must be.  And Pinto had a bad bad case of that when she was young as she was asked to do far more than she should have.  She felt small again and she hated it.  Gaining back a bit of sense she began approaching the figure when he jumped off of the furniture with an actual blinding speed in contrast to his original state.  She almost fell backwards over her own feet as he was suddenly right in front of her a hideous expression on his face.  She held her breath.Nightmare Dad  I only wanted your mother and she left me you instead.  And you were too stupid to do any good.Pinto was.  Frozen.  She couldnt move couldnt breathe.  Shed felt these particular feelings before as shed wondered those thoughts to herself however as Pinto had never addressed those worries and could not discuss them with her deceased father she had to response waiting as he actually spoke what she had always fretted over.  She had no reply to one of her deepest fears suddenly approaching her.  And it continued to speak as well.It was always obvious to us though my wife and I that you werent going to go anywhere.  That you werent going to accomplish anything.  Best you could do was the deadend job you were fired from.Pinto took a step back and was becoming aware that she was in fact neglecting to breathe.  She tried to choke out a breath as her limbs were suddenly feeling weak though she could achieve nothing but a full body lurching as the man she once felt under thumb of was doing so again but voicing things she only feared in the recesses of her mind.  Attempting a breath again she sucked in a little oxygen though it opened the flood gates and Pinto hunched over taking in big gulps of air in relief.  Slowly gaining a more rational sense.  She just needed to breathe.All the while the other figure stood over her hunched self.  He was saying something and Pinto couldnt make it out over her relief at getting to breathe again but she knew what it was.  The recesses of her mind would know.  She stood back up to take more of a verbal and emotional beating and looked down to the figure who appeared to be her father as shed known him last.Wait.  Looked Down.  Pinto stood to her full height then pausing a moment with more of a look of concentration on her face.  She adjusted her glasses.  Why hadnt she known this before what hadnt she remembered?  She felt so stupid suddenly. Why had she felt so small against this man?  Sure back then it had made sense she had nowhere else to go but but now she did.  She had people to mutually rely on and a cause FAR greater than the daily grind at her dead end job.  And he was this figure accurate in stature to her father was just barely five feet tall.  Why hadnt she noticed before?  Why had she felt so small?  She looked back to him with purpose then and the tower could feel it.  Retracting the image of her father it disappeared for a moment choosing to appear instead as her father in the actual final moments she saw him.  Just before shed run away.  Pinto began to climb the tower further with the tower haunting her sending chills up her spine but not terrifying her as it had done before.  She got several floors up before she looked back again to her haunting her one idealistic father hanging from his final invention.Pinto took in a deep breath.  She continued onwards several more stories up with the tower still formulating its next move while the one lingered behind Pinto.  Her legs started to feel the burn of climbing and she began to have to use the railings to support herself better.  It seemed as if the tower would never end.  The stairs stopped suddenly as she came to a landing.  Finding that she wasnt at the top of the tower Pinto wondered may lay in that hall she had to walk across to get to another set of stairs.  What the tower had finally formulated as the perfect image to stop her in her tracks.  Pinto had an idea and as soon as she stepped inside the room and looked around she confirmed the idea was correct.,StrawHatRPG,d06yjf7,1,t5_3axaa
6649385,0,t1_d05r5j0,One moment the strange woman was talking to me and the next she was dragged into the underbrush by a sudden unknown force.With no hesitation I leapt into the air reversing the grip on my sword as I did. In one swift motion I threw my sword like a javelin intercepting whatever had taken the woman. A hideous scream came from the direction she was being dragged and I ran forward.Crashing through the undergrowth I came to where she was tangled up in a rosebush the thorns cutting her all over. I ran around to where my sword was stuck in the ground and saw a spattering of green blood along the length of the blade. On the other side was a wriggling tentacle wrapped around her leg extensively all the way to her thigh. I bent down and grabbed the end of it pulling it hard and yanking it free from her leg.There were suckers on it but they popped free with little effort and no pain for the woman. With that done I moved around and began untangling her from the bush. In a few moments she was free and I helped her to her feet.Finn I dont know what that was that took you but its big. We can argue about earlier when we take care of it when our lives arent in danger. Ill take the lead on this since hunting is what I do for a living. Im Finn by the way.I held my hand out as a gesture of greeting and friendship. As soon as that happened there was a massive rumbling and the earth shook. The trees and undergrowth were ripped aside by a pair of massive tentacles revealing a hideous creature a squidturtle. It had a shell one massive eye a beak and eight holes in the shell with tentacles wriggling around in them.,StrawHatRPG,d073r5c,1,t5_3axaa

He bought it for her because he spotted a tattoo shop and parted ways from Sed there but she would have none of it. Following him into the tattoo shop she started asking the tattoo artists if they could face paint her like a panda. The tattoo man was nice enough to paint her face to look like  a little panda Sed thanked the tattoo guy and pranced out snatching a cool little picture of a neat tattoo on the way out. Well Gin gave her some beli to Sed to get her to stop bugging the artists while they worked on him. Her three little Stars gathered around her and ate the litle pieces of cotton candy Sed gave them when the sky darkened. Horrible monstrosities started coming off Signs and out of the pictures to attack the carnival goers.

It released Masakenshi the former slave thumping on the ground as both the monster and the man turned to look at Joaquin.Masakenshis eyes widened slightly his normally emotionless expression fading away. That animal... it could talk like a human? What was that all about?! Could it be that talking animals existed on this island? Or was it that...?!Quickly the former slave stood up as the snake coiled itself like a spring baring its fangs and hissing at the kangaroo.My apologies sir the former slave said bowing his head before the kangaroo. But if I run away from here I will never be able to realize my own goal. Please understand.Then his normal countenance returned as he looked around for a quick solution the snake still seemingly hesitant to attack the kangaroo. He figured something out a few yards away from them there was a rather large rock. Masakenshi ran towards it and standing in front of it taunted the snake thusYour real opponent is me.The snakes head snapped in the former slaves direction ignoring the kangaroo and focusing on a prey it could eat its springlike coils tightened then released as it propelled itself towards the easiest prey......Who had disappeared from sight the moment the snake had signaled its attack.Masakenshi having predicted such a reaction had used a power he had discovered while on the boat he could now change the color of his body and clothes at will and had chosen to take on the grey color of the rock. Thus while he was still visible he had almost faded into the background as the rock was behind him.His strategy proved fruitful but dangerous. The snake was far faster than him and even at its jaws snapped shut around the rock which it couldnt break as easily as a tree the former slave had been scraped by one of the fangs.

Not that she didnt like a ruckus she did but not the type with strangers.  She moved through the crowds refusing to dance with anyone turning down a few drinks before she noted a pause to the fun.  The room was suddenly quiet and all eyes were towards the center of the room.  Even the music stopped.  Even with her height she couldnt quite make out what was going on and to whom.  But she had an odd feeling about the situation.  She was making her way over when the people around her started dancing again.

However his face wrinkled in confusion as it caused spasms in the opposite arm. But before Gerald had a chance to process this Pintriss cried outPintriss Reverse PointThen the originally rounded pin ends popped off revealing sharp points beneath. After attacking Cold Pintriss opened his arms and charged at Gerald looking like he just wanted to give Gerald a nice warm hug but this hug would likely prove more painful than loving. As he ran towards Gerald Pintriss cried out for Geralds name.Gerald No thanksThen Gerald again used Swirling Leaf but this time he pivoted backwards. Pivoting twice once with each foot he backed away from Pintriss. As he moved backwards Gerald saw Cold rushing in for a close up attack of his own. Although Colds attack would likely be helpful in preventing the oncoming hug of death it would be far too late for Gerald by then. Thinking quickly he stuck out his arm with his sword pointed directly at Pintriss. Hopefully this would at least slow Pintriss down enough to give Gerald time to draw his second bokken to use Willow Whip Slash once more. This time Gerald would be aiming for his opponents leg.

9170896,0,t3_55q10u,Year oneThe battle that took place at marineford had just ended. Not even a hour ago Rokurou was risking his life in a battle so grand it took the life of an admiral. One of the marines greatest military weapons. Now Rokurou stood on yellow sand beneath a starry midnight sky. The name of the island Rokurou stood on was Poisa his hometown. Poisa was located in the south blue and was ruled over by a powerful family the family of Isoke also known as the captain of the Red Skull pirates Liruh. Rokurou shifted his feet in the sand he was unable to take a single step toward the manor where his master lived. Not many months ago he was tasked with a contract to kill Admiral Shirowane a task that he failed to do. He lost to the admiral who then had her life taken by one of the yonko Wukong captain of the Wukong Pirates. His heart was full of rage and grief. It was the first time he had shed tears in many many years. Not even when he found out about Isokes death did he mourn. He couldnt his heart was filled with rage and hatred. However now when his saviors killer met her end he felt free. Free of a guilt that plagued him for months on end. Rokurou dropped to his knees tears running down his face but also a smile. While he was sad and in mourning he was also relieved. To be free was a wonderful thing that not many people in this world had a fact Rokurou knew all too well. Some might even call being free a luxury. For the next few hours Rokurou laid in the sand staring at the night sky. Poisa was a great place to view the stars for what they really were a sight that he had missed greatly. Before he even realized it day had come and the beach began to fill with working class citizens. Fisherman casted their poles into the waters spearfishers took out tiny canoes to go hunt whales and then families came to play in the water. It was a feeling Rokurou never felt having a family in fact his time with The Void Pirate crew was the first time he felt like he had a family. Stark was a great captain until he passed then Kaguya inhabited his body and she became a bit more stern Kala was always making puns though he hadnt had any time to spend with the two newest members of their crew Jak and Ryen even then he still wondered what they were up too on this fine morning. Soon the beach became far too crowded for Rokurou to stay there any longer so he stood up and made his way toward the manor. Poisa had barely changed in fact it probably didnt change at all. In the south blue pirating wasnt a major problem especially for a powerful nation like this. The building around Poisa were made of sandstone for the poor and mainly marble for the rich. Rokurou passed through the fishermens market where the freshest fish in all of south blue was sold. It didnt take Rokurou very long to reach the manor where the royals governed over the citizens. A secret entrance laid on the right side of the manor it led to an underground passageway which lead into the manor itself. This entrance was used by the spies coming back from missions on foreign lands. After a long walk through the dark tunnel only lit by torches Rokurou came to two guards wielding spears.Guard  Rokurou! Youre back already! Who knew killing an admiral would be so easy!Guard  Shut it look at his face and wounds. Its obvious that something went wrong on the mission. Rokurou Would both of you shut up and open the door. Tell Takara to meet me in the dining room!The two guards immediately opened the giant metal doors. Revealing the gruesome basement. Enemies of the nation were strung up on crosses and being tortured young assassins were being trained the ways of killing enemies and an all too familiar face was overlooking the young assassins. Tyki the only fully trained assassin that could match Rokurou in terms of power. A fearsome foe indeed.Tyki Rokurou! I havent seen you since Irra! What a great island do you remember?Rokurou Yes I remember im surprised you do.Tyki I take it the mission was a success Takarasan wont be very happy to find out that you failed. Though with those wounds its hard to believe that you didnt.Rokurou Let Takara know im back and that there ill debrief you two in the dining room.Tyki nodded in response and left to go to Takaras office. Rokurou went to his private chamber. A beautiful room on the third floor of the manor. He dropped his bag of items on the floor and walked over to the window looking out at the city below. His room had a perfect view of the slums a constant reminder of his dark past before he was rescued. Perhaps Takara did it on purpose that cunt Rokurou thought. Though it had been ten minutes since Rokurou arrived in the manor Takara and Tyki were most likely waiting in the dining room by now. So Rokurou changed out of his blood stained outfit and into something more formal for the occasion a plain white tee and gym shorts. Then made his way down to the dining hall. Where he was meet with two more guards who opened the massive golden doors for him to enter. There he was met with another familiar face Takara Kitoaji next to him was Tyki.Takara Welcome back Rokurou.Rokurou I feel so welcome.Tyki Well should we skip right to the debriefing?Takara Let the man get some rest and food. Also from my understanding your birthday was a few days ago.Rokurou It was.Takara Then we must celebrate! Tonight we will throw a party in the manor!Tyki How will your family respond to this event?Takara Oh they love Rokurou! Hes practically family.Takara claps his hands and motions for Rokurou to take a seat next to him and across from Tyki. Nodded he slowly walks over and pulls out the chair as he sits three maids enter the dining room from a side door. Each one carrying two large trays holding two dishes each. Takara received two plays while Tyki and Rokurou only received one.Rokurou I see your diet is as strong as ever.Takara Kakakakaka! Your right Rokurou! Eat first then we will talk about the contract.All three men uncovered their dishes at exactly the same time. Steam shot out of the dishes like a geyser. Their meal three slices of bacon an omelette and toast. Rokurous stomach growled incredibly loud that it was more than likely the entire manor heard it. He hadnt eaten in three maybe even four days! Well he did eat a holy potato at marineford. Aside from that he was starving and it was surely evident. Rokurou scarfed down the food before Takara or Tyki managed to get their first bites down!Takara My oh my did The Void Pirates not feed you?Rokurou Ive been fighting for nearly three days straight food wasnt the first thing on my mind.Tyki Im surprised you can last that long especially after that night in Eikoki.Takara This is the last thing I want to hear about.Takaras stern voice ended the conversation rather quickly. Silence fell in the room as the others finished their food. When they finished Takara clapped his hands once more. The maids rushed in once again and quickly cleaned up their food. Rokurou let out a deep sigh as he know had to explain the sequence of events that brought him to marineford and the death of Shirowane.Takara That look on your face what happened?Rokurou told the story in full detail. Starting from the ambush on Sabaody how he almost was burned alive by the shichibukai Mitsuko and his short encounter with Admiral Gureinu. He then explained the attack on Impel Down the first escape from the underwater prison in its long history. The battle with Arturius who was blocking the entrance then the fight with the awakened zoan mino beasts. The next topic was about a secret floor in Impel Down Floor . This information came as a shock to both Takara and Tyki. They prided themselves on knowing all the secrets of the world and not knowing one like that was a blow to their confidence. Next Rokurou told the story of the exshichibukai Flint who wielded the GoroGoro no mi. Then the battle with the warden vicewarden and head jailers of Impel Down was told. Both Takara and Tyki were getting fairly tired of the tale at this point they wanted to know about the contract on Admiral Shirowanes life.Rokurou Flint inspired most of the Impel Down escapees and newest generation of pirates to raid marineford. Resulting in a large war at the center of the world. We thought we would be able to launch a surprise attack on them. Though we couldnt have been more foolish. All of the marines forces awaited us at marineford. The two fleet admirals the three admirals and the six remaining shichibukai were there! It was hell but we couldnt leave. We fought back defeated some of the Vice Admirals and lower but then the marines started to push us back. Every pirate on that island thought they were going to lose their life that day. Then he arrived.Rokurous expression changed he couldnt explain it but it was the first time he felt fear since his training. The way he just brushed off the attacks from such powerful opponents while countless others lost their lives in that same war.Takara Keep going! Who showed up?Rokurou was scared to even speak his name. For some reason he would know even though he was halfway across the world. Rokurou clenched his fists and slammed them down on the dining table! The table broke into tiny pieces as he said aloud the name of the man who invaded marineford!Rokurou SHI HOU.. OR WUKONG! ONE OF THE YONKO THAT RULE OVER THE NEW WORLD!!Takara and Tykis eyes widened at the sound of the name. A yonko?!?!?! they both exclaimed. Even for them hearing such a name was incredibly rare.Takara What happened next?!Rokurou He killed Admiral ShirowaneBoth WHAT!?!? HOW! EXPLAIN!,StrawHatRPG,d8eh9h0,1,t5_3axaa

He took out a pile of papers and carefully picked one out reading it closely before speaking up again.This one man has been going around disrupting the trade between several kingdoms. He has a single pirate ship but somehow he has been able to escape Marine forces several times. His name is Captain Roswell locate him somewhere in the New World and defeat him Fleet Admiral Caesar explained handing over a bounty poster that showed a bearded darkskinned man with scars above both of his eyes.

9219216,0,t1_d8ajrcl,Some long hours later the seafaring vessel was sailing eerily past the sixth island which appeared to be a rich lavish city built around a massive crater from the looks of it. The ship was headed in a crescent arc slowly revolving to face the beautiful island. It was somewhat elevated as if it was built more on a mountainous rock than an actual island but this was not the case. It was possibly the most urban out of all the islands in the Archipelago they they had visited so far And it was relatively wealthy as well only possibly outstripped by Asora in value however some could confidently say that this place was indeed superior in every aspect to Asora. Architecture wealth population. Everything.Rydan meanwhile was in a state of turmoil and confusion at the words of the ships Captain who refused to speak even a word to him regardless of how much he pelted him with questions. What did he mean there was no sixth Trial? Did that mean there was no Seventh either? Was this some sort of joke? It astounded him beyond comprehension. If there was no sixth trial then what happened now?So I suppose youve been wondering about the sixth trial.Rydan turned around. Behind him somehow the bearded man from earlier had gone unnoticed and was staring intently at him with his one eye. Rydan merely nodded to him and gave the man his full attention.Are you prepared for a long history lesson?Again Rydan nodded. But he was still a bit confused.Then let me explain to you...The story of the Sixth Trial. The story of the Manalui Archipelago itself. Listen well because I will not be repeating myself......Long ago the Manalui Archipelago appeared very different than at the present time. The islands of Asora and Cestin were primitive and instead home to the Archipelagos greatest. Heroes and warriors for Cestin where stone statues were constructed in honor of these inhabitants and the nobility for Asora. The other islands were mostly tribal heavily based on tradition. But the Archipelago was divided by a rebellion The system was disorganized as each island was headed by a Lord yet all of the seven Lords comprised a council almost like the Reverie. The Lords however rarely got along causing much trouble for the Archipelagos denizens and eventually plunging it into war when disagreements escalated too high. Asora and Cestin against Rycan the seventh island and the rainforest tribe island of Estarius. The other islands remained neutral preferring not to enter the conflict unless provoked.But the war raged on and soon enough the three remaining islands entered the war for the purpose of stopping the feud dragged into a battle that they never wanted involvement in in the first place. There seemed to be no end in sight now no light at the end of the tunnel. The war was at a stalemate as it had been for four years. The Archipelago lived in this utter chaos for so long that it was destroying Manalui as a whole.Later on in the war however...A single man proved that there was hope as there had always been. With his inspiration and his words the war was ended as quickly as it had started with a new unity. Who was this man? What power did he possess that allowed him to quell an entire war with simply the equivalent of a tap of his finger?This hero went by the name of Kyran hailing from his home island of Rycan.....You have one minute to give it up and end this war! announced the warrior Kyran long katana blade clutched tightly in his hand. Otherwise I WILL use the power that hails from the heavens to singlehandedly destroy this conflict myself! We have fought for far too long and our homeland is in ruins because you were all so selfish. This is my one and only warning.From the manor in front of him emerged a man with an evil smirk and bright blue eyes. He was laughing or more accurately cackling. It was almost sadistic. Kyran raised his sword slowly.After these four years of war you think that Im going to surrender to one man? spat the Lord of Asora. You must be so deluded that you believe you could end this war on your lonesome by barely lifting a finger. You may be Rycans greatest warrior but you do not fool me. I utterly refuse your request and instead present you with my own Leave or face the consequences. I will not give up an entire war just because some lowlife scoundrel demands I do so.You will if you want to keep your life Quinn.Quinn narrowed his eyes. Dont act as if you speak by some heavenly authority Kyran he said darkly. You are just as saintly as those who caused this war in the first place.Those who started the war are devils nothing more. Kyrans eyes flickered and gleamed. If I have to step in to uphold the notion of justice then so be it. Manalui has gone far too long in its shattered state. This ends now along with your petty little conflict. I am going to bring the Archipelago and its Seven islands beneath one ruler one King. And that King shall be me.Kyran lifted the shining blade whose name brought fear to even the Archipelagos strongest warriors. The future King of the Archipelago in all of his glory wielded the honored legendary sword...Amaterasu.A single slash of the katana sent a roaring projectile wave through the air crashing into the Lord of Asora and slamming him into the manor behind him which began to collapse! Kyran brought it through the air with another swift motion and sent debris from the former house flying everywhere catapulting into the air and sending a rain of stone and marble over all of Asora.This blade possesses power great enough to rend the entire island of Asora asunder remarked Kyran blade humming with power. If anyone in this Archipelago dares challenge me come here and do it. But alas the war has ended. I declare it over and myself as Manaluis new King and hero!One by one the citizens of Asora bowed to their new Lord......The blade Amaterasu was something legendary the bearded man reminisced staring out at the sea. They were almost at the sixth island. Kyran became the King or the Warlord of Manalui Archipelago and went undefeated unchallenged until his death. Then there was an uproar a war for power which was eventually won by the next proclaimed Warlord who instated the process of the Seven Trials. Not even the Warlord however was able to use the sacred legendary blade Amaterasu with the worry that its name would be disgraced if one were to use it improperly. Ever since that day Manalui has waited for someone worthy to put it to use... But when you signed up for this they neglected to tell you that the Sixth Trial was abolished many years ago. When Lord Katashi left Cestin in ruins.Rydan looked out toward the rich city that was growing ever closer now that they had almost landed. It didnt look ruined. But then again Katashi was said to have taken the Trials years ago! What could he have done that utterly destroyed Cestin during the Sixth Trial so much that the Sixth had to be abolished?Why? What did the Warlord do?His task began the old man. Was to rescue a treasure from a hellhound beast that was trapped and shackled in an arena in the center of the town. But Katashis volatile powers...Destroyed the arena the beast and nearly half of Cestin itself. He went all out against the thing and took it too far. So the Sixth Trial rather than being replaced was simply disposed of. You will be heading straight for the Seventh...The one youre most likely to fail.The man shuddered and did not say another word.....An hour passed. Rydan found himself at a massive iron gate that faced the Seventh island Rycan. The island which housed the Seventh Trial and evidently the Warlord was large and looming. Many mountains were arranged in a crescent shape spanning across the far part of the island. Roaring waterfalls cascaded down and there was some massive bridge built into the mountains leading up to a palace. It had to be the Warlords dwelling. There was no way it could be anything else. Far below all of that and everything going on in the mountainous area was a city bustling with people and warriors. Statues made of stone were all over the place It appeared that they had been moved from Cestin and now the Seventh Island served as the city of war heroes.Warlordintraining. Rydan turned to find a guard bowing to him clasping a spear in his hand. You are aware of what you are about to do. Come with us. After this you will be alone.Rydan followed the guard who had a group of others with him through the gate which swung open upon command. Beyond it was...A single massive cannon that stood idle apparently having not been used for years.What is this? Rydan asked impulsively.Worry not. Get in.Excuse me?The guard looked him dead in the eye. You heard me. No arguments. This is the quickest way of passage to the Seventh and final Trial where you will meet your greatest challenge yet. Load into the cannon and we will fire you away to Rycan.Rydan though he felt unsure about this clambered into the cannon and waited for it all to be over. The Sand Logia was hardly prepared however when a thunderous roar rang through the air and he felt wind whipping past him at incredible velocity! It created so much resistance and friction that Rydan thought he would burst into flames! He soared through the air waiting for it all to be over until he slammed into hard stone turning his body into sand at the last second to avoid being hit with so much blunt force. The sand coalesced back into Rydan who looked up...And saw that he was on the bridge through the mountains...With the Warlords palace in the distance.,StrawHatRPG,d8klpzz,1,t5_3axaa

9281491,0,t1_d8h76ei,Arrival to fishman island was a journey. Traveling the depths of the sea was different than any way of travel Carth had done in the past. Tsars ship passed through the deep sea effortlessly. They passed by giant fish and even sea kings sometimes. Thanks to the fishmen crew they were able to communicate and pass by safely. The group even had a good laugh at a few other ships expense as they were attacked by the creatures of the deep. All the while Tsar did not join in. When he did he made sure Carth was not a part of it. It was obvious he did not want to be friends. That was okay with Carth the man did almost kill Carth. Carth was training with him to become stronger. It was his goal to prove everyone wrong. He had what it took. Tsar gave only one rule no devil fruits. Carth could deal with that. With his newest enhancements of wings and updated arms Carth could hold his own. While he did have some worries on the fact his tech may malfunction when wet he could work around it. He was sure of it. He was ready for whatever the world may throw at him. The world in this case would be a giant fishman and the army of fishman island.The island itself was beautiful. Reefs and coral made up the buildings and landscape. Light shimmered through the bubble that surrounded the island allowing colorful reflections and images to form. It was truly breath taking. Carth was in disbelief. He would be training here. In this place.The ship docked and it was time to leave. Carth followed the rest of the crew. Tsar led them through the city towards the edge of the island. There several long houses sat by a training yard. Weapons weights and obstacles lay spread across the field. Further down a range of some sort was present. Some fishmen were already there firing away water bullets at the practice dummies. Before Carth could move forward more and begin exploring Tsar stopped the unit.Tsar You all know the drill. Get to your barracks and in uniform. Be out here in  minutes to begin training.The fishmen rose their hands to salutes and shouted sir yes sir before running towards the barracks. This left Carth and Aesop. Both were not sure where to go or do. Carth took the initiative and stepped forward to Tsar. He raises one of his robotic hands in a confused manner. Carth wasnt sure what to do now. He came here to train and he knew he would be training with new recruits for the fishman island army but still. No other orders?Carth So uh where do we go?Tsar I told you in the barracks. Get in uniform. You will still be training the same way. No special treatment. Though you will have to work twice as hard. We are all naturally stronger after all.Tsar turned and walked away. He seemed to be heading for the training yard but who know where. Carth really didnt want to anger him the first day. He knew the man could kill him easily and being stuck on his home turf under the sea would mean certain death. Painful death. Carth did not want that to happen. No sir.Carth Well lets go!And so they entered their barracks.Inside they found themselves among many fresh recruits. The term fresh out of water couldnt be more literal. The entire building reeked of fish. Carth tried not to make a face and didnt say anything. Again he didnt want to anger anyone. He quickly found his bunk and sat down on it. On the desk nearby was a uniform for him to wear. Sighing he begins to change. This was his life for the next few years. Best get used to it Carth thought.Right as he was getting into his uniform a horn sounded form outside. At that moment every fishman in the building began exiting. Carth could only guess that it meant it was time to fight. A grin appears on his face. He could do that. Tsar may have bragged about his recruits strength but Carth has  arms and already was very strong to begin with.Carth falls into line behind the exiting fishmen. Once outside they all line up shoulder to shoulder. In front of them Tsar stood. Nothing changed except he now had an army cap of some kind on. Carth guessed he put it on to intimidate but it almost made Carth break out in laughter.Tsar This is how it works. The first year here you will be confined to this area. You will sleep in the barracks and train in the yard and on the range. Those that show progress and potential will be transferred to the arena barracks where I will work with you even closer. You should all know what the arena is. But for some of you guys the arena is a training area for recruits. Every half year a tournament is held. The winner of which will receive a prize.Carth grins at the mention of a prize. He was sure he could kick all the asses of the people beside him. Even if by some chance these fishmen were stronger they are fresh. Never fought before. The only problem was Carth would be stuck to these ground for a full year. It wasnt exactly what Carth wanted but he couldnt really complain he never been to camp!Tsar Now onto the drills. Go!The first drill was simple laps. Carth took the lead right away. Several other fishmen caught up quickly and stuck to his metaphorical tail. They ran for around thirty minutes when Carth started to feel fatigued but noticed the fishmen looked perfectly fine. Not willing to be beaten by them Carth pushed himself even more. Several moments later a whistle is blown. The drill is over for now.However there was no time for Carth to wait around or rest. Before he knew it Tsar was having the recruits pair up. Carth got paired with a pufferfish fishman. Tsar handed both a wooden sword. Once everyone had their wooden weapons he walked to the front of the group.Tsar Now spar. First person to get three hits wins. Begin!Carth jumps into the fray immediately  he aims for a low attack trying to strike the mans legs. The puffer fish is able to dodge easily and counter attacks with a jab at Carths ribs. Carth brings down the hilt of his wooden sword to deflect the attack. The two then begin to circle one another. Carth moves in with a wide upper slash. As he does so legs go of his sword. It flies to the other side of the fishman and Carths opposite robotic hand catches it and hits the fishman on the ribs. One hit for Carth. Before Carth could bring his sword back up though the fishman jabs Carth in the chest. One hit for fishy. Carth rolls out of the way of the next attack and jumps back up. He gives another sweeping low blow that skims the mans shins. As Carth was moving out of range of the fishman once more the fishman throws his sword. It strikes Carth in the head. Carth was caught off guard by the weapon being thrown but now it was over. He had no sword. Carth rushes in on the fishman but the man rolls to the side and kneels next to the sword that lay on the ground. Before Carth can respond he epands himself sending the wooden sword hurdling at Carth. Carth tries to block it but the force was enough to break his own wooden sword. A few moments after the third hit was landed another whistle was blown. It was over. He lost. He got cocky. He really did need to train.Tsar gathered them together once more and sent them in small groups to different stations. This ranged from weight lifting to more running to ranged practiceCarth just used his lasers to punching exercises. This continued all day and well into the night. By the time it was done Carth fell into his bed like a rock. One of the last thoughts he had before passing out completely was simpleThis was gonna be a good two years.,StrawHatRPG,d8shv7j,1,t5_3axaa

With the amount of stamina drain that would come with utilizing so much Haki and Rokushiki Rydan would have thought that Krorko would at least be faltering by now. But the Vice Admiral was resuming as if nothing ever happened! And now he was proceeding toward Lewis using another of his techniques to grant him a large burst of speed propelling him toward his opponent!Must say thank you for the good fight! Krorko exclaimed leg flashing with a coating of Busoshoku Haki and lashing outward into Lewis! Rydan gritted his teeth before reacting as quickly as possible anticipating this. A tall strong barrier of sand spawned into existence in front of Lewis interrupting Krorkos wouldbesuccessful kick before anything too grievous could happen.Lewis. The exhausted Sand Logia reconstructed his body beside his ally but the constant usage of his nearinstantaneous teleportation ability was wearing on him. He noted that he had to stop using it so much or else his stamina would begin to give out. Weve as good as lost here. We need to find a way to get out and fast. Before something bad happens.Rydan had a horrible horrible feeling about this. Retreating seemed to be about their only option at this moment. Rydan was correct they had essentially lost the battle. The overwhelming power of the Vice Admiral was simply just that Too overwhelming to deal with. Nothing they did affected Krorko in a way that allowed visible damage to show almost. But they were going to get in one last hit before they fled. Rydan would make sure of that.Have a nice flight Krorko! yelled Rydan as a violent tornado of sand spewed from the ground right beneath the Vice! The wind and air around it swirled rapidly creating a huge storm with Krorko in the center of it! Some of the sand in the storm condensed and hardened into blades so that Rydans opponent would be vigorously cut up by the time the unrelenting whirlwind ended!Move in Lew! Rydan shouted to his crewmate keeping the storm going to buy them some time as he made an escape plan. He could fly using his Logia powers so he could grab Lewis and make their grand exit after Krorkos next attack. Hopefully they survived whatever he had in store for them after this or they would really be in a pickle.uCallanTS,StrawHatRPG,d8sssc3,1,t5_3axaa
9285701,0,t1_d8t07t6,Cobalt watched as the weapon got closer then quickly jumped out of the way. The clouds of dust and smoke that rose from the attacks indicated just how strong Zena truly was. The solar logia was not going to ignore this fact but he still didnt believe Zena would pose much of a threat to him. He saw as the expression on her face changed she seemed even angrier. Suddenly the spear came down faster than before but Cobalt managed to avoid it once again. This scenario repeated many times except that Zena was beginning to bring down her spear faster and faster with speeds that Cobalt could notice and it made him a bit worried.If she keeps on like this I still cant attack her yet with these solar orbs and I wont be able to avoid these speeds.Cobalt was just barely managing to avoid Zenas spear attacks at these points and he worried that he wouldnt be able to avoid her attacks at this point and if he didnt there would be severe consequences. Eventually Cobalt became too fatigued to try to dodge her attacks and the blunt spear slammed into him. He felt the strength of Zena in the attack and waited for it to catapult him into the ground. Before the weapon could disconnect with him Cobalt quickly shot the two solar orbs from his hands. They had become much larger than before and they moved quickly through the air powered by solar beams from behind. Zena couldnt avoid them and Cobalt heard her roar in pain as the solar orbs made contact and exploded with energy.Cobalt felt his spine crack as he slammed through the ground but he smiled with relief as he heard the Vice Admiral managed to receive his message. Dust and dirt exploded outwards as the solar logia imploded into the ground. His back was in pain his organs all felt very bruised and he was sure a couple of his ribs had broken at this point. Cobalt climbed out from the hole and his eyes darted around looking for Zena. He was surprised to see that she had fallen from his attack and Zena was out of breath and in intense pain. Cobalt could see where the solar orbs hit on her the skin had become intensely scorched almost black. The two huge wounds were immobilizing the Vice Admiral. Cobalt scoffed a bit and figured he would spare Zenas life. He turned around lighting another cigarette and began to run through the battle of Marineford again looking for another challenge.,StrawHatRPG,d8t12xr,1,t5_3axaa

9617816,0,t1_d9y72em,Taken aback slightly at the seemingly warmheartedness and etiquette of Wukongs Commander A Yonko commander of all things! He expected them to be incredibly fierce and intolerant! Rydan pursued the same direction that Simian was already leading him toward mulling the whole situation over. Was it deceit like Flint? Or were the Wukong Pirates truly not what most of the rookies thought that they were? Either way Rydans expression lightened up as he entered the lavish building.He followed Simian to a chamber where the two took a seat at a sizable table. Rydan remembered his own manners and refrained from putting his feet up on the polished wood. After all he had been treated with immense respect already despite his semipublic disapproval of the Wukong Pirates.If I may start this off...Thank you for the kindness. Rarely do I ever get to resolve anything diplomatically. Usually it devolves into chaos or a fight. And with my strong opinions of what you Wukong Pirates did at Marineford being evident I expected a less...warm welcome.Furthermore it only now occurred to Rydan that this man knew his name and epithet. Rydan covered up his subtle shock with a change of posture and one of his rare sincere expressions. Had the Yonko crew been keeping an eye on him like the Emperor himself Wukong announced at Marineford?After giving his gratitude Rydan cleared his throat maintaining a levelheaded attitude despite the fact that he was clearly in the presence of someone much more powerful and influential than he was. What was it that he wanted to speak about? Right. How could he forget? Rydan put on a slight smile.What I want to have a talk about is a sort of business deal. My service whatever youd like me to do assuming it isnt getting me killed in exchange for two simple things. Information on Flint Durai specifically his location and whereabouts. Im sure that you as one of Wukongs Commanders know him and where he is. I have a little...vendetta against him that I would like to get sorted out. And Ive been keeping an eye on him to say the least but hes escaped my sight.Rydan paused to allow the commander to take in this thought before continuing.The second thing I want to ask for is again information. This time as much as you have on Rudyard the pirate Captain from the age of Calico Jack. To my knowledge he was an Impel Down escapee who later allied or joined with Wukongs crew after his duel with him. I want to know anything about him as hes intrigued me to say the least Rydan said. Location former crew abilities just about everything you can gather. And for this I will in return do for you something of your choosing.Rydan hoped that Simian would be willing to make this deal with him. The desire to finally find Flint and attain information on this Rudyard was overpowering.uNPCsan,StrawHatRPG,d9yldlq,1,t5_3axaa

9916004,0,t3_55q10u,Akito During the Timeskip Part Akito stared wistfully at the clouds above rising ever higher above him. Behind he was leaving the family he had thought hed never have. Carth Sed Kanpai all the others. These few months had been the best of his life. He turned his gaze downward turning the letter clasped in his hand. It was sealed in black ink the mark of a dragon clawing outwards in the wax. The seal of his master the seal of the people of Jilao.I promise you Sed. He smiled placing it in his jacket and patting down the pocket. Ill be back someday to see you to the end of the Grandline and to see your tree restored in all its glory. Of course the time will come for you to continue your journey. Amaterasus thoughts floated freely in his mind comforting the man as he returned to his cabin. One of the sailors on board eyed him suspiciously and muttered under their breath though he didnt notice. My repentance will never end but hopefully by giving myself to this cause I will at least be able to feel some relief. Jilao was at war. The fire of revolution had been lit and even now the battle raged. The World Nobles had pushed too far their chains had become too heavy for the people to bear. Akito knew the day would eventually come to pass but so soon? Never in his life. Taking to his cabin and undressing he clambered into the unfamiliar bed and placed Shirubadon on the nightstand next to him. The times are changing thats for certain. Its only a matter of finding your place in the world.All things must come to an end that is simply life. But to rise from the ashes anew that is truly living. Akito snorted at the words of wisdom and fell into an uneasy sleep. His betrayal would be unforgivable but hopefully they would understand and he would be able to seek solace with them once more. It took nearly a months travel alongside favourable winds before Akito felt the cool familiar breeze of the North Blue once again. He smiled tasting the rich salt in the air and stepped out onto the bow of the ship. After reaching Loguetown hed found a large merchant galleon willing to take him north. From his understanding they were delivering supplies to the government forces under attack on Jilao. The sound of gulls chattering in his ears filled him with anticipation at seeing the island once again.Have ye ever been to Jilao lad? One of the sailors spoke his gruff voice scratching at Akitos ears. He turned his heads towards the muscled man and nodded with a smile.Jilao was my home once. I heard about the unrest and wanted to offer my support in its time of need. The man gave him an inquisitive look but pried no further. In all the seas Ive travelled all the places Ive been none match its beauty. Indeed. The warmth of the cherry blossoms and the cool spring winds the bountiful harvests and the plentiful sea.Youve been gone a long time then? The man pulled up a barrel and sat down resting his head against the grain of the railing.A while yes. The oni shuffled leaning Shirubadon up against the side of the ship. Travelling around the Grand Line with some friends of mine. We were having a grand old adventure but they understood I needed to come home for a while. Im sure even now theyre having plenty of fun without me. Akito smiled wistfully pushing the thoughts from his mind and focusing on the task at hand.The Grand Line eh? The man chuckled and shook his head. Youre brave to tread those demon waters though I suppose someone has to do it. Say these friends of yoursAkito frowned sliding one of the daggers in his sleeve tracing the razor sharp edge along his flesh.They wouldnt happen to be the Fallen Pirates would they? It happened in an instant. The bullet left a burning scorch mark in the wood as Akito jerked back just barely avoiding the shot. He spun arcing a slash across the mans throat before he could react. The faint gurgle as he fell to the deck left his dying words silent. Another crack bit the air as the oni dove behind cover grabbing his rifle hed stashed away before setting sail from Loguetown.We know youre there Demon Eye Asai Mocking laughter echoed across the ship from the helm where the captain ought to have been. Youve got yourself a pretty bounty the Marines on Jilao will pay well for your head! He inhaled the sharp smell of rust and dove out from behind the barrel letting loose a quick shot towards his would be assailant above. Moments later another thud boomed across the deck as another merchant bit the dust.Youve got another thing coming if you think a few merchants can take on a wanter criminal! He grinned and reloaded preparing the flame dial in his mouth for use. He coughed then inhaled the stench of sulfur as he loosed a bout of hellfire from within at the sails above. The acrid black flames set the mast alight as a hellish blackred light began to dance across the ship. Screams echoed into the air as the flesh of men and women began to sear. A clever trick might you teach me how you accomplished it? He nodded to the spectral voice in his thoughts hed explain after he got out of this situation. Damned pirate! How dare you set fire to my ship?! Ill make you a slave if I have too. Akitos eyebrow twitched as he pressed himself down on the deck beneath the smoke. How dare he set fire to the ship?From my understanding you attacked me! Crack! Another bullet landed nearby and he switched positions once again. Through the haze he spotted the three snipers near the wheel already lining up another shot. Setting down his rifle he began to tear across the deck at maximum speed already drawing Shirubadon from her sheath. A crimson spray followed the purple slash as he cut the men down with ease. How cocky were they that they could simply attack an armed pirate?Before he could retort the sound of cannon fire in the distance disrupted his thoughts. For a brief moment he considered that it couldnt possibly get any worse but quickly dismissed it. The entire ship shook as the Gin was here creating an earthquake and he grew queasy at the thought. Stabbing his blade into the deck below he steadied himself and waited for the dust to settle. Casting a weary look out across the bloodied waves he witnessed an odd sight. Three ships with unmarked flags hurtled towards the burning merchant vessel cannons already firing once again.Pirates? His world shook again as he held on for dear life. Whatever was happening it wasnt good. A few merchants sure thatd be easy. But three armed vessels? It seems to be that things are no longer going quite so well. I would advise a tactical retreat. He rolled his eyes and pointed at the water.Yes Ill retreat right into the ocean and swim the rest of the way to shore. Then youll die here. He shook his head in exasperation. Of course because it was just that simple. Id rather take my chances with those three and hope they arent marauding marines thank you very much.Unbeknownst to him just across the vanishing gap between the ships a small group of people had gathered at the bow staring at the man arguing with himself on board the vessel theyd just fired upon.Damn it all. Hey you there the ones firing on the ship! I could use some help over here! Brushing away the incessant nagging by Amaterasu he called out to those preparing to board. At best hed be taken prisoner and eventually hed be able to make a daring or desperate escape. At worst hed be executed on the spot.Birds you know often fly away when they are young but eventually return to where they were born. How strange it is then to see a little bird return to the nest.Akitos eyes grew wide as those gathered parted making way for a man dressed in military clothing. Releasing his grasp on his weapon he collapsed to his knees in fear and awe of who was in front of him. An Oni man with greying hair and bright blue eyes. A man whod been dead for a long time. A man hed despised beyond anything hed ever known.His father.,StrawHatRPG,db02vdw,1,t5_3axaa

This man seemed to pack more power every time he hit! It was unbelievable how his strength output had increased so remarkably since the beginning of the fight which was still near!When he recovered however the enraged Giant growled and smashed his foot onto the ground sending what felt like a miniature tremor throughout the island as the ground beneath split and cracked. He leered at Kainui not daring to take his eyes off of his opponent. Regardless he had been undermined and he wasnt going to let this greenhorn nobody snatch his victory streak away from him!Puny little fishman. Youll end up nothing more than a crimson splotch on the ground by the end of this you mark my words!It was then that there was a swish and an overwhelmingly loud thud of an axe that slammed into the ground which rumbled as the force from the blow formed cracks and crevices each of them massive in size!

It successfully stopped Kumakaran in his attack but it wouldnt be for long. Despite the aid of her haki Manamis strength was still puny in comparison to the Giant. Meaning he would pulverize her within seconds!Youre going to be seeing stars little brat! Fear the might of the Giant Pirates! Krahahahaha!It was then that Abaddons attack was just in the process of connecting. Kumakaran swung his foot back disengaging from Manami and stumbling back enough that Abaddon did not hit him with the desired impact. In fact Kumakaran nullified the damage even more by coating himself in thick busoshoku haki which did not disappear afterward.He roared and charged at the duo making great strides as the now halfbearhalfGiant aspired to finish them off by clamping his remaining arms claws around Abaddon. Once he was fastened around him his plan was to rend his flesh from his bones bit by bit until he was out of commission and ready for the cemetery.Simian was not expecting an attack of the caliber he received. He was violently slammed into the ground coughing and sputtering as blood was left in a streak leading toward his crumpled form. Simian got up once again however. It was amazing what these Commanders could take. But it was to be expected of people on their level of course.Wukongsama will be proud after tonight. He will see that Wukan and Ranga have been successfully defended from the likes of you scum.

10186830,0,t3_5l8iv1,The Golden Bell At SeaDont Feat the ReaperAnother nightmare Plagued Walvens sleep. Blood dripping from the ceiling Staining Walvens clothes steam coming off of him and the pools of blood on the fleshy ground. He was sitting by a campfire made of bones. He heard something take a sloshing step behind him. He drew Ryo Kitai instantly and slashed at it. The blade made a few clinks as it passed through. Walven didnt bother looking at what it was. But he could tell it had bones so it wasnt the standard insect beast he was fighting. He lifted a burning bone and looked behind him. On the ground was none other than Xier. Cleaved in two by his own blade. Walven cried out as he fell to his knees to inspect the state of his friend. A mechanical hand was raised up as if it were reaching out. On Walvens friends face were several emotions. Horror Confusion. He squinted as if saying Why? and the light faded from his eyes but his arm remained outstretched. Walven looked down at his hand he was now carrying Ryo Kitai. He heard a laughing come from the back of his head accompanied by a rumbling. The voice continued to laugh as Walven was still crying out. He threw down the sword and on his hand he could see blood dripping down now pouring out of his hand from his very pores. He could see tiny ethereal serpents burrowing into his hand kicking up bits of flesh on their way down. He could see them digging into his arm his veins. They made their way to his eyes before he jerked awake in the ships quarters and grabbed his guitar. It was just acoustic but he was going to get a self contained electric guitar with amplifier soon. He floated up to the crows nest to play his guitar. It was about am by Walvens estimation. He began picking the strings on his guitar. Playing composition he called Lonely Light after the only star he could see in the sky. The full moon was too bright for him to see any others. He felt something cry out in the distance and he felt a familiar shiver roll up his spine but it felt different seemed hostile. Walven stood up and jumped down from The Crows Nest. As he landed on the deck the thud resounded through the ship. His legs partially transformed into gas to negate the fall damage. When he stood up he saw Xier looking tired angry and confused. Walven punched Xier on the shoulderSorry if i woke youXier was not phased by Walvens apologyTheres a new ReaperXiers eyes widened at the news and Walven heard another voice from the other side of the deck. Abaddon saying Reaper you say? Walven jerked around to see his captainDid i just wake everyone up?Walven heard yet another voice saying Mr.Walvie didnt wake me up!

Something changed about him he seemed like a mad dog now. This was a shit idea.Mono charged himself with electro shocking Carths claw. The force he was applying loosened which gave Mono the chance to kick himself off of Carth and roll out.Mono bounced back on his feet he was visibly worried nowMono You alright Carth? You seem a bit different suddenly. Mono spun his staff charging it once again. This guy was insanely fast he had to find a way to corner him. The faster he got this done the better he wasnt concerned with absorbing energy anymore he just wanted to finish the training without loosing his head. Mono launched his staff at Carth still infused with electricity spinning horizontally. As the staff spun towards Carth Mono used the little energy he absorbed from their collision to give him a small boost leaping into the air then coming down towards Carth with an axe kick. ,StrawHatRPG,dc07o3a,1,t5_3axaa

10331459,0,t1_dc8whg5,Lewis brain continued flowing with ideas he already had several arcs plot polished and quite a few of the main characters fleshed out. He had decided the crew would be called the Straw Hats as the Luffy would wear one all the time. Lewis looked over to his notebook which contained everything he planned to write and smiled with deep passion.Time to get a mangaing he said out loud feeling a little silly after those last words. Lewis quickly left his room picking up his money as he did so. He sprinted to the mangabook shop he had visited earlier in the week to ask them about some proper manga equipment and possibly a guide to help him work through it.The shop owner was glad to see Lewis back again he clearly didnt get many people buying his stuff. The man began offering the new Shounen Leap copy to him but he quickly cut him off though he still did want the copy urging him about any the equipment he wanted. The shop owner nodded and went into the back fetching pens paper and even some guides. Lewis quickly forked over the cash and began running back to the ship telling the shop owner hed be back to show him his manuscript of Chapter One.Upon making his way to the ship he immediately started flicking through the guides reading up on the process of making a manga. In doing this Lewis learned a lot about constructing manga and even how to go about publishing it. Lewis quickly began drawing up a storyboard a sort of prototype of the chapter. Lewis penciled it in his first chapter which would have the backstory of the protagonist featured in it. After completing it he began changing the panels moving them around and trying to emphasize Luffy and his goals.The first chapter was fairly long as was customary with a beginning manga. After finishing up his storyboard Lewis was confident in his story and was ready to begin the proper manuscript. Lewis set the storyboard to the side and brought out his pen and ink along with the numerous tones and screen effects. And with that he began to drawHow Lewis sees itHe moved his hand of to his ruler and began drawing out the panels. Each box perfect in size and weighting. Lewis cracked his fingers and dipped the pen in the black ink beside him. He gracefully moved his hand from the ink container to the blank canvas and pushed it against it. The ink a perfect match for the paper. Lewis hand smoothly moved around the page his pen following it as if it were an extension to his body. The characters flew to life as they were penned in. The backgrounds followed shortly after even the simplest of items had amazing elegance and seemed to speak out with passion. Lewis moved onto the next panel its contents becoming more perfect and more pristine holding true emotion that spoke to the universe. Lewis continued on finishing page after page the story the characters the setting the dialogue and emotions all fusing into one glorious masterpiece.How it really happenedLewis placed his pen into the ink his hands shaking with raw excitement and nervousness. Lewis placed the pen carefully on the page and began moving it around trying to create the characters. However they came out as dis proportioned and scary looking with almost zero detail it was uncanny how bad they looked. No matter how many times he tried he had no success in drawing them. The next step were the backgrounds which in comparison were much better but that it isnt saying much. The shapes were coherent and could be deciphered with some careful looking. Lewis continued each page while he was improving it was still sub par artwork.,StrawHatRPG,dcf4mxd,1,t5_3axaa

Abaddon couldnt contain how he felt about Trinitys first attempt at a threat but when all it drew from the bikers was laughter he shot his fist straight up and blasted a hole through the ceiling with the pure force of his punch. The bikers jaws dropped in unison and Abaddon walked over to the woman who had shot him before and asked Trinitys question again. Where can we find Slink? Spit it out now or we will hurt you. Trinity just make sure not to say please next time. It takes a little sting out of your words. Also do this.Abaddon turned back to the woman and allowed fire to jet out of where his mouth and eyes should be then spoke up once again. Wheres Slink! I wont ask again!He looked to the rest of the bikers but none of them would speak up. Abaddon thought his threats were failing but before he continued he noticed their eyes werent on him. Looking towards the entrance Abaddon saw a woman standing there. She was at least six foot three and had an hourglass figure. Her bright red hair stood out against her tanned skin and Abaddon was transfixed by her beauty as she started walking over to him. She stopped right in front of him and suddenly blew on his mask to put out the flames then smiled devilishly as she spoke. Well look at this. I see youre keeping my underlings thoroughly entertained. Hmmm though I wouldnt mind being entertained either. Why dont you come play with me instead.Abaddon couldnt take his eyes off of the woman but he knew he couldnt let himself seem easy to manipulate by the opposite sex so he tried to hide his infatuation behind his usual attitude. Im expected to entertain a woman who lacks respect? Normally one introduces herself before they try to solicit a person.The woman seemed to pout at the choice of the word solicit but her smile came back as she brushed up against Abaddons arm. Hmph fair enough I suppose. My name is Celia Brune and I think we should take this conversation elsewhere.Abaddon yanked his arm away and took a step back before replying to her. I dont think thats a good idea for many reasons the biggest of which right now happens to be were looking for this man.He pulled the picture of Slink out once again then held it up so she could see it. Her smile faded as she looked at the picture and when she spoke Abaddon was happy for the first time since entering the Salty Spittoon. Oh yeah thats Slink. I know exactly where that rat bastard is tonight. You know if youre looking to find him I could help you out. Actually Ill lead you right to him.A smile crossed Abaddons face as he nodded his head in acceptance of the offer then motioned for Trinity to come over so they could set off.

The runes on the cavern were in a language she couldnt speak she considered bringing one of the tontatta to help her but Dopple convinced her otherwise.Cant we do anything!?Sed ran over and punched the rubble yet again sending shards of rocks flying throughout the cavern. Some shards phased through Dopple harmlessly.Well we could do the obvious.Sed cocked her head in confusion.Continue down this cavern until we find treasure traps or certain doom? Sed was getting too excited.Dopple sighed and shook her head.No have me phase through the rocks and swap places with you. Then I come crawling back out.The obvious hit Sed like a freight train. Onward Dopple! She placed her foot on a large boulder and made a war rallying motion. Dopple rolled her eyes and phased through the rocks swapped with Sed and came out again.Now to mark where this is....Sed stood back and dark tendrils crept down her sleeves onto her hand. They coalesced into dark purple claws she held her hand to the sky as it continued to grow. Now over three times her height she covered the claws in black armament haki. ROCK SMASH!Sed let out a scream and slammed her claws onto the side of the mountain leaving a dark claw mark over fifteen feet long.Dopple cocked her eyebrow Rock smash? Thats the best you could come up with? Its honest at least.The two combined and large batlike wings sprouted from Seds back.Now that we found the cave lets grab Asai! He might be able to read those odd runes.The flight took half as long due to their combined forces and they arrived at charon not more than an hour and a half later.Sed crashed through the kitchen doors to find Asai sitting with his sword absentmindedly stirring a pot.Asai! I found a thing and you can maybe read it? Lets go! Dopple will carry you!Dopple shot Sed a look of surprise and sighed before jumping into Asai. black wings sprouted from his back and he could hear Dopple inside his head.Ill do all the flying you just make sure to cut any rocks that might come down on us.And with that they began their flight back to the crater Sed marked.uKikronze,StrawHatRPG,dcoyvjy,1,t5_3axaa

However it allowed Ayokunle to move in such a way that Sarika would be always between him and Shota so the gunslinger would have a harder time landing a shot without hitting his partner in the process. He also couldnt see what Ayokunle was doing at least not very well. The fishman planned to keep his true abilities a secret to reduce the chances of a seastone bullet disabling them.Bearing that in mind he pushed Sarikas rapier aside while stepping in the opposite way ending up beside the fencer who was still decelerating. With a quick leap towards her Ayokunle managed to dodge the bullets which pierced the air where he was standing just a moment ago. He slashed at Sarika with Kirin the swordswoman easily blocking it. Now when he was shielded by the womans body from Shotas shots Adetokunbo had the time to exchange blows with her. Both of them were able to block or dodge all hits from the other the fishman was still moving carefully to not let the gunslinger get an easy hit. But the battle was going nowhere and Sarika didnt look tired at all. Knowing that he would falter sooner than his opponents Ayokunle pointed his left arm at the fencer simultaneously slashing with Kirin at her head and sending five wolfram carbide bullets at her belly.Ayokunle Quintuple bullet.He didnt feel pain in the arm because it was artificial.

Was the entire Void Crew just a bunch of murderers that took pleasure in their violent actions?Although this bothered Ryen he decided not to pay it too much attention. The rookie must be getting tired therefore he would jump in and help his compatriot with his fight. He had been sitting crosslegged leaning against a boulder his arms behind his head and in a smooth movement he stood up and headed towards Sarika.

11762788,0,t3_650upu,RegaliaKobss set out with a mission. He knew he had to prepare for any fights coming up and had a few ideas. Kobss began making his trip walking through beaches even through mountains. Kobss came across a small house in the mountains. It reminded him of his old home that he grew up in although it was smaller. Kobss was slightly lost and decided he needed some help. Kobss knocked on the door. Kobss was taller than the house was so he stepped back in hope that he would be less intimidating. The door opened and there was a older man. He was mostly bald with grey hair on the lower back and sides. He also had glasses breathed as if he was congested. He was taken aback by Kobss size and look at first.Hello what do you want? The old man spoke as if he was congested as well. Kobss could understand the man being unsure of him at first. Hello there sir. My name is Kobss and i am looking for a forest around here. I seem to be a bit lost Ive been traveling for about half a day trying to find one or maybe even a few good trees. Kobss was silent for a moment as he waited for the man to speak. The man seemed to be thinking for a moment before he responded. There is one not far from here that I get fire wood for my family. You seem like a capable man. Id be glad to show you but you gotta help me get some for my family. We are almost out and it gets very cold when it gets dark around here. The old man opened up the door more where Kobss could see a younger girl probably around  and another girl very small possibly  years old. Kobss didnt notice how muscular the man behind the door was until after he opened the door.Oh thank you so much sir. I would gladly help get fire wood. I am going there to cut down some trees for myself. If you cut fire wood does that mean you have an ax? That would make my job a lot easier. Also do you have a wagon we could carry the wood back on? Kobss laughed a bit scratching the back of his head. You all the way out here without an ax or a way to take it back? I dont know if youre that strong or just stupid. The old man turned to the two girls. Tell your mother ill be back and i am going to get fire wood. The two girls nodded their heads. The old man closed the door and showed Kobss over to a Wagon. He grabbed an ax and put it inside the wagon for now.They started off towards the forest. Kobss grabbed the wagon following the old man Hey i never caught your name sir Kobss asked politely. Yes you said your name was Kobss right? My name is Jorgan nice to meet you and thank you again for helping me Kobss replied No thank you Jorgan this is more important than me just needed wood. Ill need to carve a bunch of them too into different weapons. Jorgan was confused What would you need wooden weapons for? Training? You young people these days with your crazy ideas. Kobss laughed a bit and changed the conversation.They arrived at the forest not long after. Kobss began work immediately to cut down trees. It wasnt going fast enough for Kobss liking. The ax blade was slightly rusted. Kobss took his finger covering it in diamond and slid it down the blade to coat it in diamond. The man watched Kobss do this freaking out at first when Kobss ran his finger down the blade but then seeing it shine and no blood. Kobss then took the ax cutting trees down with ease. He cut down  good sized trees. The wood wasnt very good quality but that was alright. He then cut them down fitting some in the wagon. Kobss thought for a moment there was no space left in the wagon he began putting sticks together lining them up in a big basket. He put the wood together covering it in diamond to keep it connected. Kobss then began putting the remaining wood inside the basket. Kobss being a big man was able to make a very big basket to carry the remaining wood.Jorgan stared in awe at Kobss creating diamond to keep the basket Thats some power you have there. Its impressive you must be a very rich man to be able to do that Kobss laughed for a moment Yes its not surprising you say that but it wears off after a bit of time would create a lot of unhappy people that way. Kobss and Jorgan went back to Jorgans house. Jorgan invited Kobss to eat some dinner with him family and stay there for the night. I would love to said kobss. I can also begin carving these. While Kobss was waiting for dinner he began carving the wood into blades. He turned his finger into diamond and began carving with that. He had outside as he didnt want to scare the kids and so he didnt make a mess inside Jorgans home.He began cutting the wood into blocks and planning out how long he wanted the swords. They didnt have to be very long but about an average sword. Kobss cut the wood into rectangles then would cut the sword shape out of the rectangle. He would scrape any of the extra parts of the sword to make the blade thinner at the tip of the wooden blade. For the handle he did a simple cross handle making lines going up the base of the handle. The sides of the hilt kobss made into a point. Another sharp edge would be nice even if they are just wood. Carving more and more until they were perfect. He would do this one by one examining them to be sure they were to his liking. He made them all in the same detail. Kobss wasnt a fan of swords as it was and making them with the same detail kind of a bore. To make the words effective and quickly he had to ignore the voice in his head telling him to customize each and every one.Kobss got through about half of the wood he was going to make swords out of when Jorgan said the food was ready. Youre a fast worker i am impressed. Kobss responded Yea i am a blacksmith so making swords is nice work for me even if they are made of wood. Kobss walked into the house and sat down next to the family. He decided to sit on the floor so he wouldnt be so much taller than everyone and was closer to the table. He ate the food quickly enjoying the friendliness of the family. They seemed really close. The mother was around  years old and very soft spoken. The mother and children were scared of Kobss at first but warmed up to him enjoying his company and the whole table laughing very loudly together.After dinner Kobss went back outside and the kids followed to play. The sun was setting but the Older sister old entertained the younger as they spoke to Kobss. The sun set down and Jorgan brought out a few candles for Kobss to use as he continued working. Kobss was very appreciative. The others went to sleep soon after that as Kobss kept working on carving the wood into weapons. Almost all of the wood was used up when Kobss had a spur of the moment idea. He decided to make a couple shields.The shields kobss wanted to make would have to be large. He decided to make them about ft tall each. Kobss he began carving at the top of a rectangular block of wood. He cut two diagonal cuts making a point at the top. Kobss sharpened it carving piece by piece. He then turned it upside down to see how it would look. It seemed like it could be sharp enough to maybe go into some mud since it was made of wood. He then began working on the detail. He lined them carving a rectangle down the front of the shield. Then he carved a circle in the middle. Kobss drew a square around the circle and a line from the rectangle corners to the corners of the square. Kobss made sure to shave the edges of the shield to make a perfect  foot rectangle and a little more at the bottom with the point. When kobss was finished he decided to give the rest of the woodto Jorgan on top of what he had already got for him. Kobss slept for the night outside. He was used to it and didnt want to wake Jorgan and his family up.Kobss awoke to sunlight in his eyes. A cool breeze flowing making the grass dance. He didnt wait long before he began putting everything inside of his makeshift diamond basket. Kobss was almost finished when Jorgan came out. Leaving so soon? Kobss yawned Yes i have to get going as soon as possible I am sure my crew is already missing me. Kobss pointed to the very large stack of wood You shouldnt have to get wood for a very long time. Might have to cut it up a bit more but plenty there. Kobss said goodbye to Jorgans family not long after and made his way back to his ship. He was happy to see the small family living their lives peacefully and enjoying themselves. Kobss had completed his goal though and had to get back. He had big plans after all.OOC Rewards San If possible Id like to have made lots of wooden swords possibly around  please and a couple large wooden shields ltuRewardssan,StrawHatRPG,dgtcaps,1,t5_3axaa
