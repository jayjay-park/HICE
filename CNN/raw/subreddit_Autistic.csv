1003571,0,t3_25hyr8,As an autistic adult I dont disclose that I am autistic to people who arent intellectually capable of comprehending autism theres nothing to gain from it tis fruitless usually. Over time you can find patterns in peoples behaviour that signal who to avoid selfdisclosing your disability. Usually people who are patient understanding and open to experience are the ones you want to be around because they wont care so long as you arent an asshole.I dont find myself in a lot of situations this gal delineates the only thing that matters as an adult is being socially relevant with an ability to respond no matter your quirks. I do agree with the part where she talks about social survival though thats how it feels like day in day out but on a macro level most successful people work hard to be socially relevant but I suppose they have a jump start on us as there cup doesnt get full so fast.Professionally employers cant discriminate based on disability if you have the skills the job requires except if youre required to be social in your job then youd be discriminated against based on your inability to respond in various circumstances.,Autistic,chid42a,4,t5_2ujlz
