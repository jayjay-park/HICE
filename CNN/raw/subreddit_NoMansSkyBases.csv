9931065,0,t3_5hq3z2,I already posted this in the main sub but this one could use some content so here you go.For those who didnt see the original post I tried to recreate the Sky Tower from Oblivion in creative mode with the aim of making it my home base in my normal mode game.I made a lot of changes this time and maxed out the complexity limit but Im finally done and happy with the finished design.
