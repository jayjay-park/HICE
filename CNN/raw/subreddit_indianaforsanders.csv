3839084,0,t3_34acvm,Bloomington! Ive been following Bernie since around  when I first discovered him through reddit. I support Bernie because he has a strong record on the issues that I care about and is not beholden to big money interests. My intention is for this place to be the real deal for organizing and I look forward to working with everyone here during the primaries then in the national election. It will be valuable to have people who have volunteered before in past campaigns. Thanks for joining us.,indianaforsanders,cqtw0ln,4,t5_380yz

6529770,0,t1_czufywf,Yes!  You can phone bank you can text you can canvas.  Just because you wont be able to vote doesnt mean you cant be involved in the process my  year old sister is involved as well and she loves it.  If you can get out to the event wed love to have the help!  ,indianaforsanders,czuqa76,1,t5_380yz

7415281,0,t3_4guu3c,IDK if you were part of the signature collection effort to get Bernie on the ballot last fall but that was a great deal of work and was only  signature needed  in every district. This is completely a distraction from canvasing until Tuesday and Phone banking until the Democratic Primaries are over.  Also Jane Sanders has said Bernie wont run as an independent.  Bernie is staying in to get his delegates to put together a Progressive Liberal Platform for the Democratic Party at the convention if he falls short.  That platform will not be passed if he abandons the Party before then.  ,indianaforsanders,d2l2i7k,1,t5_380yz
