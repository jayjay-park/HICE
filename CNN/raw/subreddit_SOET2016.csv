6800810,0,t3_48qs3z,I think that this course will be about changing our perspectives on the world and about analysing the specific ways in which we think and solve problems. This is something that I tend to do quite often but hopefully this course will further broaden the spectrum of thought that I am capable of. I am also very interested to find out about how we learn and in which ways we can improve the learning process. Im always excited to learn new things and to discuss seemingly insignificant details at extraordinary lengths. Its also of particular interest to me hearing about other peoples thoughts and opinions on matters and so I was very pleased to hear about the increased level of discussion among groups for this course. After just our first week I am already so excited for this course the new approach is very interesting and I for one am a fan. Bring on week !,SOET2016,d0n5y0q,1,t5_3cxdl
6872676,0,t3_48qs3z,I think the content in this course will both surprise and inspire me. I hope I get some fascinating knowledge about life in general and may be able to reflect more in the future. I am also excited to improve my communication skills through discussing topics in class especially since English is my second language. ,SOET2016,d0vbvzf,1,t5_3cxdl
7091031,0,t3_49snl3,I think a lot of the information that we process during a normal day happens without our awareness such as verbal communication and reading peoples body language. Because of this when you are in an area that is not suitable for your brain to process this information such as a noisy area these processes become much more difficult. I was surprised to hear that taking a higher paying job that is further away may make you less happy because of the commuting time. ,SOET2016,d1k4y8h,1,t5_3cxdl
7170814,0,t3_4as47b,I do share Dannys skepticism to a certain extent because its hard to think about our thinking let alone think about improving our thinking. Although I think there are some instances where we can change our perspective of something for example which may then lead to us changing our views and changing or improving the way we think about those certain things.I havent been fooled to my knowledge however it might be fun to fool others... scientifically of course...Instances where I am walking around my house to different rooms I tend to automatically walk to my room when I go upstairs sometimes without intending to go there at all. Just the every day routine sort of stuff I tend to think quickly about. As for thinking slow perhaps just any decision I need to consider for a moment first or a task I havent done before too many times and need to stop and think how to do it. I think I will take heed to Dannys advice which will help me to not make too many stupid mistakes or to rush through doing things that could turn out terribly. ,SOET2016,d1t95st,1,t5_3cxdl
7317297,0,t3_4eq1jp,Casinos make millions because they are aware of these faults in our logic such as the gamblers fallacy. I think the fact that they show previous outcomes of numbers and colours in roulette demonstrates this  it makes it all too easy for someone to fall into the trap of thinking that a red is due. They know how probability works they are aware that they will make longterm gains despite giving these shortterm rewards  thats why the house always wins.The intuitive scientist I think is a useful albeit flattering metaphor. I think its true that we operate using a somewhat crude scientific method of asking why and then on occasion using systematic trial and error  but sometimes our intuition can fail us and instead of testing our own intuitions we get lazy and just readily believe what are flawed system decides to think.Yes Im convinced  the experiment is probably our only tool at figuring out how the world works and I think its so powerful because it acts as a buffer between our own subjective interpretations and intuitions and whats actually happening out in the world.Id  definitely prefer seeing patterns that dont exist it can be annoying sometimes to have false ideas of randomness or hearing satanic lyrics in every backwards version of a song but I sure dont mind recognising that things that are dropped from a height will consistently fall  and so I wont wake up one morning and decide to walk out the window of my fourth floor apartment.,SOET2016,d29xds4,2,t5_3cxdl
7398064,0,t3_4fs29x,As it has been said everyone is entitled to their own opinion and everyone has their own opinion and its been stemmed from a wide variety of sources. So if I happened to be thinking about the  leads I would try to employ them. Since it is hard to change someones mind and it requires a lot of effort it would be difficult to be persistent and forceful to get your opinion across. So we would have to use suggestions and ideas to not come across as rude to subtly provide evidence about an alternative way of looking at the situation. Regression of the mean is a concept that puts many things into perspective. For example in my training sessions some days fluctuate between good and bad performance so you either feel positively or negatively. This is not usually related to anything in particular. Therefore when training returns to a regular state it is reinforced that its just a regression to the mean. ,SOET2016,d2j40e5,1,t5_3cxdl
7410759,0,t3_4fs29x,I definitely think I will try to use the six leads I find them fascinating and definitely something to think long and hard about. I would like to use the six leads in my everyday life and I hope that they will help me to distribute concepts into ones I can believe and ones I cannot. I think the concept of changing someones mind or opinion about a topic is fascinating. I myself am definitely a very rigid and inflexible person when it comes to the way I think but I would like to be able to expand my knowledge and be open to new experiences and concepts about the world. I think it could be difficult to use the six leads around more closed minded people people who are not educated on some of the topics discussed in this course. It is natural to protect your opinion and close yourself off to anyone trying to change it. I think it could be done though if I emphasise that I mean no offence and simply wish to expand their minds a bit. I hope more open minded people would welcome the idea of the six leads and open to understanding and education. I have changed family members understandings of science when they believed something to be true and queried me I was happy I could talk to them about certain concepts and what really is going on. With regression towards the mean I can only think of the example of mood swings. I can definitely understand the frustration of having to deal with the worst day every  where absolutely everything seems to go wrong. I also have experienced having fantastic days where everything I touched turned to gold. I know that I will have great and not so great days and that everything balances out. ,SOET2016,d2kjz6n,1,t5_3cxdl
7417457,0,t3_4fs29x,In terms of the using the six leads at the dinner table I think it would still be very hard to even gently use these attempts to change peoples opinions. I think it is hard for people to accept the idea of evidence independent of what ever that evidence might be in relation to. I think the mythbusters experience of peoples reaction to the plane and conveyor belt belief kind of shows what could possibly happen at the dinner table about many issues that people believe. I think it also depends on how important the issue is  to some extent. For example I would be less concerned about appearing to be rude regarding evidence based cancer treatments than something like planes on conveyor belts. I am not sure that I have ever changed someones mind I think it would be a really difficult thing to do and also difficult to really know if you had or not. I dont think this is a cop out either there is a great deal of evidence about all sorts of things that in general people tend to disregard even though many people give the impression that that they know things. Kind of the difference between what people say they know or espouse and what they actually do maybe?My life is a regression to the mean. I think people are afraid of these kind of concepts because of some kind of desire to be exceptional in some way. Fact is though I have had a few moments in my life but overall I am really just average and I think basically that means that basically on balance everybody is. I think people maybe use those times when they are on top of their game to inform themselves about themselves. Maybe thats good for peoples self esteem but it probably blurs reality a bit. ,SOET2016,d2lbf5j,1,t5_3cxdl
7802058,0,t3_4dq4zi,Im as super convinced as I could be without reading the actual metaanalysis and studies myself that rereading and cramming are not good learning strategies. Ive written a big generatesummarize on my whiteboard at home to remind myself that generating content myself will lead to better long term retention so Ill definitely change my studying strategies in light of that. As far as cramming goes Ill probably continue to do it. I never thought it was better for learning instead its always happened as a function of my prodigious laziness and disorganisation. I would say that for sure advertising capitalises on the concepts of fluency and cognitive ease and I thinking knowing will help protect me sometimes. Its pretty idealistic to say Ill be totally immune though. Even plenty of my psyc lecturers have discussed that despite being intimately familiar with all the biasheuristiccognition literature they still fall prey to the availiability heuristic better than average effect ect..,SOET2016,d3t0fy4,1,t5_3cxdl
