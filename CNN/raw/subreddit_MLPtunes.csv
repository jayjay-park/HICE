1049761,0,t3_2631ia,I get the feeling that we need a website dedicated to digging through the plethora of music and showcasing the best songs and artists. Kind of like what EQD does but... better.,MLPtunes,chnm293,1,t5_2snmd

4004070,0,t1_crcofyf,They did have a difference however. Once that simply only instrumental while the other adds in vocals with the instrumental one. I wanted to keep both of them separate and I still want both versions to be viewed because I know that people may want to see it again with vocals so are you suggesting that I have to do some more work externally to make sure the viewers indeed do so?.,MLPtunes,crcp1cw,1,t5_2snmd

4529043,0,t1_ct1i7sg,Sorry for the bogus number days have past so lets say the  past days   releases on the subreddit and i added  ones. Way over  missed then ? And i didnt shared everything either.To be fair isnt the th ot the users will not see the songs because submitted in one batch also a bogus statement ? twistare I dont say that this subreddit is bad but it could be so much more !Comparisons with others subs is kinda irrelevant from my point of view i prefer seeing places people and projects aiming for better things than just levelling from the bottom.The trend community is dying is surely not directly here but its more because we are more a sharing nexus than a discussing board. We had a few discussions about this like the thread from ponyfirestone a while ago though.Was more speaking about it as a whole not only this sub this sub being one of the frontlines showing that its false and sharing music from the community.,MLPtunes,ct1islw,1,t5_2snmd
