6052550,0,t3_3yahrc,How big is the gap between the wings and the shuttle if you build it like this?  I tried modding it in LDD and ended up placing the hinges further out making slight changes to the outside of the wing to accomodate them.,legostarwars,cycznqv,1,t5_2tpjq
6080168,0,t3_3yrb9b,UCS Slave One over TFA Falcon any day. Slave One was the first and so far only UCS set I have and it is my favorite. Ive been looking at getting the Falcon but it has more play features than it has display features so for now its been a pass for me.,legostarwars,cyglcsb,5,t5_2tpjq
6115991,0,t3_3zbkqu,Disclaimer i dont own any of those sets.Ive heard a lot of people talk about how the Slave  is an exceptionally fun build and is very prominent when displayed. If you love the x wing and want a very good model of it then i would say get the Red Five version. As for choosing between the Slave  or Xwing it depends if you like Boba Fetts ship or the X wing more. Boba Fetts minifigure also looks pretty good. ,legostarwars,cyktph0,1,t5_2tpjq

My grandfather gave it to me as a Christmas gift as a kid which over the years got broken apart and separated and building it again brought back so many great memories of Lego and of him.

11675054,0,t3_66l8ql,This depends on what sets youre building. Some sets with exclusive pieces arent worth doing this with because some of the pieces alone end up costing you more money than you would have spent just buying the set as a whole.,legostarwars,dgjdtmd,8,t5_2tpjq
11761017,0,t1_dgra4ep,It depends what you are after amp if you get it on sale.  If you have any of the other HothEcho base sets than its probably not as most of the set is just cobbled together from previous sets.  However if you tried to buy most of these older Hoth sets then you will probably pay close to the same.  At RRP I personally dont think its worth it.  However in Australia Target are currently selling it  price.  At au Its worth it.  From the day it was announced I said I wasnt getting it but I just laybyed one on Monday.,legostarwars,dgt52z4,1,t5_2tpjq
11761094,0,t3_67ixft,I own them all they are all great sets.Tydirium  This is an awesome set when on display especially in flight mode and using a Laser Labs stand. Its an Iconic ship which adds to the cool value. Slave   the most expensive but as almost everyone has said the best of the lot.  Again Iconic ship and impressive build.YWing UWing amp Striker you can probably get all  for the same cost as Slave . Id probably still go for Slave .I rank themSlave TydiriumYWingTIE StrikerUWing,legostarwars,dgt5e9r,1,t5_2tpjq
