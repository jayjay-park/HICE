Those are only available at those times. Thats what your agreeing to so those are it. The second type of discount is there as an offer to compensate you for trouble a discount expiring or you cant afford it anymore. Those are not always there though. Theres a number of factors that play into the availability of them. People get upset that we wont offer them anything when in reality we just dont have anything to give them. And supervisors dont have more than we do. ,Fios,cva7dxx,2,t5_2syiv

8647680,0,t1_d6l0voq,That model is unable to do more than Mbitsec ethernet Mbps in practice under ideal conditionsIt has a MIPS KEc processor which is rather weak and it likely does routing functions on the CPU rather than in hardware. If that is the case then Mbps WAN to LAN through NAT is quite possibly the best it can do. I have not checked if it lacks the ability to do routing in hardware but I am not aware of any TPLink models with that capability and I doubt that this model would have it.I suggest returning it and getting these insteadThey cost more than the TPLink models but less than the high end routers like the Linksys EA. However it will work better than either of them. Just run the wizard in your web browser to configure the ERX then setup the Smart Queue using the results of a speed test and finally configure the Unifi AP using the cell phone app. Be sure to enable airtime fairness on the Unifi AP.This will give you a better quality internet connection than what is used at many technology startups in Silicon Valley. You can confirm the quality by using speedtest.dslreports.com. The buffer bloat score is the most important one.,Fios,d6mkla9,2,t5_2syiv
8701369,0,t3_4z0b2m,i just went through this myself you have another option.  if you live in a house and can run an ethernet cable from the ONT you can call VZN and have them switch on the ethernet port of your ONT.  at that point you can run an ethernet directly into your ASUS router.  If you have TV and use some advance features DVR remote viewing VOD then youll need to do some more advanced setup.  and you may still need to upgrade the router.  i decided to go the ebay route i picked up a Rev I actiontec for  shipped going rate is about .  The way i look at it it will take me  months for payback.  And since the Rev I is the latest actiontec its a good chance that they wont end support too soon.  the problem with the quantum is the high priceeven on ebay its around  so thats a much longer payback period and more chance it gets unsupported.  the switch was very easy i use an older actiontec in my living room as a MOCAgtethernet bridge and even that was easy.    ,Fios,d6taxym,1,t5_2syiv

9334370,0,t3_58biv4,Yes all thats needed to get it working is an Ethernet cable run from the ONT to the router and the ONT being set to use Ethernet for internet. This is possible even if you have TV youd just need a MoCA adapter in this case to give your cable boxes an internet connection. Phone is irrelevant. The tricky part isnt getting it working but getting the order to go through without a router on it.And btw its voila not wala.,Fios,d8z7732,3,t5_2syiv
9338001,0,t3_58ctew,The ONT the box where the fiber optic line plugs in has RJ phone jacks in it. You need to use those the router does not come into play with FiOS phone service. The tech who installed the ONT should have installed at least one phone jack and wired it to the ONT if this is not the case you need to get it done. Any normal phone will work. The POTS light will only come on when a phone is off the hook.,Fios,d8znrvi,2,t5_2syiv
9863347,0,t3_5fijhh,I already cancelled FiOS TV in favor of an OTA TV antenna. You can cancel the phone and television service now. Port out your number people in rvoip can help. Then speak to a supervisor and explain that you no longer need TV or voice the ETF is the same whether you cancel  services or all  and that you are willing to let them keep the account with just the service that you need if they waive the ETF. That worked for me.As for negotiations to get lower pricing for internet do not think that you can get a good price by negotiating on price with a human. They are just interpreters for their computer which is what handles their negotiations for FiOS. Their computer is programmed to only give their best deals to people at locations that previously had service at least  days in the past. There are no confirmed exceptions.The method that works is to switch to Comcast for a month after your contract is up. Then sign up again through the website at least  days later and you should get the lowest pricing available. I did that and I now pay  a month for . My monthly bill before these maneuvers was  a month. I do not pay for TV or phone service because I get both for free through a TV antenna and Google Voice.,Fios,dat7tb7,1,t5_2syiv
10024291,0,t3_5j7qy7,Two issues here only one of which you can really control.  Something is causing your connection to go down and if its beyond the ONT theres nothing you can physically do yourself.  Verizons customer service on this issue based on what you wrote seems to be lacking. You can complain about the seemingly poor service you have received regarding an explanation  permanent fix. You are a paying customer and they are expected to provide a somewhat reliable service so I would start with that issue. Call and voice your concerns about the issue but emphasize that what little support theyve given you so far is not good and not enough. There could be a number of things causing the service to drop but they all require a tech to go out and troubleshoot. It costs them money and time to send a tech out for a problem so theyre probably of the mindset of if they dont complain enough well just keep resetting the ONT. That to me wouldnt be acceptable. ,Fios,dbe6yk3,1,t5_2syiv
10028884,0,t1_dbdwt35,The only things that break with a rd party router  MoCA adapter setup are Remote DVR and OnScreen Caller ID.

10724588,0,t1_ddlvmfz,You can use a third party router. It is possible to call to try to get the order amended but when I did that the technician that came to install service thought I was supposed to use their router anyway. Just tell him that you will be using your own router or cancelling the order. All he will want is to see that the internet is working before he leaves so he can finalize things in his paperwork. When billing charges you a rental fee a few days later call to get it corrected.Also calling to get the order amended to remove the router is an experience that only Kristen Schaal could love. They will argue with you and then claim to not be able to do it or to have done it when they have not. Every time you call to try to get it fixed again the argument starts again. When they finally have removed it the order still shows it although trying to modify the order online shows it is gone.,Fios,ddm5tr9,1,t5_2syiv
10858495,0,t1_ddzyu2o,Nothing connects to TVSTB out. I dont believe it even carries the MoCA signal.Ill show you my network hub with a MoCA adapter used for exactly this purpose.Front view Routers at the top patch panels in the middle switch is at the bottom. The left port on the router goes to the ONTs Ethernet port the right port goes to the switch.Rear view The important thing here is the MoCA adapter at the top left. Theres only one coaxial cable connected to it to the Coax In port. This Coaxial cable was previously connected to the Verizon router when I used one. This cable comes from a way splitter from the ONT just as I described. The Ethernet port of the adapter connects directly to the switch.Note that all this is in the basement and the STBs are on other floors nowhere near the MoCA adapter. They each get a single coax connection which comes from a way splitter. The input of this splitter connects to the other output of the way splitter.,Fios,ddzz6us,2,t5_2syiv
