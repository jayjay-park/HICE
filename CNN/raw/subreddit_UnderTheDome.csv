5024854,0,t1_curkjzw,The drug smuggling was so poorly done and quickly dropped that we are referring to it as drug smuggling instead of hoarding propane which is a precursor for some made up drug so they could sell it to a bookie?. I loved the drug plot in the book especially when the other selectman goes down to the radio station so this one really annoyed me.  It probably stems how they cant seem to decide what to do with Big Jim. In the book he was a Villain. In the show hes all over the damn place. Everyone is I guess.,UnderTheDome,curopta,5,t5_2t193

9159627,0,t1_d8couwp,Totally agree and yeah the acting can be a tad off at times but in some ways thats a part of its charm too. Its not perfect its far from it actually but i think if you enjoy it for what it is then its an entertaining little series.The Kinship is a much better idea than the twist in the book personally. It seems much more thought out and really explains why all this insane stuff has been happening. I wrote about it somewhere else on this reddit but i basically said for me i really loved the way the dome wasnt simply the typical Aliens. Theyre more complex then that and theyre more like a biological virus from outer space. Its more interesting that way and seeing how it both emotionally and physically effects our characters was really fun. Plus we all know the best bit of season  is the introduction to Big Jims Dog. Who doesnt love Indy?,UnderTheDome,d8d1tfu,2,t5_2t193
