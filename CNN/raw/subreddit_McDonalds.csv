It got to the point I often clocked in early or just started work off the clock for a while just to make sure that when everyone left I still had everything I needed to make sandwiches on the table.   Nothing like getting an order for a dozen buffalo ranch mcchickens only to find that your ranch bottle is empty  and your buffalo bottle is empty and you have about two grams of shredded lettuce.  What makes matters worse is that there are a lot of people hanging out in the front line when its close to being time to leave while the kitchen is a total disaster zone.,McDonalds,ckt3vzn,4,t5_2qwwn

Customers that talk to you like youre an idiot throw money over the counter at you or complain to you about prices or try to intimidate you into bending rules just for them. The list goes on. Probably the best thing you can do is take a step back and look at rude belittling customers for what they are outside the context of customer you must respect because youre in uniform. remember that anyone who treats someone unkindly simply because they can is just...an asshole. Plain and simple. I used to take it personally get upset and even feel persecuted that I was some poor lowly McDonalds employee that the public looked down upon because I work in food service. The fact of the matter is that whenever someone treats you like shit that says WAY more about them than it does you. If someone wants to treat someone like shit over cheeseburgers then I feel sorry for them. The world does so much better with an abundance of kindness. So treat them respectfully and dont let them get you down. ,McDonalds,cljbys2,9,t5_2qwwn

4598913,0,t3_3e04ac,One of the first big snow days of  happened when nobody was prepared and when it hit traffic on the interstates was at a standstill.   I was on my way home from college on a day where me early morning classes were cancelled by the college and my afternoon classes professors hadnt even showed up.  My car had a nonfunctional heater and I had only brought a small amount of watersnacks.  And I had to pee....  badly. I decide to get off the interstate one exit early which also happens to be the location of the McDs I work at.   What a perfect place to take care of business.I was wrong.  After taking care of making an urine dump I made the mistake of walking by front counter.  Immediately the front counter yells out WEVE GOT ONE WE HAVE utehwildman.  At this point the store manager comes out to front line and briefs me on just what was about to happen.   Being the idiotic self I am I for some reason do not take advantage of the opportunity to run like hell.It was just after noon at this point and most of first shift was still there however most of them have families and kids that need to be taken care of and staying much past their scheduled times would not be an option.  Every single secondbridge shift employee had called out and the schedule by front counter was covered in excessive black ink.The only employees that would be there for second shift would be the third shift manager who was trapped a third shift crew member who was already out in town when the weather got serious a new grill person.  Closing the store was favored among the crew but the approval could not be obtained.  And then I showed up.   I was not on the schedule.  I had no uniform with me except for my shoes and hat which stay in my car at all times.  Under an apron I would be working wearing my favorite polo which was the same one I wore on my interview and jeans.We decided that with a crew of four people it may still be possible to run second shift.  The manager would handle drivethrough I would handle front counter we would share responsibility for fries and pies and the two others would run the grill and table.  As the afternoon progressed we lost our th crew person at pm and we were packed out to the street eternally.  Our lobby was packed from both customers and people just lounging for a few hours hoping the traffic subsides.  Drive through FC and kitchen never saw a black portion of the screen until after .  Times even in kitchen were stuck at a depressing triplenine.   reviewing thee DAR for that day was fun everything wasMidnight approaches and the entire restaurant becomes a ghost town and the few of us take a look at the damage the previous hours did to our store.   Everything single area had witnessed a complete lack care and it was visible.  Drink station was overflowing with spilled drinks and trash the floor of the lobby was littered with bags napkins and trays the kitchen was disgusting.     We all gathered for a picture and spent the next few hours rotating nap breaks and trying to bring the store to a somewhat respectable condition.  Fortunately we were largely the only ones who thought of being at a Mcdonalds thats buried in snow so despite what we were working with when daylight broke and the snow plows came through the store didnt show many traces of the previous night.And that was how I ended up with an apron.   Jokes were made from this day including the thenstoremanager associating my presence with trouble.Christmas and thanksgiving  were also horrible but milder facing massive crowds and limited staff.TLDR   Shit hit the fan went to McD to use the bathroom ended up running dinner shift with  people.  ,McDonalds,ctaa6vz,8,t5_2qwwn

Then she asked me a few generic questions like why do you want to work at McDonalds and what would one of your references say about you? I was then given the paperwork and my uniform and started the following week.. I would go in after pm and before pm as thats when most stores are least busy. Make sure you go in with a resume it automatically sets you above average even if there isnt much on it. Dress up but not too formally I wore a collared shirt khakis and dress shoes. The store I got hired at was quite understaffed so I guess they were desperate to hire somebody. If your place is more competitive then a resume and proper attire is necessary to have a shot. Also dont be afraid to ask questions as that shows your interest in the work.,McDonalds,d1nbto8,2,t5_2qwwn

8751262,0,t1_d6ndvgt,Sorry but in his defense he never should have been trained on back cash as his first service position.The first service position any new employee for service should have if theyve never worked in customer service before is front counter.  They should be kept there for as long as it takes to get them acclimated to taking orders handling customer issues and fulfilling orders.  Once they get that then move them into other positions in service.The whole point of putting someone in back cash is that you put someone who is excellent with money excellent with customers who can work on their own without having to be told to do their job every ten seconds and doesnt need to socialize.  Not someone green whos knew to the POS taking orders handling cash and dealing with customers.This is why McDonalds has such a high turnover rate!  We had a GM that operated like this.  He would put people in positions where they werent the best or fully trained for to see if they sank or swam.  Not everyone who sinks in those situations is a bad employee or without potential.  Nevertheless when put in those situations they may lose confidence and where they may have had potential endup being lost. ,McDonalds,d6zkbsc,1,t5_2qwwn
