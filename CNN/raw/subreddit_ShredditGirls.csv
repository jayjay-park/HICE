6006752,0,t3_3xop50,thats a cap cup. its supposed to cup the front of the boot and smoosh the heel into the rear of the binding while holding your toe down to the pad as well. it is not a top strap! you need to position it correctly and tighten. make sure your heel is as far back as possible and then tighten. this should improve your issue now that you know its function and expected performance. how to set up a burton est binding ive found the strap portion and quick linked you. ,ShredditGirls,cy70l3y,2,t5_2tkx2

10516216,0,t1_dczisv2,Awesome. Everyone Ive talked to who has done one has loved it. I registered for the one at Loon Im excited. They have a max. of  girls skiers and snowboarders so I guess they break up into a bunch of groups and rotate coaches. They also have a whole separate park they set up for the weekend with elements for all levels. I cant wait! ,ShredditGirls,dd04jpf,1,t5_2tkx2

11501840,0,t3_6421zp,I am more of a longboarder when I have wheels under me so not sure if this type of board would fit the bill but a bunch of my friends love them and I have thought of picking one up myself. Looks like the site has a sale going on the smaller size bonus and they have some awesome girl friendly designs. ,ShredditGirls,dfzqeyg,2,t5_2tkx2
