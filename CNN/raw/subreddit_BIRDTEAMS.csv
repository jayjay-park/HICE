6352806,0,t3_42nrts,Sorry Cards was rooting hard for you yesterday... wanted to see Fitz go all the way and get that ring.  Im also curious to see what will be happening with you guys in the offseason and next year and not just because I want to know if youre going to be a pain in our asses in the NFC West again.I dont know what to think about us except that Wilson is still crazy young considering the amount of success he has had so far and our defense remains jampacked with talent. Im sure well lose some of that over the offseason and maybe Marshawn too but it doesnt worry me that much. Carroll and Schneider have proven their ability to get a lot out of new untested players and we have seen flashes of greatness out of several of the kids this year.I feel like were a team that isnt guaranteed to go all the way next year or any year in particular but is going to have a solid shot at the Superbowl again every year for many years to come as long as we have that core talent in place. Any season where we start to gel early enough the Seahawks can be dangerous.,BIRDTEAMS,czbqs2x,13,t5_2vc6z
