9424095,0,t1_d9ak1lc,I expected Mu Online with a graphical doover and some skill balancing. Thats not too much is it? Youre just babbling all over the place because you cant take criticism. Mu Online gt Mu Legend. Thats a fact live with it. Mu Online was highly revolutionary when it came out. Both graphical and gameplay. Mu Legend is revolutionary in nothing I think. However those who are  like I was when discovering Mu Online when it was first released then this game is probably cool. But it will still not be revolutionary for its time.Imo Webzen should just open a new Mu Online server with inspiration from good private servers incorporate resets and points after reset in some way. Now that would have been revolutionary.,MuLegend,d9akhrt,0,t5_3e69k

9512377,0,t1_d9lkg9i,Atleast it changes low to top tier unlike in Legend. It stays the same.Set items are a little bit more colorful but more or less is the same. Ive seen all the gear available in CB and its pathetic in visual aspects it is plain and lacking accent. ,MuLegend,d9llpq0,1,t5_3e69k
