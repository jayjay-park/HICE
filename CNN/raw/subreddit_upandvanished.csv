10385669,0,t1_dcju5s0,That is correct.  According to the podcast the DNA from the glove belongs to a white male.,upandvanished,dcla39j,2,t5_3hba8
10388956,0,t1_dcbdl9d,In the podcast Maurice does a QampA I cant remember which episode but the school didnt contact police the neighbors did. People from the school came to Taras house when she didnt show up and the neighbor got the key to Taras house and let a few of them in. The neighbors are who contacted police.,upandvanished,dclniz3,2,t5_3hba8
10831376,0,t1_ddnfl6k,The first time I heard about the fire and the dog hitting on the septic line I was skeptical.  Cadaver dogs are specifically trained to seek out cadavers and rarely if ever hit on anything else.  The explanation about the hit was the most ridiculous thing I have heard thus far in this podcast.  I cant understand why they discounted the hit as they did.,upandvanished,ddx6hwv,2,t5_3hba8

11264722,0,t1_df8om93,I can recall judges requesting a thorough factual basis for a plea but not explicit details only the Defendant could provide. But I should clarify is this the alleged killer or the alleged accomplice potentially entering a plea in chambers? If its the alleged accomplice and the alleged killers attorney is present and theres a record i.e. recorded via audio or text I completely get it and theres no basis for shockthe Court is limiting the dissemination of information to the only relevant people. If its the killer...still odd but not fallingoutofmyseat endlessconspiracytheoriesabound odd. ,upandvanished,df8u8uc,4,t5_3hba8
