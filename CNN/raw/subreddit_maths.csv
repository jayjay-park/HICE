Suppose the boxes can contain either  or  oranges and we still have  boxes we need two nonnegative numbers that add to . We want to make to make the biggest of these two numbers to be as small as possible. The answer is for both to be  any other pair of numbers must contain a number bigger than .Now suppose we can have  or  oranges then we need three nonnegative numbers that add to  and make the largest of the three as small as possible. This time its  as  any other triple of numbers contains one larger than .And so on up to  different numbers of oranges where we can have  as the best we can do. Any other combination of  nonnegative numbers that adds to  must contain a number bigger than six. So the answer is six.,maths,ci9pfik,2,t5_2qitk

5325251,0,t1_cvpcy88,You can get information about the concavity with the first derivative.no you cant. I got it now and the problem is that a inflection point doesnt need to be between local highs or lows that why you need to use the  derivation.BTW I am using the second derivation. my problem was just the third derivation.,maths,cvsd2bz,1,t5_2qitk

6020336,0,t1_cy8sdos, correspondence AFTER the whole set is generated. Thats from fractal generation I already accounted that. You can define  correspondence AS its generated but thats just putting a baseless restriction AGAINST something. Look at what IS. For fuck sake and theres  purpose behind ANY OF YOUR POSTS. Just look at what is!,maths,cy8sgxj,-23,t5_2qitk
6042571,0,t1_cybotpi,Youre talking about a pattern like           . Im trying to figure out what you mean by that. Im not being hostile or intentionally misunderstanding  I legitimately want to understand what youre saying. Before responding to your arguments I need to understand precisely what you mean.,maths,cybouz9,1,t5_2qitk
6212092,0,t1_cyuqkcp,The problem is that I dont know the wedges. At least I dont think I do. That is because I only have the angles and the base of the hole. It is not a whole shape it is like a cutoff wedge. So the height of  meters isnt to the top of a wedge shape and the online calculators doesnt work for them.,maths,cyvqxro,1,t5_2qitk

9189936,0,t3_5671yp,Ill assume you can expand two brackets out so we have x    x    x    x We can simplify each bracket giving      The last bracket is root  due to the rules of surdsindices. I hope you agree.Now we know   .So          And you can clean up the surds which I think you understand anyhow          Hope this helps any questions just ask.,maths,d8gw41g,2,t5_2qitk
10350834,0,t3_5o808f,Seems to be in the realm of curiosity value. We may find a subtlety about it through deeper extensive analysis. In particular reaching  seems to depend on an assumption that the result of the summation must have a finite numeric value. In Numberphiles video according to Wikipedia they find ... by inserting a  on the left and such an insertion might be a violation. However forcing the result to be interpreted as a finite numeric value is also happening possibly consciously. Not saying they are doing anything wrong. But they are using the value in an assumption that it must be finite in order get a finite value. In a lesser infraction they also insert a   at the front e.g. shift the series to the right. Maybe its illegal to do that. Any one of those could be a violation of some rule about series. Although multiple people have found  from different directions. More information hereEDIT Corrected link.In Ramanujans summation we walk gently past the threshold of resulting value where the value would be finite. For example the conventional  operator listing all positive integers produces each integer as finite but the sum of them does not necessarily produce a value which is finite. By producing  mathemeticians are consciously forcing the result to be finite forcing computable forcing representable etc. They are in many cases doing that with full knowledge that they are doing so. In similar examples i is beautifully achieved by letting  to have a value.,maths,dchbsdq,1,t5_2qitk
