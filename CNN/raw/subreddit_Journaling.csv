7221180,0,t1_d1yyp96,Thats one of the reasons I started journaling too. I got a Hobonichi to keep track of things on a daily basis but am considering also doing a long form but less regular journal as well. Its fun to go back and look at things you might have forgotten.If youre worried about starting just write the date at the top of the page and list some things out about your day. Dont get too fancy or worry about getting stuck with one format. One of the most interesting parts of journaling for me has been watching how my journaling has changed from when I first started.,Journaling,d1yzrlz,3,t5_2s9nn
8471909,0,t1_d5uas6g,I agree with this. Self exploration is hard and scary especially when there are certain things youd rather not explore. Im never honest enough in my writing and its something Im actively working on. ,Journaling,d60j2eq,1,t5_2s9nn
8617910,0,t3_4xuoth,I have this same problem only Im too eager to begin a new journal and wanting to make a fresh start.  Curious to hear others answers as well. ,Journaling,d6iu6ck,5,t5_2s9nn
8617931,0,t3_4xuoth,I used to get this way too thats what made me decide to keep a catchall journal. Literally everything is in there  musings struggles observations quotes I love sketches prose lists. This way I expect it to be a mess and it doesnt bother me.,Journaling,d6iu9rh,12,t5_2s9nn
8654155,0,t3_4yej1k,Ive read that writing with physical media helps you retain more and has other benefits. Of course what you said about indexingsearchingetc is true about digital plus the ability to back it up easily. It really comes down to what is more important to you!,Journaling,d6ndtrd,2,t5_2s9nn
9790589,0,t3_5f9010,How to journal is always going to be a personal thing and how to start is always going to be based on what youre trying to accomplish.Since youll be journaling to remember things there will be two considerations for you What style are you going to enjoy enough to journal on a regular basis? What style is going to make it fun and easy for you to look back on?Some things that come to mind are lists sketches collecting and attaching things like programs tickets receipts etc. You may want an index to make it easier to find things which you can do like this or like thisHope that gives you some ideas for starting off!,Journaling,dajwit7,2,t5_2s9nn

10040581,0,t3_5jex4h,How about a reporter style notebook? Its still bound but the binding is at the top of the page rather than along the side. The top page still rolls a little bit but it lays a bit flatter than a regular notebook.,Journaling,dbgbb6o,2,t5_2s9nn

10408492,0,t1_dcnii04,Heh wait till you get your hands on some Tomoe River paper. Youll be ruined for life with paper. You can find some decently priced options on gouletpens.com and from Nanami Paper Co. ,Journaling,dcnvcdu,3,t5_2s9nn

11204958,0,t1_df223km,It wasnt as easy as just normal fabric but it wasnt too bad. The hardest part was finding heavy things to hold the pieces around the edges down while the glue dried without it they kept wanting to pop back up.,Journaling,df22g8g,1,t5_2s9nn
11277776,0,t1_dfa44b3,Cool. For the grid ones do a search for graph composition notebook. My current one and next one are lined but I really want to do a grid one again.

11399755,0,t1_dflee9y,You should try using a Pilot Metropolitan fountain pen and a Leuchtturm journal. Its a little more expensive but the pen glides so nicely and Ive heard that the LTs paper doesnt show through because its thicker.,Journaling,dfo5bv4,1,t5_2s9nn
11533768,0,t3_64iiyi,I do the same thing with podcasts.  I like to capture interesting factsinfo during the podcast along with the time and links in OneNote so that I can review the notes later rather than having to listen to the podcast again.Its one of the many things I keep track of in OneNote so that I have a repository of sorts.,Journaling,dg3cs9c,3,t5_2s9nn
