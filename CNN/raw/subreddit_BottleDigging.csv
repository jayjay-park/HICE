818465,0,t1_cgx3hee,i dont think i need to tell you the first one is a lysol lol but because the engraving is at the top it had a paper label.. sid like to see the bottom of the one with the leafthe brown is a beer or soda. duraglas is owens illinois. youve seen the bottles with the IO on the bottom and  numbers surrounding? the number on the right is the year the bottle was made. the graduated one with the ML on the side is medicine.that awesome house is a turn of the century ink well. i would love to see better pics of it. and last but not least the green beauties. they are champange bottles. the kick up was made by a very blunt pontil that allowed for a gaffer to turn it in the fire. they are very hard to date. Usually for liquors and fine champagnes the bottles have been free blown since the s. HOWEVER. judging but the color and the tooled finish im going with early s. The Horse cologne is very cool. It was probably a fancy cologne or aftershave and it would have been hand made as well probably in the s or s. the Krml is a cologne or tonic. Note the top... its the same as the horse. since the engraving is on the side it probably is from the same time period ssorry so detailed. ive studied this a long time. lol TOO LONG. ,BottleDigging,cgxb8vo,1,t5_2xbp3
