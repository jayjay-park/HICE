But what helped me is reading up on Eminems history before starting all of that. It helps you understand the context. And if you go chronologically you get to follow the path of a young poor aspiring rapper turned richest and highest selling rapper of the decade. Its an amazing story told simply through music. If you dont want to take the time to do all of that though go through Curtain Call The Greatest Hits and pick and choose what songs you love.

950058,0,t3_1qy4a3,Old thread but Im about to bump... Wanna put my opinion out.I absolutely love Lady Gaga amp Eminem. They are both artistic geniuses. Gaga is phenomenal live great singing voice passionate about her fans amp a brilliant song writer. ARTPOP as Gaga stated over a year ago was always intended to be less mature than Born This Way. She said she wanted to make a fun album amp she did. But personally I love Born This Way more. Also to the guy who complained about her outfits Gaga has always been theatrical she is a performance artist as well as a pop star. Her music is infinitely better than ANY other pop star right now.Ive been a fan of Eminem as long as I can remember amp MMLP is easily one of my favourite albums of the year. They are both under the same label amp honestly they are the only  genuinely talented people in the mainstream. Eminem has days before that he likes Gaga amp honestly a collab will just make everyone in the music industry stand up amp up their game. It would just BLOW everyone away. She also would have fit in perfectly on The Monster,Eminem,chca2jg,1,t5_2r6bz

Infinite came out and he had a more underground east coast vibe.  SSLP was influenced by Horrorcore and was essentially its own subgenre which is why it blew up. Further into his career he did some hate speechesque stuff some conscious stuff mixed it up with rock samples some gangster stuff more horrorcore now hes more mature and focuses on wordplay and puns and just playing with flow.

I believe theyll drop another album some Em will be on it but not a ton like Devils Night because hell be working on his own projects.Proof was the glue and thats why it sort of fell apart.

Why couldnt all of them be shown together?  It didnt seem to create the sense of Detroit vs. Everybody.  Where was the cohesiveness?  The only thing creative about it was Marshalls hand actions to go along with the words.  But at least that piece of creativity gave him extra screen time and we were saved from having to see literal shots of say an airplane for example.

4615538,0,t3_3e3p8w,Right now everyone rides on Kendrick... Thats it. Kendrick says She eyeing me like a ... dont exist girl I know you want this dick and its an amazing line according to social media. Em says Im the butt police and Im looking at your REAR REAR REAR! and the hip hop heads say he fell off and how it was such a terrible line. Kendrick works with Taylor Swift a country singer transitioning to pop and its known to be such a great duo. Em works with Rihanna an RampB singer known to work with hiphop artists like Jay and Yeezy and hes known to be a washed up poppy sellout by once again the annoying social media. Kendrick makes an album about the struggles that black people have to go through every day and the hardships theyve overcame something he hasnt personally gone through but rather the previous generations as well as the masses today then brings out the hiphop legend who has gone through those challenges Tupac at the end of his album and it has an immense amount of respect. Ems last two albums had him speak about overcoming a drug addiction that nearly killed him shared how losing his best friend crushed him talked about how he truly feels about his highschool sweetheart  love of his life created a sequel to Stan and linked the story with his real life and the dilemmas and battles with his inner conscience he always has to deal with closed the chapter and made an endeavor to heal the damaged relationship between himself and his mother. What is the mass reception from the hiphop fans? He needs dre to produce his beats lulz dey suk why he always yelling nao he need  go bak on drugz n den rap y he workin wid nate reuss n rihanna tf. It truly is a tragedy because he has memory loss due to the aftermath of his long battle with drug addiction and hes forgotten his work ethic before his hiatus and how he achieved those accolades. Imagine if you did something you love doing a lot and became really famous due to the tremendous work ethic you implement into that thing then you lose your memory about all of that and you remember you love that thing so much but you have to relearn how to do it again and people give you respect for the person you dont remember being rather than the person you are now. The only way people would give you that same respect is if you started doing the thing you love by going back to what nearly killed you and made you lose your memory. People assume if Em rapped in the same style for  years theyd admire it greatly. What they dont realize is his age  maturity and how that correlates to his older material. Im a high school graduate not gonna say the year and I said a lot of shit I regret in my early teens. For example I had a huge problem with swearing and I couldnt form a sentence without one cuss word. Surprisingly that was when I listened to Drake a lot and that stopped when I started listening to Em again. Anyway just reading old conversations I had makes me cringe very much. Like Id take my personal problems up to social media and show such childish angst towards the matter calling soandso a motherfucking stupid gay ugly ass cocksucking faggot prick ass bitch. If someone ever told me to get angry like that again Id say no in a heartbeat. So I can kinda get the gist of the dilemma Em is faced with . . . Whether to rap more maturely or go back to his roots. I just hope one day people will stop comparing him to his older stuff and treat him like a new artist that came into this game in  albeit whilst acknowledging and respecting his accolades he reached throughout his whole career in the back of their heads.,Eminem,ctcd94o,8,t5_2r6bz

5244538,0,t3_3mudvh,When I was a baby my dad would play Bob Dylan while he rocked me to sleep.  years later Eminem reached into that crib and yanked me out by my ears. I went from Like A Rolling Stone to Rock Bottom real quick. Bad met Evil and hiphop took over my brain. I would never return to Classic Rock or so I thought.     Several years later my natural black hair grew back and I realized Eminem had been sampling classic Rock all along. These are my favorite examples    Till I Collapse The Eminem Show   Samples Queens We Will Rock You.     Waving a lyrical scalpel Eminems raps one of his most iconic tirades. The legendary BOOM BOOM CLAP BOOM BOOM CLAP sample is a topaz fist to the skull bone.   The track is on some battling raps.  Who want some static?  Cause I dont really think that the fact that Im Slim matters  A plaque of platinum status is whack if Im not the baddest.  We Will Rock You is also sampled on Cinderella Man and Puke.Going Through Changes Recovery   Samples Black Sabbaths Changes.  Ozzy sang with his rib cage opened wide heart exposed. I can picture a young angsty Eminem zoning to this after just being dumped by Kim again.   Swear when I come back Ima be bulletproof.  Ima do it just for Proof I think I should state a few  Facts cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth.  Sing For The Moment The Eminem Show   Samples Aerosmiths Dream On.When I first heard this song my brain broke into tears. This is the ultimate narrative about hiphops impact on the lives of its listeners. Fittingly it samples a rock group legendary for their genrebridging collaboration with Run DMC.  Who post pinup pictures on they walls all day long  Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs  Beautiful Relapse  Samples Queen and Paul Rodgers Reaching Out.Em has a depressing way of motivating you. Hell rip himself to shreds hand over a magnifying glass and ask you to call him beautiful. Its painful but empowering.   Ill be you lets trade shoes  Just to see what itd be like to  Feel your pain you feel mine  Rhyme or Reason The Marshal Mathers LP   Samples The Zombies Time of the Season.   Eminem unleashes Yodaimpersonating sleepinggiant energy on this otherwise lowkey psychedelic sample.   You critics come pay to me a visit?  Misery loves company please stay a minute  SHADYXV SHADYXY  Samples Billy Squiers My Kinda Lover.     Eminem also sampled guitar work from Billy Squires The Stroke for Bezerk off of The Marshall Mathers LP .  I know youre really tired of me sampling Billy Squier   But classic rock acid rap is the genre   Got Slash on guitar splash of Bizarre Thrasher and Aerosmith  Rock Bottom The Slim Shady LP  Samples Janis Joplins cover of Summertime.  This is my all time favorite Eminem song and a fitting end to this list.    Minimum wage  got my adrenaline caged  Full of venom and rage  If you know of dope samples I should take a look or wanna talk Eminem trivia tweet me at Kaisermane. ,Eminem,cvi5mod,12,t5_2r6bz

5693006,0,t1_cx2rm7x,Can you explain why though? I get music is subjective but why even bother commenting with your opinion if you cant state why? Forgettable why? Cause lyrically the album was VERY important. Especially when he talks about how the death of his best friend affected him. Because stuff like that is what diehard fans want to know something he hasnt touched on yet.Also how his drug addiction affected him as well rather than what hallucinations he was having as he delved into that with relapse already. So i think Recovery was detrimental since it was a lot about him pumping up himself for the future as well as saying that hes there for his fans. ,Eminem,cx2rtzq,1,t5_2r6bz

Learned every last in and out of it and I fell in love with it.One of my favorite songs but I always enjoyed Encore so I guess Im just weird and have weird tastes.One of the few songs Ill sit and listen to these days I think I burnt myself out on Em. The classics feel too old now the new stuff isnt really .... musically entertaining? He spends too much time flexing and its not really music I can sit and listen to and enjoy its complex and I have to put effort into hearing it and trying to like it.I transcribed a couple of the bonus songs too and sat and listened to them on repeat for an hour straight picking out words and lyrics and neither of those stuck so I dont think its Stockholm syndrome with this song either.

However I dont know if theyd want to associate their clean brand with Ems music so it would probably be a beats commercial or something like it was for MMLP. Even with that considered its still highly unlikely. ,Eminem,ddafzuu,1,t5_2r6bz

11139788,0,t1_deujjbx,Rap God is a song about what Eminem was feeling at the time. The moment in which he wrote the track. Eminem has already talked about this and made it abundantly clear. Campaign Speech his him flexing his lyrical ability like he has on many other songs like the ones I mentioned.In no way is Campaign Speech similar to rap god in presentation. Which was your point. Unless Rap God is somehow the baseline for flex music.  gtTill I Collapse has to do with his motivation.So does Rap God. He talks about how thinking he is the best motivates him to be the best. gt Campaign Speech is just random lines that rhyme showing off why he is a Rap God. Campaign Speech was about him releasing some unheard bars to make sure fans know hes still alive and that hes working on his next album. Its purpose lyrically was to flex and release a freestyle those two things work hand in hand. While Rap God was more of a loose concept. gtWithout me? Youre fucking kidding right? How on earth is Without Me in any way similar?Well hey if hes fucking showing off lyrically it must be rap god. gtsimilar besides the fact that Rap God has a beat and a consistent flow.Rap God most definitely doesnt have a consistent flow as one of Eminems staples is that he switches flow and cadence constantly.
