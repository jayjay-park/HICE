47482,0,t3_1rgorz,I thought so for a while.  I definitely have family friends that I refer to as aunt  and uncle  that were not related too but for years I was under the impression that Ted was going to end up with Barneys halfsister making Barney and Robin a real aunt and uncle.Then the episode last season where Ted briefly dated Barneys sister happened and proved me wrong.So in short no.,howimetyourmother,ceju44c,0,t5_2qzj4

257489,0,t1_cf305n5,Teds spent the entire series secretly pining after Robin and the mother is the one who finally helps him get over her. The mothers situation is a parallel to this. She spent the past  years pining after somebody she couldnt be with and meeting Ted is what finally convinces her to move on. ,howimetyourmother,cf7g11p,10,t5_2qzj4

694956,0,t1_cgj6wfi,I hadnt thought of it this way and points taken! I see what youre saying. I think for me where I gave Robin credit was in how she grounded Ted. He always had his head in the clouds and when they were together I felt like she called him out on his shit. I didnt dislike him with Tracy and Im sad she died too but ultimately Tracy felt like a female version of Ted and I didnt get the sense that she challenged him or was anything beyond Ted being in my mind TOO perfect for Ted. To me theres a certain realism in that the most enduring loves that I know are couples where the people are pretty different and those differences make the other better. So while I like the idea that Ted reached his ideal I like the idea better that he ended up with something more realistic someone he was passionate about who was super different from him with normalsized teeth.,howimetyourmother,cgj9oaq,3,t5_2qzj4
