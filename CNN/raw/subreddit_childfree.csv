18201,0,t3_1ubfj7,I used to think about this a lot actually. Pregnancy has always disgusted and scared me but for some reason I was always also really curious about what it would feel like. I thought maybe I could be a surrogate since I could help another couple be happy and see what pregnancy was like without having to ever be a mom. I also considered donating eggs for the same reason of helping people out. But the more I thought about it the more I realized that one of the reasons I want to be CF is that overpopulation does concern me and I would feel guilty contributing my body or my genes to the problem instead of attempting to make a difference to someone that really needed a hand like adopting a kid if I ever changed my mind about being CF.

Please please please try not to let their disgusting guilttripping get to you.  You owe them absolutely nothing.  They are insanely selfcentered if they believe that they are in any way entitled to demand to use your body for their own selfish purposes.  I cannot believe they are using a past abortion Godshaming and pulling the family card for all of this.  And it is repulsive that they are recruiting every familymember and friend to try to guilttrip you as well.  Its all just manipulative mindgames.  Absolutely revolting behavior.If they want a kid so bad they can adopt or pay someone willing to be their surrogate.  Please tell them that you feel they are asking far too much.  To be a surrogate for someone is a huge deal.  Pregnancy is a lifethreatening condition which can profoundly alter or damage your body.  You have every right to refuse doesnt matter if its your sister or your best friend or someone you owe your whole life to  it is not just a favor you demand of someone.As for Jay I hope you communicate to him the following things if I am interpreting your actions correctly. That your statement to Rachelle amp Roger that you would inevitably want to keep a kid if you had one was untrue and only an attempt to make them understand your decision.. That you are only upset or moved at all by their request because they are your family and not because you have any desire to actually comply.Best wishes with this.

However for the  of the time when there is a serious problem there is absolutely no reason why that babymother shouldnt receive proper medical attention.

Refusing a medical procedure to an adult because of a personal opinion of the doctor is a pretty good troll for ethics complaint to be filed..  any doctor performing vasectomy SHOULD be informing the patient of options for freezing sperm in case their mind is changed.  between the VERY high success rate of reversals and the sperm frosty option the odds of a person having a vasectomy being able to later father a child are almost indistinguishable from not having a vasectomy.,childfree,cepcv7d,-4,t5_2qtwb

Start preparing for this and let your sister live her own life. See the niece on your terms.  Take her out of that house and do outside activities with her.  Your sister will yowl at not being able to set the terms for everything. Let her yowl.  If she cuts off your niece from you that is HER call alone.

Coming home to find the place ransacked and your valuable things gone can trigger deep feelings of betrayal at the world in general.Being shunted from a full house into just a bedroom makes it worse.  Especially when it was someone elses poor choices that caused it.  I know Ive been there.  Right now youre feeling like there is no place you can turn no privacy nothing you can do to recover from the multiple betrayals that you have been hit with in short order.Trust me OP it will get better.  The end is in sight you have a house being built.  You have a date you can count down to when the valley will finish bottoming out and your life will move up again.Focus on your work go tour the house if you can do things that get you out of your parents house when the kids are around.

163614,0,t1_cex22p0,To recap whats happening in this conversationWhat Im saying Its extremely hard for CFers to influence the view of children on the subject of having children themselves as the predominant source of understanding kids have of this is from their immediate family. Constant comments like When you have kids one day... coupled with blatant statements of expectation that the kids will one day also have kids themselves and that is just how it is are very difficult to impossible to overcome especially because that is also the same view society as a whole has.What you keep hearing and arguing against Only parents can teach children anything. Other people like teachers have no real influence over a childs life. Rabble rabble rabble.I hate the arguments. This will keep going too. Ill keep telling you I think youre right. That educators do have a hand in influencing children and changing their lives. They absolutely do. But you wont hear that. Because I still say its also unlikely for you to really reach a kid on this one subject in spite of all the influence you have because youre still just one influence of many. Even if you went out of your way to educate kids on how having children is a choice not an expectation there is so much other influence working counter to you. And some of those influences are even other educators. Yeah youll probably reach a few... But thats it. It doesnt mean no one should try either...,childfree,cex2gl0,1,t5_2qtwb

295200,0,t1_cfacwn3,I think Jarsupial has it right. Theres still a bit of a stigma against the man making less than the woman. While any unintentional lengthy unemployment surely reduces happiness  I mean it must right?  I think for most hetero couples its probably a bigger deal if the man or the woman... or both feels that the man is failing at his manly duties of bringing home the bacon. Even if they dont really feel that deepdown the same outcome could precipitate if they have shame complexes about it ie feel embarrassed because other people might think that way if they knew like nosey family. I think it probably happens even in many but not all hetero couples who are not openly celebratory towards s gender roles because were still sort of raised to expect that in a way.

358240,0,t3_1y6srm,The Fair Housing Act is an offshoot of the Civil Rights Act. Until  it was legal to discriminate based on disability or familial status. Its just been a slow progression of ensuring that basic civil rights are respected. That includes ensuring that families and people with children have as many opportunities for housing as those without. It wasnt actually until  that OverSenior housing was allowable. The Fair Housing Amendment Act of  is the specific legislation that added disabilities and familial status to the list.One way around this might be to find someone who does live in a senior community who would be looking for a livein carer or roommate. You dont necessarily have to be a senior to live in one only that the community be active in promoting it as one and have at least  of units leasedowned by at least one person of senior age. If thats too much you could get some friends together and rent a house near a college campus. The likelihood of finding families living amongst a large number of collegeage renters is lowmost people who own a home in such an area are going to want to rent it out.This gives sources in the footnotes if you want to research it further.,childfree,cfhwbty,13,t5_2qtwb

372786,0,t3_1ybt3v,Something else that is discussed far too little in our society is what happens after old. What happens when you pass away? I encourage everyone who is able to work out the details and pay for it now. Dont wait and let that burden fall on your loves ones after the fact. If you want something special make the arrangements so that its done exactly as you wish. Dont care what happens? Get the minimum planned out so that no one spends more on you than you would have wanted. Case  My friends brother passed without any plan in place and he went rather suddenly. His wife and children were forced to deal with mundane tasks like choosing a flower arrangement when they should be grieving. Yes there is an argument that this is part of the grieving process but I disagree.Case  Both of my grandparents passed in the last two years and numerous times I heard from my mom and aunt how much of a relief it was not to have to see to those details. They simply went to the funeral home where the arrangements had been made and they took care of every last detail down to the calling hours cards exactly as my grandparents had asked for it. It was enough to push my own mother to start planning her arrangements.It sounds morbid but death is a part of life.

My parents were divorced we were lower middle class think Rosanne TV series from the s and pretty secular. I lived mostly in NY with my mother but  weeks out of the year when not in school with my father amp stepmother in Florida. None of the adults especially my stepmother really wanted us around we were a burden to everyone financially and to look after. Extended family was either estranged or not really involved so wed only see them on holidays. None of the adults seemed to enjoy family life or having kids. They hated each other and still do  years after the divorce. None of them had substance abuse problems psych issues gambling issues or anything like that they just ideally didnt want to have to deal with us kids. I had a brother I really did not get along with he had behavioralpsych issues and could be miserable to have to live with again nothing too awful. I liked school friends and activities like swimming and dance. I think all this contributed to my never wanting to have kids in a subtle way. I didnt see any adults around me liking family life or getting anything positive out of having kids.

My son doesnt know any different because he isnt exposed to dogs that have been poorly taken care of and trained and therefore defensive to everyone that isnt their owner. Truth is  I dont think you should take your little bitch of a dog out if you know it doesnt interact well with others. Im happy you dont have children and dont want children but its asinine to think that parents are idiots because a child sees your cute animal and wants to pet it. I have taught my son to ask before he touches other peoples THINGS in general but children arent adults and dont think like adults so sometimes common sense to you and I slip them. But its what we as parents do to teach them at that moment that counts. So  if you dont allow that to happen then leave.  Get yourself out of the situation and let the parent be a parent. The example stated here is an exception as after the fact the child felt entitled but really its not your job to be the parent. I am a pretty reasonable person but if your dog bites my son and you give me snide remarks like I am seeing here without allowing me to correct the behavior  I will skip the formalities and fuck up your day. If you prove you cant be civil then neither will I. ,childfree,cfmwjd2,-22,t5_2qtwb

444743,0,t1_cfptto4,Ive been a pescetarian for about six years now and was a strict ovolacto vegetarian for four years before that. Maybe my opinion isnt widely shared but I usually dont care about questions of genuine curiosity as long as theyre asked politely i.e. not like Oh YEAH?! Well what if you were stranded on a desert island WHAT THEN?. It only gets on my nerves when people do it out of contempt.If the option was between eating meat and starving then yeah I would eat meat. For me personally I see survival as a solid excuse to compromise. I would really not like it though. One of the reasons I became a vegetarian was that I just hate the feeling texture and taste of meat... to me it really does feel like eating flesh and it grosses me out I have no problem being around other people eating meat just none for me thanks. Im a pescetarian now health reasons but even so I only eat fish rarely  and only certain types of fish  because even that can still trigger my gag reflex sometimes.I think one of the reasons that vegetarianspescetarianswhatevers get so annoyed with these questions is that we hear them SO often. Almost every time someone finds out Im a pescetarian theyll ask me why. Tbh its a bit annoying to answer the same questions over again with each new person but as long as theyre polite about it I smile and respond and dont think too much about it because theyre just expressing interest. As long as youre polite Im happy.My biggest pet peeve is when it comes up that Im a pescetarianvegetarian and people reply with Oh really? I hate vegetarians theyre so holierthanthou. How do you know someones a vegetarian?  dont worry theyll tell you lol. Gosh thanks for that what a totally notirritating and notcontemptuous response to SOMEONE ELSES dietary choices.

It seems like grandma trumps mom whenever grandma wants to trump mom. But if grandma doesnt want to do anything then its all moms responsibility. This probably happened when he was  months when I was around Im at school so not around much. My friend was supposed to be teaching him to sooth himself when he wakes up so she wasnt supposed to go and get him for  minutes when he got fussy. As much as she hated hearing him get fussy she still did it because thats what shes supposed to do. But then her mom would get annoyed at her for letting him fuss and go up and get him because she was being mean. But when grandma doesnt want to do anything?

If you add to that another K in legal costs plus extra expenses like travel between states for custody hearings flights hotels meals out etc. And thats assuming that the kid is healthy and stays healthy. Throw in any type of medical or psych issue addiction or criminal activities..... and all bets are off.In sum his inability to zip his pants just cost you at least a half a million dollars in the best case scenario a million if it all goes horribly wrong.So before you go much further with this you really need to think about whether this is your ideal life.... and if not how far away from your ideal life are you willing to go are you willing to give up all of your hopes and dreams for this nightmare?Because no matter what it will be a nightmare for you if you stay. Theres just no way around that now.Working it out is not about you learning to deal with it and making all the sacrifices because of his mistakes. To be honest and you may not want to hear it but for  of people this situation would be an absolute noquestions asked run the hell out the door with only the clothes on your back if necessary situation..... So it really seems a bit odd that you are not doing that... good sex is important but you can get that somewhere else frankly. Likewise luuuuuvvve is important but the  divorce rate pretty much proves that you can get that elsewhere as well.  So its really hard to fathom why you are staying if there isnt some underlying issue of selfworth selfconfidence or something else. Sorry. ,childfree,cfxpjdw,12,t5_2qtwb

I am saying that we dont consider children to owe others because they got to go to school. Just like children dont owe their parents anything for having been born.  When a set of parents or a society provides something to children it needs to do so as a gift given to the child with future hopes but no future strings. Children do not owe anyone anything for having accepted what they were given as a child.  You also seem to be failing terribly at reading comprehension.  My last statement explicitly states that I do support everyone not just parents paying into education so that all the children can be educated.  But thats from the adults for the society. Not a loan to the children to be expected back.  Did your education fail to teach you to read something before you call it names?  ,childfree,cgb5vlw,-5,t5_2qtwb

I think the problems began with the mom. Does the mother have a history of mental illness?  Is there a chemical dependency concern? Was there any indication of child abuse from her? What factors from her parenting has lead to the development of Billy? Did she just give up because she saw Billy becoming awful or is Billy acting out because his mother left him?

Its the difference between driving through him or driving around him in the latter case that kid ceases to exist in my thoughts once he disappears from the rearview miror. Maybe that same kid was playing in the road again the following day and someone else ran over him. What reason would there be for me to feel guilty over that? And how would I even know about it if I wasnt there?In the current example we are discussing we refuse to take part in the event at all. Walk away and whatever happens no longer has anything to do with you. Having not acknowledged or accepted the responsibility the mother assumed you with nothing ties your conscience to the fate of her abandoned child any more than the  other people in the vicinity.,childfree,cgmp1pr,11,t5_2qtwb

796500,0,t3_239lsf,I certainly think you could Ive considered running a cafe with an age limit myself. I do think it would need to be in the right area though. That said the best clients are people who arent at work during the day stay at home mums and who are likely to pop in for lunch earlier or later than the lunch rush hour which again is something a lot of parents do. Im in the uk and here a lot of pubs serve meals so again people who arent drinking such as parents in charge of children women who are breast feeding etc will often choose a cafe over a bar. Its also somewhere for parents to meet and catch up during the day. Id say if you planned to do it you would need to be aiming for an area such as close to a university and an area popular with young professionals who are willing to pay slightly more. That will help you make up for the covers you dont fill with families. A more high end feel to the cafe would also help create an atmosphere that would hopefully keep clients coming back and put off potential arguments over why little Tarquin isnt permitted on the premises. A more high end establishment focused on local produce where the coffee and food is excellent could also prove a hit with parents who actually want to escape children all together. Ive run the idea by a few of my family members with children and a few have actually said that there is nothing worse than booking a baby sitter or getting some time to yourself to see friends only to have it ruined by somebody elses screaming children.  ,childfree,cgutcy5,5,t5_2qtwb

Because you made such an effort I waited until I was on a computer to be able to write back.It sounds like you had a wonderful experience or as much as you can when youre having an abortion.  No one should ever be made to feel guilty about their choice because as you said and as I know its not the right time and I wouldnt be able to give it the start to life that it deserves.From what all the other women have been saying Im trying to organise an appointment with my GP so that I can get an IUD fitted at the time of my termination. Just kill two birds with one stone.Im most concerned about the emotional side of things as well.  Im normally an emotional persona I know this is the right thing to do however doesnt mean its going to be the easiest.  Youre not the first woman to comment about having a dream about the baby either. I think this would make me feel worse. I hope I can just move on cause at the moment Im even having a little bit of trouble on the odd occasion when I look at my boyfriend just knowing that Im carrying not only my baby but his too.  We both are in a position where were not ready we dont really want kids were too young and while I dont doubt our ability to actually be parents I highly doubt our ability to provide for the infant so its the best path to take.I feel far from ashamed about it I was taking the necessary precautions to prevent this happening in the first place I was on the pill but it was obviously ineffective for the first time in over  years so Im not entirely sure what happened.  I tried and my plan failed me so now I have to take Plan B.Im sorry that your boyfriend was dickish enough to even consider pulling that move  thats horrendous.  Good thing you flicked him.  Im really hoping that this is solidifying for my boyfriend and I as you mentioned but other have mentioned that it caused enough tension for them to break up while they were recovering due to hormonal fluctuations and such.

848206,0,t3_23tp3w,I can tell you from first hand experience that staying together for the sake of the children does not work at all. First of all if you have two people who hates each other and wanting to leave but being forced to stay because of their children...what good can come out that household? The kids will see how their parents are not happy with each other and that type of angerdepressionfrustration will trickle down to how the kids are treated. How can you provide that best care possible if you are living with your worst enemy that you cannot escape? Wouldnt being stuck in a position like that give you a permanent chip on your shoulder? Second the positive relationship a parent could have with their child can be jeopardize because of the parents forced partnership with the other parent. Imagine seeing the childs face light up when the father tells them Great job on that test! and the promptly gives the mother a death stare right after the compliment? Right in front of the childs face? That kid is either going to be confused frustrated or hurt. The bottom line is to stop taking the idea of for the children as something positive for them. The for the children notion is mainly there to make the parents feel better about themselves a selfish decision made to make them feel better most of the time. That saying is for people who want to keep up with appearances with their friends family neighbors coworkers etc...but what does the kid want? If the kids are young then they too want the perfect family formula of two parents since thats the only thing they know about it. However older kids the preteens on up? Some of them know that everyones relationship with everybody has a better chance of being intact and or staying positive rather than forcing it.Didnt mean for a wall of text but this post hit hard for me since I was that preteen who knew the idea of my parents staying together was utter bullshit. Both kids would not have grown up with a shit ton of mental and emotional disabilities caked with anger and anxiety if they have decided to separate.

However I believe it is just as unhealthy for a child to grow up and live in an environment where the parents are obviously unhappy being together. Now I am not one to say throw in the towel right away. The parents SHOULD at least make an effort to improve things such as counseling and improving communication. However if those things do not help and all efforts have been exhausted to improve things and the parents are still unhappy then they should just divorce. Children know when their parents are unhappy being together and it makes it a personal hell for them. ,childfree,ch32x9o,1,t5_2qtwb

They wanted me to act pregnant and one of the boys would play my son and pretend to pop out from between my legs. I refused because I felt extremely uncomfortable and left when they wanted to force me. I almost cried and I was really confused as to why they wanted to play a scene like that. I went to play on the swings with some other kids and wondered if there was something wrong with me.

If that  year old really is the brat that hes rumoured to be a locked door isnt going to stop him.You should also fear the worst and prepare your room for the teenage girls because your room is the most obvious place.Also buy a cheap revenge toy if he was a brat and give it to him just before they leave.

1077489,0,t3_26g9lo,My wife and I are now adamantly child free.  My wife has started to become repulsed by children a side effect I suppose but its good to know that we will probably stay on this side of the tracks.  Heres many of the reasons we have decided we do not want kids We like having money.  We dont want to spend every raise we get on childcare a college fund driving lessons a car for a teenager etc.  Im sure you can all relate.  I cant imagine any of you ever think to yourselves I dont like having extra money Id rather burn all of mine. We are not very responsible.  This is something that you really have to be honest with yourself about.  We cant handle the responsibilities of taking care of a dog on our own we tried and werent giving it the attention he deserved so we fostered until he could find a better home.  We can handle smaller animals that are easy to take care of.  Do you think you could honestly take care of a child that needs your attention all day every day for the first few years of its life? We are disgusted by bodily fluids.  I think this is pretty self explanatory. My wife enjoys having her vagina intact.  Ladies I hope you dont twist your legs just thinking about this but Im sure you would rather avoid tearing and stitches down there. We dread the thought of an imperfect child.  I could not imagine having a child with a debilitating mental or physical issue.  I praise parents who are strong enough to raise a child with something like severe autism or any other incapacity but I know I could not handle it.  As such I dont want to take that risk. What if its just a shitty kid?  Some kids are assholes regardless of their parents.  Some kids are assholes because of their parents.  Regardless of the category what if I cant handle being a good parent and the kid turns out to be a problem child?  What if I am a great parent but the kid turns out to be a problem anyway? We like our free time.  Its nice to be able to plan anything how we want to.  But more importantly its nice to be able to do whatever we want without planning it.  I ate a late lunch and am too hungry to make dinner? Great! I dont have to make dinner! I dont have to worry about feeding a child.  A friend wants to fly me out to visit him in another state? Its during a school week? Great! I dont have a kid! I was a bad child.  Another thing where you have to be honest with yourself.  I was an outcast in elementary  middle school and in high school I kept getting into trouble.  My brother was the same way despite my parents trying to teach us both better.  I dont feel like passing that on. My wifes family has some medical issues.  My wife had leukemia as a child.  Her sister has had so many issues with allergies bone problems and at one point she discovered she was allergic to birth control after shed been on it for six months and her health was slowly deteriorating to the point where she was in a wheel chair. Its not a pet.  If it has any problems or if we plain just dont like it we cant return it.  Thats a real fucked up thing to do to a pet but at least we can rehome a pet by posting an ad on craigslist. My wife is too emotional and she accepts this fact.  Whenever anything bad happens she becomes an emotional wreck.  Whenever too much bad stress gets to her she starts to feel panicked and loses all ability to function properly.  Imagine the stress of a child. My wife loves sushi  I dont care for it but you cant have sushi while youre pregnant.  Thankfully I cant get pregnant but for her its a deal breaker.,childfree,chqriey,48,t5_2qtwb

1176966,0,t1_ci1y2n8,I would argue that the point of existance is nonexistant. We give things purpose to make them easier to understand. One could say that reproduction allows a species to continue to exist despite a limited lifespan of its individual members and allows the species to adapt to and survive environmental changes... Or one could simply say that the purpose of life is reproduction. The problem with the latter explaination is that it can cause people to think that reproduction is intended to be the goal in life or that ones passion must be centered around it to be fulfilled.Really reproduction is arbitrarily chosen to be the point of life based on its arbitrarily percieved signifigance in maintaining the existance of life. It is not however the only thing that is required to maintain the existance of life. One could say that the point of life is cellular respiration which would make breathing ones goal in life. Physics could be the point of life which would make ones goal to simply exist....Why did I type this again?,childfree,ci211ks,7,t5_2qtwb

1183306,0,t1_ci2g9ie,gt I think we can easily agree to disagree but definitely mutually agree that payment expectations should be clearly established before the first date.Certainly this but theres a few things that just bother me about this approach. gtFirst this is likely very dependent on surroundings. I live in the South aka southeastern U.S. so theres definitely a certain amount of traditional behavior expected in every aspect of life.Im an antitraditionalist. I judge tradition by the value it brings to ones life. Just because we always did it that way does more harm than good. gtThe payer can feel as entitled as he wants but understand he DID get something in return which was a few hours of my company.Presumably you wanted to spend time with him as well. Why didnt you pay for a few hours of his time instead...hmm?Personally as a hypothetical situation if a person Im seeing would tell me this Id just get up and leave right there. Thats incredibly insulting to be honest. Id rather be with someone who is enthusiastic about meeting me not one who deigns to do me a favour for economic reasons.gtIt removes the power from the guy and in my experience most guys like to feel that they can provide and are providing. Its the hunter in them the LOOK WHAT I BROUGHT FOR YOU aspect to guys.Well that is precisely why Im against it. Im not a hunter and I dont need to bring shinies and meat back to the cave to impress the woman.  Its poor practice and from my perspective socially worthless. Because as a man I will not be able to tell apart who likes that because of tradition on the first date and from whom genuinely expects this kind of regular behaviour.gtIf a woman feels she does owe him something then thats her problem and Id suggest learning assertiveness.Absolutely at least this.gtAdmittedly my perspectives are my own and Ive gathered them from various sources including a Steve Harvey book.Well of course. If it works for you dont change. Im just giving a perspective from the other side of the argument. Its not as if everyone has to have the same opinion that would be just boring.Incidentally this is one of the reasons for which online dating is good. It just removes the dating busywork of filtering incompatible people right from the start even before the first date.PS Ive googled that book. It probably goes without saying but I am less than thrilled with it from the excerpts I read. Eh well.gtBut remember what drives a man real men do what they have to do to make sure their people are taken care of clothed housed and reasonably satisfied and if theyre doing anything less than that theyre not men. Yes mr. Harvey and real scotsmen like haggis. No True Scotsman doesnt like haggis. Fuck off.I should probably not expect a lot from a selfhelp bookIMO the only good a selfhelp book does is line its authors pockets but excerpts like the above are exceptionally simplistic paint  of the population as emotionless automatons and reduce their motivations to easily accepted social roles.Can you imagine the shitstorm if there was a book that stated True women want to look pretty all the time they love their man unconditionally make him sandwiches and have as many children as he wants?

Bring the fact that the whole argument started because he said  we should have kids. Now this is not the way to start a conversation like this if it was already established that there wouldnt be any.He should have just said he wanted to discuss it again probably at another time it seemed really out of place too that maybe he had changed his mind and that he wanted reconsider it. Now it would mean sitting down discussing it and making sure both you and him still want the same thing.Ive been with my GF for  years now and she brought the no kids idea and Im feeling good in it. We didnt exclude it completly but we agreed that we didnt want any right now if not ever so we closed the discussion for something like  years or so since we have other projects.Your BF is wrong in the way he suddently brought back a subject that was closed in a way that was not really open for discussion. But then again it seems like you two were a bit drunk and its never the best time to have serious conversations so maybe he didnt want to bring it this way.The whole your job makes you X or you made poor choices in life is what happens when you want to make the other one angry because heshe said something that hurt you. Most of the time people dont really think what they said they were just in defensive mode trying to hurt the other more. TLDR  Its time for a serious discussion again.

Those who dont pass wont get to have kids and those who only care about sex can have as much as they want without worry of accidental pregnancy.

So yeah the daughter would let her mom chill in the backyard with these kids while she did stuff around town. It was pretty much as useful as having a dead body watch your kids.

Be sure to do the followingTake kiddo to some kind of child targeted restaurant with a play area and loads of other kids. Give him lots of sugar.Attempt to go to a fancy restaurant after giving the kid even more sugar.Ride around on public transport for at least an hour.Go see a nauseating kids movie.Attempt to do the weekly shopping. This will be even more fun if you dont drive.Go to a play park or theme park something with hot sunshine tired sticky children and horiffic muzak. Serve broccoli spinach and any other un kid friendly vegetable with any meals you dont eat out. If he can get through all that and still want a kid then honey youd best think about moving on because hes a breeder for sure.

It always works out in the movies right?Then they get pregnant some people will vocally congratulate them reinforcing their decision many will stay silent and a brave few will question their decision with logic that doesnt contain magical unicorns and be shot down in flames.Then no matter how hard the struggle after that is they will always tell themselves that they did the right thing and try to preach to anyone that no matter how hard having children can be they are a blessing or a gift.And thus the cycle continues.TLDR Babies who have babies dont know any better.,childfree,cjfijkz,6,t5_2qtwb

Today too many parents would be mad at the stranger for being in the way of their upcoming olympian sprinter.As a kid if I had poor grades my parents would ask me what the hell is wrong and make me study harder.

The first shop which I got it from on consignment said it didnt happen for them and therefore they did nothing. The Yamaha dealership said Well the issue is somewhere between these points so were just going to put two new wires there  and that caused everything to short out when the broken wires made a connection. The third shop which is now the only one I trust it took the guy  hours but he found the problem wires and got everything in order. Other than him I only trust family members who are knowledgeableexperienced to work on my bike.The other big thing we had issues with was the front cylinder cutting out. Spark plugs were fine and we replaced them just in case. In the course of figuring out that mystery my granddad and uncle cleaned the carbs cleaned out the gas tank in case of rust worked on the TCI module and did various other little things. You know what it was? It was a fuse with a bad connection. A fuse! The connectors werent secured in the display and when you made a turn the wires got pulled back. We took out the fuse and rigged it directly to the connections and its been great ever since.,childfree,cjl1i6i,2,t5_2qtwb

1649626,0,t1_cjn0zom,Thats nice but simplifies the issue way too much. In truth theres a very significant subset of feminists who claim that men have no business discussing feminism that they should shut up sit down and listen. When understandably some of them get irate about some issues like the disproportionate amount of male suicide or male workplace accidents or the absolutely abysmal way fathers are seen in family courts they are told that feminism benefits them too. Imo feminism is already poisoned by feminazis however much mainstream feminism tries to paint them as a fringe movement. When you have published recognized feminists such as Luce Irigay claiming that Emc is a sexist equation then...This is not solely a problem with feminism in truth but a general problem with academic humanities see the Sokal affair. Welcome to postmodernism where definitions are made up and reality doesnt matter so long as someone feels hard enough that is.In any case this is why many people shy away from feminism. Not because they dont want gender equality but because the movement is poisoned from the inside and the resistance against the iliberal fringe is not pronounced. Take the central tenets of feminism and most people will agree with them. Call them feminism and youve stirred the hornets nest.,childfree,cjn3kje,20,t5_2qtwb

1668888,0,t3_2dg06x,My wife amp I are both in our early s both work in technology and each make low six figure incomes.  There are many benefits we have by being CF. Savings lots and lots of savings.  We both max out our Ks every year and also are able to put over  of our post tax salaries into savingsinvestments.  It makes relationships so much easier when you do not stress over money.  Even when unexpected expenses come up our pool heater broke this year   to replace they can be dealt with and we typically dont have to sacrifice any plans as a result... which leads to . Disposable income.  Even with all of our savings we have no debt except for our house. Credit cards are paid off monthly and we both drive cars that are less than three years old paid for in cash.  Were also able to travel extensively.  Weve been to Spain Germany Italy Mexico and the Dominican Republic in the past four years and have more travel planned Napa for a week in Sept and Panama for Thanksgiving.. Nice home thats well kept.  Our friends wchildren always come over and talk about how clean and nice our housefurniture is.  Its not so much that were really clean as we dont have to childproof things and are both neatorganized so its easy to keep the place looking nice.  . Free Time.  It is so nice to be able to plan things in advance do things on the spur of the moment or do nothing at all bc its just the two of us.  We have no obligations of getting children to soccer practice or having to try and get a baby sitter... just figuring out what we want to do wour evenings and weekends.I think the biggest thing I can say about being CF is that for us it means mostly being stress free. ,childfree,cjpiwrv,3,t5_2qtwb

I would say a year tops would be the limit to give her a chance to decide since it is a pretty big life choice. I say a year but that of course would depend on your relationship goals right now if youre looking to get hitched asap then you might want to move on but if you have time and the relationship clicks then give her some time.   For me even after knowing I wouldnt birth any babies it took several years of saying I might adopt before I realized there were no kids happening at all in my world.  Most of that adoption bit was from societal pressure and not wanting to seem like a monster by saying no kids and making a lifetime commitment at a young age I certainly didnt want to say something as concrete as that and then change my mind.

Maybe more? Not sure honestly I slept through class on the Tuesday we covered My Daughters Sexual History as it so happened. Figures the one day it was potentially entertaining. Darn! Luckily there were no questions on the final exam requiring me to name all of her fuckbuddies in chronological order. That was a relief. Im terrible with names.The course also covered Mr. Buddys expert financial analyst evaluation of the cosmetics industry. For those looking for stock tips out of this review Mr. Buddy is very very bullish on cosmetics because as he pointed out women need to wear makeup. So as a financial expert and an expert in the area of what women need to do Mr. Buddy says Buy! Buy! Buy! So there you have it stock market fans.Of course as Mr. Buddy explained he needed to be very bullish because it apparently costs a right fortune to send your kids and now his grandkids to that expensive Christian school. Im sorry I didnt get the name of it for those in the market but Im sure you can ask him yourself. There are probably a few more things about his life he can work into the syllabus next semester. He didnt manage to cover his and his wifes favorite positions for example. So all in all I have to say the class was very interesting and would be engaging for folks interesting in learning all about Mr. Buddy.

2014070,0,t3_2ht7jz,gt   Parents are More Likely to Have Clear Priorities which Work to the Employers AdvantageReally? Because last I checked parents are encouraged to prioritize their kids amp spouse above all other things in life. Taking Friday afternoon off so that you can pick Timmy up from school and take him to his ballet recital is not a priority that works in an employers advantage.gt   Parents are More Likely to Recognize and Prioritize Complications at WorkSo youre telling me that just because you know how to break up your screaming children when they fight over who gets the red toy you are now more qualified than I am when it comes to intraoffice relations and managerial impartiality? Bullshit. Knowing the delicate process of relieving personal woes of fully grown adults has FUCKING NOTHING  to do with knowing which parental battles to fight and how to fight them.gt   Parents are More Likely Comfortable with LongTerm CommitmentHm. Well the fact that the vast majority of my friends have separated or absentee parents as well as almost half of all marriages in the US ending in divorce nowadays says that claim is pretty much unfounded.Just because you pushed a fucking baby out of your vagina or got it cut out of you and are having a marginally successful time raising them does not translate into any real measurable benefit in the professional world that cant be gained through other means.

2053505,0,t1_cl0lmyl,I actually did this or at least the first part.  One of my college buddies is now a Unitarian minister so we had him officiate the ceremony.  A few minutes in a child starts screamingcrying so at the end of one of his lines I whispered Hey Dave can we pause for a second?  He not understanding why I was asking stopped and said the couple would like a moment for quiet reflection.We stop and the babys still crying.  Our wedding was close to childfree in the sense that children were not invited except for  families one being my brothers were especially close with and who we trusted to be accountable.  Even still we enclosed a handwritten note with their invitations saying that we were making an exception for their children because we trusted them to honor our day and that because we wouldnt be micd during the ceremony wed request they step outside if their children made noise.  In all  cases the parents were flattered to have their children included and promised to comply.So I was surprised to hear continued crying given that the parents of all the invited children had promised quiet.  I leaned to one of my groomsmen Jeremy and asked him to quickly ask the family with the baby to step outside.  I asked Jeremy because I trusted him to handle it quickly quietly and not allow negotiation.  I was  right.  Jeremy turned around and said loudly The people with the baby you gotta go.  And were not going to continue until you do.My wife and the other groomsmen started cracking up.  And the couple with the baby left.  Neither my wife nor I ever turned around and for the rest of the night we told people we didnt want to know who it was.Im sure there were people who thought it was rude but they had the sense to keep their thoughts to themselves.  And we had dozens of people tell us we handled it appropriately or thank us for making sure they could hear the ceremony and vows.  Theres probably some skewing because everyone there knew what we wanted but the response to how it was handled was overwhelmingly positive.I found out later that it was my biblethumping cousin and his wife who brought their   year old daughter NOT one of the families whose kids were invited.  My cousin and I were close growing up but now we live on opposite coasts and have little in common.  He brought his daughter on the trip because Id never met her but she was not invited to the wedding.  My cousin has since apologized and the wedding videos came out great.  Videos plural because we have the edited version which is childnoisefree and we have the unedited version with Jeremys moment in the spotlight which is our preferred version oddly.We also found out later that my cousins wife apparently confronted Jeremy and his wife at the reception.  Nobody involved has been willing to tell us what was said.  So I guess I can count on him to handle some things quietly...TLDR  I did this and response was overwhelmingly positive.,childfree,cl0ugk2,34,t5_2qtwb

2162767,0,t1_cleq2ln,Thank you for your thoughts thats an angle I havent considered.   Although I am childfree I STRONGLY believe that kids do need to be kids and not held to adult standards. They cant sit still like adults can or just play quietly when we want them out of the way or express their emotions like an adult. I know that sometimes things overwhelm them and they literally cannot do anything but scream and sob. Its hard.  That said KNOWING that kids can be like that I think its a parents responsibility to consider the surroundings. A kid melting down at the playground? Well thats inconvenient but understandable as the playground is a place for kids. A kid melting down at Le Expensive Restaurante? Its not the kids fault. The parents have to look around realize that this is a place for intimate conversation and enjoyment of good food and ABIDE BY THE SOCIAL RULES OF THAT ESTABLISHMENT. If the child is incapable of being quiet to allow other diners to enjoy their meals then the parents MUST remove the child from the situation. It does not matter if their child has special needs or they adhere to Cryitoutattachmentonlysayyes style of parenting or anything else. The child must be removed from that environment because they cant abide by the mutuallyagreed social norms.  Its kind of like my dogs. I love my dogs. Id love to take my dogs to restaurants into hospitals to my dentist appointments. It doesnt matter how wellbehaved my dog is there are some places I have to understand I CANT bring my dog. Or if I am technically allowed to bring my dog some people are allergic or will glare at me and say things like dogs dont belong here. Even at a dog park where...dogs are expected my dog still has to follow rules. My dog cant just bite people and other dogs while I say Oh hes just a dog being a dog. I have to be responsible and say Im removing my dog from this situation.  Now I could go online and find dogbloggers who would say Hey your dog is just being a dog its okay to bring your dog EVERYWHERE he has rights! And if he barks all the time or jumps on people they just need to understand hes having a moment! Other people have no right to judge you just because your dog is a jumping biting barking unruly ball of fur Hes supposed to be! Hes a dog!

No where did I read anything about how it was ok to discriminate against people with no children. The bottom line being it shouldnt be asked in an interview for employment because it doesnt matter. Only your ability to do the job is judged. If company A has a job opening that needs to be filled immediately and the candidate being interviewed isnt able to fulfill that then they dont get hired. Simple as that. It that candidate happens to be a pregnant female and they raise hell with the EEOC you have documentation that it had nothing to do with her pregnancy it had everything to do with her inability to start immediately. Dont say every fucking business on the planet. Again you are making broad assumptions based off your pissy opinions.

I have shown him all the perks of having disposable income being able to save a lot of money being able to travel and with no pets either we dont even need someone to be pet sitting for us and I only have cacti so we dont need any plant waterers either we can literally take off on a moments notice how much relaxing evening time we get without any kids how much enjoyable time we can spend on each other instead of having to wrestle little monsters into their clothes bed school hobbies etc how much fun it is to have stress free sex Ive had a tubal ligation how happy and relaxed you are if you get enough sleep we can splurge on ice cream dinners if we feel like it we get to do whatever we feel like and most importantly we are the focus of each others life.He thought he could have kids if he is with someone else but the more hes though about what kids actually entails the more hes on my side of the issue. They are cute sure but they are also the masters of your life and you have to take care of them. And there are no guarantees you get a healthy kind and happy child. I have a monster niece thats a horrible burden on my sister. I have an angel niece thats the easiest kid ever. There are no guratantees.Im happy you are thinking about it more seriously than just agreeing with her for her sake. To take the CF stance you should remember that this is something that you have to feel is right for you independent of circumstances. Would you want to be a father if you were to be a single parent? Would you want to be CF even if you found someone else that really wants kids?Also really really important she might change her mind. You might change your mind. This does not mean anyone of you lied to the other one. It just means that person changed their mind. Its important to understand that we are different people during different ages in our lives. But I really hope the both of you stick together and have an awesome CF life together.It really is freeing to see that you can choose to live the unburdened life of the childfree. Have a great life!Eta I love that your nick is the same as my SOs on the site we met through. D,childfree,clsjojh,2,t5_2qtwb

I didnt do it to keep him even if that was the initial impetus to start thinking about something I had never questioned before I did it because I honestly decided it was a better way to live.

When my gyno told me she was really gentle and nice about it. Because obviously most women once hearing that they may not be able to get pregnant would be quite upset. She asked me if I was ok and I just said YupEven though at the time I thought that I would probably have kids one day the thought of possibly having a difficult time becoming pregnant or possibly never becoming pregnant wasnt something that made me sad AT ALL.

Burying your head in the sand and remaining willfully ignorant is irresponsible parenting.  Like so many questions in life it really comes down to to what extent?

But its ok because that is life. The point of it. That is what every human has to go through and sort of the reason for it all so while it may be hard unpleasant and even horrible at times thats what its all about. Complaining about it is like complaining about having to breathe or eat.But then you see some horrible people who simply refused that burden. If they refused it because no one wanted to share it with them or because they physically couldnt carry it that would be fine because their endless grief would compensate and they would be the ones envying you. But no these shameless individuals dont take the burden because they just dont want to be bothered. Wait was that an option?And instead of looking at you with envy they go on living their lives having fun doing things you no longer are able to do... and instead of just evaporating into thin air due to such absolute lack of our basic purpose nothing happens to them. They are allowed to continue this way. Of course their very existence is an insult. How are you supposed to feel but cheated? But can you really stop and admit that if you knew saying no was an option you would not put yourself through this? Not really the damage is done and if you allow yourself this honesty you might as well just blow your brains out.

Next month you stub your toe and mutter Shit!. She calls HR and goes into complain. While she is bitching her hormones take over and she starts to uncontrollably weep. She gets embarrassed about her inability to keep herself in check and starts to make up behaviors that you never exhibited to justify her crazy weeping and to get back at you for that shit you did to cause the grudge. She gets a tissue from the HR lady and you get written up. Since the HR lady believes her she now feels like she can bad mouth you to everyone else.

2479020,0,t1_cmi18ul,Its not a dangerous dog. Its just a dog dog. A lot of dogs including generally friendly and highly trained dogs are likely to react territorial if a stranger hops a fence into your yard. Were completely ridiculous these days. You cant change the nature of a species to accommodate the decrease in standard common sense of the population. Normal dogs are considered viscous because they dont all go completely against their instinctive nature. I worked in dog grooming and training for  years and I did so based on working within what is in a dogs nature not being cornered care around their face etc. On the other note kids also have their own nature. A twelveyearold is more than old enough to know not to trespass into a fence yard. If the child was younger then its incumbent on the parent to supervise them from doing things like trespassing. Putting up a fence is a pretty clear message to stay out. A dog is one of many hazards that a property owner may enclose inside a fence and its not incumbent on them to provide a complete list to trespassers. Outside of the fact that the police cruiser with K emblazoned on it was probably a dead giveaway that the dog is a trained guardian. ,childfree,cmi596b,16,t5_2qtwb

Mine was done at a hospital as an outpatientday surgery type deal. It was about  minutes of waiting once I changed into a hospital gown  minutes of the actual procedure and then maybe  minutes of waiting before I was allowed to leave. I think most of the wait times were just hospital policy.I know a few other guys that have had it done in both the hospital setting and in the doctors office and generally the hospital ones while they took more time from start to finish seemed to be happier with their outcomes. Not trying to discourage anyone from getting a vasectomy if their doctor only does it out of their office just relaying some anecdotal information.As for the procedurerecovery itself I agree with everything you said. I didnt even need painkillers as it was more of an uncomfortable feeling unless I was moving around. I sat on an ice pack on and off for a few days but beyond that I was pretty much pain free after a week or so. Heavy movement would hurt a bit for maybe another week or two but usually only if it caused things to shift in an awkward manner.Some men myself included notice a weird sensation when ejaculating for the first few times shortly after the procedure.

2618430,0,t3_2pv1t3,I think I count! Im CF partner has  sons from previous marriage weve no intentions of marrying so Im not a stepanything. We have the boys every second weekend. Its... not so bad actually! These kids were carefully vetted before approval and I was given many test runs and opportunities to change my mind about having them in my life. Ultimately theyre here on merit. Good kids and thats from me who hates kids. Its been about a year of this arrangement and it is working out. Theyre cool people who happen to be temporarily kids. They wont be forever and when that time comes Id like to have cool adult relationships with them. Their ages were absolutely key to this working. Eldest is  just graduated high school looks you in the eye and shakes your hand like a man. The two younger are  and . Old enough to count as independent people in my eyes. I dont feel the same way about their younger cousins  too small and unpredictable. Backing up this arrangement is a stable employed and nondrama fuelled biomum who while we dont have a direct relationship has not impeded my life in any way. Shes actually shared her family with me and Im grateful for that. Last but never least is my partner who just gets it. He doesnt get conflicted over his investment in his kids versus his acceptance of my CFness. He agrees with my reasoning and I think in another life he might have been CF too. But his sons are not a thing he regrets or shrinks from hes a fully involved and devoted dad to them. Im at times quite strident about my CF feelings and he never rebuffs me or invalidates my opinions. He probably could but he chooses not to. He never pushed a love me love my kids agenda but ultimately I chose to have him with the kids rather than not have him simply to avoid the kids. The downsides? Our house is a small apartment were a little in each others faces but I escape to my room as much as I need to and am left in peace. The endless sounds of video games make me a little batty but video game sounds spell less child sounds so choose your battles. Minor trifles of living with others peacefully. The one big thing that wont go away is the theoretical question of could I handle more should they need their dad or their second home more frequently or even permanently in the future. Thats just a thing that sits there in the back of your mind and you can torment yourself with it or you can accept that its the great unknown. Ive decided its not an invalid path in life to simply cross each bridge as you meet it. How I might feel in the future is not something I can judge right now only that when it comes I know that I will be given choices and the freedom to do whats best for me. Sorry for the wall of text just thought my perspective  caught between CF and something not quite parental  is a rare one. Thought Id report back from the front lines as it were. I dont feel like a fencesitter I feel like I made three little exceptions in my Great Wall of CF. Im glad I did. ,childfree,cn0d81o,3,t5_2qtwb

2725762,0,t3_2ra2ax,Youre financially independent adults.You must reset your family relationships on an adulttoadult level.The days where adults tell you what to do and when to do it are over.You sit down decide on your boundaries and decide how you are going to enforce them. Then you do it.You should each handle your own families thats the rule. Otherwise it turns the SO into the scapegoat. You have to say things like I have decided X because its right for me regardless of whether I were married to SO or not. Luckily SO has also decided that X is right for him. We therefore have an agreement on X.  That way it is  clear that YOU have made YOUR choice and your SO is not to be blamed for talking you into something.So you both decide. We do not want to discuss kids with X personfamily any further. We have a plan on making that happen that we both agree to enforce equally and as a united front. Lets go do it!So before the next time you go to X persons place or are going to see them take them aside privately if possible. Granny Nosey I need to discuss something with you. Its very important to me. Ive brought along ltSOgt for support for me but this discussion is between you and I. Are we clear?Good. OK so during Xmas the entire time we were with you about  hours the conversation did not include any discussion about our lives our accomplishments or anything of interest to me. In fact you never said anything unless it was about one single topic. As a result I did not get to enjoy Xmas with you at all and did not at all enjoy your company that day. I do not want that to happen in future. So my first request of you is that from now on we discuss a wide variety of topics when we are together. I would for example like to hear about ltyour childhood your knitting who gives a fuckgt and I would like to talk about my school my job my hobbies... whatever. Can we agree on that? OK great.The next issue I have to discuss with you is that that topic you discussed nonstop for  hours straight was about me having a baby ASAP. You remember that correct?So I have to tell you something straight up. I have decided that I will not be having a baby now. I will also not be having a baby anytime in the next X years. For CFfencesitters I may in fact never have a baby at all. For CFers Never I have a plan for my life that takes into account that we are living in  and not  or even . Times have changed and I as a female get to do a lot of things that were unthinkable when you were my age like going to college. I plan to do all of those things before I even consider having a baby.So I need you to completely stop telling me to have a baby. Its not going to happen. When and if I decide to think about having a baby I will let you know. But in the meantime the subject is closed.Can you agree to that?If she agrees... then youre good. At least until she strays and needs a refresher course. If she just goes off on you you try to stop it Grandma stop. Im talking now and you need to listen to me. Stop.... Granny Im not two years old anymore. Im an adult. You dont get to run this conversation. Im in charge here. etc.If she completely loses it... you just say...OK clearly it is not possible to have a grownup relationship with you. That is a dealbreaker for me since I will not be bullied by you. Im afraid that our relationship needs to end today. I wish you the best of luck in your future. Im truly sorry that you will not get to be part of my and SOs wonderful future if applicable and that you will never even get to meet our kid. Goodbye. ltwalk outgtAlways remember that once you are an adult... you are in the position of power in the relationship with family members because you have the power to walk away and to destroy their illusion of the perfect family and im a great grandma and all of those things. If they dont want that to happen and are as afraid of being without you as most are there is a good chance they will cave to your demands.

2772179,0,t1_cnj65gp,I really dont want to find a new family. I like this family theyre just being a bit too selfishentitled. I told them in the very first meeting we had what I would do for each dollar amount. For X dollars I will nurture and care for and educate your baby. I will provide developmentally appropriate activities and play exciting outings and adventures and ensure your child has the best possible foundation for early childhood learning. For Y dollars I will do all of that plus these specific house oriented tasks the kid laundrydishwasher etc. and your grocery shopping. For Z dollars I will act as your personal genie. This would include all home cooked meals all laundry all errands. Well Im basically doing the Zplus job for Y pay. And Im not trying to make it about money. To me its more about respect. You have to have some sort of respect for the person bending over backwards to make your life run smoothly. At first I felt appreciated. They would frequently thank me for being the most amazing person ever. Say things like we dont know what we would do without you etc. But over time the appreciation waned and the entitlement waxed. When I said hey guys schools starting and I wont be able to cook every day remember not my job my boss looked so offended and upset...like how dare she think she can study instead of cooking my dinner. And it made me realize the thanks and praise are pretty shallow if you get pissed off when someone doesnt go above and beyond.At the end of the day I love my little toot. She can be a handful but I dont want to lose her. And I care about the family as a whole. Im just feeling used and it took me by surprise. Thanks for letting me rant and vent. Its been therapeutic because I cant say a lot of this to them. Even though my boss is a trained mediator shes being pretty passive aggressive about it even though Im trying to bring it up ahead of time and keep the communication flowing. TLDR I dont want to find a new job and I dont really think they want to fire me but if they did I have solid credentials and  years experience to get a new gig with.,childfree,cnj6qe5,4,t5_2qtwb

She wasnt allowed in any of the places in the house that I liked to be unless my parents were there. If my parents were in another room nope she had to stand outside and watch.When she was a bit older She was my personal servant. Mom says clean my room? Sis cleans my room. I want some water? She gets me the water.I never hurt my sister and we have a good relationship now but when she finally got old enough to realize she didnt have to do everything I said I got in so much trouble.

Instead of letting my husband have one the doctor suggested I should get an IUD as we were in our mid s and we may change our mind. I thought it was rude to put birth control on me without knowing anything about my medical back ground which is extensive. I went to get an IUD and it was a pain the first clinic couldnt get it in even thought  nurses tried so they sent me to the womans hospital where I was injected with a sedative to relax cervix to have it placed after  years with it and lots of hormone fluctuations pain and varying periods I had it removed and now am on the novaring which is working but still a pain in the ass. We are going to try getting a vasectomy this year as I am sick of having to use birth control.

2898004,0,t3_2taqq0,Im  and got sterilised last year on the NHS. Im also in Scotland where we dont have CCGs so its possible that my experience will be a bit different to yours. Throughout my s I tried every form of contraceptive available to me except Implanon because I have a massive phobia of things under my skin and just touching the model in my GPs surgery made me freak. Depo was great until it left me with osteopenia. Various forms of pill and patch followed but every single one of them came with weight gain and massive mood swings. The copper coil made me bleed continuously. I wasnt expecting the Mirena coil to work out for me but actually it did. Eventually at  I was sterilised. The counselling consisted of an appointment with a gynaecology consultant who talked me through the procedure checked that I understood it and asked a few questions about my life  had I always felt sure I didnt want kids was I in a relationship had I discussed it with my partner was I absolutely clear on the fact that its irreversible. Nothing too daunting. However the big difference between you and me is that I was in my s at the time and you according to your flair are in your s. I was just biding my time until I got past  and gynaecology consultants would take me seriously for sterilisation. You shouldnt face the same agerelated problems. If youre asking your GP for the first time the chances are theyll give you reading material about tubals and Essure and send you away to think about it. My advice is dont ask. See your GP tell them which procedure youve chosen mention the other one and why you ruled it out so they know youve read up on that too and say that you would like a gynaecology referral. If the GP or the consultant brings up Mirena and Implanon Id suggest telling them that you investigated these options at a nonNHS clinic Marie Stopes for example and they proved to be unsuitable. There are plenty of women who cant have a coil inserted let alone use it for  months. ,childfree,cnxib20,1,t5_2qtwb

To me this is just morally objectionable he added.Here in the US we discriminate against children all the time.  They arent allowed to purchase alcohol or cigarettes for example.  They arent allowed to enter contracts own real estate or vote.  They cant go into a strip club or see an Xrated film in theaters.  You think the gays have it tough not being able to get married?

How about you grow up and deal with the consequences of your decision to bring kids on an airplane? How about you have some compassion for those around you and realize that the person glaring at you might be doing so because your bratty child has given them a debilitating migraine or who knows what because you arent the only fucking person on the planet and believe it or not but kids crying can cause real harm to people around you.You dont have to give people candy or anything but you also shouldnt be a nasty cunt.,childfree,co8avdv,333,t5_2qtwb

3045648,0,t1_codo0w5,gtYou want the wedding  miles away and for everyone tl wear purple? Ok Im down. But you gotta fill me in on what the hell is going on.People do destination weddings or weddings where one person is from a different city state province country etc. all the time. Other times its because grandma Ruth doesnt travel long distances anymore so they are having it closer to her. Or maybe that particular place has significant meaning in the couples relationship. Few people just throw a dart at a map and decide thats where theyre getting married. Purplethemed weddings? I agree that Im going to want to have a little more informationguidance than that. And if you are a close friend or family member I will go along with almost anything except a nudist wedding because I really dont want to see a bunch of people I know and all the old relatives naked. If youre a university friend I havent really kept up with and just being polite with the invite? Im not flying to another country and wearing a spacesuit to the ceremony. I will politely decline and send a cardgift.gtPeople dont think like that though.There is a comment here where someone tried to add  to an RSVP because they had four kids. There are others where little Jimmy is coming too! and a plethora of other the rules dont apply to me happened. While I agree that trying to bring kids to a childfree wedding and adding  to your RSVP as a result is a worse offence than a cousin who you didnt specify a guest for wanting to bring their partner you didnt know about I am no longer surprised by people that do think that way. gtIm calling you out on your shit.Yes and I am too.

You are telling him to stay married to his wife live in the house his child is being raised in but to not take care of it. Do you have ANY idea what that can and will do to a kid? I do I experienced it first hand. It lead to me running away at  and also several suicide attempts. When the kid gets old enough it is going to KNOW whats going on and its going to blame itself. It is going to feel like shit and feel worthless. And as much as OP doesnt want a child he has no right to punish this child that is being born because of his and his wifes mistake. This child is not asking to be brought into this world it has no choice in the matter so why should it suffer?OP needs to either buck up and do his best to be a decent father which I fully understand will NOT be easy for him at all because its a shitty situation he never wanted or he needs to get out of the relationship and remove himself entirely which is probably the best option for all involved. He will still have legal obligations and the kid is still going to be hurt buts it way fucking better than the kid being forced to live in the exact same house as the father that wants nothing to do with it. Be a s father? Really?

3122610,0,t3_2vwy3b,As somebody from the UK I absolutely hate this. IVF is expensive but it does not save a persons life. The NHS is stretched so far already that patients are often denied life changing  and life extending medication due to the cost. People are refused treatments and equipment that would revolutionise the way they live. Yet IVF is funded. Nobody ever died from not having a child. Ever. If people spout i knew somebody who committed suicide because she couldnt live without having a baby I call bullshit. No that person had depression and needed therapy and help not having children was not the reason they died.  It makes me so annoyed the government would fund this. We are very lucky to have free medical care here but it should be reserved for people who are actually unwell. Private clinics offer IVF and if people went to spend their own money on fertility treatment that is fine by me. If you cant afford the fertility treatment you probably cant afford the kid in all honesty.  Somebody once said to me well you got a tubal on the nhs. I had to politely explain that the cost of a tubal was less overall than the country supplying me with contraceptives for the rest of my fertile years and a fraction of what it costs for one complication free natural birth. ,childfree,colnocz,13,t5_2qtwb

There is a deep human desire to be a member of a tribe and tribes have rivals.  In reality almost all humans are primarily members of one rather homogeneous node in a network of global economic machinery.  Basically we live in a hive.

The societiescultures that died out were either overrun by superior technology or numbers or they were bred out by intermixing whether by conquest or chance with the invading cultures.Its unlikely that the Aztec Inca or Mayan would be in control of their respective preColumbian areas today if they just had more people. The technology and lack of immunity to Old World diseases are what really caused them to be diminished in population to the point of being subsumed into the new dominant culture in the area. ,childfree,cp568j5,9,t5_2qtwb

I did get my share of messages from creepers which will happen in any part of life bc creepers are everywhere and single dads that were offended that I didnt want to bend my no kids rule. So thatll happen. I did find that men would write that they were undecided maybe or not sure or whatever about kids in their stats though. Id ask about it and the most common explanation was that they couldnt get dates with a CF statement on their profile. I paid the nominal fee for the bonus features and never looked back. You can sort by religious preference child stance smoking and drinking habits. All kinds of stuff. I spent a lot of time in QampA reading their answers and answering my own questions too.   To add to the challenge I have a pretty specific type. I generally date alpha male tall beardy dark haired feminists that have no interest in sports religion or children. They have to be a non smoker laid back happy and LGBTfriendly. I live in DC and I had PLENTY of options even with my weirdly specific preferences. You might have to branch out to the nearest big city but thats okay! Big cities have lots of awesome stuff so dates will be fun.    For some perspective... Im  years old divorced covered in tattoos kind of mouthy highly opinionated a clean freak and prior military. I belly dance salsa perform burlesque and have been told by several dates that Im a bit much. If I can find wonderful respectful loving generous intelligent fun men ANYONE can. I promise.

3411732,0,t3_2zal34,You need to make your own decisions for yourself regardless of your partner because thats the only way to be sure that you will be happy with your choice for life. You should never ever have or not have a kid based on what a partner wants. You each have to make your own personal final choice and then if you are on the same page go ahead or if not separate and go do what each of you wants. Thats the only way it can be without making a giant miserable resentful hellish mess.... and then separating later on when you cant take it anymore.You can simulate what the first year of having a baby would be like  and if you survive it then you can decide if you would actually want to do it for real for multiple years. more on the simulation later.You also need to ask yourself the series of questions to get at what exactly you might value about having andor raising a child and see if there are alternatives that would satisfy those wishes in a different manner that would not require the financial and other sacrifices that do not interest you. For example you could be a volunteer for some kid organization or be a big sister... do some of it without having to do it full time.As for the bullshit of someone take care of me when im old first of all if you work with the elderly.... you know that does not pan out most of the time. The kids have their own lives and their own kids to raise... their parents are not high on the To Do list most of the time. This is only going to get worse with this generation of kids who cant take their faces out of their phone and are far far to entitled and spoiled to ever change their parents diapers. Also Remember that in  years something like  of the jobs that exist today will be long gone so only about  of kids will be able to get a job leave home live on their own. The other  will be unemployed or under employed  of college graduates currently and most likely be living at home for most or all of their lives potentially with their children too. Are you prepared to support multiple generations from your savings if it comes to that?Also Do NOT confuse elder care today with what the future will be like  years from now when you are old. Well have selfdriving cars inhome telemedicine exoskeletons and robots to cart you around and clean your house and your groceries will be delivered by drones. So you will be able to live a MUCH more independent life than elderly are able to do today. At the point where you cant be independent with the use of technology youre probably going to be in a fucking coma or otherwise too out of it to care any longer.... and most likely would not know your kids if they did show the fuck up for xmas once a year. Besides you never want to have a kid because you want a personal slave. You dont want that for the kid or yourself.As for having the discussions with your partner after you make your decisions there is a screeningdiscussion framework for that. But FIRST you have to decide what you want.As for the simulation heres the short and less intense version below. If you can do this ALL for an ENTIRE YEAR.... and survive with your sanity finances and relationship intact you may able to handle a kid at least a healthy one if not a disabled or ill one.copypasta Once the practical safety net is in place then you need to do some serious thinking about what you want the rest of your life to look like.Do you want to spend  years doing little else besides being focused on raising and paying for a child? How would you handle it if the child turned out to be severely disabled and require  care until the day you die? Are you ok with spending your retirement years changing a  year olds diapers?Do you have the  it costs to raise a middle class first world child until ? Are you going into a career where you will earn that much?Are you ok with the potential that you may tear backwards or forwards.... there is always some small chance of damaging ahem those nerves. Etc.If you want to see what having a child would do to your lives you can simulate it easily.Have old posts on how to do that. But for starters set up a separate savings account that you are forbidden to touch. Set up an automated daily transfer from your main account into that account so that overnight each and every night  is transferred into that untouchable account.Do that for a year. See what it is like to live on that new level of lower income.Can you afford to stay in your current apartment or do you need to move to the slums? Go and actually shop for an apartment that you could afford with your lower income. See what they are like! Can you still afford to pay the rest of your bills? Are you at each others throats because theres no money for even rice and beans to eat? Do you end up having to sell one of your cars and become a single car family? How does that impact your lives? Then while you are doing that for the year. Each of you downloads a screaming baby ringtone. You set that to go off every two hours  for  straight minutes. except at work because that would be strange and use headphones. Every time it goes off you both have to stop what you are doing including getting off the highway leaving the grocery store in the middle of shopping etc. Then you listen to the screaming for  minutes before returning to what you were doing.At night you will have to wake up every two hours. And both of you walk to the living room and stand there for  minutes listening to the screaming ringtone. Then go back to sleep for  hours and repeat.Do that for the full year as well.See how your productivity and stress level fares see if youre still having any sex. See if you even still like each other.Also from the day you start this experiment count forward  weeks. This will be your postpartum window. During those six weeks you have zero sex. After that you can have sex no more than twice a week.more than  men and women spilled some startlingly frank details about what theyre doing or rather not doing in bed. While  perncent of respondents said they have sex with their partner once or twice a week  percent only get it on once or twice a month.  percent do the deed less than once a month while  percent said Sex? Whats that?There are more things as well but that should give you a good start at seeing what your future life as parents would be like.If you come back a year from now and say OMG IT WAS AWESOME! then you might be able to survive parenthood.,childfree,cph5uzt,2,t5_2qtwb

3529571,0,t1_cpukutu,I appreciate your perspective and I know its a broken and rough system. There isnt any focus on changing it and I feel it needs to be better. Its one more broken social system we have to offerRegular parents and a lot of these foster families have kids of their own too arent qualified but neither are a lot of people that end up having kids. Step parents can be rapey and abusive and play favorites parents snap and drive in diapers to kidnap their kids....I first hand know a few parents who have gone through IVF and its another form of privilege in a way. Its expensive uncertain and can sometimes take years of pouring money time emotions etc. Sometimes it produces nothing instead of something and people have sunk all their money into it. While adoption isnt a perfect alternative I dont see enough people trying to help or make it easier or even bothering to fix the system. Thanks for the point of view! I do like a good civil discussion. My sister in law just gave birth to her third kid and the first two were conceived through IVF. They were lucky to have the means to do this but like I said it comes with privilege as well. It hurts to know that people would rather take the easy way out than fix a broken social system.Edit I wish competent parents would pick adoption over IVF.

My animals were well trained and never bit anyone without provocation.  But small children arent always trained to play nice and be respectful of animals therefore their parents need to watch out for them.  My brother and I were playing video games with some friends.  We had one of those legless chairs with the rounded bottom that sat on the floor and could rock back and forth.  A friend was sitting in the Nintendo chair and rolled back on the tail of our lb dog.  She yelped and yelped but he didnt move because he didnt know.  So she gave him a few nips on the arm so he would move.  It hurt he was a bit teary and bruised but he wasnt mad at the dog.  Neither were his parents.  Everyone in this situation understood why the dog did what she did and that it wasnt out of viciousnous but necessity that she reacted this way.

And my family knows that.Speaking as someone with assets its never a good idea to divulge the details of your financial status to individuals unless you really really trust them or you need them to know for another legitimate reason i.e. wealth management tax guy financial advisors etc.. Once people know you have money its incredibly difficult to discern if they have any ulterior motives. Family can be particularly bad about this if they know you have money and they dont  and Im speaking from experience here. Sometimes they feel entitled to your money by virtue of being your family  Ive had to cut off family members both close and estranged for precisely this reason. It got ugly fast.In the future Id strongly suggest keeping your financial status private from family and friends  you invite less drama into your life that way. Personally the only people who know my net worth are my immediate family members who set up my trusts and our financial manageradvisor. No other family members friends coworkers or acquaintances know and Ive only had one of them my boss actually make jokescomments alluding to me having money presumably because he figured out who most of my jewelry is by. Family members who did find out and gave me a hard time about it were summarily cut out of my life. Your sisters financial situation is not your problem. Her kid is the one who did the damage and so she as the parent is responsible for figuring out how to pay for it. If she has a hard time doing that then maybe she should think about actually parenting her kid to prevent a repeat occurrence. ,childfree,cq1hisj,12,t5_2qtwb

Some people have separate bedrooms some people even live in separate buildings or apartments or even in different towns.With that said negotiating some of these things can be really difficult and limit your dating pool. If you do find yourself thinking about a relationship and find someone you like you could bring up your concerns. The person may be more along the same wavelength than you realize.

I dont know how to get that message out in a productive and helpful way since its so ingrained in peoples brains that its just this thing you do once youve been alive long enoughare dating someone long enoughget married etc... but I do strongly feel that its something that everyone should be confronted with before they have kids. Honestly our schools should be teaching it. Just with the facts mind you.

3912607,0,t1_cr210fc,True story that little mew sound is the only reason we have one of our cats. My husband and I used to go to the pet store as a cheap date when we had just moved in together and didnt have a lot of money. We would always say were not getting a pet were just going to play with some animals and go home. Yeah. Really. We said that. And it worked for a while because my husband takes a while to get attached to animals so he doesnt immediately want every animal he sees. I on the other hand will take home any nonhuman mammal that even looks at me. So one night we go to the pet store and they have kitten adoptions going on. Were just looking at all the kittens in the large cage and my husband was tapping on the side of the cage a bit. One of the kittens came up and put his tiny little paw right where my husbands fingers were resting on the cage looked straight up at him and made the most pitiful little meow Ive ever heard. Right then I witnessed my husband melting for the first time. Within  seconds he was asking if we could hold the little orange and white cat and within  minutes we were taking him home with us. Weve had him for five years now and hes probably my favorite living being other than my husband. Weve added another cat to the family but Bear has a special place in my heart. ,childfree,cr29tld,18,t5_2qtwb

She was almost shocked at the revelation that you could choose to not have kids and needed time to reevaluate her stance in it all. She decided that she wanted kids sometime in the future and we both agreed to split up.A year later she contacts me and says something along the lines of she wanting me more than she wants kids. I had not been able to get her out of my mind either so I decided to take the risk and trust her judgment on this. We had an extensive conversation where I told her about my vasectomy and all that so she knew that being with me meant no kids ever.We stuck together and had a great time for a few months before she tells me that she thought she could handle it but she cant so I had to go.I have selectively stayed away from even pursuing anyone who may want kids. Which has led to my perpetual single status ever since. Friends of the family and even some relatives have expressed some polite concern over me not having a girlfriend for a while.

Most other people just bought clothes maybe one or two outfits since they got them new at a store and baby clothes are strangely expensive. The author however went to a thrift store picked out a huge assortment of baby clothes for all different occasions from birth through one year of age for all different seasons and weather presumably not picking out ones with obvious stains took them home to wash dry and fold then gave it to the new mother. Presumably Mom was more excited to get a big bag of clothes that would pretty much take care of the first year rather than one or two little cute things. Anyway I guess my point is that even if you have to buy your own baby stuff you could just hit the thrift stores for  cent second hand stuff rather than buying new I feel like the baby stuff in stores costs as much as grown up clothing. ,childfree,crixup9,45,t5_2qtwb

But I dont think youre actually helping.I dont think making new words will make it happen less. In my experience I see thats not rape much more than rape is no big deal. Calling it something else is what I see people do to convince themselves that they or their friends are not rapists or havent been raped or would never rape or be raped. Its easy to push it away if its something violent strangers do to women in dark alleys.I think were better off saying yes rape is awful and here is what actually happens and here is how not to do it. I think when people say thats just fraud the people doing it think lying is bad but its not evil and horrible like rape.

It felt like a slap in the face but I decided it was merely a way of keeping me in the loop though I never stayed in contact with old boyfriends. This was before the internet was a normal thing.Later on mutual friends filled me in on how things were going with him unprompted I never asked! They said hes balding and gained weight pretty standard I guess that his babymom refused to bring the now  kids to see his mother she lives in a lowincome but otherwise very nice apartment her only grankids at the time and that the baby mom is not a nice person.He had sent me a letter at the year anniversary of our breakup a sincere apology for having been so crappy to me when I clearly didnt deserve it. I accepted said we were young and didnt know better.

Dont let them show up at the church doors with unanounced kids. Make some sort excuse to get them early and preferebly alone.Ive heard of weddings where they falsely claimed the sediment around the church was seriously corrosive to cars and that theyd drive shuttle guests from a parking lot to the church in a special not really car anyone with kids was asked to leave at the car park no big scene. Or you could organise something like seeing the local gardens to weed them out the parents that brought their kids skipping the tour didnt have anyone to have a tantrum in front of. An easy one is to turn them away right at the property line station a security guard at the gate noone with children is allowed on the property no excuses.

I mean the weeks and even months after you suddenly add a baby to your life are a pretty mentally and physically disorienting time. I am a huge believer in thankyou cards. I have a whole bin of them  just thankyou notes alone  and I write them religiously for almost everything. But after my kid was born I was so so inundated with kindness and generosity from so many people and so SO overwhelmed that I hardly wrote one. I was mortified but I just never got it done. My kid is turning one year old next month and I have since called or emailed everyone who sent me money for the babys college fund sent me baby stuff brought me dinner etc and thanked them personally for the individual item they sent I do remember who gave me what  I noticed and cared deeply and told them that Im completely mortified to have left it this long.

4607077,0,t3_3e40v8,Welcome. This is a nice little clubhouse. Youve got lots of choices on how to deal with them. The major factors are being a legal adult and financially on your own and possibly if theres a potential inheritance that you want that may require additional gamesmanship Ultimately they cannot force you to have a kid. And they have zero say in whether you do or not. And theyre not allowed to bully you or play guilt games.If theyre going to be helping you with school costs and such for a while then your best plays are the old shrug avoid kick the can down the road types of approaches. Dont get into any discussions dont offer reasons dont explain yourself in any detail. There is just no upside to that. With the schooling you have a perfect scenario for playing kickthecan.  Gosh long time before Iwe even think about that! So much to do before Iwe even consider settling down.... Were focused on schoolcareers.... Not until weve traveled to at least a dozen countries! Not until its the last thing on the bucket list! which we plan to never get to... but not telling you that Plus all any medical specific ones... Anyone who tries to have a kid while in residency should be admitted to the psych ward STAT! My student loans....After that you can just tell them that youre not interested in discussing the topic.Right now thats not in the cards for the forseeable future. If that should change I will let you know. Until then the subject is closed.Other sorts of options Im really not going to have this conversation with you. Im not having this conversation with you. Thats honestly not your concern. The topic is not open for discussion. That is a private matter optional between me and my SO You know were just not close enough for me to want to talk about my sex life with you. Its time to change the topic to ltother topicgtAnd you can do various things to reset your relationship to be adultadult such as the boundary setting techniques.Mom we need to discuss something. The last five times we have met for coffee you have not asked be about X Y Z important things in your life. Instead of caring about my life and being interested in the things that matter to me... all you have done is babble on about how I should have a baby. To be honest because of that these coffees have ceased to be enjoyable for me so this will be the last one for now. Enjoy the rest of your afternoon. Bye!Mom you know what if your only reason for calling every week is to ask me if ive shot a load of cum in someone random womans vagina lately you can just stop calling because I find the whole conversation to be kinda pervy.

Untilunless the kid actually SAYS something that gives the police something to act on or untilunless she can get a PI to produce evidence that might be actionable there is nothing that can really be done.The person she suspects is the kids biological dad and shes been trying to get the courts to rescind his visitation rights but because all she has to go by so far is her own suspicions and no real evidence the courts wont do anything about it not even issue a temporary restraining order. So its quite a clusterfuck.But she has been trying to get authorities involved for a long time. But there wont be much to go on unless the kid spills the beans about whats happening.If anything is happening at all.

Thats for the short term issue then also ask them if they can suggest any respectful doctors in the area. You might get lucky.If all else fails take the list of doctors from your insurance and just start contacting them until you find someone  thats how the doctors on the list got on the list by folks searching and shopping.

Many apartments near universities cater primarily to students so there will be few to no children. though you might have to deal with loud college parties When youre at the apartment see if there are lots of amenities designed for kids such as playgrounds. Maybe see if there are rules restricting when kids can use things like pools or gyms. Some apartment complexes only have one bedroom and studio apartments so families would be rare.,childfree,cthayi4,4,t5_2qtwb

4658564,0,t3_3er9z5,I always use this example when explaining why I dont particularly like children.Imagine you dont like dogs. You dont hate them you dont hate responsible owners in general you have nothing against them. But you also dont feel anything for dogs. You dont find them cute interesting funny...Now tell me what happens if you go campingor any other event and someone tells you that they will bring their dog. Of course this is not good news for you. Because although you have nothing against dogs when you take cuteness and fun away from dogs they are really just barking hyperactive furloosing animals that will bother you every time you eat. And you know that best case scenario is that the dog is going to behave nice and will not bother you. Your life will not be enriched in any way.Well I dont like kids. I dont hate them I dont hate responsible parents in general I have nothing against them. But I also dont feel anything for children. I dont find them them cute interesting funny...Now what happens when I go out with friends and someone tells me they will bring their child. Of course this is not good news for me. Because although I have nothing agains kids when you take cuteness and fun away from children they are really just badly behaved snotty little humans that will probably bother you. And I know the best case scenario is that the kid will behave nice and will not bother me. Actually unlike dogs that cant understand a word you have to behave differently around kids and simple act of bringing the kid to such event will fuck up atmosphere pretty badlyno swearing no dirty jokes no sexual or political topics no loud sounds. And i know my life will not be enriched by this kid in any way.So yeah its pretty much impossible to really like dogs if you dont find them cute or interesting.

Like if parents werent assumedforced to be a romantic partnership and therefore a romantic model to children.  People could team up for odd years to raise the kids they want so badly as friends with the understanding that this partnership is to support the kids.  Then you wouldnt have spouses who didnt realize their coparent wanted kids more than a relationship or people who feel like this lecturer having to fake an unwanted romantic relationship to raise kids.The whole notion of the only acceptable family unit consisting of no more and no less than two romanticallysexually paired adults and their children is just so confining on so many levels and it hurts everyone who doesnt fit it well.  Parents like this guy CF people people who dont want to be in a romantic andor sexual relationship people who want to be in more than one and so on.

LOLThere is ABSOLUTELY no reason to have kids to have stay in save or whatever a relationship. In fact if you do that it will blow up in your face. If you dont want kids you just move on find a CF partner and rock on with your life how you want it to be.Ask yourself this If in nine months you were standing in the delivery room looking at your current partner.... and she were lying there having died in childbirth and you were handed the child to raise alone. How much of an mistake would you think you had made?Are you prepared to raise a child who is  disabled and will never live independently? What happens if you have a child and  years from now you are a  year old who is changing a  year olds diapers?Is that a risk youre willing take?gt life is just not going to be the same.You are correct. Having kids will destroy her body and your sex life. Theres even some chance that she tears forward and loses sensation there. Also you will never again be a priority nor will your relationship. Everything shifts. The odds are high you will likely stop being a couple and just become coparents   chance youll be divorced coparents.Go visit rdeadbedrooms for what you have in store for your sex life with  kids. Spoiler alert With four kids pretty certain youll have no sex life.Here you go straight from horses mouth a survey of parents by Parenting magazine no lessgt more than  men and women spilled some startlingly frank details about what theyre doing or rather not doing in bed. While  perncent of respondents said they have sex with their partner once or twice a week  percent only get it on once or twice a month.  percent do the deed less than once a month while  percent said Sex? Whats that?As far as being certain its actually kind of easy. First do you have any experience raising children? Younger siblings? etc.Second if youre up for trying out the lifestyle you can do a simulation which will give you a small sense of what it will be like minus the actual baby the emotional stuff and being covered in shit piss and vomit for a decade or two. copypaste You can run a year long test. If you survive the year doing the below things. You may enjoy having a child. First how are your geneticsfamily history? What about those of your partner? If you are the one who would be carrying the child how is your health? Are you likely to have complications? PPD? What are the odds on you dying in childbirth aka you have a heart condition diabetes etc.?Second Are you likely to have a disabled child an average child or a gifted child? If its anything but average youre going to have to increase all of the steps below to reflect the added expenses increased level of attention time and care.This is for an average kid Download a screaming infant ringtone for your phones if you have a partner. At ALL TIMES when you are not at work or in a professional setting that would be weird! you set your phone to go off with that screaming every two hours. THAT INCLUDES OVERNIGHT EVERY NIGHT. That includes when you go out to dinner or the movies. Youll have to use headphones. Whenever it goes off you have to stop what you are doing set your phone timer for  minutes and you must do nothing else but stand and listen to that screaming child sound. At night that includes both of you getting out of bed walking to your livingroom and standing there for  minutes. Then you go back to bed for the next  hours. Repeat every night. See how well you handle living on no sleep. Figure out what a baby costs on a daily basis. In the US thats about day. Set up a separate savings account that you are not allowed to touch. From your incoming checking account set up an automatic transfer every night for that daily cost of raising a child. See if you can live on your new reduced income. If you find out that you cannot live on it then you would need to find a cheaper place to live.... so go see some of those shitty apartments. See what it would be like to live in the crappy part of town. See what it would be like to not be able to own a car and have to take the bus everywhere every day. Basically simulate what it would be like on your new budget. From the day you start the experiment NO sex for the next six weeks. AT ALL. This would be your or partners  healing time after having a baby. Then after the six weeks you have sex no more than once a month for the next year.This is often what your sex life looks like after kids.parenting.comblogsshowandtellsexandmarriagegtmore than  men and women spilled some startlingly frank details about what theyre doing or rather not doing in bed.

Whats that? Take a backpack get  pounds worth of gym weights of some kind. Except for when you are at work you have to wear the backpack or if youre sitting down you have to have it on your lap  its on your lap when youre watching TV eating dinner working on your computer etc. After two months double the weight. At  months triple it. You and partner can no longer do anything funspontaneous if you have not planned something at least  days in advance and written it on a calendar you dont get to do it. No popping out for an ice cream or latte unless its planned and you take twice as long to do it.  You longer allowed to go out with friends after work etc. Unless you are at work you need to be home. Unless you have carefully planned an outing in advance. Dont forget to take your backpack. Get a bunch of cardboard boxes and write on them crib highchair changing table stroller and a bunch more random smaller items that would simulate toys put them all around the apartment so that you literally have to trip over kid shit everywhere. If either of you are neat freaks.... you may realize that all the shit kids have to have will seriously drive you insane. Somewhere in the first month or so babysit an infant each of you SOLO for at least a day preferably a few days. You each have to do everything for the kid by yourself you are not allowed help short of you know logical emergency and health stuff of course. If youre still doing the experiment  months in babysit a toddler for several days. If youre still hanging in there by  months have the most unruly teen in your family come live with you for a week.  If you survive a year of this you can still pay your bills you and your partner havent killed each other and youre still doing everything on the list... and youre having a ton of fun with the experiment maybe you would be happy as a parent.,childfree,ctpc47k,20,t5_2qtwb

4740713,0,t3_3ft7o9,I work with someone like this as it stands most people in my office get paid a fixed salary So they get paid the same whether they do an extra couple of hours or if they have to go to the dentist or nip out for an hour. Despite this we are still expected to clock in and out as a matter of course just to log our hours. Some people complain on occasion because theyre having to do extra hours without pay but this is usually rectified in christmas bonuses etc. Anyway about a year and a half ago mr entitled started working for us. Initially he was placed on an hourly rate to see how he worked out. Initially all was well he worked the full  hour week without a problem but then after a few weeks one day he had to go home because of a family emergency he went home around  hours early. Needless to say he wasnt paid for this time. The following week he went home early again this time by around  hours. The following week he went home early on the wednesday then never even turned up on the friday. He always had the same excuses either his wife couldnt collect the kids from schools or his daughter was upset and needed him or his kid had a dentist appointmentBy the end of the second month he was only getting to work about  of the time. His work wasnt getting done and he was still on hourly rate so his wages where massively suffering. The one day he asks to speak to his manager and made a huge complaint about everyone else being paid salary and him getting an hourly rate. The manager laughed in his face and decided to give him a long earned disciplinary for his cheek efforts. Worth mentioning this guy wasnt an only parent his wife didnt work and his kids and wife have no notable health complaints. Not only was his actions an insult to me and the other child free people I work with but it was an insult to the none entitled parents who dont feel the world owes them something. TLDR Guy I work with thinks he should be allowed to come and go as he chooses because he has kids he also thinks he should be paid the same as people who do a full weeks work. ,childfree,cts40rs,4,t5_2qtwb

Good manners is to ask permission first.In this case the school will probably try to reach OP if something happens to the kids and cant reach the parents.

So they set up a Go Fund Me thing for it several months ago and post the damn link for it on facebook every. damn. day. A while ago they also started posting snide comments as they post it like We thought we had more friends than this and Thanks to our REAL friends who have donated so far stuff like that. I think its only raised about  in about five months and more than half of that is their own savings that they added. I think they were expecting the whole lot to be donated within a few weeks. Im not giving them a damn penny. Tbh I dont understand why its so important that my friend needs a kid of his own. He got together with his fianc when her kid was only a couple months old shes now five I think. He raised her. She calls him daddy. As far as she knows he IS her real daddy. But apparently shes not enough. In fact they both go on about how theyll never be happy unless they have another child that theyll have absolutely nothing in life to look forward to etc... and I just think how does this make the kid theyve already got feel? Shes not good enough for them. She gives them nothing to look forward to.

I HIGHLY suggest you get  New roommate. No way in hell Id let someone live for free off me just because they had sex and made a mistake or talk down to me or make me feel uncomfortable about responsible life choices. Its a pair of shoes not a yacht.I have one friend who is CF we talk about our CF lives a lot and support each other. I have one friend who has been in my life for  years. We hang out and talk regularly although she has a darling daughter who sometimes accompanies us its not an issue because my friend knows what is acceptable and not acceptable. I love my friends daughter but most of the time we prefer to hang out alone and she doesnt come up in conversation unless its something important.  Most of my other friends have kids. Once they push something out of their vagina they stop being able to be an actual friend it seems. Everything becomes an excuse they exude bitterness and entitlement from every pore. Ive started writing these women off as soon as they have kids. I dont do it to be hurtful but I feel as though there is no other option. My one girlfriend as an exception I dont include women with children in my social life. I used to try but I quickly found that theres no point.

Just as driving kids around in a minivan to go to the mall doesnt make you a chauffeur they usually require specialized training and endorsements on their license nor does fixing a booboo make you a nurse my sister works as one in a hospital and I bet she just wishes her job were momlevel easy for the same pay.They may do things that hint at those professions but in almost every case theyre doing them as such a base amateur level that if being a mommy were a real job wed probably just hire illegals to do it and probably get a better outcome.,childfree,cu9gj68,3,t5_2qtwb

The deadline for leaving is October th. We are going to sit here and come up with a plan for making that happen. If that takes both of us working three jobs and eating pbj sandwiches for months thats what is going to happen. I will under no circumstances have anything to do with the kid.  I will not sign any agreements or participate in any way in the process of obtaining or retaining custody. If asked by CPS I will flat out tell them that I will have nothing to do with the child.  You will not sign any papers or agree to anything regarding this child either. None of our time or money go towards supporting the child. I do not consent to that. We have our own needs and need to be planning for our own future home retirement health and wellbeing. Spending money on someone elses child is not happening. I will under no circumstances lie or speak any untruths to CPS or any other authorities I will instead practice full disclosure.

NOTE Hold back the drug issue and use that directly with CPS that way you dont give them a heads up and give her the opportunity to clear out the drugs. This part is to protect the child.

Its how much carbon dioxide will be produced in the future as a result of having a child who will most likely end up having his or her own children who will then have theirs etc. based on predictions for average resource use per person.If on the other hand what youre looking for is just the amount of carbon dioxide pollution  produced over that  year period compared to how much would be produced if the couple in question did not have children thats a bit harder to answer.  Only looking at that  year period your carbon dioxide output does not really increase all that substantially when youre raising a child that factor of  comes into the picture as the accumulation of slightly increased carbon output is iterated indefinitely into the future.So looking at only that period a reasonable estimate is to say that a couple having a child will increase their carbon output by a factor of around . over the  year period.  Because your child lives with you he shares your lifestyle by default and will consume resources accordingly so that it becomes  people living that couples lifestyle instead of just .  This would in theory apply to any couple regardless of how much they produce.Now the average person in America according to the World Bank produces  metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.  So  for the couple and then times  you get  tons of carbon dioxide per  year period.  Add one baby and you make that  tons per year for a total of  tons over the year period or  tons more per child.

But in this world not all people have the options of terminating a pregnancy or give a child out for adoption. There are countries where women have no access whatsoever to both birth control and abortions. Countries where girls are married off to men   even  years older than them. The second they start getting their period they start producing children. Countries where birth control and abortions are legal but women have to go to great lengths to obtain them. Or they wont because of sociocultural norms and internalized guilt. It even happens in first world countries where rightwinged politicians do everything they can to restrict womens ability to control their own body. Its all about giving birth to a baby not so they can care for the new human life but so they can enslave women because they deserved it for having sex or because its their duty to their husband and country.And charities dont always have a choice in the matter. They come in these countries to help out women but its not like they can influence a nations mentality or politics so these women can have access to better reproductive health care. And above all none of these children asked for this. They need the support their mother didnt have andor the support their parents cannot provide. Its not fair to these children to be helpless because they are children and to be left alone because its their parents duty to care for them. ,childfree,cus52a9,4,t5_2qtwb

5067282,1,t1_cuwqkw8,Im sorry I had to respond to some of your comments. First off I agree that labeling everything would be ridiculous. Its a waste of time and effort and Im sure someone has a legitimate lots of words phobia who would suddenly not be able to do anything at all.Part of trauma is overcoming triggers and developing coping skills...But suddenly having the trigger thrust upon you from an unexpected place such as a gunshot wound to the head posted on rpokemon with the title How I would react to losing a battle to a team of all legendaries exaggeration here without any indication or thumbnail will still be more striking than seeing it on an appropriate sub....or if you cant do that learning to self censorGoing along with your later read the comments why would someone even be on their guard about a phobia of theirs in what they consider to be a safer place? Like my previous example if you cant do gore why would you expect the pokemon sub to have a gunshot wound? Thats ridiculous and has nothing to do with the sub. Why would you read the comments in pokemon to make sure that a pokemon related image isnt gore? You should certainly avoid things that you know have a probable chance to be messed up like the infamous  sub if you have certain phobias but avoiding something like child free which is about man I dont want kids. Who agrees? to avoid seeing vomit thats kind of dumb. Maybe you are legitimately triggered by vomit and if you are im sorry but if anything this proves my point that when people mention a trigger that they are automatically assumed to be someone who wants control and special treatment rather than someone who wants safety. Yes this mentality needs to stop but instead of assuming that someone wants control or assuming people want safety why cant we in this situation specifically take  seconds to say sorry I posted something unrelated to pokemon that I thought would be funny I thought my gunshot wound picture would correlate to the feelings many had about losing a one sided battle or more like this for the op sorry I posted something unrelated to child free that I thought would be funny I thought my gif of a dog vomiting would correlate to the feelings many had about children but you arent op so thats not on you.Oh and Im sure someone will say but gunshot triggers and vomit triggers are totally different! Not to the person who is legitimately triggered by these things. You dont get to cherry pick mental illness anonymous person who thinks that.So back to my reply since you are someone with ptsd you should know that you cant always be prepared for it. Sometimes you just get blind sided and have to deal with it in a non optimal way and sometimes youll ask the people responsible to be a little sensitive to the topic. Child free and dogs vomiting isnt quite parallel to me. Neither is pokemon and gunshot wounds. I feel like I should have a conclusion but yeah. Being taken by surprise is never good.,childfree,cuwsrsc,0,t5_2qtwb

They psychologically torment themselves forever over it. They drive themselves into depressions over it. Maybe since they hate themselves enough for it and will never forgive themselves we could show some forgiveness and not pile on with the pitchforks and torches. Instead we can focus on the cause the real one not cellphones as a scapegoat...like how the brain lets it happen and find a solution.Note my view is not meant to be read as they can go about their business but rather they still need to  pay their debts with the courts...but as a society we can admit that mistakes happen.,childfree,cvib21g,1,t5_2qtwb

So whenever shes been shopping I get a phone call Heeeyyyy me and kid are just round the corner can we come round for a coffee?And this is always on my days off which I like to dedicate to doing absolutely nothing. I find it really hard to say no outright so I usually try to find an excuse. She always has a solution to the excuse though.gtMe Actually Im heading out soongtHer OH well well come with you!gtMe Im kinda in the middle of cleaning the floors are all wet and theres stuff everywhere...gtHer Thats ok Kids name LOVES cleaning! Well come over and he can help you!gtMe Well actually yknow I just wanted to spend some quiet time at home...gtHer Well thats no fun! Dont worry kids name wont bother you well come over and we can have some quiet time together!I do LIKE seeing my sister and nephew hes a sweet kid and I honestly wouldnt mind her popping round for a coffee and a chat if it actually was that. Yknow pop round for a rest after lugging all your shopping around have a coffee and a chat for an hour or so and then go home. But no she wont leave. She decides shell text her boyfriend to come pick her up after hes finished work so she doesnt have to walk home. Considering she usually calls me at around am on these days and he doesnt finish work until  theyre round ALL DAY. I end up having to make the kid lunch because she never brings anything for him to eat because We were only going to be in town for a little while but then I thought wed come see you! and also end up with his kiddy shows on TV for hours because I dont have any toys for him and she never brings any because of the reason above so the poor kids bored out of his mind.And then when her boyfriend finally DOES come round to get her she says to him Should we have another coffee before we go? Luckily her boyfriend usually says Nah we best get back kid needs his dinnerI need a showerneed to get to the gym etc etc. I think its partly because he does actually need to do these things and also partly because I think he gets that I want to be left alone and hes more polite than my sister xD,childfree,cvlnstd,3,t5_2qtwb

Im really good at working independently though the flip side of that is I suck at working in groups. I also was allowed to do things other kids couldnt like fly out to be with my sister while she had kids I was able to take days off to go play paintballhelp run events.I also have some really major weak points like music and social skills and math. During my elementarymiddle school years I did great and then I skipped the th grade I did advanced math so I didnt actually miss anything but homeschooled myself for th and th grade with very little support from my mother and when I tried to take Trig in my junior year struggled through and ended up passing the class with like a . In all other classes I was straight As. There also wasnt much of a schedule I sometimes did my schoolwork in my pajamas adjusting to the real world of having a strict schedule was a bit of a shocker.My parents also werent able to afford me some of the opportunities public school were like my welding and small engine classes my principles of engineering class and digital photography and they had to be jack of all trades in regards to classes not a master of one like a public school teacher can be. I wouldnt choose to homeschool if I had kids and given the choice I would have chosen to do my entire education in public school but provided a parent can do a good job I would say that it is a viable option but it cant just because you want to you need to evaluate if it is a good decision for your child and for you.

I dont know what state you are in you also mentioned tribe so I am assuming you are Aboriginal. Save those text messages and get in contact with your state or tribes human rights council and labor board and let them know what is going on to cover your own butt. If you havent requested yet or informed your HR let them know you have a disability and by law they have to accommodate your needs to a reasonable extent and that you have never abused this privilege and do not deserve to be chewed out when you get back because you have a disability and be made to feel worse about it.When you go back to work and you supervisor wants to talk to you make sure you mention this reasonable accommodation that is your right just as it is much as mombies right to stay home with her child for no reason and that she was never harassed about it or told to provide any documentation short of Im a mom! and that she has no right to harass you for having withdrawals from medications.Next time mombie asks to go home because of son ask her if her sonshe can just suck it up and stay because its not fair to everyone else that she gets special privileges for being a parent which is discrimination at its finest may I add which can add to you Human Rights complaint about your work.Edit to add Dizziness and brain zaps are serious withdrawal symptoms. Some doctors even think that the brain zaps are mini seizures hence the dizziness. Brain zaps are NOT something someone can just be sucked up SMH.

5443662,0,t1_cw7dhmv,Its not just the Nazis today most kinds of genetic research when it comes to humans is highly controversial unless its about finding some gene that contributes to obesity or alcoholism or something. I know a lot of people who heavily frown upon the old practices of measuring skulls and cataloging differences in race or ethnicity. And yes by our modern standards their methodology was highly questionable but they didnt have our modern standards back then. They also had very much the wrong idea about a lot of things but at least they still gathered data which has been pretty useful to us today. And the idea that microbes spread diseases isnt that old either.Anyways as things go on population control may or may not have to become a reality. As standard of living and level of education increases the birthrate drops that is a worldwide trend and may actually lead to population decline. Now we are like  or  billion people so it may not seem that horrible. The thing is that population decline can go really quick. We could actually halve the worlds population in just two or three generations.Such a quick and drastic change would pretty much destroy most economic systems and governing systems because people wouldnt be prepared. If we did prepare however we could easily all live incredibly well being just  billion people on the earth. We wouldnt take nearly as much toll on the environment and there would be plenty of room for all of us.Eugenics isnt necessarily bad but when handled wrong and done with the wrong knowledge to back it up it can be just as bad as it can be good.,childfree,cw7hapq,3,t5_2qtwb

My mother also expressed regret at starting so young  she had her first kid at . She never said she regretted having us but then she would never say that even if it were true. So if my parents influenced my decision in any way it was in the sense that you shouldnt breed kids that you dont both want  because its only going to end badly.,childfree,cwbyyi0,3,t5_2qtwb

5503388,0,t3_3qcggx,No offense to your friend but thats such a third wave feminist argument to make. Basically that women should have more rights than men. I totally agree with the argument you made so I wont repeat it. My opinion is that a man and a woman should be on the same page about their desire for children before they get married. Even if they arent exactly on the same page like maybe the woman for sure wants kids and the man doesnt now but believes he could change his mind... If I was a woman that knew I wanted kids i think that my partner being sure about not wanting kids would be a deal breaker. This actually happened to me but in the opposite direction Im a woman that is sure I dont want children my ex did and in the end it was one of the main reasons we didnt stay together. He told me I think I could change my mind and be okay without having kids but in the end he kept asking me if I was sure of MY decision. My current boyfriend is sure he doesnt want kids. I asked him if I was the same exact person except I wanted kids in the future for sure would that be a deal breaker? I asked since I was the scenario I was in before. He said yes it would be a deal breaker and that was a huge relief to me because it meant we were really on the same page that we werent just making compromises for each other that would bite us in the ass later. This sort of thing isnt really something you get to choose as a singular person in a relationship. If a man and a woman are married and the woman was under the impression that her husband wanted kids and he told her that as well and then got a vasectomy without telling her that would be messed up. But thats no an issue of gender equality or womens rights or a womans right to be a mother whatever the hell that means. Thats just a poor relationship. What your friend is describing IS basically rape of the man. Really weak and hypocritical argument. Motherhood is not just the womans decision you know. Thats a stupid thing to say. Edit there was actually a lawsuit about this in Japan. A woman married a man and she later said she didnt want kids and he sued her on the grounds that he agreed to marriage because of their decision to have a child. I dont remember the outcome pretty sure he lost though. ,childfree,cwf3xyn,1,t5_2qtwb
5503886,0,t1_cwf5zoi,I agree the mature women were respectful about it so I will give my props to them.

5504586,0,t3_3qh98d,you have NO reason to feel bad about this honestly. I would say that a real man knows what he wants and sticks to his priorities. The reason that the mature women are more understanding is because they well DO understand that a child is a HUGE responsibility especially to have it dropped on your lap. They are understanding of the fact that getting into a relationship with someone with a child also means being in a relationship with the child and since they understand the magnitude of that they are okay if someone is not wanting to get into it. The women who call you less of a man those girls NEED a man. They cant take care of their kids themselves and are the opposite of the women I just described. They dont have a relative idea about what raising a child is especially being involved with a child that isnt your own. Obviously they werent ready to be mothers. Im also  currently in the longest relationship Ive been in. Almost all of my past serious relationships ended because of the kids in the future issue. All Im trying to say is that there are women who will ultimately be on the same page as you and you have no reason to compromise your ideologies or desires because of the things a few women with children have said to you. Thats not a reflection of you its definitely a reflection of them. Remember that there are dudes out there that want to date or are totally willing to date women with kids let them find each other and do your thing!,childfree,cwf9gf5,3,t5_2qtwb

5581803,0,t3_3rkma0,I once visited my grandmother before she passed away years ago. She could see my path of becoming a woman with a career instead of deciding to have kids and be a stayathome mom. As I was telling her about what I was doing with my life she started crying tears of happiness.You have no idea how happy I am for you she said while fighting through tears. I think it is amazing that women can do what youre doing today.That broke my heart. My grandma grew up in the Great Depression and lived a horrifically impoverished life on the family farm in Oregon. The stories she used to tell me as a little girl still stick with me. When she grew up there were absolutely zero opportunities for her the only thing she could do was be a housewife and raise my mom while still being in poverty and just barely having enough to get by every month.Things werent much better for my mom when she grew up and raised me. She was also a stayathome mom and my dad had only a decent job to keep our family together. Thankfully we didnt live in poverty but money was very very tight and I knew that meant we wouldnt get much for things like Christmas and birthdays.Now that Ive grown up and have gone to college years ago I was able to find a job that pays much more than what my dad ever made even when adjusting for inflation. I married a wonderful man that also works in a wellpaying field and together we live a cozy uppermiddle class life. I could not be any happier with the decision I made to be a career woman instead of a childbearing woman. It warms my heart so much to see how far my family has come in three generations. I am so thankful that I live in a time where women have the freedom to pursue a career if they want to.I am so sad to hear your mom feel that way about your decision in wanting a career.

This hypothetically fertilized egg was given more medical authority over my body than I was.He also lied and told me there werent any other doctors at that clinic that performed them except the woman who butchered my mothers IUD insertion as well as lectured me about how having sex comes with responsibilities and having to remember a pill every day was one of them.I still havent gotten an IUD and am so pissed that I have to drive an hour away to get one because the doctors in my network here are quacks and the one doctor I loved who fully supported me getting one was out of my network.My point is it should not be this hard for anyone to get a freaking IUD especially if they have insurance.,childfree,cwvs4uk,3,t5_2qtwb

I say enjoy the relationship while it lasts but remember you both want fundamentally different things out of life. This isnt like she wants a Toyota and you want a Honda she wants to be a parent and you do not. You really need to level with her about it. There is always with anything in life the chance that youll change your mind. But why risk it not changing? Youre just putting yourself at a huge risk emotionally and physically and financially if there is some sort of accident. I recently had to have that talk with my boyfriend who has always been sort of apathetic to the idea of having kids whereas I will not ever be a mother. Not. Ever. He has agreed that for us a life with no kids is the best option and that he has no strong feelings about being a father he just truly does not care. If you already know her position is in favor of having kids ultimately the relationship will end or you will eventually be trapped in a life that you did not want. There are other girls out there that would be just as good for you and support you not wanting to have kids. This isnt a small conflict of interest this is an entire life changing path.

The string that hangs down through your cervical opening apparently is a place bacteria can cling to and can cause more frequent infections. Otherwise my male partner constantly complained about the fishing line he felt poke his member whenever we had sex. I went back to my OBGYN to have it trimmed but she cut it as short as she could. It was so short at that point that I had trouble reaching far enough each month to feel if the gard was still properly in place which is the whole point of the string.That was my experience anyway I know it is not for everyone... but I hope it is not yours! ,childfree,cwzbnl5,1,t5_2qtwb

Are you OK with spending those years with someone youre not compatible with in one of the most important choices of your life. What if her birth control fails and she doesnt want to abort.

Its pretty safe to assume that they know that abortion is an option. By encouraging them to consider other options they will likely consider all other options anyway.You simply must ask yourself what your goal is here Are you trying to legitimately help someone?

My wife hands it back to me  I work from home and was in my office and tells me she will deal with it. Later at work my wife confronts the mom and she has nothing to say but I have a child so I cant afford to pay for it. Fuck off... She never paid for the damages. She never even said sorry.

5764486,0,t1_cxbb6aq,Depends on what you mean by baby talk. That higherpitched singsongy voice with overenunciation and slow pacing? Is good for babies apparently. Its called parentese by speech developmentlinguistics professionals and it signals to the baby that what is being said is directed at him in part because it mimics or falls in line with sounds and actions that inherently draw a babys attention more easily this helps him tune in to it and engage in something interactive which is apparently how language is learned via interaction not really via hearing things  this is why babies do not learn from that Baby Einstein stuff  they learn mostly via interaction having people respond to the things they do or the noises they make etc so when they can easily know that they are being spoken to or reacted to they develop those skills better. The baby talk that involves fake words intentional mispronunciation wittle instead of little etc is stupid and I dont know why people do it.I actually am a parent of a baby and I had to consciously make myself speak in parentese because I knew that it was a good thing for my baby. It allegedly comes naturally when speaking to babies but not for me. It was tempting to act superior about not having the natural urge to talk like an idiot but I knew that research shows that parentese would help my baby engage in what I was saying and how I was saying it etc so I worked to remember to do it. I would say that theres really no reason to use parentese to talk to a year old though. Tldr is that baby talk is stupid and makes language even more unintelligible to babies parentese sounds stupid but makes language more intelligible to babies. ,childfree,cxbmyui,8,t5_2qtwb

5818107,0,t1_cxht2le,gt Suburbia is a place you could not pay me to live honestly. It shackles people to cars and long commutes. For me the best thing you can have in life is time. Time to have hobbies time to hang out with friends amp family time to go outdoors. If you spend your life in a suburb you are choosing a life far from things such as work and errands. If you choose life instead in a dense small town or big city everything is compact.Exactly!  I love living in citiesand live in a very expensive one presently.

5819684,0,t1_cxih1m8,gt I dont think women should have their kids suffer just because birth control failed and he did not want kids.Neither do it.  I think that if the woman cant do it on her own the pregnancy should result in abortion or adoption and it would be selfish of the women to keep it if she cant afford it.  If she the guy did not want a kid.... why should she expect money from him because the BC failed?  That is not his fault. As to your first paragraph.... well I think most of us can agree that more and better options are a good thing and some people dont think parenthood should be a choice for women even.  I would be less on a high horse if so many people were not so ok with women doing.  I am disgusted by the ohh well its a baaaaaaaaaby so it is all good  attitude. No it is not all good no these women should not be just forgiven and it should not be accepted.  It should be more of a just because you can do something does not mean you should.  I dont think it becomes ok just because the kid is loved and cute. I think the women frankly is still a threat to society and should be treated as such.

Anyway the whole point is that I see the world and people positively. This is really obvious because otherwise I wouldnt be noting this about the sub and  I wouldnt be getting tired of peoples attitudes.

You need to worry about your finances first and foremost sounds selfish but you and your husband do.  Shit happens jobs get lost etc. etc. and one needs to be ready for it. Also if your husband is so into taking on the child if the parents die which would involve you leaving and he is all lovey dovey towards it as an outsider I wonder if this will push him from nonCF to fencesitter or wanting his own.

Then again they probably saw me as an annoying little shit because apparently I never shut up. Dolls ugh. My mum gave me a doll that she was given as a child when I mustve been about  or  years old. It came with a beautiful silver cross pram but I never went near it. The doll just creeped me out and I think I managed to get the message across pretty early on that I didnt like them to my parents but other family members would still send me Barbie dolls for Christmas and birthdays. Yuck. I was much more interested in boys toys and my favourite present ever was a giant remote controlled tank that my dad bought me despite my mums protestations. I was bingoed earlier in my life with the typical oh youll change your mind or youre still young you dont know what you want and the usual assortment.

6001317,0,t1_cy6a0na,You can get a vasectomy or the reversible procedure that lets be sterile for five years. It seems you feel having sex is a right? Not once have you acknowledge that when you agree to have sex with the woman you agree that it is her body and her choice what to do in case of a baby. You are having the act of procreation. What do you mean you arent deciding to procreate? Unless youre saying well I just wanna do the act of procreating but not procreate. Then dont cum in her vagina? By doing that you are giving up the choice because it isnt your body. Your argument is saying I want to do the act of making kids but if I end up making a kid I want to have the choice of no responsibility of it. Which doesnt fly when you become an adult.If we both consent to a fistfight and one of us gets seriously injured. You will be responsible for medical damages. This is life. Now like I said had you written a contract out before the sex or fight then you can maybe be okay. No ones stopping you from doing that before sex. You want to fail at a making a kid and want all the problems to go away if you mess up. Sex is not a right. Dont have sex if youre not sterile unless youre okay with the consequences.

My wife and I have a similar situation with one of my distant relatives. Shes super awesome and has a couple of great kids that love us and we like them a lot too Omfg they can be such annoying little shits sometimes. Because of our relationship with her shes put it to us with our prior consent to ensure the kids get what they deserve from her financially in the unfortunate event something happens to her. But.... I dont think I could or would raise them. I dont think I could do it. I dont think I could go that far... Even if I knew that their situation would be shitty otherwise. Financially my wife and I are just really starting out. A lot of school debt and she wont earn very much for at least another year.

The first  days I barely moved off the couch except to replace my ice packs but even that wasnt too bad.Edit to add Any surgery can go wrong but I asked around and found a doctor that does them all the time.

6350555,0,t1_czbevxs,It would depend on how close the relationship is.  Not telling someone is different that lying in this case.  He was clear that he doesnt want kids which is his only obligation.  And we dont know how close they are.  Partner could be sex partner in a casual relationship or a de facto marriage. Reproductive choices are very personal and if someone wants to keep that private thats their choice male or female.  I would let someone who wants kids know that I dont want kids.  Though Im  and menopause is around the corner so I dont think most men would be dating me with the expectation that Im going to have a kid.People have all sorts of reasons for keeping their reproductive choices private.  A woman on hormonal birth control may not tell a new sex partner shes on it because its easier to persuade him to use condoms if he doesnt know.  Eventually the relationship may get to the point where they can trust each other to be exclusive.  Was she deceiving him not to tell him?  She had every right not to tell him.  Does it mean she didnt trust him or she thought he was going to give her a STI?  I wouldnt say that just that shes protecting her health.  Just as men may want to protect their health and avoid reproductive coercion.  If I put a seat belt on as a passenger it doesnt mean I dont trust the driver.  If I have a fire extinguisher around my kitchen it doesnt mean Im planning to set it on fire.  These are sensible measures to protect myself.  I see a childfree man getting a vasectomy as similar.  And they dont have to tell anyone they dont want to.  Though if they are with someone who wants kids they should be up front that they dont want them.  I remember reading about a posters friend who got oopsed and the guy was in an abusive relationship.  He eventually ended up killing himself.  Unwanted parenthood can be devastating for men too and they have even less choice than we do. I applaud the OP for taking charge of the situation and getting a vasectomy rather than complaining about how worried he was about getting oopsed.  He also managed to get out of a previous relationship which was abusive which is also difficult to do.  ,childfree,czbhka4,3,t5_2qtwb

6363361,0,t1_czcw6ty,I agree to a point but even deciding to not care about the consequences of rutting and thereby creating progeny is a decision even if it is deciding to take a chance as opposed to not rutting and not having children.  Even if making that choice comes naturally progeny are created by choosing to have sexual relations with someone of the opposite sex.  Not having unprotected sex is doing nothing.  I have chosen to have sex and not have children which I see as making  decisions to do more than nothing but not doing either is the zero state.  Does this make any sense to anyone but me or am I swimming in my head again?Completely agree on the least special part since the majority of people can do it without putting out much effort and half of them only need to allow someone else to put out most of that.  I personally feel that anyone who has sex without using birth control should see that they have lost the ability to complain about any resulting offspring or childrearing efforts and be taken seriously but I think we are relatively rare in that realm of thought.,childfree,czcxzgu,1,t5_2qtwb

6369254,0,t1_czdcn2y,gt I do feel the need to play devils advocate a bit though. Most  year old Cf folks do in fact change their mind before theyre . What she said would be a reasonable thing to say to the vast majority of her yo patients who say they dont want kids.Why does that matter for this though?  Its just a piece of writing on a form.  The only things that could come of it are.  The form never needs to be changed because OP stays childfree..  The form is utterly irrelevant and is never looked at again..  If OP did change her mind for some reason the form might need to be filled out again..  If the form got entered electronically someone might have to change an entry on the electronic version.The possibility of an item on a form needing to be changed is NOT liability issue for the doctor here even if OP did change her mind.  The doctor is not going to get sued because something on a form needs to be changed in the year  or whenever.  After all things like weight smoker status and medical history change.  No doctor ever got sued for failing to predict that a patient would gain  pounds or break a bunch of bones after unexpectedly taking up motocross racing as a hobby.  There is literally no reason not to enter OPs real answer on the form other than being a colossal jerk.,childfree,czdm4vt,2,t5_2qtwb

Of course there was talk about her being too young to go on dates she told him she wasnt interested in the boy blah blah blah. It was not an angry conversation which was nice. But then the dad turned to me and asked do you have boys or girls? I think there were going to be followup comments about how teenage boys are easier to deal with or something.

In six years in foster care prior to living with us she had lived in  homes and had a failed adoption. So basically had never lived in a stable home her entire life. She was very difficult VERY DIFFICULT.But we thought that it was worth putting our CF life on hold for a few years to help another human being.We still see ourselves as CF and have a CF mentality but also care about our child and her well being. She is  now has a . GPA has a job and has a bright future in front of her. We provided that and we feel good about it.Because we were CF and invested on ourselves for eleven years we were able to make this decision knowing full well what our job would be.But again we are CF at heart and when she moves on we will resume our sort of CF life. Whats cool is that she knows that and she sees herself either doing the same as we did or being financially stable before having her own.

But I sometimes roll in late because of the shuttle from my car dealership not quite being on schedule when I have it in the shop for the day if I have appointments with doctors or medical tests scheduled if I need to leave to drive a parent to and from an appointment as they get older...

Cis is a term that a minority group is trying to force into language despite it having heavy use as a negativelycharged word.

The stress that you must be feeling from this hit to your finances is so gut wrenching.Back in my early s I was a former athlete who had become lamed because of a poor coach.  Wheelchair bound kind of injury.  Through a grueling regiment and a crap ton of pain I literally pulled myself back up onto my feet and went to college.  It was truly difficult.  Here I was in leg braces taking on a full course load and working up to  part time jobs.  There were no options of outside support for me other than hard work which involved applying for academic scholarships and taking on extra shifts.  I know I asked this in another comment but I was wondering if you can possibly take on a parttime job from the college to continue your benefits.  Im not entirely rehearsed on the change to the benefits so forgive me for any misunderstandings.  Simply just want to help since Ive been in a similar bind before.

Im assuming he didnt go away to college like I did or hedve been forced to learn life skills at college. Hes stuck in his comfort zone but its making you miserable and you dont deserve that. Where else does your mother expect him to learn life skills if she never teaches them to him? Id honestly be surprised if he has any real friends because hes so dependent on your mother. Hes a grown man. Why isnt she treating him like one?Im kinda blaming your mother here for his abysmal situation because despite the combination of Aspergers and ADHD making life skills feel difficult hes gotta learn them sometime and he honestly shouldve learned them long before now.I have the same diagnoses he does and Im better off because my parents dont put up with me acting like a teenager who refuses to do her own laundry or bathe herself regularly because Im more mature than that now. I may live with them still sarcasm alert  thanks unemployment but Im not allowed to act like a needy teenager anymore.Does your brother see a therapist?

I still meet many people who do not understand how the Daily Mail is not just another tabloid not just as bad as the rest of them but instead something far more despicable and dangerous. Its one of the most popular papers in Britain and when we say Just ignore it  theyre just trying to get hits I shudder. We do not ignore evil  we challenge it and get angry about it. huge number of Americans dont seem to realize that The Daily Mail is just as bad. Theyre so much better at hiding it  go to their front page and theyll have four real stories and then one they just pulled out of their asses. And I mean literally theyll just make up a fictional story usually about the danger of immigrantsforeignersMuslims or salacious sexrelated crimes or the horrors of feminism.For instance they ran an outrageous crazy exgirlfriend story with the headline Dentist Anna Mackowiak Pulls Out Her ExBoyfriends Teeth they made sure this happened in Poland to get the crazy foreigner aspect in there. The story went viral and was picked up by Fox News The Los Angeles Times The San Francisco Chronicle and The New York Daily News as well as every fucking news aggregator website on Earth. When somebody finally looked into it and it turned out that none of the people involved actually existed The Daily Mail said they werent quite sure where it came from.

6630510,0,t3_46auhd,I think it might not be so much about changing ones mind per se as that some people under some circumstances are less able to tune out the CONSTANT barrage of external demands that they reproduce or in some cases that they not. And we all receive social pressure to varying degrees from friends family society significant others religion etc. Personally its been a major project of mine for the last five years or so to work out which of my desires and life goals actually come from me and which were imposed on me by a religious upbringing or social conditioning. Obviously we all grow and change over time thats a given. However I have observed that people who do take the time to deconstruct the reasons behind their preferences in any area of life tend to know what they want get what they want and hold on to their convictions over time. Thats why its become really important for me to revisit this on a regular basis.

What a lot of people dont realise is that pedigree cats dont just look a certain way they also have very distinctive personalities with big variations between breeds.

Theyre really not thinking when they say it so try not to get too rattled and hear what theyre hopefully really saying youre patient kind funny etc. I dont think theres anything wrong with gently explaining to someone like that that good parent is not a compliment to you just as you shouldve not had kids isnt a compliment to them even if you mean that they are a good writer or musician and should have focused on that instead so if they could think of a way to express what theyre really thinking youd appreciate that.If its an asshole that says it to you on the other hand then there is likely no goodhearted sentiment behind the expression just more miserymongering bullshit so you should feel free to let em have it with both barrels.,childfree,d0eku7l,7,t5_2qtwb

The Texas Monthly article is worth reading especially for the section on her being placed on a PIP by Planned Parenthood with the good possibility of being terminated for poor job performance and her being motivated by spite and anger towards her former employer rather than a crisis of morals. Shes become a very successful speaker on the probirth and antichoice circuit.  She spoke on the campus that I work on this past week and I thought about going out of intellectual curiosity but decided against it because the sponsoring group was the Catholic student association.  I didnt think theyd be too open to attendees like myself that were prochoice and would ask questions that were skeptical of her claims both about her personal story and the pseudoscience that they use.  I for one am skeptical about her claims to have had two abortions while married when as an employee of Planned Parenthood she knew that providing access to birth control was reason for its founding.  ,childfree,d0jg86o,5,t5_2qtwb

Theyre scared and wanting validation and support from someone in a position of supposed credibility. People are much more willing to listen without question to someone who presents themselves as some kind of trusted authority figure especially if they dont really know the facts themselves. Im sure to a woman who knows nothing it wouldnt seem like a stretch to hear that abortions can be dangerous or cause other issues. Although I do wonder how anyone believes it if someone says condoms arent effective....lol. But anyway I wish that the school system would make more of an effort to educate our youth on sexual and reproductive health.

6824331,0,t1_d0pti3e,Just hope that no one finds out because Im pretty sure that there are laws saying you cant discriminate against people with babies specifically.  The place I used to rent from was a tiny building with four units. Being close to the College it was at the time rented to young professionals college students and a couple that just left the military. It was quiet cozy and the grounds were well taken care of tree trimmingparking lot plowingmowing. Then the owner was charged with discrimination and the building was sold.  The new owners started taking Section  housing. I lived there for another year and a half and I saw each unit get replaced with either double shitty parent and spawn or just one parent and multiple spawn. Suddenly the grass is getting ripped up broken toys are EVERYWHERE and my car starts to get scratches on it. I wrote a complaint to the owners who told me to call the police who told me theres not a thing they can do because its private property and why do I care about some scratches on an old car?  None of the families stayed for more than  months. Every time a new family would show up the local Thrift Store would truck in free furniture for them and then when they left they just chucked yard bags full of clothes in the car and fucked off. Each time it would take the cleaners two weeks to repaint recarpet repair damage to doors walls moulding and fixtures and to air the place out smokers all of them. The company said they were paid several thousand dollars so I have to assume that the owners were making bank off Section  and then just eating the costs. ,childfree,d0pu4tq,11,t5_2qtwb

For example parental income has a reasonably high correlation with success but does that mean that only the wealthy are allowed to breed? There was a study a few years ago that showed better outcomes when there were books in the home so some wellmeaning but misguided legislators started sending books to every childs home. They didnt realize that it wasnt the presence of books so much as parents who are educated enough to enjoy reading.

The reason they may be so desperate for time apart anyways is because helicopter parenting allows little time for their own needs. As long as its not burdening some relative they should get away more. Side note My parents were very attentive and loving but when they needed space I was sent outside to play!.

He had a very distinct yowling meow theres no mistaking it. Once I walked outside and heard him yowling with my own voice answering. Meow... Clyde... Meow... Clyyyyde...? Meow... Clyyyyyde?...

Well as a philosophy student I have several reasons. One given the principle that existent life is more valuable than potential life it seems unjustifiable to being more children into the first world rather than adopting from the thirddeveloping world as they were here first and ought to have a chance at a better life in order to reduce globalized systematic wealth inequality rather than birthing any child even my own into privilege in an already overpopulated world. Second I have a strong hunch that there is a genetic predisposition in my family to be vulnerable to mental health issues given that my grandmother on my mom and dads side my dad two of my sisters as well as myself have all dealt with severe depression anxiety or manic depression at one time or another or continue to as in the case of my aunt who is now into her s. If I were to knowingly subject any child to a fraction of that pain I would be a monster. Third I have career goals which are specifically unfriendly to families. I want to be a general surgeon which requires very long hours on a weekly basis on top of a lengthy training process. If I were to have children I would not be able to give them the time and attention that a child deserves. My father was not very involved in my life and it was awful despite having four siblings. If I were to take the time away from my practice as a surgeon I would be deliberately not making the full use of my education in order to spend time with my kids which would be incredibly selfish. The reason I want to get it now is that I am sexually active and do not want to burden someone else with the decision of whether or not to get an abortion because I didnt want to go in for a  minute operation. Doc... when would you like to come in? P I also made sure to dress up a bit so I was wearing my dress shoes a casual blazer dress shirt.

6986541,0,t1_d1896ju,I really didnt make that comment to start a debate. I just was sharing my opinion. I think until its born it is a fetus I dont give human rights to a fetus just two the mother. So the mother can abort it if she chooses. I forgot to say the father has human rights over his body as well. If she will not abort and the child is born then the child needs to be taken care of financially. Until our society can provide that for them then both parents will have to in this situation. That it punishes the child to be born and not be taken care of. You cant force someone to abort even if theyre stupid enough to bring a child in to the world they cant provide for and know its father doesnt want it. I agree that it sucks but he knows she has the choice and he doesnt he knows if its born he will have to provide for it for now things could change and Id support changes so he should make dam sure he has protection and if he doesnt want kids that he also has a vasectomy. I think education will help a lot too because some people dont have access to proper sex education birth control and health providers thatll do an abortion. I think with proper education abortions will be needed less. That is simply my opinion on the matter. You can state your opinion too but Im not getting a debate over it today.,childfree,d189jt2,3,t5_2qtwb

I see a lot of women on here contemplating essure for sterilization because their doctors are more inclined to do that procedure over tubal ligation using cauterization. Essure was just revised by the FDA to include warning labels cautioning women on life threatening risks involved in using essure. This goes for the clip sterilization method as well. No foreign objects in your body.When talking to your doctor make sure to reiterate and stand firm on everything you have said to him so far. Dont say if I were to have kids I would adopt because that shows that you may actually want kids. They are looking for you to be consistent.Also iuds arent all they are cracked up to be in my experience. Ive tried three different kinds paraguard Mirena and skyla. All three caused issues with hormones. Mirena and skyla caused unbearable life impeding pain affecting both school and work. Ive actually tried Mirena twice to make sure it was really the iud...i honestly hoped i would not have the same symptoms. The point is they are going to recommend you try everything and fuck up your hormones and place foreign objects in your body because no doctor wants to sterilize a young woman.

7086207,0,t3_4cmceq,Ok everyones going after the MIL rightly so. She should have heard the no the first time and shut up about the idea. But Im going to point out the other big concern that the OP and her husband didnt sit down talk through the pros and cons of the idea and make a decision together as a unit. Instead it sounds like OPs husband heard the idea liked it and agreed to it he put the vacation before his marriage.  Thats got some serious red flags the husband and OP are the nuclear family and should be treated as primary.  The inlaws are the extended familythough often inlaws dont understand that their child has left their nuclear family and created a new one if the marriage is healthy the child will have done just that. This doesnt sound to me like its really about the vacation itself but about the marriage.  Something in OPs husbands mind clicked back into son of MIL when thinking about this vacation instead of thinking first as husband of OP so he made up his mind without really talking it through with the OP and prioritizing their shared preferences.  Sure he could go without the OP but something in the way the idea was discussed in the post made it really sound like the husband isnt seeing this as doing something else but as leaving her behind because shes being difficult.  If Im right and I hope Im wrong the problem here isnt the vacation but how the OPs husband is seeing himself and his relationships hes married first their son second.  Sure he could go off on a vacation with them but not at the cost of making his partner know that he doesnt value her first in his life.OP dont go on this trip.  Its too wrought with other meanings.  And if Im anywhere near to right sit your husband down and talk through how he sees his marriage to you visavis his relationship to his family of origin.  He better see the marriage as more fundamentally important than his relationship with them his relationship with them can be very very important but the marriage trumps the family of origin. ,childfree,d1jl7d8,31,t5_2qtwb
7087378,0,t1_d1jknq0,No matter what the situation is between the parents or who wronged whom every child deserves the financial support of  parents.  Some fathers do get stuck with a unfair situation but it would be even MORE unfair to the innocent child to not be supported by both parents because of whatever reason. Child support is for the child not the mom. If you dont want to pay child support either dont have sex or get a vasectomy and doublecheck that shit on a regular basis. How would you feel if you had to grow up starving and cold because your dad fled the country and didnt pay child support? Its almost like people dont realize that every time someone dodges child support the taxpayers like YOU and ME end up footing the bill for the kid instead in the form of welfare and entitlement programs. And we had zero say in the conception of this child. If OP wants to get a divorce he has every right to do soits his life he shouldnt spend it in an unhappy marriage. But he needs to pay child support like every other noncustodial parents of EITHER gender. I have some sympathy for fathers that didnt intend to have their kid not the case here this kid was planned and wanted by both parents but they KNEW the decision was out of their hands once their sperm enters a womans vagina and they KNEW that babies are a very foreseeable consequence of having sex. Yes life can be unfair but there are far greater injustices out there than people having to face the consequences of having sex. ,childfree,d1jpzzu,12,t5_2qtwb

This is very disrespectful and I wonder why you dont realize it. But I suspect it is because you are a teenager and you think the way a teenager thinks  with a distorted view of your actions and their attached consequences. Questions for you to answer are Do you have supportive parents? Are you working? How will you raise and support this child?My advice is for you to carefully consider your actions which have extremely wideranging consequences for you for your parents for your guy for his parents and for any child you decide to bring into the world. I wish you had a wider idea of what you are doing but you are young and so I will tell you two things A fetus is not an olive. It is a fetus that will presumably grow into a baby and then a child. And having a baby is not the way to cement a relationship.You need to take a pregnancy test and at this point be very brave and honest with your boyfriend about your situation. If you have a supportive friend or family member talk with this person and ask for help and support as you walk this path.

During this time Id go shopping with my mother or read a book.Eventually I was allowed to stay in the apartment while my sister played. The apartment was beautiful she had a gorgeous grand piano in her living room I would sit and watch my sister play. If I got bored I had a book though often I would be practicing in my head my scales and song that I had to soon present to my teacher.If we were ever to misbehave and from memory I cannot recall ever doing so my mother would be embarrassed and furious at us. Her children. Not the teacher.This is such a problem now children are not being held accountable for their behavior. Whats worse is the administration that should be supporting these instructors just throw them under the bus.My instructor was private she did it from her apartment so I imagine if we misbehaved she could have told us to go somewhere else. But my mom was on top of us in terms of being polite patient and QUIET. Children were to be seen not heard.So sorry OP I really miss those days and I  to this day  admire my former piano teacher.

7252110,0,t1_d21veqi,Even when I didnt like the apartment I had when I first moved out I still wanted my parents to be a part of that step in my life. When I bought a house I had my parents over before it was really put together becasue it was an exciting event in my life that I wanted them to see. Their baby is all grown up and in the same situation that they were in at my age. Our house is actually a lot nicer than their first house and they are delighted about that becasue it means they raised me well and that I am doing better than they were at my age. They succeeded as parents. I have a sister Im not close with and I dont like her husband so I never invite them over. But I wont let that stop me from enjoying time with my parents in my house. They are getting ready to move in two weeks about  hours away so Im glad that I got to have them over as much as I did. Tell your sister why you dont want her kids over last time you brought your kids they broke my property and had no respect for my belongings. Im assuming she didnt offer to pay for what her children ruined. Its your apartment you get to pick who comes over.

7265554,0,t3_4ewy48,Youre right.I grew up in a town that was energetically touted as The best place in America to raise a family!It was awful.However I live in a very small town now about  people and fairly isolated geographically. I freaking love it. Most of the residents here are retired so the population skews older. There are kids here and the community is very kidfocused but the community also has a clear expectation that kids behave and that parents teach them how to be civilized human beings not selfcentered little monsters. The nextclosest community is totally different... all the kids there are like feral goddamn dogs never sitting still showing no consideration for other people etc. I cant stand it there.I think what underlies those Such a great place to raise kids!!!! towns is thick suffocating religion. People in those towns are obsessed with religion and are usually all of the same religion. Every successful religion that has stood the test of ANY real interval of time includes a strong mandate that people have a million babies so you will naturally find aggressive probreeder worldviews in ultrareligious towns and that goes hand in hand with oppressed women who are doing all the childcare and who have given up on life because religion makes their lives hopeless. So they dont bother to actually raise their kids they just let them be monsters.Find a relatively religionfree small town though it is rare Ill admit and its pretty fucking great. I love how quiet and peaceful it is here and I love it that the kids here actually are being raised right. When I lived in big cities the children were exactly as unbearable as in religious small towns.

Generally those who have the means to control their reproduction do. Duggers aside most people dont want to shit out a cunt dumpling every other year. Ive been watching the cycle of poverty for a while. I came from a shithole small town in the bible belt where Fox News is practically as good as God They shut down the Planned Parenthood in my home town and doubled the churches. They taught abstinence only education and more or less told people that condoms were ineffective.I even got kicked out of a youth group for refusing to pledge my virginity to my future husband. Out of roughly  girls in the group Im one of two who did not become a teen mother. Im the only one who is not currently a mother at all. The other became a dentist. Unfortunately in my home town after giving birth the woman is expected to stay home and raise the snot goblins. Its much harder to find a job if youre female there. If you do find one youre paid far less because youre considered a walking incubator. The only jobs women can usually get are low wage and hardly any have benefits. Growing up all of my friends whose moms werent married worked  jobs to get by... so their kids raised themselves and SURPRISE! all got knocked up as teens. The cycle continues.TLDRThey took away planned parenthood and comprehensive sex ed made child care unaffordable and within  generations successfully got women back into the kitchen.,childfree,d25lpvr,1,t5_2qtwb

7344904,0,t3_4fx3by,Be  next month. Boy am I glad I grew up then instead of now. I am from the put kids out in the morning and whistle them in at night generation. I would not trade the freedom  of my childhood for anything today. We developed judgment of strangers from the earliest age. We learned to look before crossing the street when we were toddlers. We explored our world and went where our curiosity led us. We learned to think ahead and take what we needed with us. Many a peanut butter sandwich came out crushed from a pocket. We learned enterprise.  Returned coke bottles became a snack and we knew where the berries grew. We made friends where we found them. They could be the old woman feeding the pigeons or the local vendor.We were not greatly at risk. Stranger danger is highly over rated. It is an extremely rare thing. Statistics show that children are most at risk from their own family members and family friends. Sacrificing the freedom and wonder of childhood out of fear of strangers is way too high a cost. I think I and the ones I raised may be the last of the free range kids. That is a tremendous loss to society. Truth be told I think we grew up smarter stronger and more independent than the hot house kids being raised today. We were expected to be fully functional adults by  capable of working and raising a family of our own. I understand that expectation has been pushed up to  now. Humans should not be  years past puberty before they can function as adults. Something is very wrong and I think this over parenting is a part of it.,childfree,d2d2cg1,36,t5_2qtwb

7355002,0,t3_4g2ckt,Well if youre planning to have a kid in the future we may as well get divorced right now because there are ZERO circumstances under which I will ever have a child. Not with you. Not with anyone. EVER. If we ever had an accident i would immediately abort it. No question. So if youre wanting kids lets just rip off the bandaid and divorce. Short of that ONE or possibly BOTH of us is getting sterilized. Those are now and forever the only options on the table for discussion and my plan is to get the IUD out early and get sterilized as soon as I can or you can. So again two choices here Divorce or Sterilization. So lets have those conversations. Its long past time to settle this.Hes playing kick the can because he thinks hes got four years. Tell him that he doesnt. Tell him that you do not really want the IUD anymore.Many males tend to purposely ignore that BC for women is not riskfree is expensive painful with lots of side effects.... they just treat it like set and forget not my problem as long as I get the sex... well there are risks and if you dont want to continue to use hormonal or mechanical BC you have that right.

7373933,0,t1_d2gcx0q,well maybe my fellow Czech can correct me but I do feel its stronger than in US etc. because of the ridiculous amount of things the taxpayers pay for the children. Three years maternity leave says it all I think. This organization of the state in my opinion enforces the breeding mentality rather exceptionally. Also there is this weird discrepancy between putting children on a pedestal but being very benevolent to child abuse. Its completely normal to beat kids and emotional abuse its not acknowledged at all again I am sure I would be able to find an exception but I am talking about the general consensus among the biggest part of the population. I believe in our case it really stronger parents adoration then child adoration. People are like their kids owe them something for being born and the rest of the society owes them for having kids. The argument of you must have children so they can pay for our retirement is very common. This is changing slowly but every time there is an story in the news about a mistreated child which is a older than  b the abuse is mild physically like only bruises but not broken bones the public automatically takes the stand of the parent berate older children for being spoiled and insufferable praise the parent for using discipline and complain about the state which keeps sticking nose into family business but they dont mind the money from the state lol. There was this story about a  years old girl. Her swimming teacher noticed rather big bruises all over her body and asked her about it. The girl then admitted her mother had done it to her as a punishment for opening a fb account when being told not to. The teacher called the cops which decided it was not abuse and sent the poor girl home although she begged them not to. The most common opinion about this? The girl should be punished severely for snitching at her mother and the teacher should be punished too. Maybe now you get the idea. Also gender stereotypes. I was called manly and other things multiple times in my life just because I speak my mind and like to make fun jokes etc and laugh loudly. And bazillion other more important things but I dont want to write a novel D Feel free to ask specific things or send me a PM if you want.

Also there are some who are not comfortable with it who shouldnt be completely disregarded. That last part was just me agreeing with the OP that its okay to sexualise breasts and think of them as sexy because as the title of the post says theyre not just for feeding babies. With this I was also saying that yes it is okay to show them off. Offer a little bit to look at. I am not saying just put them all out there and be trashy about it no way. Just that its okay to show off a little in a subtle sexy way because whether the social justice mombies like it or not breasts are fucking sexy. And this is coming from a straight woman.

Insurance will not always pay for it especially when it is not medically necessary and finding a doctor willing to do an unnecessary hysterectomy would be even less likely than one willing to do a tubal. Hysterectomy is a major surgery and way more invasive than a tubal with a longer recovery time and added risks.

7637756,1,t1_d3a1r5r,I think its more that its just a different kind of hard than we as a society tend to really have experience with prior to parenting. I have an awesome career that I love which requires both skill and knowledge and which is pretty competitive. I also have a toddler. I am fortunate in that I get to control my own schedule via freelancing so when I went back to work after having a kid I took a small pay cut and dropped my hours down to three days per week onsite and approximately eight hours per week billed from home mostly doing paperwork or logistical problemsolving in the evenings. I love my job and it is incredibly intellectually challenging and stimulating also at times physically difficult  I am a union carpenter and spent years of my life loading trucks building stuff etc. It is also very hard at times. I have to manage my engineers and the physical build of my product and my client and my boss expectations and oh yeah my budget. A small mistake can easily eat up tens of thousands of dollars on any given project to say nothing of a large mistake. The client relationships are vital but the clients are often dicks. The usual.But damn the days that I am home with my kid are HARD. I love those days and I actively choose to have them in my life because my employer would gladly give me fulltime onsite hours if I wanted but those days are hard. They are hard because they are not logical and because there is no fix it now solution to the problems that come up. I mean if I have a problem with my colleague I can just be like Hey this is what I need to make me better able to do my job and my colleague will generally listen and consider what Ive said and either agree or disagree but have some sort of interaction that mostly adheres to normal rules of conversation. Whereas that would be an absolutely extraordinary thing to have happen with my under toddler who will scream and cry and take about  minutes to calm down from the trauma of wanting to go outside in winter but not wanting to put clothing on. If my client gets super SUPER pissed off he may yell at me but I can be like Dont speak to me that way or I can just say Hey you know what I understand why youre angry and Im so sorry. Here is my plan to make it up to you. Whereas my toddler will just rage and rage because I opened the front door when we got home from an outing ??? I dont know and nothing will make him stop until hes damn good and ready to stop. It is emotionally unpredictable and exhausting and that makes it incredibly incredibly hard in a way that my work days are not. It is also tedious and just inescapable. If that kid is screaming I can comfort him or ignore him or anything in between but what I cant do is get away. Getting something done with a toddler reminds of the time I was on crutches. Everything became unimaginably hard and took unimaginably long. Thats fine because thats what having a kid means but it would be pretty shitty for someone to be like Jesus how hard is it to go to the fucking grocery store? You act like you just cured cancer! when I was on crutches. It was damn hard to buy food and cook it and clean my apartment etc when I was on crutches. Sometimes just the thought of having to do any of that was enough to make me want to stay in bed. It feels kind of similar to have to do that stuff with a toddler. Is it the worst most hardest thing in the whole wide world? Of course not but it is hard and its hard in ways that dont sound hard until youve really been there.I love my kid but yeah parenting is absolutely very hard if you are doing it well and I say this having worked and still working in a very competitive skilled environment where I am also one of relatively few women in a maledominated industry. Honestly I think the the hardest part about being a parent is that I always want to be somewhere else. When I am at work I miss my kid like crazy even if Im having a blast or very involved in a project and I am so excited to go home and see him. But when Im home Im like omg I wish I could get away from my kid for just an hour please god just make him stop doing x. At least once a day I find myself wishing that it were actually possible to slap some sense into another human being. If I were actually just home all the time I would probably go insane just from wanting to be somewhere else  I am very glad that I get to work at an emotionally and intellectually fulfilling job that gives me a chance to long to get home to my kid.No parenting a kid is not hard in the same way that many jobs are. It does not require a whole lot of knowledge or application of knowledge or skill or education. It requires a fuckton of control and compassion and calm. It requires almost superhuman patience and an acceptance of the exceptionally tedious. And I dont mean like ringing up McDs orders tedious because I have worked some shitty tedious jobs in my life too. I mean like watch paint dry while someone sings  Miles on repeat tedious. No mothers are not doctors and chefs and professional drivers and teachers. They are parents. It sucks that women feel the need to obnoxiously justify their role as parents using other terms to describe what they do in a way that feels more accurate and respected to them but in some ways that comes from people denigrating and ignoring what parenthood actually is. Parents are not doctors or anything else unless they actually are literally doctors I mean  but parents do a lot of work good parents do at least and it is not easy work. Its different but not easy. tldr parenting is basically like holding a lb rock over your head. Its easy to be like What the fuck is so hard about that its only lbs! How weak are you that you cant even pick up a mediumsize rock! Some people run marathons and you cant even lift ten pounds!? but if you try to hold it over your head for an hour a day a week it becomes pretty fucking hard. ,childfree,d3adbyt,13,t5_2qtwb

He could have a tragic accident or illness.  Your current methods are very partnerdependent and highly dependent on a partner who has excellent selfcontrol knowledge of his bodysexual response not a whole lot of preejaculation leakage AND who doesnt want to get you pregnant on any level.  I hear you very clearly that you never want to be pregnant.If you did ever have another partner theres no guarantee that your methods would be successful with someone else.  Even a guy who is rabidly CF may not have the ejaculatory control of your current partner.  Or you could be with a guy who is willing to knock you up thinking it will force you to stay with him.  Obviously you can still abort but it sounds like the idea of even a few weeks of pregnancy gives you the massive heebiejeebies.  It sounds like you may be open to fostering or adopting or perhaps becoming a stepparent in the future.

And its two sided too to act like Childfree folks arent mature for not being interested in that flavor of baggage is disgusting. Caring for a loved one going through chemotherapy is baggage. Being the caretaker of a parent whos suffering from severe dementia is baggage. Being between jobs and having financial stress is baggage.   Children and peoples babymommadaddy are more than baggage. Its a separate relationship that you have to maintain and many many people wouldnt sign up for that in other circumstances either. Im at the age riiiight where people are having kids on purpose more than on accident mid twenties and just from my experiences with my friends peers employees and friends relationships.. having children is a lot more than just baggage when youre a single parent because youve also got the childs other parent. Whether the other parent is all that involved in the child and individuals daily lives they will always have that previous relationship and it can be very hard to draw a line to just keep you out of it. Ive seen so many cases of people getting dragged into so much unnecessary drama and put into difficult positions constantly.   Like for me personally? I could absolutely date someone with an older child. Id be happy to get to know them not attempt to parent them not try to be their equal and would want to be able to treat them like an adult. Why? You can censor your subject matter less music movies TV speak to them in a way to not infantalize or condescend them try and engage them in topics of things they are interested in or beginning to get interested in. But a younger child? Dealbreaker. If the child is young then they still may have confused notions of family structure especially if the parent is single and has been actively dating a bit. Many people elect not to let their kids meet someone until its serious buuut thats a maturity and class thing. A male friend of mine met his dates kids almost immediately and was extremely displeased about it. Why? He made them reservations at a very nice restaurant for their first date and goes to pick her up at her place. He gets there and she informs him shes a mother of three later finds out all different parents and that she hadnt realized she would need a sitter. So he winds up having to take the whole fam damily out to like a Cicis pizza buffet or something cancels the reservations and eat the movie tickets hed purchased for them. She harassed him for MONTHS after that all via social media posting that he wasnt a real man and that a real man would WANT to take care of her kids.

They want you to believe your relationship with your children will be rewarding enjoyable and without any insurmountable difficulties.Youre being asked to expect the best with absolutely no basis in reality to justify that expectation.

You need a better quality of friends and yeah this is really one of the few safe places to discuss this stuff unfortunately.The fact that they are terrible people and horrible friends should not impact your own selfworth. Start by checking the CFfriendly docs list in the sidebar to see if there are any in your area. These are docs that at least one of our members have been to and got sterilized. Thats not a guarantee that they theyre not going to change their mind from one day to the next or whatever but its a start and many members here have had success using the list. Weve had females as young as  get tubals and males as young as . There is a double standard of course but still you can make it happen.If there is no one in your area listed you get to be the pioneer that will find one and add them to the list. Various ways to get started on that If theres a PP in your area take a chance and call them up and ask if they know any respectful docs in the area. Its a bit of a crap shoot depending on who answers the phone on a given day but worth a shot. Take your insurance list of docs and just start contacting them one by one and asking. Dont necessarily stop with the idiotbreeder receptionist though. Try to talk to the doc or their nurse if you can to get closer to the truth one hopes. Call up noncatholic hospitals in the area many have doc referral lines. Ask specifically if they do tubals at that hospital and get the names of the docs who do them and if you can ask them who the most respectful professional doctors are from that group. I have some complex concerns and I want someone who will listen to what I want. Call any docs on the list in areas that are not too far away and ask them if they know anyone closer to you. Longshot but... whatever it takes. If you live within a reasonable distance to a state line and your insurance would work there check the list for that state as well as yours. Sometimes there might be someone just over the line but since they are listed in the sidebar by state you might miss someone if you dont check.Etc.,childfree,d3rcayr,4,t5_2qtwb

7837173,0,t3_4mo636,My husband and I have been over this quite a bit. It is the opposite though in our situation. What we decided on was that for six months or so we would do foster care. We would register with the state so that we could become emergency foster parents for the children in need. Normally those children are placed in a home quickly and you may only have them for a few months or so. Its nice because its a trial situation and youre also helping out children in need. This is a great middle ground because it seems like you both really love children but you dont know if you want that for  years. I was in foster care for quite some time when I was younger and I can tell you that if I would have had a foster parent that didnt beat me and was kind to me that would have changed how I saw the world so much. The world needs more kind people like you guys. You may even decide to adopt an older child instead of having your own! Great foster parents change lives. I hope this helps!,childfree,d3wyryl,2,t5_2qtwb

Every time I committed they suddenly changed tune completely. Everyone pretends to be progressive there but I feel like its mostly lip service from Christians.

7986660,0,t3_4ojx51,Im so sorry.I have plenty of anecdotes which could be appropriate. Ill talk about my own. I hope it helps. Its long.sorry for the grammar Im not a native English speakergt I always thought that when a marriage falls apart there would be years of fighting until neither person could stand it anymore.Nope. The can be monthsyears of unhappiness but there is no guarantee that there will be fighting. From my experience the more introvertgood guynonconfrontational the unhappy person is the less likely there will be a fight until the very last one. If that person has poor communication skills it can be worse.Im a compulsive good guy an introvert and a nonconfrontational person. I was with my ex for  years. Being a good guy who did not like fights we had almost none. We had a few isolated arguments about the things that made me unhappy among others but they never became full blown fights. Since I had very poor communication skills so I could not explain properly what made me unhappy and how much it made me unhappy. Being the good guy I didnt want to leave for what I perceived as a stupid reason like unfolded laundry and I did not realize what was really bothering me her inability to do what she promises to do. When she fell in depression the good guy in me was even less able to leave because she needed help not another problem.After forcing myself to talk but with no improvements to the relationship I gave up trying to talk. She thought I had stopped being unhappy.I was unhappy after two years in the relationship. I left after five years three years later than I should have when I realized nothing was working. It looked like we were a little distant but thats all. In practice we just had learned how to step around anything that caused problems. When I left she never saw it coming. In fact she never understood all the things that made me unhappy. She spent too muchshe took loans to spend  of our gross income for months shes probably a compulsive buyer. She didnt respect me didnt keep her word on anything made any real effort to work on our problems and I still resented her for having sexualemotional relationships? with asome? guys? online even if they never metbut nothing serious happened!. To date she still thinks I left her because Im greedy and didnt want to spend a few bucks on plants to decorate the house.When I finally had the courage to confront her it was too late. It took so much to go against my nature and have a fight that too much had accumulated. I just left and nothing could have made me change my mind.So I dont know how much any of that applies but if he hasnt cheated on you and got his gf pregnant Im willing to bet hes a introvert he may have poorly communicated his unhappiness so weakly that you didnt realize it was a real problem and not just an annoyance of the moment he didnt want to cause trouble but hes a good boy. So he never did even if he was unhappy. He may even have looked happy. When his dad died he was confronted with his own mortality a friend of mine did and he realized he wanted kids to have a legacy to pass on.  He didnt know how to talk about it since you said you didnt want kids and so he didnt. The almost became irrelevant so in his mind the relationship became more and more doomed as he thought about it for a year. When his mind was made up. He did it. He left. Nothing left to save anyway. the kids are probably not the only reason but the most easily explained. It was the last straw that makes a convenient excuse and still makes him look good to the friends and family.So for you it may have been really fast but in his mind it probably has been a long time coming.As you move on I can only say that you dodged a bullet. Until something significant happened to make me learn that being a good guy can be really bad for a relation and what real communication skills look like and how I could learn them I would have made a bad husband or father because I wouldnt have been able to work the problems so they didnt become major problems. Thats what this looks like to me.Good luck.,childfree,d4drypl,2,t5_2qtwb

If you want to be a parent because you want to raise a child and teach them about the world and experience things with them it is not selfish to not want a nonverbal nonambulatory diapered  year old who seizes multiple times a day and requires a feeding tube. if someone posted a gofundme or something about parents with a massively disabled child you and everyone else would be saying they should have had an abortion. So why are you now demanding that anyone who wants to be a parent must be willing to deliberately take that on?,childfree,d4v6ghc,1,t5_2qtwb

He thinks my name is Babe and when he hears my SO say it he runs over to me for kisses. When Im sick he brings me his toys and shoves himself into my crevices because he thinks itll make me better. I could never ever imagine giving him up. Like the thought of new owners doesnt even compute in my brain. They wouldnt know of his random little quirks and how he absolutely will not go outside in the rain. They dont know that he once faceplanted in a snow bank then looked at me like it was my fault. They dont know that he used to pretend to hurt himself for attention when he was younger. My husband and I are his whole world.

A newborn baby would die within hours if not cared for.The other end of the spectrum is you and me...  But we are certainly fallible and prone to all sorts of biases and irrationality.  Lets not kid ourselves.  Even adults arent capable of making fully adult decisions.And in the middle...  I have a preteen daughter.  She THINKS she knows whats best for her but I frequently disagree.  So shes somewhere in the middle of that spectrum.  She knows the basics of living... like food money general hygiene etc.  If her mother and I suddenly mysteriously disappeared I think shed figure out how to survive andor find help.  But shes far from a fullyfunctional adult obviously.So yeah shades of grey with a definite startingpoint but no welldefined endpoint.gtThanks a lot for helping me figure out my position on this I really appreciate your responses.

Breastfeeding also means the mother is  responsible for feeding the baby its a lot of pressure and maybe OPs friend would be more comfortable being able to share the job with her spouse. Perhaps breastmilk is the ideal substance for a baby human but you dont need  perfect to be healthy and it breastmilk comes with a catch of a miserable stressed and unhappy mother then I do not think the benefits are worth it. I think lactation consultants should only be talking with new mothers who actually want to breastfeed if I were not childfree and some person came in to my hospital room and started lecturing me Id tell them to fuck off. I dont think anything the OP has said about her friend gives the impression that she wont be a loving mother. You can love and be devoted to your child without having everything in your life revolve around them and still being an individual rather than babys names mum. My mum adored me from when I was born she still had friends and a life outside of being my mum I was and still am in my s an incredibly important part of her life just as my little brothers are but just not everything. ,childfree,d593ips,6,t5_2qtwb

Well they left about  minutes after that but that little kid was quiet not plastered to a phone or throwing French fries. He was looking at the adults the tv and the bottles lining up along the back wall. Every now and again hed contribute something like it was mr. Soandsos store that had the dog daddy.

The nurse was trying to dress me as I was still going in and out of consciousness.   The pain from the surgery was really no big deal in fact I was fine with some OTC aleve NSAIDS and never had to take the prescription pain killer. I was sore and bled a little the first day but most of all I was just really tired and wanted to sleep. Like I said they over medicated me.   The worst part was I was getting over a sinus infection and the intubation made my throat feel horrible. I couldnt even speak the day after the surgery because my throat was so raw. Luckily I had lots of hot soups to help ease the pain and by the third day post surgery I went to see my Gen Practitioner and she gave me an antibiotic to get rid of the sinus infection.   I had a lot of shoulder pain when I laid flat on my back so I spent a lot of time sitting semireclined on the couch watching as much Parks and Rec as I could tolerate in a day reading and relaxing. By the th day post I began feeling normal and the shoulder pain started to go away and the throat pain began to lessen.

My own grandfather is a bit....behind in the times. He only begrudgingly accepted a cell phone after my dad and his brother just bought one set it up and threw it at him because his landline always went out and he lives alone. He asked how to make a call they showed him how to put it on charge aaaand its been there since. He will answer calls GREEN PHONE PAP but never calls texts I dont even think he knows theyre games on there...and Im still not sure if hes ever been on the internet. All while constantly charging maybe it reminds him of a corded phone.Anyway sorry just had to explain what kind of guy he is. So one day my brother sister and I were helping him take down a tree. He always asks about schoolworkrelationships and asked if there was any one special in my life. I hadnt seen anyone for about  years at this point and it had been over  since one had gotten far enough to meet him basically they meet him when you plan on keeping the guy. My siblings make a joke about me being a lesbian which isnt even weird   we would joke around like that usually ends in calling the actual gay person straight but I couldnt believe they said it in front of him. He just gave a shrug and said something like aint nothin wrong with that it dont bother no one else.

This isnt about love this is about compatible life goals.And as other people have mentioned as a guy you are playing with fire. She needs to get serious about birth control and realize that if she gets pregnant and doesnt abort it will mean the end of your relationship. Youll send her the money shell be legally entitled to for child support but shell never see you again and her child will grow up without a father.

I am sadly also the only one who has a classical educational background meaning that none of the people I work with have an idea about much of anything between the Big Bang and now. I dont mean to be insulting but for most their interest and information level starts at what the TV and the tabloids say and we are  women stops with soon marrying and having kids or currently having their first kids. They are all also highly sexist to both genders without realizing it and very awkward and cueless concerning LGBTG issues although they think they are supportive and relaxed. I have a niece and also sometimes can put in my two cents I also have an LTR cf partner yay! so I can talk about that and relate a bit but over all my world is very different to theirs.I knew I was lost when I was asked about my weekend and said I had seen Nolans Interstellar of which the music and sound effects seemed to be very much citations of Kubricks . The answer I got was Who are Nolan and Kubrick?  They are all great people and I love it there but I already feel very out of place and its only getting worse with three women coming back soon from maternity leave and my closest colleagues already planning their first pregnancies. Oh well at least I am studying again. Wont stay there forever.TLDR no relation to colleagues is probably common and unavoidable,childfree,d6l3jgj,6,t5_2qtwb

He didnt claim a strong opinion one way or another but I intuited from what he DID say that he was against abortion.

Adoption seems like one of the most traumatic things to go through even if one is childfree. Ive contemplated how abortion ties into veganism but Ive come to realize it is more of a womens rights issues and not one of the fetus rights. The concept of fetus rights seems ridiculous. Furthermore the cells are not capable of feeling pain until way later in the pregnancy. It is also not capable of surviving if it were immediately detached from the womans body. Therefore the decision is up to the woman as the cells live in her body. I dont see why people think this is a huge decision.

8838487,0,t3_517apl,Heres my take and others are free to disagree with me.  I AM selfish in my reasons for not wanting kids.  But I dont think thats a bad thing.A parent has to sacrifice their free time their patience their health their individuality and in some cases their bodies for women and even their careers.  Im not willing to sacrifice any of that.  Im selfish because I want my free time I want my independence.  But I dont see that selfishness as a bad thing.  I recognize that while I have many positive traits one of them is not the selflessness of a parent.  I dont think thats a bad thing it just IS it would only be bad if I recognized this and still decided to have kids anyway.Selfish in this case could be perhaps more accurately described as selfconcerned  not selfobsessed which would be a flaw but concerned about ones self.

We take things people say even if they dont say them towards or about us as if they are speaking directly to us.This goes doubly for shite parents who see every possible post even slightly critical of kids or childrearing as a directed attack towards them.  They feel the need to be vindicated because odds are good gt methinks that their little critter wasnt planned and is serving as a constant reminder of poor choices they made in life.  They see someone who doesnt make those same choices either by using more reliable or any contraception or aborting and they feel like youre holding it over them like youre gloating when in fact youre doing no such thing.

8883419,0,t3_51xm62,For anyone interested heres the whole text to that.gt Disclaimer Im going to sound like either a huge asshole or a sociopath in this post and I know that. Please understand that I wish I was so different than I am and that Im just being honest about my feelings here. I try to ensure these feelings affect my daughter as little as possible and that she knows she is loved and cared for.gt Ive been with my husband  lets call him David  for seven years married for five. Our daughter Lily is three and a half years old.gt In my early s having a child was something that wasnt really on my radar but that I wasnt opposed to either. I didnt feel apathetic about it but ambivalent  not sure if I wanted to commit to having a child but also had a sense that I would find parenting fulfilling emotionally intellectually and spiritually. In fact I thought I would regret it if I never had kids. David had always wanted to have kids too so when we had this discussion before our engagement it was natural that we agreed to start a family.gt I was  when we had Lily. She was  planned  we were in a good position in our lives to care for a baby I had just finished grad school and had a great telecommuting job that allowed me to work fulltime from home David was making good money. We felt ready as much as one can be to be a new parent.gt I had a relatively easy pregnancy and continued working throughout most of my pregnancy. However the way I felt during my pregnancy was nothing like Ive heard anyone describe before. I hated being pregnant. It didnt feel magical or spiritual to me. I hated being told that I was glowing I hated people telling me what labor would be like I hated people asking questions about my pregnancy. I was physically uncomfortable all the time and I didnt feel like there was a person inside me let alone a person I loved. I didnt feel connected to her at all I just felt disconnected from my own body instead. I was freaked out about my lack of connection with her but read a lot online and convinced myself it was just pregnancy hormonesthat it was normal to not feel bonded until after birth.gt This was true to an extent. I did love her and feel connected to her the second I saw her. But I didnt fall in love with her the way other mothers describe it. I didnt want to watch her sleeping all the time I didnt feel like I missed her when I was away from her. I took a month of maternity leave from my job and I was bored out of my skull. I wasnt depressed or anxious or overwhelmed just incredibly bored. Every day felt like the day before it like there was no end in sight.gt I returned to my job but felt like I couldnt work fulltime even online with the baby constantly needing my attention. My work involved a lot of conference calls deadlines etc. and had to be done during regular office hours even though it was online. I transitioned to parttime consulting in my field which is a great fit for me and she goes to halfday preschool which gives me more of my own time.gt Please understand I do love Lily and I spend time with her and care for her. But I just dont feel like Im meant to be a parent. I dont enjoy her presence as much as Im supposed to. I love her and want all the best for her but I thought I would enjoy her more. I kept waiting for something to change telling myself oh its because shes an infant she cant really interact with me and then oh Ill feel differently when she starts talking and then oh well Ill enjoy teaching her to read. I have a background in linguistics and I thought I would love seeing her go through the process of language acquisition but its slow and boring.gt With every milestone that passes I become more and more worried that the way I feel will NEVER change. The other moms at preschool love LOVE talking about their children about future plans for them about parenting techniques. I find this conversation utterly boring. Thats not a judgment of these women by the way  I find it boring in the same way I find nuclear physics or economics boring  not because I believe it lacks value but because I find my mind wandering when I engage with it.gt David is a wonderful father. He cant wait to come home to Lily every evening. Hes so excited to be around her and parenting looks so NATURAL on him. Even little things like changing diapers or waking up to feed her or just talking to her came so much more naturally for him. I cant relate to him at all and Im sure he wouldnt be able to relate to me if I explained the extent of how I feel.gt The truth is I just feel completely trapped. I hate that I can never go back to not being a parent. I feel like I made a horrible mistake and I dont see how I can be fully satisfied with my lifestyle again. Maybe Im just a selfish person but I hate the idea that my life revolves around this tiny human. I hate that I cant do anything spontaneous that my life is so set in stone now. I really really hate the idea of my primary identity being mother. It just feels like this constant weight on me this ennui this thing tethering me to a place I dont want to be. It makes me feel cagey and claustrophobic.gt And I hate the idea that I might fuck her up by feeling that way. I cant imagine any adaptations I could make to my life that would make things different. I try my hardest to be a good parent to Lily but Im terrified that as she gets older shell start picking up on the fact that Im not like other parents.gt I feel like Ive gone through every other possibility in my mind that might explain why I feel this way. I talked to a doctor and my therapist about the possibility of postpartum depression. Im not depressed according to the assessments Ive taken. Ive been taking on more work and meeting friends more to get out of the house. Ive talked to David not about all of this because I think it would scare him but about feeling like Im not a natural parent. Ive taken up new hobbies. Ive tried spending more time with Lily teaching her new things making scrapbooks about her. The inescapable fact that I keep coming back to is that Im happier doing other things than I am being with her. I dont find fulfillment in our relationship. I dont like what my life looks like as a parent.gt TLDR  Very sorry for how long this turned out to be. Ive had a hard time figuring all of this out. I regret having my child and want my life to be different. It isnt depression or lack of effort. Ive been in therapy for two years. Nothing is changing and Im so scared that it never will. I dont want to fuck up my daughter but I dont know how long I can live my life pretending to be happy when Im miserableHonestly this is my biggest fear. Sometimes when Im playing with my niece or nephew I get the urge that maybe I want one of my own but I think this is how Id end up. I dont hate kids but I dont want to either which is what I would dread happening if I had to give up everything I want to do to be solely responsible for another human being.

She was willing to saddle you with a lifetime of responsibility. That alone shows how little she cared about you. Dont let your emotions get in the way of whats right. Get away from her and stay away from her. This is a really weird analogy but its the best I can come up with. Imagine you had a relative that wanted to lock you under their control to better themselves. Their method could be anything but lets just say they were in trouble with debtors. To your face they tried to be your bestie but in reality they gave no fucks about you. They then try to get you to take on responsibility for their mistakes for the rest of your working life. Thats what your significant other has done. She made a mistake and wants you to help pay for it. Dont.Case in point I have a brother that is very likely not my blood relative. My dads other kids all have a very mildmannered easygoing personality. None of us are aggressive. This other brother? Not only does he not look like my dad but hes nothing like the rest of us.

I understand your reasons for not wanting kids. Although it sounds like your bf wants kids and that youre leaning towards not wanting them. This is where things start to suck.If you feel that hes leaning in the opposite direction of you it hurts but you have to move on with your life. Youre in college so am I. I get that you see the endless possibilities in life you want to live them. So I guess a little advice is to live your life for you because in the long run your the person who gets the final say. Never compromise with this only you know whats best for you. Your mom will come around if some how she doesnt well thats her problem and not yours its your life. In the end it will either be he gives or the relationship has to end.

Im a huge fan of personal gifting as in I dont give mums presents on their birthdays that are fit for their kids AND vice versa. If your sister has this dream of a holiday even if its silly she can wish for a monetary contribution to their holiday piggy bank on HER birthday and you are free to decide to gift money or not because in the end one cant expect or dictate the nature of a gift. I thought Id had to get my niece a grand present for her first birthday  but I had no idea what she could want. I asked my sister and she said put a few stones she can swallow easily without suffocating in a metal box and put a bright ribbon around it shell love it. Thats what I did total cost  cent for the ribbon and a little time for finding an unused tea box and some pebbles. Niece loved it but was mainly impressed by the ribbon. To be honest I dont think your two year old niece has that much more if a complicated wish list. I guess youre good with some sweets stickers and crayons?

Im sure many folks go What the fuck did I get myself into after a year or few of actually experiencing it and just bounce.Thats also one of the many reasons I never want to have a kid... because I wouldnt want to be the kind of person that would abandon my responsibilities but if I got stuck with a kid I probably would knowing my temperament.

That bitch didnt have a phone? SHE couldnt download some game on her husbands phone? If you would have explained it to her that insurance companies pay for replacement cost and that you wanted it to be insured before you let a child handle your  device would she have scoffed when you required  to have the child use the IPad? If she thought it was outrageous to give you the money then you think she would have paid you if her child would have broken it? Or would she have hidden behind her husband and said Accidents happen.What didnt she understand about keeping a child entertained at an adult party? Never mind. This breeder didnt understand that when she had a kid her life was going to change and she might have to stay home every now and then. Im a horrible person. I would have explained to her that it is an ADULT piece of equipment. Meaning I would have made her believe that it was a means to a cum. If she didnt relent then I would have downloaded a SHIT TON of porn turned the volume up on  and gave it to the kid. ,childfree,d808z6s,2,t5_2qtwb

And youre at a transit hub where people are trying to make commute connections. For the record I did offer to help that daddict by carrying the stroller so he could carry the kid.

If you lack the funds  take all YOUR not his stuff that can be easily replaced  and just pawn it. Tell him that you had an abortion after the fact and give him the same choice you can either accept it or you can leave and if he accepts this he can return to you after he has brought back all the stuff that you had to pawn in order to get this procedure. If he does not accept  you will have to split up. That is the only option. You will give him the same situation that he gave you something bad has happened because of the actions of the other person and you now have to choose either accept it or not.   Trust will be a big issue in your relationship but he may be willing to work on it. Dont ever let your birt control be entirely on him. Me and my GF use birth control both  she is on the pill I am using condoms. You can never leave it up to him ever again. That is your choice and even if you want him back.

This can relate to anything hoovers busses people with beards and children.Children and dogs are notorious for just not getting along. Children especially babies and toddlers have absolutely no concept of how to behave around a dog and usually lack the mental capacity to understand how to.Children stare poke prod grab bite make awful noises smell weird and most importantly do not know when a dog is giving signals to back off. This can lead to an upset dog.In your case your pooch is probably scared or nervous because theres this weird looking awful smelling noisy thing that hes never seen before. The most unusual or random of things can set a dog off and it always comes back to the dog feeling insecure.Honestly the best thing you can do in this situation is one of two things.Firstly you can keep your pooch away from kids. It will mean hes less likely to be upset when around something he doesnt understand.That being said considering how prevalent children are in our society it would be best to introduce your dog friends willing very slowly and gently with lots of love and rewards to children. This will mean he is less likely to be scared more likely to be relaxed around children meaning hes less likely to freak out and bite  even the gentlest dog has their breaking point when scared and it will give you greater peace of mind as well not having to worry if your lovely woofer is upset.Check out Positive Reinforcement and Desensitisation especially on Dog Trainer Victoria Stillwells Positively website.

Ive heard a lot of people complain about intense cramping and heavier bleeding with Paraguard. Mirena lasts for  years and protects against pregnancy with hormones that seal up your cervix and prevent an embryo from attaching to your uterine lining which it thins. For this reason about  woman no longer get periods. I know birth control experiences are different for everyone but this has worked incredibly well for me and several of my friends.

The plan was at thirty wed have t make a decision due to the increased risk of birth defects and related issues. Problem was we never made it to thirty.

Now as we approach  Ive been snipped and weve made some huge changes in our lives. Ive mentioned a move a lot here lately the big reason for the move was a it drastically reduces my commute b she can now be a full time writer and c we dont have any spare room for kids. We sold the  sqft house on . acres in the exurbs for a  sqft house on . acres right outside the city. Theres only one bedroom. We fill this house appropriately as compared to leaving half of it untouched. The old house was empty because at one point we were expecting to need the room if we came around to the decision we wanted kids.

9276403,0,t3_57gntl,Admittedly enough I have a rather pessimistic and nonPC view of the situation. For starters I think that most people are too stupid andor selfcentered to think understand that overpopulation is a problem and that yes they DO have a personal responsibility to help solve the problem. To that end Im very pessimistic that anything that is both effective and entirely voluntary will become appealing to people before its too late and by that time we WILL need to go to extremes like limiting the number of children people can have. I too would like to avoid that scenario but at this point I think its inevitable. Now what to do about the situation?On the propaganda side of things we have options such as continuing to spread the message that climate change is a problem overpopulation is a contributing factor and therefore also a problem and that every human has a responsibility to do what they can to help curb this problem. normalizingdestigmatizing childfreedom adoption particular as the first choice for bringing children into a family not just as a last resort for the infertile and small families by which I mean families with  children. This can be accomplished through positive representations of childfreedom adoption and small families in popular media. In more dire circumstances it could be coupled with outright negative portrayals of large families  children and refusing the option of adoption.On a policy level globally increased access to education and resources to control ones own reproduction especially for women education geared towards increasing the equality of all genders and the destruction of specific gendered roles such as placing most of the burden of childcare on womenUnfortunately as the population situation gets more dire I think extreme measures to limit fertility would be necessary. These could include placing strict limits on infertility treatments e.g. all must be paid for out of pocket only X number of attempts for each treatment allowed or even outright making them illegal Strict limits on maternity and paternity leave e.g. you get  months paid leave with your job guaranteed at the end. If you want more you dont get paid and you give up the guarantee of getting your old job back. The possibility of extended leave for extenuating circumstances may or may not exist depending on how the situation populationwise is. Tax credits for individuals with no children or with only  children with the highest credit going to the individuals with no children and the lowest going to the individuals with . Individuals with more than  children do not receive the tax credit. Individuals who have children lose partall of the credit permanently i.e. you dont go back to getting the nokids credit when you no longer claim the kids as dependents. Choosing to adopt will allow you to keep more of the credit than having biological children would. All forms of birth control and sterilization fully covered by health insurance and available on demand well...as ondemand as a surgical procedure can be.  Abortion fully covered by health insurance and available on demand. The development of birth control options for men other than the condom celibacy and vasectomy. At the most extreme legal limiting of how many children can be born will have to be implemented. This could possibly take many forms such as a blanket limit on how many children each person can have to limiting who can reproduce and how many children they can have when they do. This option is extreme and fraught with problems so it SHOULD be the option of last resort well after the implementation of other extreme options. The problem is that ideally people would realize the problem and take steps to have an active part in rectifying it without ever hitting the kinds of extremes I outlined here. But like I said at the beginning Im super pessimistic about the caring and intelligence of most people to choose ON THEIR OWN to limit their own reproduction and therefore contribute to the stabilization or decline of the population. Its much easier to do feelgood but not as effective stuff like turning out the lights in rooms you arent using than it is to take a huge step like deciding youll only have one kid when you really want four.,childfree,d8rumjd,6,t5_2qtwb

Go to a therapist regularly and dont just quit KEEP GOING.See about going on a medication and STAY ON IT unless its making you seriously ill. Messing around with them only makes things worse.Find some social groups that share your interests Meetup.com Facebook groups google plus etc and go along to events to make new friends.Join a gym to get fit get a haircut buy some nice clothes. Stand up tall. You can still be a geek on the inside and look your best on the outside.Do some serious work on how you see yourself. No one else should have to love you or want you if you dont even love you or want you. BUT THIS CAN BE FIXED.All of this shit CAN BE FIXED with some hard work from you.But that is the ONLY WAY its going to get fixed. No girl is going to fix it for you. Only you can. So go fix it. Not for a girl but for yourself. The girls will come along when you are in a better place Edit Ive seen in your other comments that youve tried therapy and medication for decades to little help. My advice after spending  years on the medication merry go round that didnt help? Go see a psychiatrist. Save up the money if you have to usually takes a couple of months to get an appointment anyway so put  a week aside to pay for it. They know their shit. For me it was as simple and complex as Id been misdiagnosed. I had bipolar  not depression. Completely different illness doesnt respond to antidepressants they generally make it worsePsychs know their shit way more than GPs. google around reading reviews to find a good one and save up.

I asked her  times to take her dog off the leash and as soon as she did the dog was more calm. Its totally normal for some dogs to go up to the new dog when they are let in.My dogs are old even though they look young because they are small. You can tell by movement and color but she asked about one how old is he?.. I answered and she asked is he healthy?.What kind of question is that? Are YOU healthy?

This was a house that had small children a person who is allergic to cats two elderly people and one person going through chemotherapy. Any behavioral problems would have been bad. My parents got a cat that wasnt allowed on their lease and declawed him to avoid suspicion from the landlord and protect their furniture . He was ok for awhile then started biting out of the blue. They took him to the vet who declared him healthy and blamed catnip for the behavioral problems unlikely. More likely they knew he was having chronic pain issuesarthritis related to declawing and were covering their ass. They took away the catnip and big surprise the biting issues didnt go away. They put him down because they were having me and my sister and he had become dangerous. They are still prodeclaw and scared of catnip to the point where they didnt allow it in the house with their current cat which me and my sister successfully blackmailed them into not declawing when we were growing up. I got a catnip plant last year and brought it home during break to show how little I cared about their catnip phobia. With my parents previous cat the only people who got hurt was them and the cat who wasnt declawed is already nervous to the point where he probably would have gotten a mentalphysical health problem which would have caused behavioral problems.

For the record there was no one around the area and they werent disrupting anyone.We had some time to catch up after the kids had gone to bed.  It was weird because we used to be on the same level about a lot of things.  I tried to share the joys of living in my city including food places the beach and a lot of other enjoyable activities.

We just relocated to a new city because we were sick of where we lived and both our jobs sucked. He changed careers on a whim from something he hated to something he loves! So not having kids made it much easier to sell his house relocate etc. I would say we are a typical middle class DINK couple. We like to keep things simple so when we are ready to buy again scoping out the city and renting before we settle in a neighborhood we will get a small house. We try to live well within our means. With a small house we can pay it off much faster and dont have a lot of cleaning to do. We have  dog which is plenty for us to care for.Getting married is not a rush or a priority for us. We love to travel and so far have alternated each year with a big international trip or several small domestic trips. Im not strapped for money because I focused on eliminating or not taking on a ton of debt and I have a career. If we had kids we would be okay but things would be a lot tighter.

We essentially live the same lives as the people around us we just dont have kids and anything that has to do with kids. Which leaves everyone wondering what we do with all our free time and money. Essentially we live a less stressful life and are able to afford things we probably would not if we chose to have kids. a nicer house a boat a few toys etc We also have the time and the extra cash to travel more and go out to eat a lot more then parents would. The other posters were right. essentially we do what we want. If we want to take off and go somewhere for the weekend the biggest challenge we run into is can the dog come or do we need to drop him off at the inlawsThe biggest challenge we have living in an area like this thats primarily families is finding people to socialize with that either dont have kids or are not mombiesdaddicts.

9740452,0,t1_dabwarn,Basically this far from being the tabloids Darling Little Angel Madeleine McCann was in truth a revolting little brat with serious behavioural problems who tormented her twin younger siblings and drove her mother to despair. It is believed the parents resorted to whether regularly or occasionally some kind of sedation for her so they could get some peace and in this instance go out drinking nearby being too cheap to pay for a sitter despite being wellpaid doctors. Being doctors they had knowledge of and access to a range of dope for the brat. So they came back to find either a her dead likely because of the drugs and so disposed of her. This is by far the most probable event. Scent dogs detected human corpse smells in their hired car boot. b her gone. But any such disappearance would be far more likely because she wandered off  perhaps dopedisorientated perhaps looking for her parents  and met with an accident. Rather than abducted in the manner described by the McCanns. Which is not plausible for many reasons.The McCanns are middleclass and mediasavvy. They knew what they had to do and the British media obliged thanks to their paedoobsession the angelic little girl angle and the mileage they love to make out of the supposed incompetence of foreign police. Shitrags like the Daily Mail will still post photos of random scruffy fairhaired girls out begging in Eastern European with headlines like Maddie  sold to gypsies? And the McCanns go along with this absurd and utterly tasteless charade because it aligns with their pleas to find her. And they justify using money raised to pay their mortgage etc because they how could they work whilst they had a media blitz to orchestrate?Tldr  Madeleine McCann was a little monster.

Also in the U.S. complexes are required by law to have a certain percentage of handicap spaces. The maternity spaces are just a perk offered by the store and not legally binding so feel free to park in those if you like. Generally the only accommodations a pregnant woman needs is that they shouldnt lift more than lbs regularly and they should avoid overheating.

For every episode centered around babies and motherhood one can easily point to another episode where House consistently portrayed as the smartest man in the room for every room hes ever walked into advocates abortion and contraception.Maybe this is just my personal reaction to zealous careerists who annoy me almost as much as zealous parents.  Just like with parenthood not everyones life revolves around career and not everyones has to.  I like it when people or characters who find raising children unfulfilling choose not to have them.  I also like it when people or characters who no longer find their career fulfilling up and say screw careerism screw someone elses definition of success Im going to find something new to do with my life that I find worthwhile.That said I also disliked the open fetal surgery scene.

Later on I had the copper iud however unfortunately it made my periods a fuckton heavier so I started using large menstrual cups which then in turn pulled the string out. When I visited my gyno and told him that the iud came out because of a large menstrual cup he laughed at me and told me that I was just too young to have an iud.  I was using the diva cup  for women who have given birth i have not. He ignored the fact that it was in fine for over  months.   After this debaucle he suggested the pill I was desperate so I tried it. It gave me horrible acne and never fixed my heavy bleeding. He later told me that the amount I am bleeding is subjective. While in fact I was bleeding over mlml a day. I was furious. After being laughed at and then having my heavy bleeding ignored I could not take it.

10237990,0,t3_5m4ikh,For me regretting not having kids later on has never been a scary thought. I can think of three reasons why that is. . Regret is very unlikely. Theres a study Im sure someone will link shortly that describes poststerilization regret and the factors that contribute to someone regretting getting permanent birth control. From my perspective the key finding was that if you are sure enough of your childfree stance to get sterilized you will almost certainly be content with your decision. . Regret is survivable. Regretting things is not a nice feeling but it is just a feeling. Uncomfortable emotions unhelpul thinking and unfair interpretations can be subjected to psychological work. You can overcome them either by changing them or accepting them. People come to terms with their past actions and inactions all the time function dispite them and find happiness regardless. Regret is far from the end of the world its sometimes portrayed as. . Regret would be a mistake. In this case regret would also be irrational. If you make your decision to the best of your ability and knowledge and with an honesty towards your values and characteristics theres no reason to be regretful later on. Regretting would mean you wished you had made a decision that was incorrect at the time that you had gone against what you thought was your best course of action. Thats not at all reasonable and if my future self would really think that hed be a fool. Id like to think hes smarter than that. ,childfree,dc4j7im,1,t5_2qtwb

10343061,0,t1_dcgfndf,Yes I agree with every point! Like I would also be resentful if I sacrificed so much to mutilate myself to give birth to a baby and then had to do  of the work for no thanks but I just... like... Why would you put yourself in that situation? How is it a surprise? I mean I think the cultural gender norms around malefemale roles in childrearing are so strong and insidious that its an extremely rare statistical anomaly when its truly equal or when the man is doing more work. But it happens. I dont understand a persons priorities who would settle for a man like this for the sake of having a baby but as you say snagging a man is like a status symbol and a stepping stone to reproducing which is their real goal as a woman. My BF pointed out these are easy massproduced measures of success for most people and that was a big revelation for me because I was so confused why they were so obsessed with all of it. As much as I hate the dad is babysitting tropes I think its based in a bitter reality. My friend who has a baby and bad tearing her husband is great at the positive stuff ergo he gets to be the fun parent experiencing kodak moments and hes definitely affected by the shitty parts but he really does babysit his kid and for the whole time  hours hes trying to pawn the kid back off on its mom. Naturally she resents this deeply. I dont understand how our other friend sees this and doesnt realize it will be her even if not to the same degree friendwithbabys husband is a workaholic. In her case it doesnt seem that their relationship is immature they do communicate well its just that she maybe has rosecoloured glasses on about his future parenting role because he agrees with her when she states things about wanting to have an egalitarian relationship IMO. IMO most men dont even really realize how little theyre doing in childcare.gtThey communicate foolishly if at all and act like their spouse needs to read their mind. At best this results in a subtly verbally abusive relationship.This is definitely how I feel about the woman who I said was the worst offender. Everything she says about her relationship disgusts me. He sounds like a loser and she sounds like a mildly verbally abusive shrill nagging parody of a negative stereotype of a woman. It seems like both men and women like you said just never grow out of being dumbass teenagers and approach relationships like an idiotic game that they both semihate but also both completely enable e.g. him by shirking childcare duties her by never communicating directly and expecting him to read her mind.What do you think will be the effects on society RE male birth control?,childfree,dcgg0nj,23,t5_2qtwb

Hell most of us here think that even  is STILL way to young to be pregnant.When someone is being forced against their will to have children its called Reproductive Coercion and its a form of domestic abuse. Nevermind. Misread.Anyone who is telling you to get pregnant at your age is NOT A FRIEND no matter how nice they might seem otherwise. A friend is someone who has your best interests at heart who wants you to live your dreams who cares about what you want for your life and who supports YOU and does not try to coerce you into being a breeder cow the minute you hit puberty.Since youre still legally and financially dependent your best bet is to avoid getting into these discussions and avoid these people as much as possible. Spend a lot of time outside of the house get involved in school or volunteer activities go study at the library instead of home and generally just become a ghost when these people are after you.To the degree you need to its perfectly fine to be silent bullshit kick the can down the road and outright LIE if you have to. There are times in life when lying is FINE. Being bullied is one of those times. You dont have to defend yourself you shouldnt bother trying to change their minds or make them accept me or make them understand because all of those things are USELESS if the person doesnt actually give a shit about what you want. Theyre just trying to control you for their own purposes.Your objective now is to do your best to put together some type of plan to become financially independent as soon as you can and to spend as little time around bullies as possible. You want to start getting work experience and earning your own money as soon as you can and saving as much money as you can in the process.Also have you considered looking into any options for going to a boarding school for high school? If you could get a scholarship or something and find one that is at least far enough that they cant drop in on you easily you could potentially get a measure of freedom.,childfree,dco6sma,3,t5_2qtwb

10485012,0,t1_dcweewl,Im assuming it wouldnt apply in that case. Someone correct me if Im wrong but I think the primary reason behind this policy is basically that doctors dont want an enraged spouse bursting into their office down the line. XDIn all seriousness though the negative reaction of a spouse is strongly correlated with poststerilization regret and requests for reversals. So in theory confirming that ones spouse is on board significantly lowers the chance of regret. Part of the underlying problem here is that in our society theres an implicit attitude that spouses are by default entitled to the reproductive capabilities of their partners body. This is evidenced in bingos such as What about your wifehusband? Arent you going to give them babies? Since our cultural Lifescript narrative stipulates that marriage leads to babies actively rendering oneself incapable of producing said babies is seen as a badfaith violation of that implied contract. Of course this doesnt mean single people are in the clear when seeking sterilization especially if they are young because doctors often cite concern about ones hypothetical future spouse wanting babies. Which is infuriating because nonexistent hypothetical spouses cant sign permission slips. This seems to be somewhat more common for women to run into though perhaps because of paternalism and subconscious sexism on behalf of the doctor e.g. an unquestioned assumption that all women desire motherhood and some just dont know it yet. There are other factors too. In general I think society has a stronger vested interest in preserving womens fertility for all kinds of reasons that arent worth extending this rant to include. Also men dont have any hormonal birth control options and its less reasonable for doctors to tell them to just rely on condoms given their failure rate.,childfree,dcwl2mt,13,t5_2qtwb

I also watched my mom make twice as much money as my dad both working full time and she still did  of the childrearing and housework. Honestly my decision to be CF has little to do with them except how much the sexism angers me. But for a long while I thought I was a lesbian so that wouldve hardly mattered anyway and I still wanted to be CF. I was more strongly influenced by babysitting and being like this is boring smelly repetitive and annoying and also just a total lack of desire to have kids. I have always found them to be unpleasant  I hate when they screamscreech including happy shrieks I hate when they intentionally try to act cute for attention and everyone goes nuts over it I hate the idea of not having time to myself amp how demanding they are and as I got older I hate the idea of them ruininginterrupting your sex life and possibly destroying your relationship with resentment I would be VERY PRIMED to resent any male partner I had kids with because of aforementioned sexism. Add that to some severe tokophobia once I learned more about the horrors of pregnancy and childbirth and youve just got a great CF agenda going. My sister used to say she didnt want kids because shed fuck them up like our parents did us I think they did okay but we both do have emotional issues but now is saying who will take care of you when youre old? and my friends said the same thing and changed their minds so...I think parental influence can totally influence being CF but a different person in your exact same shoes like my sister might be like Ill do it better or oh well thats life if you fuck them up its fine gotta get taken care of when Im old. So while for you thats pretty compelling reason some people would see that reason in their own lives and still desperately yearn to pop out babies. Shrug!

10729950,0,t1_ddm7byc,You can appreciate the result of a choice while still regretting the choice itself.  My sister had a problem between her first and second pregnancies so my second niece is biologically my daughter.  Im not her mother I didnt give birth to her or raise her and I have the same relationship with her Ive always had with my elder niece.  Biologically I have  children donated eggs at  I produced a lot of eggs in the first cycle and my sister and BiL decided to donate the rest of the embryos to a childless couple they are friends with after the first attempt was a success.  I love my niece but my sisters always been open about it which is fine but theres been a fair bit of fallout.  My fiancs family and I have always gotten on well but not wanting to have children is apparently different when I gave my sister a daughter and people I barely knew twins.  People find it somewhere between odd and monstrous when you dont prioritiselove your own offspring Im willing for the twins to visit a few times a year and theyre nice enough kids but thats the extent of my feelings towards them.  Fiancs dad was sick with cancer for the first time when fianc thenboyfriend met the twins they look more like me than my nieces do.  Hed always been childfree and knew these children existed but with his family pushing for children and the risk of losing a parent he switched and suddenly wanted children.  We broke up and after taking care of younger relatives he became very strongly childfree.  Were engaged but we could have done without the break up.  I wouldnt wish my niece out of existence but if she could have come from someone elses egg that would be nice and I would have loved that child just the same.I will say that maybe because my mother was somewhat abusive I dont value blood ties.  I love my siblings because Ive spent lots of time with them and they are wonderful.  People say its different when its your own but to put it in perspective I was in the delivery room with my sister because shed decided I should get first hold.  I handed her off first chance I got Im not huge on babies and I was holding a small damp bundle.  Im not sure if my sister was offended or relieved by how quickly I was finished holding the baby.,childfree,ddmppzq,7,t5_2qtwb

If they get rude or their behaviour makes you uncomfortable leave the situation or ask them to leave your house. Personally I dont recommend telling them that youre getting snipped.

This is changing with different approaches in strategic management but the trickle down effect takes some time. Please please document everything from now on if you can. Dont be lulled into a false sense of security HR is brilliant at making you feel safe then dancing with contractual obligations to keep things under control.

So in some ways Ive given up just because Im sick of dealing with the bullshit you get sick of being lied to cheated on treated like dirt etc. after a while but also because its been hard for me to find someone who isnt uber sensitive about crotch spawn.

Things will set you off and you can become very reactive and your threshold for stress becomes very low ha see why I dont take them?. But we also live in a fucking society and you cant coast on that. Its simply unfair and mean to everyone else. People have fatigue stress and hormone problems all around us and we still hold them to a standard for basic decency.Generally when I felt that way I would take responsibility and just sort of be by my myself. I also could use rational thought and felt very bad if I lashed out earlier. You cant use that as an excuse. And you certainly should own up if it happens. Removing herself from the situation was logically the best thing to do if someone cant control their behavioranything else is somewhat permissive of abuse. She wasnt immature for not putting up with it. I guess some people will use any excuse not to grow up. Does she get an excuse for being an asshole once the baby is born because shes tired?

Thinking nothing of their own kids or the other people at the show.Now the kids are unhappy and the people around them are unhappy because the kid is distracting them from watching a movie they paid good money to see.After  pm movies should be .Parents can no longer use it as an excuse to keep keep their children up so late just so they can go see a movie because they cannot or did not want to get a sitter and those of us who do not want kids disrupting our movies have a time we know we can go and see a movie without kids there and without having to spend a ton on the  and over venues.,childfree,devco7l,7,t5_2qtwb

11184772,0,t3_5zmadn,Seconding. Ive got endo am deciding between  having one within  years...or perhaps a tubal  endometrial ablation. My gynae was hesitant to even consider hysterectomy with ovaries left in a woman so young Im !!Ok I was like  when I saw him because it still doubles Dont believe anything your doctor says without checking it first your risk of early menopause. Apparently even if left untouched the ovaries can fail. Luckily if Ive understood correctly the same research states that for my age group ovarian failure tended to only be about a year or so before natural menopause would have happened when keeping both ovaries. But when keeping one ovary  its around  years.So can I ask if your doctors have said they want to do a hysterectomy? Or is it something you plan on suggesting? ...I think they would be very hesitant to do a hysterectomy. But if they have decided they are going to do it keep your ovaries if you can.Also a few years ago I tried these injections they give you to make you go into early menopause   its one of the treatment options for endo. You are supposed to be on them for  months. I had to stop after a month because I became suicidal. I dont mean in that like jokey way where eg people say their hot flushes made them suicidal  I mean suicidal. You can see now how I struggled a month like that even one year earlier for menopause is a serious consideration.Im telling you this because Im someone  doesnt respond well to large hormonal changes  and it sounds as if hormonal changes also affect your mental state. It doesnt matter whether my depression is flaring or not  I just become an emotional wreck. Crying all the time. For no reason. Just feeling this enormous weight of sadness. It started with my periods I found out because other people noticed my low moods got suicidal within the first  months of Nexaplon implant...but the menopause injection was the worst.You may want to look into something called Reproductive Depression . Its a fairly new idea to doctors but its something women have known for a long time  OMG like hormones can actually affect your moods? O . Lol. Anyway  one of the suggestions is that some menopausal women should be prescribed estrogen to stop their mood from plummeting.  Its what I plan on doing when I hit the menopause. I was soooo ready for a hysterectomymy endo had migrated to other organs Yay! but my reaction to the menopause injections gave me some serious reservations. And of course a hysterectomy doesnt cure endo either...Anyway as a veteran of the nhsever wonder what its like having a condition no ones ever heard of and even less believe in ?! it breaks my heart to see someone so young having to go through the system. Theres some really twatty doctors with strange attitudes to believing the patient and to womens health in general. I have some advice for you Never believe what the doctor says without checking it first. Seriously  read the research. Thats where you get the real facts.  If you arent getting anywhere  consider going privategetting a second opinion or request to be seen at a different trust. Become your own advocate. Learn as much as you can about your condition. Keep up with the latest research and clinical trials etc. Take someone with you to your appointments. It needs to be someone who can stand up for you. They need to be someone who wont be bulldozed by a consultant or professor !.  This helps in two ways. They are less willing to treat you like shitinvalidate your opinion eg due to agelife experience etc with a witness there who will stand up for you. And if you get upset they can take over in the appointment while you gain your composure. Take breaks but dont give up.

11191403,0,t1_df0fmkl,All of my comments on people wanting children wasnt to show that everyone wants children just that wanting children isnt some big phenomenon. I also believe that if you offered people  million dollars to me sterilized many would do it and just adopt. But that point doesnt really prove much it certainly doesnt prove that people dont want children. The  million dollars is also misleading because it assumes that people would take that money and invest it. The likely scenario is that people would go on more vacations and buy more stuff. You could have more money in your bank after that time but it wont be  million dollars. That would make everyone a millionaire.gtAre you saying the child dying isnt likely?I wasnt talking about death I thought that when you said they may not return a penny it would be because your child ends up a failure or disabled.gtEveryone dies. To use that as a reason to not have kids is relatively noble. Its choosing to not murder someone.Its not noble its just a decision especially since you do it to make your own life better similar to why people have kids its selfish.gtI benefited from being in the US. But she did not.If she did all of this with your best interests in mind and if your life truly is better than it would have been then it proves my point. But if you arent thankful for that then either there is more to the story or its on you.gtNot sure what you mean.You made the claim that the bond between a couple is deeper if they dont have children. Maybe you meant that its deeper if its not founded on the desire to have a family. Either way I dont agree. I wasnt talking about people who get together to have a family.

Ranting about a kid in a  venue? Sure thats valid and it was annoying when someone brought their kid to a beerfest last summer though I really dont think its a public crisis or embodiment of the world turning to shit like some people seem to. But in a food store or at a park? Nah those spaces are for everyone man.I also find some of the advice to be thorny and embody the kidhating stereotype. Look the world runs on pleasantries and culturally accepted norms. Refusing to look at a baby when your boss brings her in or walking away when someone shows you a photo is rude  you dont need to hold the kid even but saying yes very baby is a bit brash. Then again I love babies so this is very easy and pleasant for me to do but I digress. Niceties should be integral in our interactions IMO and yes not being an ass to kids or calling parents mombies if theyre not acting like that is just the way welladjusted people behave. Im not really into pets and find that calling them furbaby and comparing them to children is a bit silly. So you know what I do? Avoid places where doggiemommies bring their pets.

I dont know about you but this sort of behaviour would make me cut all ties from them forever.. Perhaps youre not in a position to do that right now but you should strive to remove the toxic people out of your life and practice recognizing this sort of behaviour so you know who also to avoid later in life too.

I focus on my emotional and mental health a lot and am finding myself to be a generally happier person and I am even attracting a whole different breed of friend since I started focusing on me. I can have uninterrupted bubble baths and the nice things I do buy for myself arent spilled or broken by children. And when I am in a relationship sex.

Junk food and fast food are treats not regular supper items Budgeting  a child aint freeetc.People take that class when theyre in age of being able to reproduce so when hitting puberty. Even if they dont have children at least they are learning some life skills. Then they pass on a written test. If you pass you get a license to parent. If you fail you dont. You have to retake the classes.What happens after gaining a license? Once you or your partner gets pregnant they are likely to see the doctor at least once. The doctor assesses the pregnancy explain options to the couple keeping the baby giving it out for adoption or aborting. If the personcouple so chooses to keep the baby the doctor sends a form to the parental equivalent of DMV. The PDMV makes random checks to make sure the parents know what theyRe doing. If they dont know what theyre doing they can be offered more classes to prepare for new baby or be fined. I have yet to find a solution to the What do we do to people who keep having children they cant afford? because its not like we can fine them even less able to afford the kids or take the kids away bit too harsh. Maybe a tax return of some sort? Obvs this whole plan would be super expensive and cumbersome. I just like to daydream. TLDR  A parenting license doesnt have to be about good or bad genes. It could be about knowledge skills and financial situation. ,childfree,dfn8iun,10,t5_2qtwb

Her children quite literally ran away from her as soon as they could. She was NC with the rest of her extended family had picked fights with everyone never finished college couldnt  hold down a job and depended financially on her husbands her whole life. She spread so many lies and hatred and separated the family for years before it could get back together again. I think my mother inherited a teeny tiny share of her disorder or at most dealt with the consequences of having a mentally ill parent. So yeah if you have BPD I dont fucking care how good of a parent you think you are its not recommendable. Maybe Im jaded I dont know. People with BPD have made my life hell before Im sorry if any BPD patients read me please dont take it personally. But know this Your children will have to pick up the pieces of your broken and volatile messes they will resent what you do to them through the years. Dont act surprised if they run away and go NC.

11463703,0,t3_63lvmn,I love threads like this. Always interesting to see how we all got here The first time I truly realized I was CF I was around  years old give or take a year. I went to a yard sale one day and a lady was selling some really beautiful paintings. I loved them and asked if she had painted them. She said she had but that after having kids she just didnt have the time and energy for it anymore.So I started thinking. I was an aspiring artist and the last thing I wanted was to ever have to give up my passion and sell my work for dirt cheap in the driveway of a suburban twostory picketfenced house. And that my friends is when I started really questioning the life script. Before that point I just assumed having kids was just what everyone did around a certain age and never thought too much into it though the idea of ever raising my own kids always did kind of freak me out. It was shortly after that I realized I could always just not have kids.Over the years certain things from my childhood started making more and more sense. Heck I didnt like playing House with other girls when I was really little and always just felt awkward about it unless I could be the dog or some other role that barely did anything. I also didnt like other kids touching my figurines and stuffed animals despite being a kid myself because I was afraid they would be too rough with them. Babies always kind of grossed me out and any time I was ever asked to hold one or entertain one was really uncomfortable. The moment of the yard sale was definitely a wakeup call but looking back there were plenty of signs leading up to it.Some other reasons that kids are not for me Pregnancychildbirth really freaks me out. I feel vaguely uncomfortable around pregnant women and dread the day when my friends start having kids of their own and ramble about their aches and pains and want me to touch their bellies...ewww no. I dont wanna get fat and lose control of certain bodily functions and all the other icky stuff that comes with pregnancy. I really dont like babies. At all. Theyre smelly loud and leak fluids from every orifice. I also find them really ugly until theyre old enough to have distinguishable features. I would find having to take care of one all day every day for its first few years of life to be mindnumbingly dull. Im not big on young children either and dont really know how to interact with people too young to have an intelligent conversation with. I also dont like dealing with younger teens who think they know everything I thought so at your age too buddy. The only kids I can really click with are the  crowd and they dont stay that age for long. I doubt I would ever be able to provide a kid with a good financially stable life with my desired career of choice. I want to have the freedom to do what I want without having to worry about providing for them. I want to have the time money and energy to devote to my hobbies and go whatever else I want. I also like to sleep a lot. I know selfish right?  I am a child of divorce. Watching my parents go through a nasty split over the course of the past three years after  years of being happily married has not been kind to my mental health and has tainted my view on marriage a little bit. I have a boyfriend who I love dearly and would like to get married to someday but in case something ever happened between us I would never want to put my own kids through the things I had to go through. On the topic of mental health I have moderate anxiety and occasionally also go through severe depressive episodes. I am seeking help but still have a long way to go. Some of this is from the situation I have had to deal with the past few years but the anxiety has been there in varying degrees throughout my whole life and I suspect my mom may have anxiety as well. Not only would I risk being a bad parent due to my own mental health issues but some of it may be genetic and could be passed onto them. I love my boyfriend and dont want that to ever die out because of a kid. Kids cause marital and financial stress date nights become less frequent and you cant just be intimate whenever and wherever you want anymore. Were still really young and all but were coming up on four years of dating very soon and dont ever want to have to stop and share each other with a kid. I know a lot of people say you end up loving your kid more than your spouse but if Im being honest here thats not as happy of a statement for me to hear as it probably is for most people. I care about the environment and dont want to exponentially increase my carbon footprint by adding a child. I also dont want a kid to have to grow up in a world where some essential resources could become a scarcity in just a couple more generations.,childfree,dfvejkq,16,t5_2qtwb
11463858,0,t3_63mhi6,Tbh I got the same shit when I was vegetarian.People would initiate conversations with me about it just because they noticed I was having a veggie burger probe for my reasons and as I learned what they really wanted was to find any possible way to tell me why my life choice was wrong. Its like they assumed that because I possibly have decided I think eating like a vegetarian is more ethical I must think Im better than them and they have to preemptively puff up their feathers and get defensive when Ive not said a single negative thing and have only gently given my sugarcoated reasons oh I just dont know how I feel about factory farming and I never really liked meat anyway for example. Then they try to convince you to eat meat or go on about how theyll eat extra delicious steak in your honour or most annoying how they pity you. Im not vegetarian anymore but Ill fiercely defend them because so many omnivores are so aggressive about it.Some people just love assuming everyone around them needs to be reminded why their own particular choices are the best ones and nothing to be ashamed of... Unprompted.Someone I knew chose not to drink alcohol because he just didnt want to no profound reasons and got similar probing questions that inevitably lead to preemptive youre not better than me though!!! type responses. Complete with pressure to join the masses. You just havent had the right drink! To be honest I felt this urge in myself because I didnt understand his choice and find drinking so fun and relaxing! But I knew better by then and resisted.I think people SOME who go along with the majority might have some sense of shame when they see someone who doesnt. Like its something they dont want to question so they immediately are uncomfortable that someone else has. ,childfree,dfvf6dv,10,t5_2qtwb

11687580,0,t3_66rsj7,So much of what you wrote is incredibly relatable for me and Im sure for most others who will read it. I usually interpret these personal pleas from parents as something that says more about the speaker than about myself. Your mom sounds similar to mine and I know that mine has always viewed having grandkids as a reward for successful parenting. My siblings have treated my parents poorly and taken advantage of their generosity but the minute they started popping out grandkids all was forgiven. Ive been the one to help my parents out with moving hospital stays etc. but all I hear in return is that Ive disappointed them with my selfish decisions. I know that my mom has always been wistful about the career and adventures she never got to have though shes always quick to follow it up with but being a mother has been my greatest job and other comments that put down women who insist on being selfish and having careers instead of children. So it sounds like your mom may be approaching this in a similar manner and also blaming herself for the reasons why you arent having kids. I dont have a solid solution for you. My response has been to pull away from my family and give them the smallest role in my life I can without cutting them out completely. There are other issues at hand mom is a tough combo of religious narcissist but stepping away from them has been great for my mental health. I wish you the best on it.

This relationship most likely needs to come to a close swiftly.As long as you are not on the same page about the kid issue you are not in a relationship and should not be doing serious relationship and money things   youre only fuckbuddies.Yes thats harsh to put it that way but you need to understand that the kids thing is not negotiable and youre not in a partnershipLTRmarriage with someone unless you agree on this.Shes already at the time where she should be getting knocked up. At a minimum she needs to go find a partner who wants them like.... this year.Spend a year or so getting to know them get knocked up and have the kid by  years from now.Thats the healthiest and best thing for both her and the kid.If you try to drag this out then realize and end it at  and she finds someone else and then ends up with a disabled kid or is disabledsick or dies from a high risk pregnancy.

11692882,0,t1_dgl5x0w,gt That would be devastatingall youve ever wanted to do is fly planes! And now you cant. And you never will.Ill repeat what I said above..I think a lot of peoples life goals become unattainable through no fault of their own. If its your dream to be an Olympic athlete but you find out at a fairly young age that you have a relatively minor not life threatening heart defect that prevents you from performing at that level..youd be devastated. However you most likely wouldnt be ready to go get a heart transplant your doctor probably wouldnt give you one your medical insurance or in some cases national health insurance probably wouldnt pay for it you probably wouldnt go looking for healthy hearts on the black market or anything nearly that extreme. People looking to have kids will go to extremes and theyre encouraged to on some level. Life is unfair not everyone can get what they want even if they want it with every fiber of their being. In the case of the colorblind guy who wanted to be a pilot there is no alternative flying school thats going to let him be a pilot. In the case of the infertile couple at least there IS an alternative adoption even if it is expensive and inconvenient. I think were all ignoring that there are also other ways to be involved in childrens lives and make a difference.

11695047,0,t1_dgl9znf,I do want to be more clear about the desire for kids. I did spend real time with kids and babies. At the age of  I was helping take care of my niece cause being a mom was too much for my sister and she walked away. I stayed with my other sister after her csection and cared for her daughter every night all night. I have had kids puke in my bed in the middle of the night and tantrums and stores to deal with and I still wanted a baby. I used to purposely hold my friends babies hoping it would rub off or some nonsense. I even had family memebers calling me telling me a dream they had where I was pregnant so I would get all hopefully thinking it was a sign. I am the only adult in my family that plays with the kids. My sister pays to fly me to visit her so I can spend time with my niece on her school vacations and she also visits me in the summer. She is a teenager now and going to Germany and was upset because she was missing summertime with me. So yeah I like kids but time has a funny way of making you see clearly.

11802474,0,t3_687vdq,Depends what dog and what you teach them. I have  dogs. People sometimes ask me what did I do that theyre so calm and well behaved and dont make any troubles.The fact is I did almost nothing. Theyre former foster dogs and I adopted them because theyre cool calm and smart. Theyre short haired maintenance is minimal.Sometimes I foster more normal energetic dogs and while its fun I couldnt adopt them its too much work.I guess answer is  if you wanna dog always get one that is a match for you and your lifestyle. ,childfree,dgxunt6,1,t5_2qtwb

No matter what is your life experience you can be assured there are other people like you.

11804305,0,t3_68e35f,This isnt really a CF problem this is a mental illness problem. She may be targeting you on this topic but its not about that. And discussing CF topics wont make the problem go away because thats not the problem. gt who have mostly unfollowed herDo that. Even if it may be possible to help her IRL. Facebook is NOT the place to hash this out. An it is certainly not the place to cure someone.gt Id be wondering if she needed some counselling.No wondering about it. Shes a victim of rape sex trafficking etc. and is traumatized not to mention the laundry list of other problems. Unless she has been in intensive counseling for years she needs it. Needed it a lot time ago probably before she was . She may have underlying issues such as bipolar etc. that started the entire cascade and the drug abuse could be self medicating for that.Unfortunately this has to be your wifes problem to decide if and what type of help to offer because its her crazy family and you will never get anywhere as an inlaw  you have already seen that her family have gotten nowhere. And ultimately this is a job for the professionals. Neither of you are qualified therapists and even if you were it would be unethical for you to treat her.The best you could ever do is point her in the way of therapy or possibly offer to help with a bit of the cost. Beyond that you cant save someone who is hell bent on burning their life down. The only thing you can do is stay away so you dont end up in the bonfire.Basically Sis I would love to have you in my life but the deal is that you need to seek out treatment for all of the trauma you have suffered. I am not trained to help you and Im at a loss. The only think I can offer to do right now is to help you find the right treatment. I will do some research on therapiststreatment available in your area and email you a list of what I find. I hope that you will take advantage of the treatment available. If you do that please have your therapist contact me when she feels that you are ready to have a respectful loving sisterly relationship again. Until then I am afraid that we can only communicate via email I cannot have you in my home and I do not chose to have any more of these unpleasant phone conversations. You will have that list by next Friday.Something along those lines obviously customzied to the situation. Set boundaries and requirements for her to be in the life of your wife as a sister and only if that goes well do you or your child enter the picture.,childfree,dgy24p3,17,t5_2qtwb
