6861703,0,t3_49oi66,OOC Ill break the ice  and sorry for the too long post I am Ammanea  years old Zabrak female exslave Sith Sorceress. But this says everything and nothing about me.Lets start at the beginning. I was a child when my parents sold me. I do not remember. I do not know on which planet I was born who my parents are and where are they now. I was sold to a wealthy merchant on Dromund Kaas. The first thing I remember clearly is a whip lash across my back. I dont remember what I did to deserve it but I do remember I refused to cry. For this offense not giving the pleasure of my screams I received even more lashes along with shocks from the collar I wore. I remember grinding my teeth until I thought they would break. And red blood on red skinThis was more or less my life for the next fourteen years. I even earned my tattoos on basis of my stubbornness and unwillingness to break. Slave overseer liked to mock me provoke my temper telling me Im so useless that even my parents hated me.I thought naively childishly that that was not the case that there had to be some other explanation. Surely my parents loved me!Until one night. The overseer came looking for me while I was cleaning the courtyard. He was grinning like a madman and extended his hand holding a datapad. Dread came over me as I read. A trade agreement between my parents and my master selling me for a piece of fertile land. It also said they had other children and one less mouth to feed.Shame sorrow desperation Anger. I started crying for the first time in my life and screamed at the top of my lungs my tears mixing with the rain. I screamed my fury into the night sky and sky answered. A lightning hit the overseer incinerating him.In all the chaos after such an accident I managed to slip away find a group of pirates and thugs who agreed to take my collar off and get me off Dromund Kaas. I will not tell the details of this story but one thing I will mention. Over time I realized that if I can say something in a certain tone of voice and wanting it bad enough people would do as I told them. And thats how I survived next two years. Thieving breaking in commanding peopleUntil eventually I ended up on Hutta. My luck was running sour and I was starved tired and cold. And surrounded by a group of thugs with blasters pointed at me. I knew I was going to die but couldnt summon the strength to do anything about it. Suddenly a Chiss appeared pulling out her blasters and saving my life. Her name was Zyrae two years younger than me and a small time bounty hunter dreaming of winning the Great Hunt. She nursed me back to health and I continued living with her for a while. Then the offer came for her to participate in Great Hunt. I couldnt leave her I owed her too much. That night I invited her and her friend for a drink to celebrate. That saved her life. Had she been with her crew she would have ended up like them. Dead. I swore to help her. Together we killed the murderer of her mentor. From that moment on we became sisters. We stole a ship. I wanted to go and find some isolated mining planet but Zi was insistent that no one would look on Dromund Kaas. I reluctantly agreed. But inside I felt bad because her money from the bounties is what kept me alive so I decided to return to my old habits thieving. But I choose the wrong mark. The woman I was about to rob was a pureblood Sith warrior.Achlyse for that was the Siths name caught me as I was trying to use my will on her. She grabbed my hand and literally dragged me through the streets to her stronghold. There she explained I am Force sensitive and that my talents could be put to better use. I became a slave again doing all the chores with additional duties of studying. I despised her for putting me in that position and myself for being caught and made slave again. Gradually I came to realize that my slave duties were what Achlyse considered good for building a character and in hopes of awakening and channeling my anger. In time we came to grudgingly respect one another.  She wasnt cruel for the sake of cruelty or vindictive. She was arrogant stubborn and boastful and often we would butt heads but she never ordered me punished. Eventually it became clear she could teach me nothing as my skill set lay elsewhere.  It was only as I was entering the shuttle to Korriban that it occurred to me how much I came to view this scary pureblood as a mother I never knew.,TheDarkbladeCovenant,d0u30ud,2,t5_3ctj7
6872498,0,t3_49oi66,My name is Argavus  years oldSith halfblood male former slave sith sorccerer.I was born on Dromund Kaas i was given the name Masayr after my father my mother was a sith pureblood who had an affair with a mighty human sith lord who liked to dissobey the dark counsil one to many times.When i was  year old my father was called to the dark counsil and was exiled from the sith order.Stripped of his title reputation and all his wealth he saw no other option then to sell me and my mother to a local slaver.My owner originaly refused to buy me of fear that when i come of age my force powers will become his undoing.After multiple negotiations and price drops i was sold off and seperated from my mother.When i became  years old my owner decided to put me in the mines with the slaves that dared to rebel against him to mine all the valuables that were to find down there. I was whipped on a daily basis and every month i was beaten down to near death. The guards alway told me that if i did not got back up that i would die.These tortures that i had to endure became essential to my survival And after  years of being whipped and now also on a daily basis beaten i became hardend and determined to break free and free the others and kill my owner.As is usual with the sith species my force powers began to manifest themselves always hearing the stories from other slaves who were old war veterans who served with the sith i became facinated or as some would call obsessed with the force lightning technique.Ive spend two years perfecting my technique and rallying everyone down in the mines to stand together against our owner. When the time came i lead my people to the surface killing every guard that stood in our way.Then i came to the surface seeing the sun for the first time in  years. I was nearly blinded by the lights and it became nearly our downfall. But while i was blinded i unleashed a great force storm killing everyone near me. Ive killed over half of my own rebels and never felt any remorse to this day.When we came to the compound i told everyone to guard the main hall as i wanted to kill him myself. But i chose one person to acompany me a captured bounty hunter named Kaymar he became my best friend in the time we spend down there as we were of the same age. Together we burst into the master bedroom to find our now former owner being busy with a young female slave. Having seized one of the blasters Kaymar shot him in the knees incapacitating him.I held off on killing him for now to find out the name of the slaver who sold me to him. After only a few seconds of torture with my force lightning he told me his name.After taking my time slowly killing him and freeing the rest of the slaves Kaymar offered his help in finding my mother to repay me for freeing him.Together we tracked down the slaver on Dromund Kaas and forced him to tell us where my mother was.We travled to Nar Shadda where my mother worked as a prostitue to one of the Hutts when we found out the brothel she was staying in we burst into the room only to find a strange man sitting next to the corpse of my mother.The man revealed himself to be my father Masayr sr. and told me he heared about me escaping and trying to find my mother.Angered i unleashed a lightning strike using all of my strength but it was to no avail he pierced me with his lightsaber and left me to die next to my own mother.I awoke in a medical centre seeing Kaymar sitting next to me who was able to hide from my father and save my life by carrying me to a healing tank. After some weeks i was healed up and said my goodbyes to Kaymar who told me i should go to Korriban to enroll in the sith academy to learn to control my powers and become stong enough to enact my revenge.I enrolled into the sith academy under the name Argavus telling them i was a fullblood sith with my fathers name being Argavos another sith pureblood who as i later found out that he was my older brotherAfter another  years as an acolyte and a apprentice to a weak sith lord i became a lord of myself and started to track down my father who went in exsile with the jedis.Two years have passed and i came across another sith pureblood by the name of Arvacon who iniated me into The Darkblade Covenant promising me power beyond my wildest dreams an the resourses to finally find and kill my father.Sorry for the long post i just had to much fun with this and i just kept going either way i hope you enyoed my little backstory,TheDarkbladeCovenant,d0vb5qb,1,t5_3ctj7
