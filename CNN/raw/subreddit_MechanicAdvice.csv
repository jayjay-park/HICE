3076,0,t3_1u5rlu,gt What exactly does it needs a new crank kit bottom end mean?  Could this actually be the issue or just a engines ruined copout answer?  Is this sort of thing fixable and if so is it worth fixing performance and pricewise?There are several things going on here. When a mechanic talks about the bottom end of an engine hes referring to the crankshaft and its associated bushings.  The crankshafts job is to take the energy created in the combustion chamber on top of the piston and transfer it into rotational motion so that your transmission and subsequently wheels can use it. So the simple answer is that bottom end damage is usually a death knell for your average engine because of the amount of labor involved to tear the engine down. Also its a liability. Its a time consuming job that can too easily go wrong and fast. Installing a new motor is the cheaper quicker less likely to bite you in the ass method of repair.,MechanicAdvice,ceesdrf,1,t5_2tkvu

9766,0,t1_cefjdsd,Before you start just turn the key to the on position you should hear the fuel pump working.  If it is not check the relay.  The relay will be in the fuse panel in the engine compartment pretty sure the relays are  US so not too expensive.  If this does not fix the problem you could be looking at a failed engine control relay which is behind the dash or even worse a failing ecm.  If the fuel pump is working you could be having problems with your coil packs.  If you know how to check for spark try it if not dont.  It can shock you good.  ,MechanicAdvice,cefjpgz,2,t5_2tkvu

113836,0,t1_cer3tch,The only time Id ever run a straight  weight is if you have a carefully monitored oil temperature and heater to maintain the oil temperature at at least  C while the engine is off.  A dual weight oil is an oil that is formulated to work in a wide range of temperatures.  The first number indicates a minimum pour point low temperature meaning the lowest temperature it will still pour at a specific rate.  The second number tells you how fast it pours at  C.  The higher the first number the higher the lowest temperature is. lower number is colder range  The higher the second number the more viscous it is at  C.  Using a straight  weight instead of a dual weight w does nothing but make starting harder and reduce protection until the oil is warm.If you do feel your clearances are getting wide and you think it would it be good idea to switch to a more viscous oil try a w or a w.

Some people think they are optional and toss them. If it is vacuum assisted may be the line is bad or missing or it might need adjusting.

We took off the carb to see what it looked like and if it was leaking and the whole thing was a mess. The secondary and primary choke let off didnt want to work the coil spring on the choke itself was rusted and somehow bent the best was the front of the carb wasnt sealed well to the intake and was corroded. The intake also had some rust on it as well. There was also several different kinds of screws used on the top and I think they messed up the threads. All in all it was terrible. The edelbrock was much cheaper. What we ended up doing was taking it off and cleaning off the intake with carb cleaner and a right angle die grinderpolisher. The local stores had the edelbrock  and the adapter plate for the install. Both bolted right up with no issue. The couple things that are did have to work around are the compression fitting for the gas line didnt come with the right parts and we spent three hours and went to  stores looking for one. What we ended up doing as a quick fix was just putting the soft line over the hardline and used to hose clamps. Edelbrock didnt put the right size nipple in the box. They put two of the same one in.   The other issue we ran into was the transmission kick down switch. That was fixed by using the edelbrock nitrous microswitch and bracket. I dont think I have any clearance issues and it started right up. We will adjust the mixes a bit but it runs way way better.I can send some pics of the install if you want.

And they seem to be built a little simpler than German stuff.

1173596,0,t1_ci1na0t,As long as the vehicle isnt overheating or you arent noticing any other Ill effects no. However if it is the fan assembly it will eventually fail in some manner due to the wear and tear associated with the contact thats making that noise. How long it may take is anyones guess. I would take it to the shop you had the motor repaired at and see if theyll take a look at it in good will. They may offer to work with you if its obvious theres an issue that was created during the fan motor replacement. If they dont help out keep driving the car. Just keep an eye on the engine temp in the meantime especially while stopped as thats the time the fan is needed the most since there isnt any air moving through the radiator normally supplied by the car itself moving through air. Last quick note im more apt to say that this is the fan due to the intermittent nature if the problem. If it was a bad pulley water pump or ac compressor you wouldnt notice the sound come and go the way you described. If you want try starting the car in the morning with the hood open. After it warms up may take  min the engine will get hot enough for the fan to kick on. If you notice the sound start at that time you have your answer. ,MechanicAdvice,ci1nehh,2,t5_2tkvu

You could remove the button and if its a twowire switch just jump it. If jumping it works you need a switch. If jumping it doesnt work the wire is broken between the switch and fusebox.

1476387,0,t3_2b3506,Check the seal where the trunk meets the body of the vehicle. The back glass could also be to blame. Look for areas of rust at the channel around the glass. Dont rule out the possibility of rust. When you drive it around in wet conditions a rust hole somewhere in the floor pan of the vehicle may allow water to enter the trunk. Itd be a good idea to remove everything from your trunk and then lay out a few towels. The next time it rains go and pop the trunk. See which towels are wet. Thatll give you an idea of where the leak might be coming from. It could even be the tail lights. There are large openings in the back of the car if the tail lights are removed and there are usually foam or plasticrubber seals that are sandwiched between the plastic lights and the metal body of the vehicle. Those seals mightve gotten crusty over the last  years. ,MechanicAdvice,cj1c9j5,5,t5_2tkvu

2095776,0,t3_2iwqsp,Is it idling low? If so the Idle Air Control valve may be dirty or inoperative. Is the check engine light on? A small backfire from the exhaust may mean the car is running too rich. Look at the pressure regulator on the fuel rail where the injectors live and remove the vacuum line that goes to it. It usually has a red nylon vacuum line but Ive seen other colors. Turn the key to run not start and check that its not spewing fuel. There also should be a schrader valve on the rail that would allow you to test fuel pressure. In this case if you dont get fuel from the regulator nipple you may not be getting fuel at all. turn the key from off to run and you should hear the fuel pump run for about  seconds. If you dont hear a sound then likely the pump went south. The schrader valve will confirm this if you push the pintle in the valve and no fuel comes out.

2352395,0,t1_cm2c3yb,No they shouldnt. The one on the tire is the maximum that the tire can handle. The one in the door jamb is what the car is designed to use. Over inflating by  psi is safe enough. It will even increase your fuel economy a bit but you will pay for it in other ways. For example my car is rated  psi  kpa on the door jamb but the tire is rated  psi  kpa. So as you can see those numbers arent similar there is quite a gap. Heres another example. Say youre a  pound man and you have a headache. The pack of mg Advil says take two every  hours or  mg per day for someone of your size. But your doctor knowing your health personally tells you to only take one every  hours or mg per day so you dont damage your liver.

2470595,0,t3_2nt9sw,  Sorry for the wall of text there are a lot of things to consider in the hiring process and it is hard to condense them into a couple of lines.   You can take entire courses in hiring practices.   If you were pleased with the skills and abilities of the tech that just left and you are still on good terms you may want to consider asking him to help interview job applicants that you feel have potential. You admit to not being technically savvy and trying to judge someones technical abilities when you have none yourself will make evaluation difficult and likely inaccurate.   For example the question regarding idle on a speed density FI system mentioned elsewhere in this thread actually has several other possible correct answers besides the one given so relying on one question like that can result in missing out on a very qualified tech who can explain in great detail all the nuances of the system and provide other possible causes for the symptom in favor of one that chooses the right guess.    Create a formal hiring and interview process that provides for evaluation of the candidates by more than just one person.  Larger companies and institutions take this approach all the time.   For example I was invited to sit on a hiring committee for a technical school automotive instructor one time my job was solely to assess the technical ability of the applicant.   Other members with different backgrounds were there to assess their ability to work under pressure how they might integrate into the existing faculty their attitude toward safety and other factors.   Even the receptionist out in the waiting room was part of the process she was secretly scoring applicants on how they behaved while in the waiting area and how they treated her as a female in a technical school environment.   Let your ex lead tech evaluate their technical skills.  Choose a member of your existing crew to sit in and evaluate how well they might fit into the team.   Perhaps have a friend someone that you know who is involved in hiring or HR at another company or a  long time trusted customer sit in and evaluate their customer relations skills.  Having been involved in hiring techs for many years a few suggestions I have are   As others have suggested consider promoting from within first as long as there is someone in the shop that has the necessary skills and is interested in the position.   Not giving a qualified existing employee a chance at the position can cause some degree of resentment and morale issues within the company.   At least discuss it with anyone you already employ and explain why you are going to advertise the position and ask if they have any input or concerns.  A good manager is a team builder and this requires taking into consideration any concerns other people on the team may have. Require some sort of formal credentials especially if this is a supervisory position.   OE manufacturer certifications ASE credentials technical school AA or BS degree along with any others that may be needed such as a refrigerant handling certification state mechanics license inspection mechanic license or state emissions inspector license if any of them apply to your area.  For a supervisory or team leader position a few years of supervisory experience would be very helpful as well.   While experience is important it also is not everything.  A guy who has been a mechanic for  years but who has no formal training might be able to change tires and brakes OK but is probably going to have no idea how to troubleshoot a complex body control or computer networking issue and cars are becoming exponentially more complex every year.   Also an important part of this job is having the ability to sit down at a computer terminal and locate the information you need and to teach yourself new systems or procedures on the spot.  Nobody knows everything and learning on the fly is essential.  That being said rely on references and your gut feelings just as much.   I have hired many guys with impressive paper credentials that turned out later to be complete unskilled idiots when it came to actual hands on repair work.   We hired a guy once with a degree from UTI and an impressive k tool set that could not change a tire or a serpentine belt without help even after  weeks on the job.  Some tech schools even well known ones are diploma mills where almost anyone that sits there for  years paying tuition walks out with a degree always request the students transcript from the school.  the transcript will give you a more accurate indication of what kind of student this person was.   Someone that aced all his courses will usually make a better diagnostic tech than someone that just scraped by with a minimal passing grade and no extra work completed.     This is where your ex tech can be helpful in the interview process the guys in the shop can usually pick up on this kind of thing much quicker than management does.  Avoid anyone that seems to job hop constantly.  If an applicant has worked at  shops in the last  years there is some issue.As you know employers try hard to retain valued members of their work force someone who changes jobs every year or so likely either has some kind of personal issues or an inability to produce consistent expected revenue for the business. Have a required basic tool list for employment and strictly enforce it.    Ask the guys in the shop to help create this.   Nothing slows a shop down more or creates more resentment than a guy who decides to borrow someone elses torque wrench or mm socket day after day instead of buying his own.    If you require a  ftlb impact gun and a brake lining gauge to work there and they show up the first day without it send them home until they get one.   Make it very clear that they are expected to keep their tool set updated as new things are needed.  Enforcing this policy will have a noticeable positive impact on shop productivity. Place high priority on finding someone who shows maturity and good people skills as well as technical ability.    This person will probably be interacting with your customers and answering the phone as well as turning wrenches.   They also will be interacting constantly with the existing employees.  If you hire someone that screws off when you are not around who cannot explain technical issues to a non technical customer so that they understand it who has no concept of flat rate labor times or who annoys other guys in the shop by making messes is moody or who offends people regularly then you are going to have problems.   Look for someone who has a desire to learn who does not mind going to training classes and seminars to keep his skills updated.   If the last training they attended was  or  years ago despite having opportunities to do so their skills are going to become outdated very rapidly. Do not jump at the first person that looks promising.   It is better to leave the job vacant for a while than to hire someone that is not a good fit for the position.   Advertise the job creatively and make it clear you are looking for top notch people with credentials experience and a comprehensive professional tool set.  If you pay a dollar an hour above the prevailing rate in your area or offer a performance based commission or bonus   as part of your compensation package that often helps to lure more qualified applicants. iAtn.net os a good place to advertise open positions.   The Snapon and other tool guys who service your shop get into every shop in town and are an often overlooked resource.   They usually know who in your area is competent and not happy where they are currently employed they also have some idea who is or isnt doing a good job in another shop if you need references.  Get to know the instructors at the nearest technical college to you.  Often they are able to provide leads for qualified graduates when you have a position open.   It gets you a better quality of applicant than the usual I changed a couple engines in my garage at home and changed my own oil for years kind of respondant. If you hire someone and it turns out to be a mistake get rid of them quickly.   Most people do not change much.   One of the biggest mistakes we have made over the years in our shop is giving new people many repeated chances to change behaviors that make them not fir in or to try to retrain someone that has bad work habits or who turns out to not have the required skills for the job.  It is very easy to allow yourself to be sucked into the trap of wanting to help someone become something they are not but this comes at the expense of your company.   If someone cannot do the job to expectations or causes issues in the shop fire them quickly and reopen the job to someone that might be a better fit and make you more money.,MechanicAdvice,cmh2bzs,3,t5_2tkvu

2724617,0,t3_2r9iy4,hmm.. the knock sensor is tested at the end of the KOER test when you are suppose to GOOSE the throttle...  this is a FLIP the throttle wide open for about a half second.. the engine cannot accelerate to WOT rpms.. but it will get to  or so. during this goose test.. the ECM will advance the timing and listen for the PING .. you can hear it usually Ping a few times during that fraction of a second.. lets look at the idle speed issue.. and you may need a new idle speed control.. they do wear out somehow..  unplug the idle speed control motor with the engine warmed up fully and the engine should drop to a fairly slow idle speed..  depending on your mileage.. you could have a vacuum leak.. dirty throttle body boresblades.. worn throttle shaft bores.. rarely happens.. takes a LOT of miles..   leaking vacuum hoses. incorrect PCV valve.. broken pcv valve.. especially on the . motors its almost impossible to get them out without loosening the upper plenum on the intake manifold.. there are several issues that can cause the Idle air control to go wide open sometimes.. do you have a hand held digital volt meter ... if so.. run this test..  you will also want to find the ground wirebraided strap from the back of the engine to the firewall.. if test  is high.. that needs to be cleaned..  i will look at the info and give you more tests and things to check.. on to the other systems. ..EDIT.. you  need to measure with your digital volt meter the red wire into the Idle air control.. for close to full battery voltage..  you can measure the red wire to the other wire or other wire to ground to see what the computer is commanding.. it does this on the Negative side.. you will also want to measure the TPS ground connection to the block with the engine running and with the key on engine off.. measure the TPS voltage.. that it sweeps evenly.. without spikes.. i will have to dig out some numbers for you for the TPS voltage.. END EDIT.. now for the EGR issue... attach a vacuum hose directly to the EGR valve and open it using suction.. yes.. you can do it.. it should open..   if you have a hand held vacuum gauge.. you can TEE into the line to the EGR valve.. stick the gauge up on the windshield and take it for a test drive.. you should see the vacuum gauge move up close to  inches of vacuum at  to  MPH during light to moderate acceleration.. that will indicate that the EGR vacuum system is functioning..   the red hose is manifold vacuum to the vacuum reservoir . but it goes thru a check valve on a single fitting vacuum reservoir..  some models have a dual fitting vacuum reservoir.. that has a build in check valve..    the green hose is EGR control.. the EGR solenoid actually pulses vacuum signal to the EGR valve...  the three wire device on top measures how far the egr valve opens .. this is the dual vacuum connection reservoir..  ..  here is the much more complicated looking but functionally identical vacuum diagram for the single vacuum fitting reservoir.. both of those look COMPLEX... follow the vacuum.. starts at the Manifold connection..  goes to the vacuum reservoir and all three bottom ports on the solenoid..  each solenoid pulses vacuum to each of the controlled devices..  when the solenoids are OFF.. blocking the vacuum.. the hose to the device is  vented.. so the ecm can modulate or just turn on and off the vacuum.. usually the EGR is the only one modulated.. print or copy my text.. so you can go over it one section at a time.. why the voltage drop test..  the computer is grounded to the body.. the engine sits on rubber mounts.. without proper grounding you can have different voltages on the ground side.. this gives the computer incorrect info.. you will find after getting your EGR functioning. you will get better fuel economy also. ,MechanicAdvice,cnds08v,2,t5_2tkvu

Cupping on the rear of vws is caused by toe being miss adjusted. As for the cam follower it should have a warranty extension until  on your motor. If it fails vw will replace anything that breaks because of it up to and including the motor.

3118990,0,t3_2vvbxp,Lots of tire shops will have a guy that does nothing but alignments. He gets paid a certain amount per alignment.

In his fury he didnt want to spend any more time on the vehicle so he was rushing and just threw the tire in the trunk and didnt wash his hands. These are the guys i hate. They give us a bad name He could have left something loose on the rear suspension when he was aligning it. Its best to have it checked out.  Something to keep in mind is BMW has very specific requirements for an alignment. The car needs to be emptied of contents. The fuel level needs to be within a certain range and specified weights are placed in the vehicle before aligning. Most tire shops wont have  this stuff. Mostly because you can still align it without them but it wont be to BMW specs. ,MechanicAdvice,cola6tq,9,t5_2tkvu

Only way it could is being so far off that gas was getting past the Pistons and into the oil thinning it out leading to a spun bearing but from what you said you only drove it  miles so I dont see how that could have happened in so short a time.Only other small possibility is that somehow the oil pump wasnt working  properly afterwards which could easily cause bearing failure in  miles but I dont know that vehicle well enough to say for sure if thats a possibility.Its unlikely but if your persistent enough ask for the dealer to help pay part of the repair since it only made it  miles from theyre facility and the tech never test drove it and perhaps could have caught the issue before it became so big.,MechanicAdvice,cpjllbi,0,t5_2tkvu

3470107,0,t3_2zz1x8,P is a catalyst efficiency code. The code is trying to tell you that the cat is not working anymore. Swapping the exhaust behind the cat typically will have no effect or bearing on this code unless the rear O sensor location has been improperly modified. If you have a decent scanner that can watch the data you will probably see that the wave form for the downstream O follows along the waveform from the upstream one. This indicates  things that usually the cat is not restricted and that the downstream O is working properly. You likely have to replace the cat on Bank  but you might also look in to having a carbon clean done with some Seafoam brand cleaner. Sometimes the cats wont work because of a buildup of oil deposits on the ceramic substrate causing the cat to be ineffective.,MechanicAdvice,cpntf8l,1,t5_2tkvu

3705816,0,t1_cqeoa9d,When you turn on the key you should hear a momentary rrrrr sound from the back of the car that is the intank fuel pump priming the system to pressurize the fuel system.If your turn on the key and its dead silent and then the car does not start then the fuel pump or main relay would be first guesses or  the ignition switch may be bad but doubt it.If we assume that we have fuel pressure based on hearing the fuel pump prime then the next stop is air so inspect air fiter and look for disconnected vacuum lines or other real obvious intake air leaks. And third stop is spark. A bad distributor bearing or the ignition module in the distributor Honda calls the module the ignitor can cause nospark. Also if the timing belt is actually at the point of missing teeth the car wont start consistently since the ignition timing will be way off.Of course if the plugswires have K on them that could be causing hard starting as well due to weak spark.

3830978,0,t3_348s5u,God yours is about as nonspecific that car problems can get. There could be a multitude of things causing that...Id start with electrical. Is your battery in good condition? Test by using a voltmeter on the batt terminals. Should read near v with the car off and around .v running. A combination of bad or just discharged battery along with an alternator on the way out could cause intermittent voltage drops especially when slowing down  when your revs drop so does your alternators output. Voltage drops too much and there isnt enough to run the spark plungs causing the engine to stutter or die.,MechanicAdvice,cqsypx1,1,t5_2tkvu

3903081,0,t3_355e4c,you can do it in several ways...  yes.. you can use jack stands to safely support the rear wheels off the ground..   a decent driver can probably perform the  to  mph shot.. with the the transmission in drive or over drive..  please dont have crew behind the tires..this is the vehicle speed sensor..   its bolted to the side of the transmission tail housing. there is a different version that is only  bucks..  either will work.. see the shaft..  with a chunk of rubber hose over a reversed drill bit in a variable speed drill one can spin that shaft and make the speedometer move with the key on..  the engine probably does not have to be running.. this  at autozone or thru wellsve is the connector for it.. with some scotch taps.. disconnecting the stock sensor.. adding the wire taps to an extended  and plugging in a speed sensor.. it can turn in either direction.. a variable speed drill should be able to spin it fast enough to do your speed changes needed  hint.. wrap the power drill in a beach towel to keep it quiet.. or extend the wires a few feet..... if there is a tiny video camera set up and a monitor for the drill operator to view.. it should be fairly easy to perform.  hopefully that car is not equipped with an  MPH max  speedo.  at that point a rewrite will be needed..many many years ago.. i worked at a paint store in hollywood on the same block as pinks. .. they sent me out to warner brothers burbank.. special delivery to the dukes of hazard stage..  i was drooling all over the general lees.. i was going to check them out after i made the delivery.. as i am turning to leave.. the crew parts at the large door on the stage.. a pair of german shepherds walk in followed closely by Cathrine Bach in costume.  i did not even remember to look at the general lees parked around the sound stage when i left.   for all those who watched the show.. if you think she was pretty on tv. she was stunning in person. how the wiring works.. one has a current limited  volts.. one has ground.. as the shaft rotates it causes the sensor to drag the  volts to  volt then releases back to  volts. this pulse is counted in the either the speedometer head or the ecm to make the speedo move..  so its almost no voltage and no chance of getting shocked ..  and probably a LOT safer than spinning wheels. ,MechanicAdvice,cr16osy,3,t5_2tkvu

3905462,0,t1_cr1fqk3,Shame wish I could bring my garage with me to schoolLiterally just copying my last comment. Its pretty long but I had a few questions at the end.Something like this?Or would this be better?Broke ass college student so I was just trying to avoid having to buy something else.Tangent So dont really waste your time reading kinda ranting Ill just put the few questions in there at the end.I have a lot of the stuff I need at home rotors pads grease etc. but I am going to be driving through the mountains quite a bit over the next week and wanted new rotors because my old ones are warped.I had my brakes done last year but the shop FUBARed it. They torqued the wheels to gt lb ft where my torque wrench maxes out but it was probably closer to  and according to the service writer it sounded like the rotors warped at the hub is that even a thing?. Hell I had to buy a . foot breaker bar to get the wheels off. According to the tech at the local firestone the rotors were just warped while I loathe having to go to a chain like that they were the only ones with an oncar lathe. The tech was actually really knowledgeable he let me stand there and watch everything and was chatting the whole time. He drove a  STi and used to work for a local tuner shop and knew his stuff about the WRXs. After he did a test drive and used a dial gauge he said that all the rotors were warped. He also told me that although they could try to cut the rotors it was possible that it would not work plus in the mountains they would overheat much faster. He said the  to turn them could turn into  to replace them if it fell below the discard. At this point he actually pulled me outside of the shop and flat out said Our rates for brake jobs are a rip off. Call this guy he is one of the best tuners in the area and can take care of you for half the cost. and he palmed me the dudes card.So for the second time in  miles I am having to replace the rotors.For now I am just going to replace the rear because they probably are actually warped I did not replace them on the last brake job because they were within spec. I am only planning on disassembling the front and making sure that none of the pins are sticking this shop has been so wildly inept I dont trust them not to have fucked that up. Im going to use some steel wool and go over the rotors and hope that it was just pad deposits that is the problem.Actual QuestionsIs it possible for a rotor to warp at the hub?If it did warp the rotor at the hub should I be concerned about my hub itself warping?As stupid as this sounds I am going to put the rear pads on a belt sander and reuse them. We measured them when the guy let me into the bay and they have only used . mm of the pad from new. I would prefer not to spend  on new pads when I have some at home unfortunately my family cant actually find them in my parts stockpile. Is there any reason as to why I should not do this? Obviously if its a major safety issue I will replace them but I am just trying to get this fixed as cheaply as possible. Would using steel wool be the best way to try and get deposits off of the front rotors? Is there something else that would do the job better? Sorry for the wall of text.,MechanicAdvice,cr1gglj,1,t5_2tkvu

3950809,0,t3_35p42m,The charging system in all modern BMWs is regulated by the vehicles computer system. As batteries get older they begin to lose their ability to hold a charge as effectively as they did before. The computer in your BMW regulates the system to charge your battery more or less aggressively depending on the batterys age. Naturally it will charge in older battery more aggressively than a newer one. If you just swap out the battery without notifying the computer it can set off red flags in the system which will stall your car and give you in error via your dashboard. Or it could think that the old battery is still installed and continue charging your new one with the same aggressive manner that it was charging your old battery. This will cause the system to overcharge and therefore kill your new battery fairly quickly. Installing the battery itself is not very difficult however in order to reset the computer you need to have the proper software. While sometimes the dealership is the only one to have it depending on where you live there may be automotive shops that specialize in BMWs and other German cars that may also have the software. Naturally they will also charge you a fee for the reprogramming however I doubt that it will be nearly as steep as the stealership. It may be worth it to call around and see. Bmw being a fairly popular performance machine if you live in a highly populated area you might find a few places. For instance here in southeastern Virginia we have Active Autowerks in Virginia Beach and Auto Envy in Chesapeake. Finding the shops can sometimes be as simple as looking through your phone book or visiting a bmw forum bimmerforumbimmerfest. The third option is to find and get the software yourself. Usually you need an adapter cable that will run from your laptop to your OBD port as well as the software. From there its a matter of learning the software and doing the reset yourself. This can be fairly straightforward or rather difficult depending on how good you are with computers. keep in mind that while the program itself can tend to be fairly expensive provided you get out through legal means wink wink nudge nudge. It is actually very powerful in helping you diagnose problems with your vehicle and running checks to make sure that everything is working properly. If Im not mistaken it should also still be cheaper than taking your car to the dealership. If you plan on keeping the car for a long time or plan on having multiple BMWs with iDrive getting and learning the software might be a good idea as it can save you a lot of money and headache in the long run.

4016365,0,t3_36gq7o,I hope OP reads this everything everyone said is true.  Its a decent price it cleans the valves the intake the injectors the throttle.  All these things should be done especially on direct injection cars.  If you dont do it regularly do not I repeat do not do it.  It should be done every k miles on your car.  If you go k before you do it as so many people do it will clean excessive amounts of carbon out of your system which will then find their way into your EGR system and you will be spending further money to clean that and you wont have a choice then because your car will run like dogshit.  In conclusion do it its very worth it but only if youre under k and plan on doing it regularly.   If youre over k ask them how much they would charge to clean the MAF and Throttle body and leave the rest alone then add your own fuel additive to your gas tank which will more slowly clean your induction system so as to not overwhelm the small EGR passages.Edit  Do not attempt to do a full  step on your own very stupid idea.  Let a professional do it that way if he screws it up which can easily  happen and your motor is toast youre not on the hook for it.  They are.

Just make sure youve got replacement nuts and bolts as the stuff thats on there now is probably little more than a blob of rust.The noise coming out of the tire could be a few things.  The first thing Id look at would be featheredchoppy tire wear on that one corner.  Google Images can show you exactly what Im talking about.  If its there I would imagine that it was a result of driving with a bad bearing which would allow the wheel to flop back and forth as youre driving.  Not in any large way of course nothing that youd be able to see with the naked eye but you get the idea.  You could try rotating the front tires to the back to see if the problem goes away.If the problem persists that would rule out the tires as a possible culprit assuming that the rear tires have worn flat.  Further it would point to having a possibly defective bearing.  One thing Ive learned over the years is that just because a part is new doesnt mean that its any good.  Another test for a bad bearing would be to jack the truck up so that the front wheel is off the ground then grab the coil spring and spin the wheel.  If you feel roughness youve got a bad bearing.  Its hard to explain exactly what the vibration feels like its similar to a cell phone set on vibrate going off in your hand.  Hopefully its the tire as thats an easier repair.,MechanicAdvice,crn1e6w,2,t5_2tkvu

4104070,0,t3_37n0zi,want to find the issue.. start like this. parking brake set hard.. friend you trust in the drivers seat.. drivers window down. reach thru the open window and wobble the steering wheel back and forth..  how much can you wobble it before the left front tire reacts???   look carefully to see that the body is not moving left and right before the tire reacts.  under the hood.. examine the steering box mounting as the steering wheel is wobbled just past the limit of the freeplay. it should NOT be loose.. it should NOT be rocking. .  lay down under the front.. head toward the driver side. examine the shaft coming out of the bottom of the steering box. is there any side to side play?   look at the various steering linkage ends starting at the pitman arm..   one part should not move before the part its attached to..  you will also want to look at the track bar bracket and the upper end of the track bar.. that should also not have any play in it.    flip around and look at the passenger side of the steering linkage.  you should not see any play.. track bars have come loose and worn the mounting holes into an oval.. the brackets have come loose on the frame.. the bushings and tie rod ends on it have worn and allowed play.. you may also want to put your hands on each connection after you have watched it wiggle to see if you feel any movementplay.. you can also feel the noise thru your fingers sometimes. ball joints.. wheel bearing assemblies can also fail.. squeek.. clunk.. this is the beginning of every examination i do on various jeeps and other xs with straight axles.  and twin traction beams. ,MechanicAdvice,cro37ia,1,t5_2tkvu

4537170,0,t3_3d7enc,I recommend doing some reading up and deciding for yourself what turbo will best suit your needs especially if youre considering going new. Its a pretty good technical article on choosing the perfect turbo for your application. Anyone can tell you to grab a T Garret turbo from so and so model year but youll have a lot less problems tuning it in the end if you really do your homework. The problems that youre likely to run into by just picking a random turbo are going to be airfuel ratio while on boost as some of these turbos reach peak boosts at different times and youll want that peak boost to match your shifting rpm. You run into problems with oversized turbos and excessive lag often once it does end up reaching peak boost you can lean out very quickly causing a ton of damage throughout the engine. I also assume that youre going to want to slap this on and want the tuning to be more or less easy. Since your vehicle uses a mass airflow sensor you will have a lot more margin for error when it comes to throwing a turbo at it. The computer on your Disco will be able to compensate the airfuel ratio to an extent. So you would at least be able to drive it to a shop with a dyno and get the tune really dialed in. ,MechanicAdvice,ct2ji2w,2,t5_2tkvu

4647333,0,t3_3elq3l,The engine alongside the greater responsibility of producing useful power is essentially a vacuum pump bringing air into the cylinders in the largest quantities the intake system can provide. If the air filter is clogged that potential ceiling is lower and the engine must work harder to draw in the same air quantities available with a clean filter. Since the majority of electronic fuel injection systems are wired to provide cosistent power delivery they will respond by using a richer or more fuelintensive airtofuel ratio rather than allow the filter to causecreate lackluster acceleration. In other words you wont notice anything behind the wheel choking hesitation etc unless the filter is really really clogged but you will notice it at the pump.,MechanicAdvice,ctgcz1o,3,t5_2tkvu

4713997,0,t3_3fhkin,Sounds like several problems. A transmission reluctant to properly change gears in a honda Civic may be the result of a worn or failing clutch master cylinder or clutch slave cylinder. But the transmission coming out of gear while driving is pretty telltale as to a transmission with worn parts inside. Parts that would require a very difficult teardown and rebuild. Personally if it were my Honda I would go to the local picknpull there is  here and get one from them literally  exchange. Make sure it is full of the proper Honda trans fluid. Now If your still interested in fixing a car that has a KBB value of good  and very good  I think there are other problems causling your car to stall. Starting with the easy stuff would be state of tune. Plugs wires cap and rotor fuel filter air filter and any other easy to check and replace items. Inspect andor replace. I would be real interested to see why its stalling and not running. Usually an engine isnt running because of one of three general things no spark no fuel or no compression. An interesting test on a nonrunning engine is a shot of spray carb cleaner down the intake. If it still dosent run could be ignition or compression related. Next step would be to examine ignition componets and see if your getting spark or not. Literally pull one of the spark plug boots off have someone crank over the car and watch for a spark to come out the end of the spark plug boot. Rest the spark plug boot on a good ground DO NOT HOLD IN YOUR HAND! Itll shock the dog jesus out of you if you get hit by the spark. Also a lot of parts stores rent compression testers. A good way to get a feel for the internal condition of your engine. Research online what proper readings should be for your engine. If the engine does run briefly on the spray carb cleaner but dies soon afterward the problem may be fuel related. Reasons fuel may not be getting into the engine may include clogged fuel filter bad fuel pump bad fuel pump relay or a bad PCM powertrain control module not opening the fuel injectors.  A bad fuel pressure regulator will also keep an engine from running but generally thats not intermittent. You kinda have to take it from there. Narrow down where the failure is then take to the internet like your already doing.... GOOD LUCK! ,MechanicAdvice,ctoql2w,4,t5_2tkvu

4811730,0,t3_3gq2po,This sound is most likely the rear diff fluid.  The good news is that it wont cost a lot to fix.  The CRV uses a unique rear differential that uses hydraulic pressure created by a difference in wheel speed to apply clutches and provide realtime wd.  Because the system is unique the fluid is also special  its called Dual Pump FluidOver time this fluid wear out.  The result is a moaning type sound from the rear when the rear axles are moving at different speeds.  The easiest way to verify this is to turn the wheel all the way to the right or left and drive in tight circles.  You will hear the noise as loud and as clear as can be.  The fix is to flush out the old fluid.  To do this you have to drain the fluid refill it then drive in some tight circles......then drain the fluid again refill it and drive in tight circles.....then drain it and refill it one more time.

4822468,0,t1_cu2eaex,Im curious who sells you a lifetime brake warranty and how much it costs. You may have found a good deal in this case some warranties are way too good when the store doesnt expect you to use them.Ive actually had decent luck hiring guys on Cl but like I said hard to screen for personality you get along with. That being said I suppose if a guy has the tools to do the job hoists wrenches etc it would probably be a decent screening method. Part of what you are paying for in a contractor is tool rental anyway after you factor in the cost of tool rental for the day the actual guy is probably less than half the cost. ,MechanicAdvice,cu2etyx,1,t5_2tkvu

4869532,0,t3_3hl944,yes..  but there is a LOT more to it.  there are wheel bearings to remove.. clean and repack.. axle seal to install.. before you pull the retaining rings off the studs.. please hold the hub tight against the rotor face.. spin the hub and rotor and wire brush the dirt off the out side of the hub so it does not fall into the hub when you remove it.. you will also want to make sure you have replacements for the spin on retainers on the studs..  the dorman ones wont hold. this stops dirt from falling in between the hub and the rotor when you are changing a tire.  i have seen a lot of off roaders pull a front wheel off these.. yanking the hub off with the wheel and then drop it peanut butter side down into the sand or dirt..  then just slide it back on contaminating the bearings..  or piles of sand or dirt falling in and contaminating the bearings. front wheel seals are ... front wheel bearings are set  or A..   these are the proper push nut retainers for your wheel studs.. ,MechanicAdvice,cu8cb46,1,t5_2tkvu

4874756,0,t3_3hnodu,As uimprl said it doesnt sound like it has compression. I would take the valve cover off and see if the valves are opening and closing. Its possible the timing chain is broken and the valves arent operating at all. If they appear to be opening and closing verify your timing via timing marks and set the valve lash since youre in there. If you know its in time the valves are operating and the valve lash is set correctly and it still wont start check the compression. If all those are fine and set correctly you have a fuel issue. The easiest way you can test to see if its getting fuel is to give it a shot of starting fluid. But BE CAREFUL. Its easy to catch a diesel on fire or blow it up with starting fluid.

If its a small job I do the work twice to make sure I dont make an amateurs mistake on a new part. Pro tip for OP If you decide to do it on your own move slow and pay attention.

4978275,0,t3_3ix5v2,Heres an update...  Visited the dealership today.  Took a friend with me as a witness.  The two of us were allowed to walk around under the lift with the mechanic and the Service Manager to review and take pictures.The dealership claims that the struts were in fact replaced.  They claim they used OEM struts which explains why the other shop believed they had never been replaced.  They were expecting to see aftermarket shocks on there  not OEM.They also claim the rear stabilizers had been replaced.  That point is hard to argue as they did not have the same patina as the rest of the suspension components.The bushings however are a different story entirely.  They claim the bushings were replaced in January of this year but they used nonOEM parts from a third party.  They attribute the perished bushings to using aftermarket bushings and they have agreed to order new bushings from Ford to replace at no cost.For those interested here is a picture of the rear upper strut rod bushings   And here is a picture of the lower bushing    It appears to me that they may have reused the original bushings when they replaced the strut rods because I find it very hard to believe that bushings could get into that state in six months.I still have the car in my possession and they will be calling when the new bushings have arrived for installation.  Once they have finished I will be taking it to another garage for the front strut replacement.,MechanicAdvice,cum1ru9,1,t5_2tkvu

I read it that no air is moving out of the vents cold hot or inbetween.  If thats correct stay away from checking pressures or leaks or anything else mentioned as the system is working fine.When you dont have airflow can you hear to cabin fan spinning?  If it only spins the cabin fan on its highest speed the blower motor resistor is bad.  if its completely random its most likely a dying fan but could be bad wiring.  Do this  turn the fan all the way up and see if it works all the time.  If its random id unplug the fan and hotwire it to see how it responds.  If it runs at good speed with direct v its a wiring issue.  ,MechanicAdvice,cumbqh3,1,t5_2tkvu

Btw it shouldnt need refilled if it does you have a leak or your burning it.To check the fan let your car idle from a cold start until it gets up to full temp.

Take all the cables apart and if it has the two positives pull them apart and clean all the mating services up until they look shiny and new.  I use a wire brush and hot water.  Next step is to check for the v signal on the S terminal of the starter assembly when someone turns the key to start.

5394398,0,t1_cw162nk,So like this  What fasteners are holding the far end to the trunk floor?  When you had the  degree tilt issue there are only a few things that could have happened  a lateral tear in the trunk floor shearing of the fasteners or no fasteners in the first place.  For what its worth I wouldnt trust any load over lbs probably less to be safe with this style of hitch receiver.  You need the kind that mounts to the unibody rails.  I have an  CRV with a class  hitch and have hauled around  tons from New England to the Midwest on  occasions with no issues aside from not nearly enough power to make the drive comfortably.  And as for the repair process for a damaged structural component there are many ways to go about it and it depends on what the component is.  The classification of structural damage is a brand sort of like a salvage title is a brand...it simply means that the component has been damaged in a way that no amount of repair will result in the component performing in its unaltered asmanufactured state.  This is why Id advise that you can no longer have complete faith in the integrity of your trunk floor and seeing as how your current receiver relies on the integrity of the trunk floor you might get a receiver that relies on the integrity of an undamaged structural component before you do any more towing.,MechanicAdvice,cw170gy,1,t5_2tkvu

Maybe  per for any non stocking facility buying from a middle man.Customers can always go home and check ebay and amazon and find lower prices.  Thats not he point.  They want it fixed today and by someone else.  That means a markup of more expensive parts.  And we are not even getting into quality parts most shops use because they do not want comebacks where they have to work for free.

5739702,0,t3_3tq9w2,Its a time consuming job but it can be done with little experience as long as you have access to a decent set of hand tools.  Youll need some pliers for things like fuel lines sockets and wrenches for nuts and bolts a good quality floor jack and a set of jack stands some extensions in various length for the hardtoreach nuts and bolts...  thats about all that comes to mind.  Youll also need to rent or borrow if you know a person who has one an engine hoist.  Taking an engine out without one is near as makes no difference impossible without a lift.Generically the steps are the same for every car when it comes to pulling the engine out.  First off once youve got it properly supported on jack stands Id start by removing the hood.  That will give you one less thing in the way as well as giving you plenty of room to work.  Then drain the cooling system into a catch pan.  While the cooling system is draining disconnect the battery and take it out of the car.  Dont leave it sitting on a dirty concrete floor as that can cause the battery to discharge.  Put it on a workbench or something similar somewhere thats out of the way.  Now its time to disconnect the fuel line.  Since its a  Im going to assume that its got a carburetor and as such there will be little to no pressure on the fuel system.  It will leak some gas when you take the fuel lines loose so be aware of that.  By this point the cooling system is probably drained so go ahead and remove the radiator.  Youll probably have to remove the fan and its shroud to get the radiator out but as those parts are going to have to come off before the engine comes out anyway nows as good a time as any to remove them.  At some point youre going to have to disconnect the transmission from the engine unless youre going to be pulling them as a unit so youll have to figure out how to get at the torque converter bolts if its got an automatic and the bell housing bolts which youll have to undo regardless of if its an automatic or not.  Youll also have to remove the starter motor so you may as well do that while youre under the car disconnecting the torque converter.  Now also while youre down there youll have to find the motor mounts.  They should be on either side of the engine under the exhaust manifolds.  Theyll look like large rubber and metal things with a big bolt running through them.  Remove the big throughbolt from the engine mounts.  You may need to use a floor jack and a block of wood to lift the engine ever so slightly to get the bolts out of the mounts.  Once thats done remove the distributor cap so you dont damage it.  If its got power steering youll have to either disconnect the power steering lines from the pumpsteering box or take the pump off of the engine.  If its got AC and you dont have the capability to safely discharge the AC system youll have to unbolt the AC compressor from the engine and position it aside while leaving the lines hooked up.  Youll also need to disconnect the wires from the alternator as well as any other wires that you see attached to the engine.  One thing I forgot to mention youll also have to disconnect the exhaust either by unbolting the pipes from the manifolds or by unbolting the manifolds from the heads.  Its up to you to decide which route would be easiest.Once youve got everything disconnectedunhookedunboltedout of the way now its time to bring the engine hoist over and attach the chains on the hoist to the engine itself.  Some engines have eyelets designed specifically for this purpose sometimes youve got to bolt the chains to the engine it all depends on your specific situation.  Regardless once youve got the engine hoist attached to the engine its time to lift the engine up a little but just enough for the motor mounts to clear and then move it forward to disengage it from the transmission.  Also look for anything that you didnt disconnect before you do any farther thats still attached to the engine and needs disconnecting.  Once youve got the engine clear of everything its just a matter of using the hoist to lift it up and move it forward to get it out of the engine bay.Get yourself a service manual and watch all the YouTube videos you can find on how to pull an engine typically the longer videos will give you more details on exactly what to do.  It can absolutely be done by someone with no experience but it is going to be a daunting task.  Take your time take lots of pictures for reassembly reference and dont be afraid to call friends and family in for assistance if you need it.  Sometimes you just need a second pair of hands or a third pair or an eighth pair...  Good luck.,MechanicAdvice,cx8kdym,2,t5_2tkvu

The one nice thing is that they have a  year warranty and WalMarts are just about everywhere so I can exchange it if I get stuck somewhere.  MotorCraft batteries are good too which is what your dealer would put in.The only thing that I would do right away is the ball joints as those can be a safety issue  your wheels can fall off or something causing more damagerepair work.

You let this one get too far gone.Its to the point where its hard to tell you where to proceed.Replacing the cats will probably be the most expensive. And if they are clogged up and restricted or falling apart it would cause the car to have sluggish performance and have trouble reaching speeds as you note.Problem with that is you also need spark plugs and it sounds like your engine is misfiring. Misfires damage cats. So putting the cats on without addressing the spark plugs and misfires will just ruin the new catalytic converters.

So if the battery has a problem then suddenly the car wont restart. To check the alternator you can just do a visual inspection make sure the upper bracket is good sometimes they break and the belt and connectors are tight. Then if you can get hold of a voltmeter you can make sure its charging the battery at the appropriate times.As far as fuses I cant think of one which would make the car stall but its a good idea to check them and also the battery cable clamps and ground points.,MechanicAdvice,czvi105,1,t5_2tkvu

6582284,0,t1_czzrzjq,You are  correct about the temp fuel freezes at. Its a common misconception that it is gasoline that freezes it isnt the gas it is any water that gets in the gas that freezes. Water is heavier than gas and sinks to the bottom of the tank and gets in the lines before gas. This is much more likely to happen when more condensation forms in the tank either from bad gas or more commonly when you dont have a lot of fuel in the tank and there is more empty space for condensation to form. Years ago gas used to be of lower quality so freezing was more common. They have gotten better now however if your fuel tank is low it can still happen every now and then it has happened to me. So you are correct it would not be fuel freezing at the temp it would be water.

6629012,0,t3_46g6bk,A lot of people have given you great advice on how to jack your car and get it on stands safely so ill interject something else. When you buy jack stands you want to check the welds and you want to put them on the floor at the store and make sure theyre level. Last time I bought jack stands I went through  boxes until I got a matching level set. Last thing I want to do is put a car on stands that I know are not level.Harbor freight is pretty good for cheapnot for heavy use tools. Jackstands though? No way Id trust them. There are better stands out there for comparable prices. Craftsman stands are better than HF at the same price and Northern Tool has very nice doublelocking  ton jackstands for the same price as HFs single locking  ton stands with crappy welds. Last I looked northern tools stands were like . Cant beat that.Lastly dont put a car on jackstands in your driveway unless the stands have a flat base at each corner or unless you dont care about your driveway.

6810865,0,t3_49168w,Be careful working on this because theres exposed high voltage on the circuit board that can kill you definitely on the right side such as around those coils next to the yellow rectangular plastic boxes.  Look around for a reset jumper pins or switch because it may be necessary to reset the board even though this normally happens when power is turned on.  One of the first things to do is check all the power supply voltages probably V DC V DC and maybe lower DC voltages like .V.  I dont know if the motor runs at V DC or V AC because I cant see the writing on the black plastic cubes relay which will indicate that information but its not unusual for batterybacked openers to use a low voltage motor.  On the other hand those devices on the large black heatsinks may convert V DC from the battery to  V for the motor .  I assume at least one relay is for V AC for the overhead lights.  Sometimes relay contacts weld together but their low voltage coils generate high voltage back voltage which can damage the transistors driving them if any protective diodes fail.  Those diodes may be in the transistors or wired across the coils.  ,MechanicAdvice,d0ob4ct,6,t5_2tkvu

I noticed that mine was spiking the thermostat constantly. After I pulled off into a WalMart parking lot and let my engine cool down significantly I popped the radiator cap added some coolant and watched the hoses. I had a leak in the radiator hose running to the thermostat. I yanked some duct tape out of the back and taped it up limped it home and checked it out further once cooled. I yanked the thermostat and noticed it was closed. This is a bad thing. It will stop the flow of coolant into the motor. My suggestion...check ALL of the hoses as well as the thermostat. The thermostat is an inexpensive and extremely important fix. That being said...if you had smoking issues coming from the block as well as running low on oil you could had ruined a head gasket. This could have caused your rpm to tank and cause you engine to stall out. Theres several different ways to check if you might have a blown head gasket.

Replace the plugs if they havent been yet K is a lot even on platinum plugs.  iridiums tend to go even longer but a really hot ignition will even wear those too.    As the plug gap widens from wear mileage it increases the voltage in that circuit making it more likely to have an arcover on the wires boots caprotor if equipped or at the coilpack to wire junction.    Replace the plugs wiht the highest quality ones available   The best are iridiums I prefer NGK followed by double platinum then single platinum then copper.  If you have coil on plug ignition one coil per cylinder iridium or double platinums are your only option. An older coil distributor can take any of the types  but iridiums last the longest and are also the most expensive still cost effective over the long haul though.,MechanicAdvice,d2kp5ol,1,t5_2tkvu

Honestly this is something Id have to check out for myself and I would advise you get a good mechanic especially one that knows transmissions to look at it befor you buy it. At k if its never had the transmission replacedrebuilt its going to at some point in your ownership. A firm shift can be a good thing for the transmission often its actually preferable and the way I like to build them as it means good hydraulic line pressure for the transmission. But if its too hard and aggressive it can break internal components and put undue stress on things such as the clutch packs planetary gears sun shell bearings and sprag. Professionally I would probably err on the side of something being wrong with the truck thats causing it to shift that hard. So if your concern is not wanting to replace the transmission you might either account and budget for that or find a different truck. ,MechanicAdvice,d3yfb10,2,t5_2tkvu

7923910,0,t3_4nsxw7,Since youre replace the starter its likely not the issue but you can wire up a remote start switch and use that to bypass the start circuit and get the engine started.A common failure point is the neutral safety switch.  Next time it wont start try starting in neutral and try pushing it up in to park as you turn the key.  Could also be in the ignition switch.

7975575,0,t1_d46xjlm,Hey so a bit of an update here. I jacked up the car to do the check you did and on the front left and front right wheels I noticed that the hub? was shaking when I did as you said at  and . After doing the test I noticed that several of the lug nuts had become loose so I retightened them and performed the test again but the wheel would not shake as before. Similarly this was exactly the same on the left rear wheel. Both of the left side wheels had become loose and after tightening them they stopped shaking.That said after tightening them and setting the car back down and retightening on the ground since I didnt overdo it when it was jacked up I took the car for a drive and I had the same problem except this time it sounded as if it was coming from the left side of the car. I got back home and the two left side wheels were loose once again. After doing some further inspection I realized that I had mistakenly rotated my tires as if they were nondirectional. Jacked everything up and put all the tires back in their original position as they were labeled when the shop put my winters on last October. The issue isnt nearly as loud as it was before but it still gradually comes back as Im driving though it does seem to be lessened by braking. Lastly this could likely be an effect rather than a cause but I did notice that the front right wheel seems to be worn quite unevenly. When rolling it on the ground it leans pretty severely to the outside and bumps.Prior to fixing the rotation I recorded what the car sounds like as Im driving. Heres the link to the audio  There are several different sounds as the video progresses  and on becomes the most significant which also happens to be when Im driving slower kmh or  mph excluding the end. Would you still say this is a bearing issue? ,MechanicAdvice,d4cj3ts,1,t5_2tkvu

8111936,0,t1_d4ruoh2,This doesnt take into account two things. One retail parts outlets manage to sell parts without marking them up  even though they have to look up and order parts just the same as the mechanic. Two retail parts outlets arent also booking  hours a day labor at  an hour or more. The business model used in your example assumes parts sales alone are the source of revenue keeping the garage open as if it was an auto parts store. But a mechanic isnt an auto parts store people dont go to him to buy parts to install on their own. Why? Because he will charge them an arm and a leg for something they can get at Auto Zone much cheaper. They go to a mechanic for his labor and repair expertise. Parts sourcing should be a courtesy provided to people willing to pay him hundreds of dollars an hour book time for a repair that will take a fraction of the actual time booked not a way of double dipping the customer for another couple hundred bucks. Until you can sell parts at Auto Zone prices and still turn a profit get out of the parts sales game. ,MechanicAdvice,d4rus5n,3,t5_2tkvu

Since the model has only been out since  Im not sure how much life I can realistically expect to get out of it.  With a brand new transmission I would hope to get at least kk miles out of it so I guess thats another  years.  Realistically any car is going to have upkeep costs associated with it and Im ok with that.  The alternative would have me buying a used car since I think that makes more sense than buying new.  But I have had my car since it had k miles so I know how it was treated... used would have some extra unknown risk I guess.I made this post mainly because I dont really know anything about car AC.  From what youre saying it seems totally plausible that the compressor would have some significant internal damage and could push debris into the lines  is that right?My secondary concern is the pricing.

8383248,0,t3_4ug8i2,...It sounds like youd be better off letting a professional do this but to answer your questions.. No you cant just remove the subframe. Thats basically what is holding the entire drivetrain of the engine and transmission in the car. You either need to support the motor and transmission from the top of the engine bay with a hoist or keep a jack underneath the transmission and motor while removing the subframe. Which is kinda hard to do at the same time. Since most often the jack is gonna be in the way of removing the subframe but you cant remove the subframe without having a jack under there for support. Let alone doing this all on the ground to begin with and not on a lift like im assuming what youre doing.. Replacing the filter would be the best thing to do.

8793163,0,t3_50h13h,Assuming Ford hasnt put out a completely shitty line of transmissions though I wouldnt put it past them I can tell that you skip gears when you shift and when you skip gears I can tell that you put more pressure on the stick than you should in order to get it to drop into that gear.  You admit to doing it on the upshift gtNote I do not race this car nor do I bang gears I do however accelerate briskly firstthird on occasion.but I would bet money you do it on the downshift too. Synchronizers are like little automatic clutches that take the speed of the output shaft and synchronize it to the speed of the input shaft.  When you upshift from say st gear your input shaft is spinning  RPM and your output shaft is spinning say  RPM.  When you change the gear ratio by selecting a gear closer to  in your case rd gear the synchronizer acts as a brake for the input shaft as well as the rotational momentum of everything attached and geared to the input shaft such as the transmission countershaft bearing races and the clutch friction disc and spring hub.  The braking action  changing the rotational speed of that mass from  RPM to say  RPM  happens in approximately  second before the click into gear  once the click happens everything is synchronized and you release the clutch and by this time the engine RPM has fallen to match the clutch disc and if it hasnt youll either slip the clutch or youll feel a jerk and your engine will bog down depending on your rate of clutch release.  Note that Im assuming youve released your foot from the accelerator pedal during the shift.  The harder you press on the stick the more force you apply to that miniclutch and the faster it will change the input shaft RPM.  This works on the principle of friction to transfer energy so just like your brakes the harder you press the more friction occurs the more heat builds up in a very small area before the oil has a chance to pull the heat away.On the downshift the same thing happens.  You are in th gear with a driveshaft spinning at say  RPM.  When you try to select rd gear the synchronizer will try to accelerate the input shaft and clutch disc and all that mass from  RPM to  RPM or more in approx.  second.  That might not seem like a great deal but there is an fuckton of friction occurring inside the synchronizer in order to make your  shift seem smooth.  You can do this manually well YOU cant your transmission is juuuunk by rev matching the engine to the output shaft without using the clutch.  When you pull out of th without touching the clutch and LIGHTLY try to put it into rd it wont let you until you bring the engine RPM up to match the gear youre trying to choose.  See how high the engine RPMs get before it will let you into that gear.  Once its in you can release the accelerator and you can let your engine brake and slow the car down.  Anyway the point is that its user error possibly complicated by cheaplymade synchronizers.  Your miniclutches in the transmission are completely worn out illustrated by your YT video.  Stay in school kids.  Dont skip shift.,MechanicAdvice,d74thz7,1,t5_2tkvu

8826251,0,t1_d78bfio,That might be your problem right there. Those screws are not supposed to be adjusted on fuel injected cars theyre actually not idle adjust screws contrary to what many people will tell you. By adjusting the screw youre throwing off the ECU since youre basically changing the base values its expecting and working with. I know of some people who adjusted the screw on the throttle body on their Ford engine only to discover they cant really get the car run the way it did before. I also know of some Ford mechanics that will get close to bursting into tears if you tell them youve adjusted the screw on your throttle body. Me personally I dont think its THAT big of a deal and I believe you CAN fix that but still it might tell you how crucial not touching that screw actually is.You shouldnt have to change your idle anyway its preset in the ECU and your idle air control valve is there to make sure the engine idles at target rpms. If your engine is not hitting the idle rpms according to specs theres some problem with your engine vacuum leak IAC problem stuff like that.Also please dont clean the throttle body if you plan to do that. Thats another thing people often recommend that can actually do more harm than good.

If you plan doing car repairs in the future a midgrade DVOM will save you lots of time in diagnosing electronics maybe  or so. You dont need one with an ammeter I use mine VERY rarely just Volts and Ohms is ok.But yes there are two ways depending on the type of connector. If you are lucky you can slide the test leads into the back of the connector and leave it connected. Otherwise unplug it and carefully probe the harness end Without spreading the pins. Dont jam the test lead into the pin and ruin it. Do this with the engine running and make sure you dont get any wires caught up in the belt fans or exhaust. If you have a temp gun handy you can shoot the thermostat by  or  it should have v. If you have a helper its safer to have them watch the gauge on the dash while you hold the test leads.If you dont get v and cleaningswapping relays around doesnt help youll be stuck going to a shop to get the live data read....or buy a ish temp sensor and coolant and take a risk.If all the relays are the same swapping with your headlamps AC or starter relays in place of the fan relay is a good trick.

9055647,0,t3_54alhb,So when you crank it it catches and some combustion events are taking place? But it does not reach proper idle and simply dies? If you are able to take a video of said action with sound that might help. Some more info on the got stuck part might be helpful. Did the vehicle die while driving? Did it simply refuse to start once she returned to the vehicle after shopping? The circumstance of the death will make a big difference in the direction my armchair diagnosis goes.Does it attempt to start without being jumped? Must you jump it to have it attempt to start? What happens when you turn the key with no jump? With jump? Be as specific as possible.Based just on your description it sounds a bit like a fuel issue. Bear with me here I am gonna ask some dumb background questions.Does it have gas in it? If so was it just filled up mere kilometers before developing this issue? If yes are you SURE that it was gas put in there not diesel? Look for oily residue near the gas cap. Smell for diesel.

And finally put the black lead on the negative battery terminal and the red lead to the body of the starter. If the meter shows more than  volt while attempting to crank then you have a bad ground.

Just moving the shifter out and back in to park allows ignition. Does that sound like the TSB youre talking about?And finally where can I get more info on the TSBs?

If the car runs well and the check engine light stays off the most likely issue is the tires.  psi low on all  tires can have a huge effect on your mileage. Check the inside of the drivers door for the highest safe pressure for the tires and pump them up to that. If you dont like how the car rides take it down  psi. Be sure your not carrying a lot of extra weight in the car take the stuff out of the trunk you dont need and watch the temperature gauge to make sure the car is warming up normally.

You are more likely to get many dealer Certs at large dealership. I worked at Ford and Chrysler several years and never got any factory certifications at small dealer. GM was much better as was large Ford dealer. ASE will get you hired but it doesnt mean much at the dealer service department. Lube tech is rock bottom as far as pay goes. You have to hound the shit out of service manager or advisor to get training. Dealership parts pays good with commission after you have been there a few years and no tool bills. Also can move up to management. Not many options to move up as a tech. Subaru you are likely to be doing a lot of engine work and wallet flushing. All work dealer gets is  warranty work and pays about half as much as customer pay ticket. Larger dealer with many techs is better because at small dealer they gone feed their favorites all the good jobs and they get all the training. ,MechanicAdvice,d9yf0yi,2,t5_2tkvu

Cam profiles Intake and exhaust manifold design piston even different cylinder heads are common differences.  The power output is designed to the target market for the vehicle. Yes derating the motor so that the Cadillac looks more appealing is definitely a factor. However sometimes its the target market that drives the power. Someone buying a Cadillac would probably be fine with having to buy premium gas but the ability to save money on gas by buying regular might appeal to the Buick market. The lower octane gas cant be run as hard so power output has to be reduced.

You can fab or buy engine mounts. They are usually just study metal with rubber or poly urethane bushings. Fuel engine management is the connection between the gas pedal and the injectors. You can run into a headache as you mate the donor engine and the chassis wiring together. Some swaps are plug and play see honda engine swaps. Some you can use a stand alone ECU to replace the whole thing like a Haltech computer. If its really odd and not a common swap youll need two wiring diagrams and to match each wire to the right place. Transmissions can be swapped over with the donor engine but then you need a custom length trans axles or drive shaft to line everything up.Youd be surprised how things will mostly work together and how you can bodge something together and itll work mostly. You can find many parts in a junkyard and try to make something work for cheap even. Lots of cars from manufacturing groups will have parts that will fit together. The thing that makes it easy is having someone with plenty of experience helping out and pointing you in the right direction so you dont spend weeks looking for a part you may not even need. ,MechanicAdvice,dbqzrm3,2,t5_2tkvu

In my book that is totally fine.Rear end noise at only highway speed. My guess is hub bearing is going bad. You can check for play but sometimes they dont have play.

See if you have another entry for Throttle Position  Voltage not . Just to make sure.  Most cars will kill injector pulse if they see full throttle on start up as a safety feature. If you dont have another option for that you will need to measure the TPS voltage at the TPS itself and see if it is sweeping. If it is stuck at  then the car would run full rich and you would get that .v on sensor Since this is a  cylinder car Sensor  is a DOWNSTREAM sensor. It only measures converter efficiency.

11029746,0,t3_5xh1g5,My experience with their cars in general is that they are great troublefree vehicles until some magical mileage at which point they turn in to complete rubbish over night.  Youll have no problems at all then all at once everything on the vehicle is breaking left and right.  If you get new or used with warranty I would have your maintenance especially the oil changes done at a dealership.  If not at the dealer buy a case of oil filters and have the oil changed with a supplied filter exactly on time and keep the receipts.  One of the reasons they can sell so cheap is they do not fuck around when it comes to warranty claims.  If you arent in compliance with proof you are denied.,MechanicAdvice,dei738s,-1,t5_2tkvu

Camber may be a little easier to get if you can get the angle gauge to sit parallel to the hub on the tire but thats really difficult.  Caster angle will be pretty much impossible to measure without the machine though it is not always adjustable.

11248086,0,t1_df6xt7o,Okay that strengthens your position with the shop considerably. They did owe you a new oil pan...however you entered into negotiations with them and agreed that retapping the oil pan was an acceptable repair to you...you have already reached a settlement with that shop. You can go back to them and attempt to renegotiate the terms of your settlement but I dont expect this shop will play ball. You may have to threaten legal action and be prepared to follow through. This is a chance that the repair they made will the life of the car and you may never see any additional issues due to this...or it may leak all of the oil out the engine overnight. The shavings worry me...but I am picky about these kinds of things. Anything left over should get trapped in the oil filter but I have seen small bits get past. In all likelyhood it wont be a problem for you but it is always best to cover your own ass and limit your exposure to future liability whenever possible. The shop should have stepped up and replaced the oil pan...in my opinion the best path forward is to find a new mechanic for any additional service work.I hope this helps!,MechanicAdvice,df6yclx,2,t5_2tkvu

For cars you need a wide range really. For diesel trucks its low and kind of slow. For generators its low and really slow like there are some that are rpm.Slow  torque. High  power.

11625984,0,t3_65wx3r,It really wasnt ever a very good test but back before everything was computerized you wouldnt hurt anything doing it.  There are two issues here.  First the voltage can surge up to v or more without the battery in the system.  That can be enough to pop bulbs and cause problems with computers.  Secondly the alternator generates three phase ac power that is converted to dc by the rectifier.  At best the power coming out of the alternator is a bit dirty but if the rectifier has partially failed a very common problem then youre missing one or two of the three phases that are combined to make the dc voltage.  Computers dont like dirty power.  This certainly isnt a do this and ruin your car type thing.  It happens all the time and nothing bad happens.  Ive seen doing that damage a computer one time and that was years ago.  The test really offers no value though and has the risk of damaging other things so theres no need to do it on purpose.,MechanicAdvice,dgdtfnt,7,t5_2tkvu
