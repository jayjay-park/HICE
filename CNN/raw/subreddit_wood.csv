6349015,0,t3_42kfvj,Alright Im going to give you an opinion right now on a few different levels Color  Youve got similar low tones and the highlights are different colors.  Youve got some ability to play off of that but youve got to do well matching... Grain  The grain in Zebra Wood is really much straighter than Rosewood and youll have to figure out how best to manage that whether you can pick out your rosewood beforehand to make sure the grain are comparable between the raw materials but be aware when you come to a butt seam or any other point where two faces come together... Workability  Zebra wood is  harder than Rosewood.  Try to get pieces finished separately before gluingfastening so you dont have issues with uneven sandingfinishing at seams.Honestly the idea of having a striped pattern in two similar but different colors could make for a cool tabletop or cutting surface.  I wouldnt go into it with both of these woods without a plan though.,wood,czbb97s,1,t5_2qocp
