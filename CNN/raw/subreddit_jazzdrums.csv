1762500,0,t3_2emwaq,I use the Vic Firth As for practically every approach to my drumming these days. If I want to have a bit of a lighter feel I like to bring out the VF SD Maples or my Ayotte Jazz Maples  I highly recommend trying the latter if you ever get the chance. The feel is similar to that of a A width and the smaller sized ball tip gets insane definition from your ride.,jazzdrums,ck1bitk,1,t5_2zdze

2973195,0,t1_co61zih,I mean hes not the greatest drummer ever especially in jazz but the man was no slouch and hes especially not terrible.Edit The dudes biggest influences were rhythms from Africa which requires a great deal of independence. Similar to Elvin Jones influences ,jazzdrums,co62g5x,1,t5_2zdze
3776755,0,t3_33mz9v,Usually Vater Fusion model. Its like a A with a short taper. It just feels right in my hand. Occasionally Ill switch to a Zildjian A if I need to keep it really quiet. Thankfully thats not too often.  ,jazzdrums,cqms0j0,1,t5_2zdze
4071657,0,t1_crkdstv,I agree with jamming with people.  Practicing alone is great dont get me wrong but I cut my teeth in a band in high school and I think thats really where I learned mostly everything I know.  Solos fours comping how to get through a tune in the right place with and without a lead sheet you name it.  I also have a pretty decent repertoire now.  ,jazzdrums,crke9nf,3,t5_2zdze

10007045,0,t3_5hp9y8,Great playing! Really dug your solo ideas at the end too! For me for whatever my advice is worth at any tempo Im focused on momentum and what Ill call necessary energy. I always want to be propelling the group forward whether that means morphing the time a bit by being slightly behind the beat or pushing depending on what the moment calls for. I think you did that beautifully here. You didnt just get locked into keeping a pattern for patterns sake. You pushed the group ahead with great energy and the vibe is super modern because of it. Welldone! ,jazzdrums,dbby35e,2,t5_2zdze
