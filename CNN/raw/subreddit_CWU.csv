117323,0,t1_cersdpc,Well Im a writing major and so far my advisor seems to have no interest in me or my completion of the program. I get the feeling shes very bombarded with students every day and doesnt give a flying fuck about anything anymore. That sucks.Im looking at graduating after next fall so at some point Im going to have to get those credits petitioned and Im not entirely sure I trust her to get the job done.What can be done?,CWU,cershkf,1,t5_2st7x

1108854,0,t3_26tahi,No not everyone can claim Oh believe me Im a woman. Harassment and perversion is one thing gender is another. Anyone who goes into a bathroom to spy on people deserves to be cunt punted out of college and that has NOTHING to do with them getting away with anything because they claim that it involves their gender identity. ,CWU,chuc1wl,2,t5_2st7x

1476996,0,t3_2b2yy0,By far the worst place Ive ever lived granted this was about  years ago about a year after it had opened. Double charged for rent multiple times paper thin walls between neighbors and my door literally fell off the hinges. And definitely dont expect to get any of your deposit back even if you are a meticulously clean tenet with no pets. ,CWU,cj1f0tj,4,t5_2st7x

4499416,0,t3_3cpjzv,Charter is going to be your best bet here. Ive had  major outage in  years that lasted for lt hours. I spend my day working from home streaming music tv and playing video games. No real issues as long as the wiring in your buildinghouse isnt old.Its the base plan of du thats .month which includes free modem rental and no extra feestaxes. If youve never had charter before use the online chat when signing up mention you want to redeem the .month special for internet only which is not officially advertised on the site as they want you to bundle multiple .m promos such as tv amp phone which then goes to the normal price of . after  months.Fairpoint is literally dsl.,CWU,csxt0sh,3,t5_2st7x
