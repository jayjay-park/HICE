4847656,0,t1_cu5jwb7,gtIt was meant to be rude. If youre collecting shit to look cool and act like theyre merit badges you need a reality check.   Thats not what I fucking meant and its DEFINITELY not what I said. I said the Sticker makes the POP look cooler. Exact words used It makes the piece look cooler. I said MERIT BADGES make you look cooler using them as a comparison to why Stickers on Pop Boxes make the Piece look cooler. You built this entire debacle on the misreading of a comment. And also you arent supposed to TRY to be rude. If someone is being rude you call them out or shrug them off as an asshole.. You dont be rude back unless it is the only way to get through to them. And you ESPECIALLY dont be backhanddedly rude like you did. If a Dog shits on your carpet you arent supposed to shit on it as well. You also made an extremely premature judgement by basically calling me to Al Wiggum from Toy Story . Of course I love Pops. Do you really think someone that would only collect them as Vanity or to Scalp them would regularly post on this Sub? Didnt think so. gtWhy you think a sticker on packaging for  toys meant to protect it during shipping and then be discarded makes the plastic cooler is beyond all reason.I dont even know what the actual fuck you are trying to convey here. Are you saying the   inch Sticker is supposed to protect it during shipping obviously not at least I hope not. Are you trying to say the Box is only meant to protect it during shipping? because that is such a stupid statement that I need to break it down.First off this would mean all Pops would need to be shipped to be obtained by the collector which is simply not true. Second off Who the fuck discards their Pop Boxes? I mean not only are you suggesting they are meant to be discarded but you are putting it out there that EVERYONE should get rid of andor destroy them. How many ITB Collectors are there? Probably a LOT more than OOB ones thats for sure! You are also suggesting that the only thing I think the sticker adds to is the plastic which also makes no sense but considering the rest of this shitfest I shouldnt have even mentioned it.Overall you are being a serious fucking asshole. You are basically shitting on anyone who EVER thought it was cool to have a Sticker on the box of their Toy or Collectable you COMPLETELY shrug off ITB Collectors you basically say fuck you to anyone that disagrees with you and do it in way that is so moronic and asinine that its literally hilarious.Tldr You built this argument on a misreading of my comment you extraneous logic to make me seem like an idiot to make me seem like an idiot for liking Stickers on my Pop Boxes and you do it all in a way that is as rude and antagonistic as it can get.Please for the love of God or Jesus or Science or whowhatever the fuck you believe in try to put up a better argument next time. If not for yourself for everybody you will ever debate with.  Or maybe this just wasnt your best which happens to everybody sometimes.Good Night Or Day depending where you are to you sir.

6259990,0,t3_41by0z,Like everyone said. Facebook Reddit Craigslist eBay.On Craiglist and Facebook I actually prefer posting different ads in different groups of SMALL lots. Like  pops per ad. This way people are more likely to go through your whole post and wont skip on the commons. Also the pictures are zoomed in and people can see the pops much more clearly which may be more attractive for the impulsively buying pops that look cool type of buyer.Also I know people prefer that you have the prices include shipping BUT for cheaper commons you know youll probably take a loss on Id break split up the price and shipping. It seems cheaper in that X pop will be  dollars but shipping would be flexible if they buy multiple pops.,funkopop,cz16x8n,2,t5_2ulbr

So what happens hypothetically if I make an account on another forum that has a username similar to another user here and not my own? Will they just assume it was the other person making the remarks and ban them sight unseen? Will they ask the person on Reddit Hey did you make these comments about us on this other forum? allowing them to say they didnt? And if they do ask if you did whats to stop anyone from saying nah Bruh wasnt me. Never been to that site. and then the mods have to either ban them anyway or just ignore it like fucking adults should just do anyway. Then to complain about people downvoting comments in their edit just makes it worse. They arent downvoting you because they dont respect you as a person they are downvoting you because this post and your comments sounds incredibly childish and they dont feel like your points have any merit. This is like a principal suspending you for watching porn at home. Your jurisdiction ends with Reddit. ,funkopop,cz4bwns,29,t5_2ulbr

Just build your collection with afforadable stuff you want now and eventually you can do trades for the older stuff or save up for them.

6822786,0,t3_497rc2,I would tell him that the item was damaged in shipping and ask if he had the item insured. At that point it gives him the opportunity to do the right thing and offer to either file a claim to refund you some of the cost or refund some to you directly. You might be able to file a claim as well but if it wasnt insured maybe not. If not and if he wont reduce the price then your best bet is to pay less for it and find a replacement box telling him that the reduction is for a new box because it wasnt packaged properly. Dont stiff him completely when he did purchase the item  it sounds like he simply didnt understand that you just wanted the item that was there at the regular price and that box condition is important for these things. ,funkopop,d0pntos,0,t5_2ulbr

7494772,0,t1_d2u0twu,So its annoying if they ask if you have a product but they dont purchase it?  Seems like you shouldnt work in customer service if that kind of thing upsets you.  People are allowed to come in a store and ask without buying.  Its called customer service if something is purchased or not.  Its amazing how so many people that work in customer service get frustrated and bothered if a customer just asks a question.   God forbid you do your job.  Last time I checked you are getting paid either way since you are most likely paid by the Hr.  Its not all about making that one sale its about building good relationships with customers and hopefully they spend more in the long run.  Honestly it doesnt surprise me that you work or worked at GS and had that kind of attitude.  I dont even blame you its one of the biggest issues with GS.  Customers are just numbers to GS not people ,funkopop,d2u46ip,1,t5_2ulbr

You can go in on that day see if they arrivedshipped from the warehouse.Pops arnt shipped overnight like all the new upcoming games so expect them to ship on release date. Preorder them and have them shipped to your house is always an option but I still recommend in store pick up so you dont get stuck with a banged up box or a defective Pop.,funkopop,d4pzl5o,2,t5_2ulbr

8309157,0,t1_d5g6pfa,Im not getting hostile but I also didnt come to this thread for a lesson on how or where to buy pops. People on here take their shit way too seriously that they feel they need to downvote because I asked someone to pick one up. It seemed the OP was at the store so I figured Id ask. Not the end of the world. I was on the site when it was released and it kept saying out of stock when I added to cart much like every box lunch exclusive I try to get. I didnt feel it necessary to create a new thread to ask for it when someone is literally in the store and all I did was ask. Regarding me sounding like a dick or coming off as a complete asshole Im not even going to defend myself against it because its perception. All I did was ask the OP if heshe minded picking up an extra while at the store. After being downvoted I merely asked why I was being downvoted because I asked an honest question to help out a fellow collector. You acted like me asking for it was taking away from local collectors. Im not asking to ship  of them overseas to Singapore just an example to resell them in a foreign country. I asked for one. One from a collector for a fellow collector. Thats all.,funkopop,d5g796p,0,t5_2ulbr

You didnt want to get in line to late because they could run out of wristbands before hand typically they would run out in about  min each day. When you go through the line one of the Funko employees has a tablet that you push a randomize button on. Either a time will show up on the screen for you to get a wristband and buy during that wave or nothing. If nothing then no wristband. According to them you will only be able to do this once per day. Unfortunately people were going back and joining their friends in line so they had more chances. The odds of getting a wristband seemed pretty high it looked like only  in every  people werent getting one on the randomizer. ,funkopop,d5rucvu,1,t5_2ulbr

8601364,0,t1_d6gl1e9,No. Meagan was the name of the doll in season  episode . Remember that doll that kept turning up in random shots throughout the season? It was like by the window with that scene with the razor. And in the rocking chair of the farm house? I think it was Maggies. At least shes the one who called it by name.  It would just show up in scenes. Hershel tripped over it when he still had two feet. There was a behind the scenes episode that detailed how one of the camera men had a daughter who died during production and he wanted to have the doll in some of the shots because it belonged to her and she was a huge fan of the show. It was a way to kind of celebrate her memory in a subtle way through a medium she enjoyed. Really neat little factoid. Pretty sure if you go to the Walking Dead Wikipedia page a cursory glance will reveal I just made all this up.,funkopop,d6gris1,4,t5_2ulbr

That is what I am trying to find out if there is any merit in her arguments. I mentioned beanie babies because it simply reminds me of it that is all. As for all the comments about cigarettes my wife has tried a million times she cant force her too just like she cant force her to quit buying these toys but what she can do is educate her on these decisions and hope that it will help.

As people said make sure you check a users feedback by looking at the spreadsheet. Also check the age of the users reddit account whether they seem active in general on reddit etc. Always use PayPal Goods amp Services so you have purchase protection. If someone asks you to pay friends and family they shouldnt be and you can let the mods know. We cant do a background check on everyone. We are unpaid volunteers and dont have the resources or time to do that. Finally if someone isnt leaving you feedback politely ask. It never hurts to ask and it always helps if you include a direct link to where they can leave feedback for you in your message.,funkopop,d9evrzl,1,t5_2ulbr

9828073,0,t3_5fz9dq,I went to  different Target stores in Houston and NONE of them had the Batman pops on display. TLDR  Go ask the store employees to check in the back have the Target DPCI available for them to check. Make sure they find the display.I asked at  of the stores. At the first one the employee told me they were in the back and he couldnt get them that i would have to return the next day. In all fairness it was kinda close to closing time for them so i let it go. However when i got to the next Target when i asked an employee there he said they were in the back and went to look for them only to return to me and be surprised to not find the display box or any Batman pops at all even though Brick Picker said they had  in stock and when he checked with his scanner tool it showed they had  instock. I went back this morning and they still had no display but i needed to get to work so i left.The rd Target i went to I asked a clerk who went into the back obviously not on display again and he returned with the unopened box that contained the Batman pops in their display. There were  other guys there looking for these Pops and they each grabbed a set. I only wanted the Professor Radium one so that is all i took.Target off Cypresswood near I Freeway is where i came across the fresh display.,funkopop,daomba2,2,t5_2ulbr

Most people would recommend holding on to the box if you display them out of it that way if you ever decide to part with it itd retain its value. One pro to leaving them in the box is that the boxes can stack on each other. A con to that is you only get the front view of the Pop. Pro to loose is you can admire the Pop from every angle. Cant think of any specific cons off the top of my head to open display. Hope that was helpful.,funkopop,dbm8s5l,2,t5_2ulbr

Alpha  is a perfect example he has a unique UPC but Walmart has him listed as Anime Assortment. Its why Brickseek is so messed up trying to find him. Not one single store is going to have  Alpha  Pops but you go into the store and will see Power Rangers DBZ Naruto Pops plush and various Funko related items.Another example  is ZEA Bats  The Joker Boxer and  Harley Quinn  all from the Suicide Squad linerelease.,funkopop,de8wu0p,3,t5_2ulbr
