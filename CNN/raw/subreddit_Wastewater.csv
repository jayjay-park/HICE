4429882,0,t1_csorg1p,I have heard a lot about dog food. Do you just throw it in or do you have to grind it into a powder? Any adverse effects on the system.I will have to also look into food processing locations that would have a valuable feed. I know there is a Darigold up the road a ways. Do you know of any milk waste that would work well and perferably not smell horid while sitting in a tank.,Wastewater,csp2rcc,1,t5_2qt21

7968514,0,t1_d45hoqz,Based on  gallons per week  hour workweek thats   GPM.We make a Volute ES system thats about   feet by  feet with the chemical dosing system and can run itself while tucked away in a corner. We can add another small mix tank to the backside divert that into one of the smallest CleanFiltration Tequatic systems and theyll filter for everything coagulated to above a couple of microns. The concentrated heavy metal sludge goes back to the Volute and you wind up with relatively clean water out one side and a heavymetal cake about the texture of a freshly baked brownie on the other side. You can probably sell the cake to a metal recovery company. The entire process scheduled maintenance is a slidein brush replacement once or twice a year on the Tequatic and a ring cartridge replacement once or twice a decade on the Volute. With that production rate it can probably turn itself on about twice a week and take care of the tank whenever its halfway full.You might also be able to get away with a small centrifuge and a high residence time or maybe using your current tank as a clarifier by adding a mixer amp chemical dosing system.,Wastewater,d4bqizj,1,t5_2qt21
8617021,0,t1_d6ii4z4,Yeah  thats the one. Its good for wastewater and surface and I think even distribution. Youll need more classes later on but that should get you the d license which they all share. Youll have to test separately but to even take the test you need this class.  Good luck. And heads up i just happen to be in Texas I dont know much in wastewater and I dont know if many other people in this sub are from Texas.,Wastewater,d6iq5s9,3,t5_2qt21
8970636,0,t1_d7q1lck,Whats your background age work experience education if you dont mind me asking? What makes you want to go into this industry? The money typically isnt very good honestly unless you get in with a good company. Most municipalities pay poorly. The real money is in managing small systems privately as your own business after you become more experienced. I dont do it but a lot of people I know through the industry manage little plants and lift stations for places like RV parks apartments school boards. It typically involves just checking them and light maintenance once or twice a month typically done on weekends and those guys make more doing that than what the cities they work for pay them.,Wastewater,d7q4ulc,1,t5_2qt21
9099098,0,t1_d85jjgq,Ive spent most of the last two days standing beside the Volute Sales Director from Scotland here at the WEFTEC conference in New Orleans in the United States.Your facility sounds a LOT like a pilot study we conducted in Kansas earlier this year. They even had plants with root systems growing on the surface of the lagoon. Drop the right kind of pump down into those lagoons to force the sludge to the Volute and turning it into dry cake in the  or higher solids range is easy.,Wastewater,d85kc37,2,t5_2qt21
