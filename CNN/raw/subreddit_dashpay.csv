7096261,0,t1_d1km46l,It is that low today thanks to low utilization and the existence of block subsidy. However the true cost of a transaction is almost certainly several orders of magnitude higher. I read an estimate that the true cost of a bitcoin tx is about  which is currently subsidized through the block reward. Thats fine but if microtransactions are going to be a thing there will be literally insane amounts of them and then it gets unsustainable  MB blocks or  MB blocks or more doesnt really matter when were talking several orders of magnitude larger number of transactions.I dont know what a DASH tx true costs is probably considerably less than bitcoins due to no ASICs larger blocks etc but still significant. Pretty much all Proof of Work coins will have significant tx margin costs no matter what you do. I dont see how you could fit the potentially trillions of microtransactions we could see in the future ever be onchain and certainly not on a PoW coin blockchain.Besides you really dont want every web page visit made to be forever engraved on the blockchain regardless of what obfuscation techniques are added regardless of IP not being stored or whatever. Given AI and fingerprinting analysis everyones web page visits  or refrigerator refills  logged on the blockchain sounds like an epic integrity disaster waiting to happen.So. Microtransactions are going to have to be done offchain or at least on some sidechain like feature. Third party is possible although again do we really want to entrust our privacy data to some proprietary service? Not that shit again. For microtransactions we are going to need some kind of sidechain or sidechaintoasidechain system that is also immune to corporate theft of our integrity selling the data and governmental abuse using the data to exert excessive powers. I dont have an answer to what that would be but perhaps some DAO using a cryptocoin that is simultanously extremely dark high privacy and scales to billions and trillions of transactions where each transaction cant have a fee higher than a couple of millicents or satoshis or whatever unit you prefer. I dont think such a system exists today.PS. Microtransactions isnt just about pay per view on the web although thats a nice use case. The big thing with microtransactions will be when IoT hits big. Machinetomachine transactions will be a thing Im not talking AI here just MM tx for dumb machines and once it does it will make the need for microtransactions completely explode. The overall value of this market will inevitably outnumber the current world economy. Fiat isnt even going to be in the running for such a system due to its inherent flaws. It will have to be some kind of crypto.,dashpay,d1kqbxb,4,t5_37fg8

Is this question supposed to scare anyone?Because the same nonsequitur could be applied to every Cryptonote currency or any Bitcoin mixing service out there and yet here we are with an ominous question and a spooky outcome in the Dash subreddit from an anonymous coward. Guess what Not gonna happen. They cant even agree on how to regulate Bitcoin and you wanna scare people away from Dash with this? Try harder.Anyway heres your answer Logic prevents them. The laundering of the money doesnt take place when the digital currency is mixed. It takes place when dirty cash is exchanged for crypto. What the mixing in DASH does is nothing different than six people throwing five  Dollar bills each on a table shuffle the pile around a bit and then everyone takes out their  bucks.

But... some early adopters and affluent people do so yes InstantSend really needs to be implemented on iPhone wallets as well as soon as Dash is accepted. Other wallets like Exodus desktop and Jaxx really need to expand to support it as well.I almost think once we hit a critical mass of wallets really need to put effort into ensuring they all support InstantSend. It really is the big differentiator. This is really a good use of time and community funds if needed to make happen.

10813463,0,t1_ddud3sx,. Agreed if we can in fact integrate with them faster than wed have Evolution up.  At best its going to be a matter of maybe  months faster.. Agreed good benefit. Agree with the first sentence but I think the Evo devs could focus just as well or more with onboarding additional inhouse resources to handle integration support.. Agree with the last sentence this is essentially the same as .  For new customers not BlockCyphers existing integrated customers we need to make Evo DAPI as or more convenient than BlockCyphers API.. Basically the same as  and  but I doubt that absent this integration work the business dev team would just be sitting on their hands not knowing what to do. And now Ill go ahead and add what I think is missing from your list.  One key benefit I see is simply that it will be a badge of honor.  BlockCyphers website likes to play up Bitcoin and Ethereum as the king and prince of blockchains.  Standing next to them will certainly give us street cred so....Street cred  gold star  badge of honor in the cryptospace.I think this is going to pass regardless of my concerns so Im trying to be optimistic but I see a lot of challenges and risks in terms of Dash offering competing services with BlockCypher.,dashpay,ddvbz93,4,t5_37fg8

You could launch a new altcoin based on dash and technically it would be identical but no one would chose it over dash because of the added value of dashs current user base.

11361235,0,t3_624b2k,Dash uses a different algorithm called X. Actually it is  different algorithms chained together. One block is mined roughly every two and a half minutes and it yields just over  Dash as a reward. Rewards decrease by  per year. I am not sure if it is what you are looking for but all important info about mining Dash you can find here ,dashpay,dfjrwm6,2,t5_37fg8
11367429,0,t3_62843q,Moo is as you might have noticed also a Core dev for Dash. Hes usually swamped with tons of work and we hope to see that mitigated in the near future with the newly to be hired developers. If he doesnt reply even for a while its almost always due to his other duties but he always replies eventually and has a rock solid reputation in our community. Not a single user ever reported loss of funds with him.Heres a little resume that might help you understand his delayed response time.,dashpay,dfkh5fp,4,t5_37fg8
11370435,0,t1_dfkqvkx,How are they not helping Dash scale? Does Bitcoins declining full node count help it scale?Anyone can run a node on the weakest hardware they can find and claim theyre helping the network when the only thing theyre contributing to is an even slower synctime of other nodes.By remunerating our node infrastructure in Dash we can set minimum hardware requirements for Masternodes. Something Bitcoin can only dream of. And no You cant cheat that system as I have laid out hereMasternode operators are financially enabled and incentivized to invest into powerful hardware and thus build a super strong and fast network for us. Something that is already happening. Why are they incentivized to do so? Because running low end hardware will cause their node to drop or be banned resulting in forfeiture of increasingly valuable rewardpayouts.Bruteforcing the scaling problem is the only viable solution for any cryptocurrency to scale. You can circumvent the problem with engineering hacks like SegWit and Lightning only for so long until you realize you simply need a bigger boat.,dashpay,dfktfjm,1,t5_37fg8

11411372,0,t3_62mhlb,TenX is really interesting. I could see them possibly becoming the biggest cryptocurrency card available if they can deliver on their promises.At the end of the video the TenX CVOCofounder says that there might be something special for Dash. I wonder what that could be?  But I do think that people will start using Dash to fund their cards because of its instantsend features. Sometimes we are in a tight spot and need something quick and it is extremely frustrating to wait especially when you are dealing with your money. ,dashpay,dfpgtmt,2,t5_37fg8

11436727,0,t1_dfs0xtn,I started using bitsquare after I made the post. I am really impressed by the system. Would definitely recommend. I hope others looking to trade start to use it.Im using it exclusively dashbtc the same way I was using Poloniexshapeshift. The main advantages are that I can remain anonymous and can have larger purchase orders. Im going to try my hand at regularly trading and see how it goes.rebtc collateral thats true but it is still a good option for people who already have btc and want to get Dash at a specific price or amount. It is also seemingly relatively simple to buy btc using fiat. Which would add one more step in the process but would allow a noob to get involved with Dash relatively quickly.re additional software. yes but it is pretty straightforward. The learning curve is more or less the same for learning how to use something like Poloniex for the first time.I would definitely recommend it so far. I love the idea that simply downloading a piece of software I am able to find people to trade with using a builtin escrow service based on multisig wallets. I am worried by centralized exchanges in general and specifically with how big Poloniex is relative to all the others.,dashpay,dfscbd1,4,t5_37fg8
