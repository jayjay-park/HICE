This is done so that the community can find the new content by themselves which is how it should be done for this type of game imo. It isnt optimized yet but it is definitely at a playable level at the moment I currently have  hours into the game so far. Right now there is still a decent amount of stuff you can do so it doesnt get boring too fast. For a game running off the Unity engine it sure does look nice. Watching a freshly cut tree fall to the ground for the first time is pretty cool. I think that it is getting better at a reasonable pace for a  person dev team. yes.

1356564,0,t1_cimazm0,yea i agree making the mutants multidimensional characters would be much more interesting.  Or even being able to trade with some or build some kind of relationship with some while being enemies with others.  maybe even some would dislike you if you were friends with some other group of them.  Im no game developer but i doubt it would be too hard to categorize different mutants and add positive and negative relationship stats to them. Even games like Skyrim did a form of this when joining different cults or becoming a werewolf or vampire etc...  ,TheForest,cimc3np,1,t5_2t178
1357801,0,t3_29mxnl,TLDR Yes but everyone should lighten up andor justify their claims including you.gt  After all that is the whole point of a public alpha if they didnt want our criticism and the responsibility to listen to it they would not have made a public alpha. Unless they just wanted to take our money and run which it seems they didntThis is a false dichotomy. They probably do want constructive criticism but that doesnt mean they want to do what we say. It means theyll take what we say into account.Also I know other games that are released in alpha that dont give much of a shit about feedback so much as just want people to be able to enjoy it sooner than they would otherwise have been able to.gtPerhaps it shows a flaw in the communication between the devs and the testers?Theyre a tiny team Im not sure theres a separation between devs and testers. Maybe there is but its irrelevant really. gtMaybe they genuinely thought saving was fixed and just failed to test it? Maybe they knew it was broken and lied ?Whatever happened coding is hard. Bugs can have many causes sometimes they are very hard to track down. Its quite easy for developers to test something and miss a completely obvious bug just because they dont use the game the same way others do. I speak from experience I am a professional programmer.gt Who knows but the answer is definitely not its an alpha for the first quote but it is for the second.I disagree  alphas are usually about adding features and betas are usually about polishing bugs. These are not concrete terms though so whatever you call it prerelease should be the only thing you really actually need to hear. That means it isnt finished whether there are bugs to fix or features to add. And even release is a vague term with over the air updates these days. Yes Its alpha is the answer for your second example quote. But I would change the answer to Its prerelease.Other than that I think I  agree with your sentiment. I think we should be constructively critical of the game. I think we need to have discussions somewhat like this.I think we should hold the developers to a slightly higher regard because theyre charging for the game already.I dont understand how some of these bugs they claim to have fixed have escaped their notice. But at the same time I think people really to understand that they really cant see into their development process and theyre making a game which is an art form  they have absolutely no obligation to make it a game you want to play  they are making a game they want to make.I am always a fan of people justifying their answers and not just claiming something like Its an alpha or you obviously know nothing about coding.,TheForest,cimho5p,6,t5_2t178

1488995,0,t1_cj2x4c9,Zockah.de Your use of the Unity engine The Forest and my question here is the same again Why Unity? How awesome The Forest would look like based on a CryEngine  or Unreal Engine . In addition the Unity engine has repeatedly struggling with performance problems do not use the best renderer and much more. On the other hand I understand the decision because you just wanted a possible simple engine that supports everything from the house. With all the ambition I would have thought that The Forest is a relatively large Indie Game not a lowbudget title. What can you tell me about this? Was it really only a decision of the money or do you see in the Unity engine any great advantage? Maybe The Forest was initially planned as a small survival game and was later suddenly and surprisingly extensive and big? Tell me something about it?Ben Falcone The Forest is even an extreme low budget game. We actually cost less than most D indie games on the market. Unity therefore offered itself besides you can do with the engine some really great things and the problems with the performance does not come from Unity but of us but are still solved in the course of development. The same applies to the physics engine for example can still fly around current tree trunks. Here is relief in sight.Zockah.de  I am also always interested in the work behind the scenes. You say to yourself that you are only four in Endnight Games is that correct? And you have taken on more staff  freelance set after the release of The Forest has become such a success?Ben Falcone The truth is that our team actually consists of only three people. Meanwhile we still have a few freelancers as well as some D artists and programmers to help us and support worldwide. The turtle in The Forest for example comes from a wonderful and very talented German D artist we have found online.Zockah.de  Actually it was already. Thank you for the honest answers as well as the opportunity for the interview. Personally I love your game and become The Forest continue to pursue. I hope you find a way to go with the further development in the right direction. What I can say so far is that it has delivered a pretty impressive work with The Forest especially when one considers the small budget and the tiny team. Nevertheless the ideas are in play wonderfully and the potential for the future is definitely there. Maybe The Forest is indeed the next big thing in the genre of survival games. I wish you all the best in any case and good luck with the sales figures.Ben Falcone Thank you for your interest and thank you that you have taken for an interview with me your time.The Forest FanboySo that was it my interview with Ben Falcone the Creative Director of Indie Game The Forest. I hope you liked it and the questions were interesting enough to give you a few new ideas. If you feel like we can in the comments now a little about The Forest the interview discuss the future and much more. I am still extremely pleased with the game not to say that I just mutate to small fanboy. Despite all the quirks The Forest Ill do it a lot of fun and shows virtually on every corner potential for the future new interesting features or other gameplay elements. The Forest could if the developers continue to stay on the ball be the next big thing Survival of the games. If it does not perhaps already is.,TheForest,cj2x55f,6,t5_2t178
1490604,0,t3_2b9ded,Here is my two cents First of all the game isnt all that scary after you see the cannibals for the first few times they just seem like a regular thing that are expected to come basically every day. The main survival part of the game is building to survive against the cannibals without cannibals the game is super easy. Im pretty sure there is a bug that you literally cant starve I hardly eat because of said glitch. Veganmode is more of just a wayor at least IMO to explore and to see what you can dobuild in the game.tldr the game is pretty boring as hell without cannibals which are not even scary after your first few encounters.obligatory sorry for autocorrects and shit for I am on mobile,TheForest,cj34enm,4,t5_2t178

If there are too many invading your base or when you are out collecting stuff just run away! Once you get a short distance away get behind a tree or a bush crouch and you will lose them.

Not entirely realistic but if done slowly I dont think people would really rage starts to loose the fire burnt texture and goes back to bark with leaves growing back in over a time period. Two days or so to make burnt trees useful again logs a few more to get the green.And mechanically thered need to be a way to keep the amount of times down at least from nonplayer sources if the player purposely wants to start one.. then fine lol. A way to help is to say after a few days of no rain trees are more flammable and spreads farther to neighbors and conversely rain causing less flammability to the point you could chuck molotovs at trees. Got to get those effects right though like anyone who has been in a real fire  point of realism for a bit of cinematic emotion. Two real fires that looked amazing in a sad beauty sort of way  Imagine running through The Forest while burning branches fall down and flames lick at your health pool...

10024060,0,t3_5imfun,I dont think he or the scientist most of them at least become cannibals the shipwreck from  states that there was already monsters on the islandforest.I think he mightve kidnapped her long before theres a chance and she wasnt called down in a plane. Thats why her clothes are weird maybe she was used as a birther for all the many babies thus her spinevagina to try and get as many samples and tests as possible. Thats why some cannibals have no sexs  Spinebaby.I think the Relics are old or alien or whatever cuthulu shit ya wanna say. I think there are natives whove always been there and worshipped the relics keeping the system going with new children. Then there are the cannibals from those who turned like some scientist and some planecrashers Id imagine. Either it is gradual just like the playercharacter eating infected meat to survive. I think testsubjectsbabies are the ones who have no sexs whilst those who turn later and the natives still have their sexs. Theres some texts about and magazines mentioning Possibility of Eternal life with relics?. I do agree with your assessment that they tested it on children and different things I think rich parents bought others children to revive their own dead ones as parents being sponsors are mentioned. The containmentcells are seemingly bulletproof and even explosiveproof meaning they wanted to contain and observe like that huge blob the mutations to learn and control it. Something broke free and went on a haywire or the scientists themselves went mad but itd be strange for the relic to be observed for so long to have so many go mad which is why I think the majority were killed. A infected person possible wouldnt spread the contagion that fast as you yourself are able to withstand it for some time. The Red Man exile is a good theory though. Theres a lot of decaying corpses of miners on the island more so than most corpses making me believe the whole crisispoint of the lab happened recently. Since even the hanged labman hasnt rotted. The Red Man survived just as you had during the small period waiting for the plane to cross the site as he knew for some reason or another as he probably had called it there but surviving during this period infected him just as others had to survive. Not sure at all.As you say skincare can also be a source of infection.Im unsure if the larger mutants are born created through the machine or fused by the corpses of dead. Which is why you see corpses stacked into piles and fused with walls. A bit Dead Space about it all.Or as you say maybe he orchestrated it all along only turning into some demigod cannibal wasnt in his intentions but just a sideeffect of him having to wait. Im not sure the breakout of the plague or the scientistlab getting purged was part of his plan since he shouldve known the problems infection can cause. Or as you said maybe he got infected before the planecrash and is actually the one that crashed the facility. I think the game suffers a bit from the exact same thing Dead Space suffered from its the best when theres very little explaining and the terror or such is unknown. Dead Space fucked up and had more outlandish story per game and I still love the series. ,TheForest,dbe5vk6,2,t5_2t178

10056639,0,t1_dbibkzs,its ok but long reload not great damage and hard to aim and also doesnt set enemies on fire.  ammo is much harder to find. use flare gun  melee wep to take down any foe easy,TheForest,dbiekmo,1,t5_2t178
10137043,0,t1_dbsnoq4,I cant turn up anything helpful on google cause it just gives me pants results.But from what I remember the slender tall and pale ones that often are in caves and come later on during high aggression levels are called Skinnies.The game has the notes section in it now where the player tracks things he finds in the game.  I might be wrong though considering I call the small rabid ones ferals or golums.  Feral because they sometimes attack tribal cannibals and are all sorts of crazed.,TheForest,dbsv003,1,t5_2t178

10297571,0,t3_5ndnho,You can definitely complete the story in multiplayer. There are objects all around the map to collect for completion sake there is the passenger manifest that you can tick names off of when you find their bodies and then when youve got enough gear there is an end game area you can head to and get an actual ending for the game! And then if you still wanna play for the building and surviving aspects you can reload the save you made before you go into the final area and just keep playing like it never happened!,TheForest,dcbaabk,5,t5_2t178

10882917,0,t1_de2atao,With a buddy it makes the game kind of trivialwe finished the game around  hours in. However we did cheat a bit looking up the location of the rebreather.. we explored every cave twice and spelunking was getting repetitive.,TheForest,de2huk7,1,t5_2t178
10891157,0,t3_5vmsab,I Redman Multiplayer Modeampnbspgt After completing the game an additional game mode unlocks where the host andor client becomes the Redman and actively hunts new survivors.ampnbspII Deeper Cavernsampnbspgt The current state of the game leaves little for the underground after the limited number of caves have been explored. While I in no way desire some random dungeon generation code I would like to see much more added to the spelunking. Theres a lot of untapped potential for caverns. Subterranean lakes mushroom forests more twisted mutants and cannibal types more crazy ritual madness skinning rooms for the new mob types anything really that adds more to the actual lore of the objects and the existence of the cannibals. Preferably something dark and disturbing.ampnbspIII More Pseudo Moral Choicesampnbspgt Along with the new Redman mode it would be great to see more flexibility in gameplay. Like encouraging the player to become violent and cannibalistic themselves. It would be great to get more tribal like structures to make to go along with the more animalistic play style. The sanity rating needs more impact. Let the player become frightening to the cannibals maybe even by becoming a new character the Blueman using the available paint options. Basically just more interaction with the Cannibals and their mechanics. I would never advocate anything peaceful between the player and the tribes but fear and anger or even a type of respect might be viable options.,TheForest,de3cg8e,25,t5_2t178
