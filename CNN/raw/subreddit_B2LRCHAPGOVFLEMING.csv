1812678,0,t1_ck7j3dz,So youre saying that they dont care until it directly affects them. Okay but what about when it does affect them. Do you think at that point they would be more open to post it on social media or still be hesitant and just not talk about it like you said. ,B2LRCHAPGOVFLEMING,ck7ltzu,2,t5_335lq
2903308,0,t3_2svg09,I also think this would be very interesting. I dont think that things will ever be completely normal again. They are moving past the situation but that memory will always be there. ,B2LRCHAPGOVFLEMING,cny41o6,1,t5_335lq
3084970,0,t3_2vfaik,I think this event definitely makes us question certain stories we see on television. We all now that social media has a HUGE impact in news. Investigations should and Im assuming will take place but I just see it as kind of an eye opening situation to most people and the new broadcasting network. ,B2LRCHAPGOVFLEMING,cohr7qo,1,t5_335lq
3105279,0,t3_2v8njk,I think the state takeover is a good thing. Something had to happen. I know that the board was recently elected but the LRSD has been in decline for years and I attribute that to the board not being fit to run a school system. I did my last project on something similar and I feel that before we go back to being an independent school district we need more requirements to be on the board. ,B2LRCHAPGOVFLEMING,cojv05x,1,t5_335lq
8794961,0,t1_d73g19c,I do not simply because the people that are chosen to represent us will not always take into account the other partys ideas or issues limiting freedom.  Yes we have the freedom to vote but does it matter if a bipartisan approach is not reached and a good percentage of the population is left unsatisfied with the decisions made on their behalf?,B2LRCHAPGOVFLEMING,d751a2r,1,t5_335lq
8843792,0,t3_5178j1,My opinion on Colin not standing for the pledge of allegiance is perfectly acceptable. Management and the NFL as a whole I believe should not take a stance on this issue lest they wish to start controversy. America I believe is one of the most patriotic countries in the world today and the pledge of allegiance has always been a big deal. Players just as anybody else should have the right not to stand for the pledge if they do not wish to. Since this asks about my opinion on the situation I do think that wearing the socks seemed very counterintuitive to what he is trying to accomplish. If he were only trying to raise awareness for black lives matter movements could he not have done so without such an offending picture?,B2LRCHAPGOVFLEMING,d7awchv,1,t5_335lq
8863001,0,t1_d7chx2r,If every NFL player refused to stand during the national anthem it would have an effect on the movement I believe. If its just kaepernick then it probably wont do much. But I do think he is genuinely trying to help the movement and raise awareness of the problem.,B2LRCHAPGOVFLEMING,d7d7i14,1,t5_335lq
9116824,0,t1_d87kssp,I think the teachers leaving could have one of a couple effects. If a large majority of teachers good teachers leave and make it vocal that they are protesting the policies that could make the schools think twice. However if just a few teachers left especially if it includes ones who are openly gay the school could just see it as their policies being successful. So the impact lies in the scope.,B2LRCHAPGOVFLEMING,d87p0ry,1,t5_335lq

9506717,0,t3_5a8jzn,I would go for legalizing Euthanasia in all  states but I dont think I would just hand the patient what they need and let them walk out the door.  What if they didnt actually have an illness and wanted to kill someone else using this method.  If we are going to legalize it in every state Id say it would have to be in a controlled setting so a hospital could work heck you can probably do it in your home but I would like the doctor to administer the doses.  I wouldnt feel comfortable with someone doing it themselves.  Id feel much better if I know a trained professional will carry out the act. ,B2LRCHAPGOVFLEMING,d9kwm0o,1,t5_335lq
9659077,0,t1_da39gdf,I would only agree with the popular vote if we could establish a secure system that would ensure that an accurate accounting of individual votes from eligible voters.  Currently most states oppose voter IDs.  I dont think you could have a popular vote without them.  ,B2LRCHAPGOVFLEMING,da3om0l,1,t5_335lq
9824422,0,t1_dald2hh,The votes are being counted accurately and voter fraud is very rare. While in person voter fraud and voter registration fraud do exist they are very very rare and have no impact on any election. According to the Washington Post theres four confirmed voter fraud cases in this election three of the four were trump supporters. Trumps comments about  illegal immigrants voting is completely false and has been debunked by many fact checking sites. He also says a million dead people are voting which once again is false. While it is a problem theres quite a lot of dead people still registered to vote virtually no one claims their identity in order to vote. The reason is no one else cares whom wins as much Clinton and Trump do. Half of the people who voted for Clinton were Bernie fans who settled for Clinton and most of the Trump voters settled for him because they all just vote for a party not a president. What this election shows us is that the electoral college is stupid useless and outdated by  years and that the president is just a semi democratic but not really elected king. Both the electoral college and the president are outdated and harmful to the nation. Why should well over half the nation as it always is have a leader they hate. In a true democracy the people should be their own leaders not a rich old white man who knows nothing or a rich old white lady who thinks shes entitled to the presidency because shes a clinton or bush. If Clinton had been elected that wouldve been  out of  years of the ClintonBush monarchy. In a country of  million people something seems wrong with that. But now we have a racist rapist so either way it wouldnt have been good. So what the people need to do is demand real change doing away with the electoral college not want a recount in a state with  electoral votes out of .,B2LRCHAPGOVFLEMING,dao55c9,1,t5_335lq

10373701,0,t3_5o72o7,Ultimately the main focus should be on what they can do to strengthen and improve not only the country but the world as a whole. However it is true that our leaders will be naturally looked up at as role models for children and other individuals. So of course they should demonstrate ethical behaviors in their daily lives and possess a strong moral compass so that our future generations can be influenced in a positive manner. ,B2LRCHAPGOVFLEMING,dcjx6hz,2,t5_335lq
