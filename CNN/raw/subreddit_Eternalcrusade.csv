The purpose of the Founders program is to allow serious customers to voice their opinions of what they want and dont want in the game. Being grabby and greedy shouldnt be condemned when we paid money to do so.  I agree that sometimes the complaining is out of line  when it comes to graphics and such in the early game modules.

5448566,0,t3_3pk0ha,Ill take a whack at this cause Im allowed. Im also biased. And a very bad person. I also like tea. And driving over people in tanks. Anywho onwards.gt I am going to use a lot of other game examples here because I cannot really pin down what this game has to offer in total now or generally at all. I have seen the initial scale of the game km x km per the release statement. My question here is  is it like Planetside  where its capture leave rinse repeat.. without any tangible benefits? PS plays more like a giant FPS and not an MMOFPS..if that makes sense. Theres no depth in capturing a base and keeping it.Our goal right now is multiples of territories each territory including  maps  outposts and  fortress as a single map. We call them open territories as opposed to one single open world. There is a larger theater of war for continents that have campaigns for factions rewards etc which is largely player controlled by a group called commanders.gt What does this game have in terms of RPG depth? Are there builds and unique weapon skills etc? I see they are spoken about in the FAQ but Id love to see nonNDAbreaking skill trees or whatever thats out there.Character progression visual customization personal loadouts itemization variations of weapons armor and gear for loadouts and so forth. gt How is lootgear drops handled? I assume since this is PvPmainly with some PvE? vs the Tyranids that the loot drops from killing players?Loot is end of match as well as other sources but we do not have loot drops as such. There is PVP and PVE both of which affect the larger theater of war.gt Are there resources to this game? I see you can spawn vehicles so I imagine theres a cost associated with that?Yes and no the theater of war level is about resources resources give benefits or can be deployed to territories as part of assault or defense of said territories. Resources are assigned by commanders or by faction leaders us as part of campaigns. Resources that are deployed are deployed in territories by warlords  on each team. Vehicle spawns are right now very simple but there are vehicle loadouts limitations and resources can affect type and number of spawns.gt Are there aircraft like the one pictured here in the banner here?Yes but not directly player controlled they are more indirect actors to begin with.gt Is the gameplay pretty slow in game? Meaning I have seen videos and right now it looks slow and clunky like Firefall that disaster.In the Alpha surveys the main complaint right now is TTK being too short Time To Kill which one could argue is an indication of it being too fast.gt In your opinion what is going to make this game successful? Me my team and the founders but mostly me of course.gt The Warhammer IP is being used by so many horrible games these days plus the MMO days seem to be numbered as a whole genre.. and for large scale FPS combat we do have Planetside  still even if its rather shallow. So what would keep me wanting to log in and giving this game longevity?Because when me my team and my founders have developed and launched this game you will crave only war and it will be here waiting for you.And me.And of course your progression the campaigns the theater of war the free expansions your guild your friends your thirst for blood.,Eternalcrusade,cw83uvx,8,t5_2xj04

Not to mention Ive read dozens of novels. So I too have some lore experience.gt Quality control. Does GW have any voicesay in the matter?They do but as you know they hand out licenses to everyone it seems like their standards have fallen dramatically the last years. This company is no exception. They use the lore to the extent they need to create a team deathmatch game which isnt impressive.Just login to see Space Marines of all chapters running around in the same team organized in random squads with any number of classesweapons. Today my squad had  Aspiring Sorcerer  Traitor  Devastators heavy plasma spam FTW!  Raptor. Spread all around the map because respawning. There is no teamsquad cohesion built into the game no purpose just pick a weapon and blast away.Oh and about the backstory to this game... the jury is still out. They are hiring and firing writers and we dont really know what is going on in Arkhona. tldr its a team deathmatch game with a K skin.gt Early Access is meant to test the game using public criticism. Not ding dong ditch the hell out of the market never to be seen again.A very valid concern but they have said that they are fully funded. This isnt a tiny company many of the people working there are wellknown in the industry. They are legit. We will see a release for sure.gt Will it have life after release? Being popular is important in what I consider a niche universe on steam.I wouldnt bet on it. I mean it might but it might not. Since there wont be an open world forget Planetside nobody really knows how the campaigns will play out. The shooter is fun I have  hours logged but I already feel tired. Matches are pretty random hectic unpredictable. Just mindless slaughter.

9091384,0,t1_d83soyf,Yes and No.Yes for the reasons you specified.No becauseYou will need increasingly more matches every step of the way to gain something thats random. With the k amp k crates its okay because that takes very few matches to attain even if you completely suck at the game and you can get k from a single match if you play wellthe team is not incompetent but when we start coming up on the k amp k crates thats where the real problem lies.Say I play  k REQ each matches for a k crate I open it and I get an attachment for a weapon that Im not even using at that point Im probably going to stop playing for the day. P Id rather have the option to keep buying cheaper crates be able to get duplicates of stuff and then have the option to use several duplicates to get a higher tier item looks at Warhammer End Times  Vermintide for example  regular Boltguns  Master Crafted Boltgun.Obviously that system has its own set of pros and cons. The absolute best thing would have been if we had more than  ranks got crates when we ranked up and better crates at certain milestones as well as a small chance of receiving crates if you perform well in a match.   sure that this has been suggested several times on the official forums throughout development Just my  cents teeth.,Eternalcrusade,d84myo9,1,t5_2xj04

ECs melee system is casual and bland comparatively.  EC is Battlefront  with Witcher s basic melee stuffed into the rest of the game pad buttons.  ,Eternalcrusade,de41yfk,1,t5_2xj04

11262071,0,t1_df8iuzn,Yeah unfortunately you wont be able to rename. I doubt support would be able to help but wont hurt to try.

11274788,0,t3_60x0wz,To add the the PVE tips melee is terrible against tyranids because often times they surround you and they take a couple of hits compared to what you can do in a few shots from a gun. If you have a higher leveled melee character the best you can do to support the team is to kite around the tyranids if you really want to go melee. But youll also probably get shot by your teammates as well from friendly fire.Lair missions do require a bit more mobility so having only  heavy weapon is recommended with the rest being regular shooters with a medic.,Eternalcrusade,df9zbkb,1,t5_2xj04

11428234,0,t1_dfqe9in,gt I just started as well. Are there any good youtube tutorialsweaponvehicle reviews? I feel like Im missing a lot. Any tutorial video Ive seen seems to assume you already know what things do. Ive been using the Eldar Dragon Fire gun to take out armor... but it feels very inefficient compared to Ork Melta bombs. Whats the best way to take out armor as an Eldar?I think most tutorials dont speak that much about the specific gear as most of the veteran players are warhammer nerds. Many take it as given you know the lore which includes what to use against what. About best way to take out armor always attack the rear. Fire Dragons can equip double MeltaBomb two to the rear will kill any vehicle. Fusion gun has short range and thus short damage falloff range see in loadout stats get close.gt I hop in vanu Eldar tank thinking the main cannon second seat will rip through some enemy armor... it was kind of a sniper rifle that you had to charge? and seemingly did no damage to enemy armor. Can you change the loadout of tanks?Tank loadout is WIP not comming in the next two months.gt I still dont understand how the game modes work. I know you take and hold points... but I still never know whos going to win till its over. Does respawning drain tickets like in Battlefield games?Theres usually three points to capture each got a little icon at the top of the screen. Each point icon has a little clock icon next to it untill it gets captured from the attackers the first time then it grants a time bonus I think  minspoint. Right next to those icons is a little bar yellow as attacker red as defender that fills up faster the more points the attackers have captured. Once its full attackers win. On Fortress maps defenders have tickets. Attackers win if they take all points have to be in order or deplete all defender tickets. Same goes for the game mode that Zedek runs in but I cant remember the name. ,Eternalcrusade,dfrdmri,2,t5_2xj04
11502257,0,t3_643e9z,gt Thoughts on the rangers?If they are going to be elite or veteran classes with limited spawns the devs could just as well not bother adding them.
