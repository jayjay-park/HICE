We have been together for over  years and we werent trying but we werent not trying. It never happened after years of unprotected sex and then one day I didnt start my period. I guess we just assumed after years that it wasnt going to happen naturally and at the time we werent prepared to pay out of pocket for fertility treatments.Ugh I wish both of our SOs would go back to day shifts and just be sweet most of the time. Also they wouldnt put us down. Im sorry for your situation too it feels horrible. I have tried ignoring him and being mean back but it just isnt me. So I usually just end up crying by myself. I havent really just tried sitting and talking to him so I will. I am going to try not use attack words but more feeling words. Hopefully it works. I hope you can find a way to get your SO to come around. OMG I know all about the men who treat their pregnant women like queens. When I went to that appointment alone a couple was there and the guy helped her in and out of the chair was holding a little baggy with her snacks holding her water bottle he even set up a pillow before she sat down! Needless to say that made me feel worse than I already did. I could have lost it right then and there in the damn lobby.But yeah my SO has his good moments I just wish he wasnt so mean lately. Like when we were visiting family my mom told me to sit down while they were loading up the car for me and my SO to leave. Some of the stuff was pretty heavy. He told my mom dont let her fool you she can get the rest of the stuff. WTF. It wasnt that much stuff but it was heavy. He could have done it himself but my mom was just being nice and helping so I wouldnt have to because I get really bad back pains.Come live by me Ill be your friend. Lol. I will taxi you we have two cars one just hangs out because I never go anywhere. At this point Id kill for a girls day even if it was just running errands.

57270,0,t3_1uq195,You sound like me when I was pregnant with our first. I had quit my job for various reasons and didnt look for another job bc we were trying to get pregnant and we both wanted me to be a SAHM. When I did get pregnant I was so excited but we ended up staying in our one bedroom apartment so that we could pay off debt and save for a house. Most of the time I was okay but other times I would get SOOO jealous seeing all the posts about nurseries because we wouldnt have one  it does get better though. My husband got a few raises and switched to a better paying job we should be debt free with the exception of our car which is okay within a few months and pending background and credit checks which shouldnt be a problem well be moving into a  bedroom apartment within a month! The desire to want some things may not completely go away especially when nesting sets in but the urge is not as strong and you get creative finding cheaper alternatives. When you can spare some money for extra stuff scour garage salesthrift storesconsignment shops for maternityfurnituredecorations. Also look up some DIY decorating ideas for framing your art and look up places you can get free materials to make them. My sister spoke to someone at a cable company I think and was able to get two of their empty cable rolls for free she just had to pick them up. They look like big thread spools and she set them up as bookcases in her sons nursery and it looks really cute!,BabyBumps,ceky8a1,2,t5_2s7cl

The days are not so consistently intense anymore and sometimes i feel like my normal self for an hour or two at a time and in between are shorter periods of crazy time. Ive managed to completely alienate both my parents and its been a strain on my marriage and my relationship with my  year old. Its been all consuming but less so now that im not constantly nauseous. All that being said ive also been on progesterone supplements since  weeks and im maybe even still reeling from coming off BC in august and it only taking  cycles to conceive. Luckily i have a very patient enduring husband and a forgiving and loving daughter and we will all be fine. But its been harder than i want to admit to myself. I recently narrowly avoided passing out from a panic attack and my blood pressure is running higher than ever before.

68483,0,t3_1uw05a,I had mine at about  weeks because I was visiting my family who all lives out of state and it was just the most convenient time. I didnt really get all that much thats been useful though. Almost everything we actually need weve had to buy ourselves.

68543,0,t3_1uv4kn,I went to the man that had already delivered ALL of my nieces and nephews at the time. It was a large hospital practice but one of the hospitals he delivers at is a mock birthing centre. Everything is done in one room your baby stays with you  piece bathroom attached to every birthing room etc. It was great. He delivered my son will be delivering my daughter and up to date has now delivered ALL  of my nieces and nephews. And my friends son I recommended him as she had no idea where to go. I love my OB. Hes an older Italian man with gentle hands and caring attitude. He always makes sure that youre as comfortable as you can be answers any questions. And lets you make all the decisions. Hes basically antiCsection unless you medically need it. Will let you go to  weeks if you want before inducing. He even did my sons circumcision not starting a debate. Just mentioning that its part of his aftercare All of his staff are amazing and the in house ultrasound technician is his wife. She has dated and gendered all  of the babies that Ive seen born with them and never been wrong. I will always go back to him until Im done having children and would recommend him to any pregnant woman.Edit Being referred by my sister helped. It was just coincidence that he is one of the most recommended OBs in the province. Hence why his office is so large and busy.  Edit  also because my OB works out of  different hospitals I can choose which hospital I want to deliver at. ,BabyBumps,cem8eb3,2,t5_2s7cl

89981,0,t3_1v3yvd,You can find great inhome child care facilities that ARE regulated I would not go with one that is not. Many of the rules for inhome child care are more strict than with centers there are more inspections in most cases consistent provider many centers have high turnover rates as they usually only pay minimum wage with poor benefits and a great home environment. Many studies have shown that inhome child care is much better for infants because they have a consistent caregiver less disease spread and it is a home environment. In a center your child may have a different provider several times a week. That doesnt give them any chance to bond with their caregiver. There  are a few drawbacks you would want to have a good backup provider if the provider becomes ill they may not have a substitute to work for them and they would have to close for the day. You would have to find other arrangements while the provider takes a vacation typically twoweeks a year. Most good providers have their vacations lined up many months in advance to make sure their clients know ahead of time. You may have to pay for holidays and vacations when your child is not there many providers have in their contracts that parents will pay for holidays. Check your contract and make sure you agree before signing. Call your local CCRR they are an excellent resource for child care ,BabyBumps,ceoo8tj,1,t5_2s7cl

100083,0,t3_1v8jju,Well I guess on the bright side at least youve got her conditioning you to be squicked out by it which youre not rather than intimidating you with how awful and hard it is?I loved breastfeeding didnt find it difficult wanting to do it again is one of the reasons we decided to have another baby and not to adopt.  I was lucky enough to have a long line of proboob women conditioning me that its just how you feed a baby.  Oddly enough those lovely women are the minority in my extended family.  Aunts cousins inlaws friends acquaintances everyone else was full of how difficult it is.  Like having a good breastfeeding experience is unicornscarce.I am probably biased and judgy because I had such a good experience but I honestly believe that these attitudes are the reason why almost every women I know in my generation has not been successful breastfeeding.  I never comment or question because I can only imagine how I would have felt if I had been unable and I would NEVER poke that wound for someone else.  But I always wonder.  Ive heard every reason under the sun from friends and relatives about how it just didnt work for them and it makes me sad.  I cant believe that this many healthy women with healthy babies were physically incapable.  Maybe lots of them just didnt want to which doesnt bug me at all.  But I think a lot of them gave it up because they had been intimidated by the women in their lives.Sorry Im so wordy.

Everyone i mean everyone will ask are they twins? Does it run in your family? Are they boys or girls? You will hear it over and over. A trip to the grocery store will take an extra  min because you will be stopped so much. What my boyfriend and i do is each take a baby and split up the grocery list and go our seperate ways this way we only occasionally stopped becausewell because our babies are freakin precious anyway. Twins are not bad i swear!! When one is hungry feed the other. In my experience dont try to set a schedule with them they will fall into their own and you will just follow key. Podee bottles saved my life also a nosefreeda invest in one they are only like bucks but it will save you from a screaming child mine actually smile now when we use it. You will learn patience and right when you think you cant handle it anymore two smiles will emerge and it will melt your goshdarned heart!

139755,0,t3_1voqo6,No I havent been through exactly what youre describing but I can tell you anytime I google absolutely any symptom I am feeling it automatically gets my brain going into overdrive of EVERYTHING IS WRONG AND HARMFUL TO THE BABY.Have you ever read TripAdvisor? Or maybe Yelp? If so youve noticed the people that go on those sites tend to be a bit more dramatic and negative about their experiences.  That is how I try to view Dr. Google. Its going to give me the absolute worst outcome I could ever imagine.  I googled Gums bleeding during pregnancy and one of the results I got back was that all of my teeth are going to fall out. There was even stories of ladies who FELT their own teeth were going to fall out! Omg! Now for sure my baby probably wont even develop teeth. Nice eh? Youre right  you cant unread what youve read.  Thats the difficult part.  Have you ever read the side effects from over the counter medications? They list everything on there including what youre taking the medication for!What Im saying is of course youre only going to find bad things. People only want to talk about the bad and how it affected them not about the good because guess what? No stories ever came out from the woman who had hypothyroidism and had a perfectly healthy baby.  So heres the deal.  Before your other appointments you now know what your primary care doctor needed you to know.  You can take this information and bring it to the High Risk OB on Wednesday and ask the High Risk OB who has in all likelihood seen this before what does this mean? Until then listen to your husband  do not google this for more horror stories and worst case scenarios.  It will do nothing but bring your stress level up!Best of luck and please keep us posted!,BabyBumps,ceucjbw,2,t5_2s7cl

With this one it is even worse. She was at least told what was wrong with her so she did feel somewhat validated...but she is worried that it wont get better and she will have this for  months with a  year old.  I am currently living farther away from her.  I feel really helpless! I keep sending her support and I am trying to get my family to do things.  No one seems to really understand how sick she is.

178059,0,t3_1w4sim,Let me first say congrats! I breast feed with an occasional bottle of pumped breast milk. But thats only if I need to go somewhere for a short period of time without baby. Anyways in my experience breast feeding hurt a little at the beginning but I powered through it and now its a breeze. In my opinion its so much easier to pop baby onto my breast than to wake up and make a bottle when you are already exhausted and tired! I was told by my nurse at the hospital to use a nipple shield since my nipples were getting a little raw. I used it and it was awesome! Baby was able to breast feed easier and eventually after a few weeks I stopped using it. I love the bonding experience with my daughter. I am actually typing this as she sleep nurses! Anyways breast feeding in my experience is amazing but its not always for everyone. Im not faulting anyone who uses formula. I understand each woman and baby is different! ,BabyBumps,ceyprr6,2,t5_2s7cl

Not a labor and delivery nurse and I still wouldnt expect her to get a lot of the choices Ive made but its shocking to hear her say ignorant things like my pelvis is too small. Shouldnt she understand the anatomy of childbirth? I dont really want an opinion about me that isnt coming from my midwife. The thing she got my husband with is that there is a ten minute travel time to the hospital and she scared him into thinking that something horrible will happen and the baby andor I will die on the way there. I told him its not as if the midwives would just freak out and start panicking they are trained medical professionals that have procedures to deal with this stuff.

He even made up negative things my references said about me to try to make it seem like he took a chance hiring me. I know for a fact that my references said no such thing about me. The things he claimed they said dont even make any sense. They are things nobody would ever have reason to say about me.

236396,0,t3_1wt8gc,We opted not to have it done. We have a very small chance of the baby being born with a very very very rare genetic disorder so our first thought was lets test for everything under the sun. After talking to our OB and Nurse the assured us that the NT test isnt  and can cause more stress than needed. We had already decided that heaven forbid something was wrong with the baby we would keep and and deal with the rest later. Our OB basically sat us down and told us that most insurance companys wont pay for the test and that anything that needed to be caught will be found during the Anatomy Scan later on. Since we knew we would keep the baby no matter what the Dr basically just told us to save the money and wait it out. Our OB is fantastic and is in the business of taking care of people and not making money. We feel great about our choice and will be having our AS this week. ,BabyBumps,cf5935r,1,t5_2s7cl

If you go in armed with as much knowledge as you can you can make better informed decisions for you and baby.

I would have her discuss everything at her next appointment and see what his take on it is but I highly doubt he would say shes gaining too much weight. The only way I can possibly see that happening is if she just gained  pounds in the last month but as long as its been relatively steady seems perfectly normal!,BabyBumps,cfaq9tj,7,t5_2s7cl

292938,0,t3_1xght4,There are two kinds of pumps personal use and hospitalgrade. The latter are usually higher quality but not always. The main difference is that in hospitalgrade pumps there are special valves or other setups that prevent any possibility of milk getting into the pump itself and getting moldy spreading disease etc. Your friend is probably giving you a personal use pump PISA etc.. Personally I wouldnt have any issues with it as long as I bought new tubing and sterilized everything else but you should be aware that tiny particles of milk may be inside the pump itself. It would be difficult but possible for those particles to cause problems with the milk you pump. Ive seen Medela hospitalgrade pumps for as low as  on craigslist so thats what I chose to do but in most cases its pretty hard for milk trapped inside a personal use pump to cause issues so I wouldnt be that scared about it. ,BabyBumps,cfb4m85,6,t5_2s7cl
293165,0,t3_1xgfrv,The baby might still change them its still just an idea to them and that doesnt have as much emotive power as an actual baby.  But really it isnt necessary to subject yourself to their learning process.  Cling to the good eggs like your brother and just be firm with the rest if you cant say anything nice.  Either they will improve with time after the baby arrives or they will be less and less involved as the baby is old enough to understand and be affected by their behavior.  My sister was a bit sad thinking her children wouldnt look like her because she married a Chinese man but she was dead wrong.  Her girls look like you ran her photo through a program to make her look asian.  Very very much her babies.  That may be what it takes to make it real for your family.  If not youve got your own family now.  It isnt always what we hope for but it works out. ,BabyBumps,cfb5gsr,2,t5_2s7cl

I never felt anything last time except for the tummy twitches.  how far were you last time?  i only made it to six weeks.  so the fact that youre not feeling anything is normal ... i dont think you feel anything until  weeks or more.youll be FINE with the first year.  thats what being a new parent is about.  figuring that stuff out.  the second one you know what you are doing!  not sure about the boobs.good mother you will be.  the fact that youre worrying is proof.  as far as your husband finding you attractive that is something youll need to discuss with him.  dont feel selfish.  thats a normal feeling.  its just something you need to let him know  you are scared about.GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR RAINBOW BABY!,BabyBumps,cfbuuqs,1,t5_2s7cl

I could see why they let it have a chance at life. It had a good chance of being born healthy and normal compared to that other poor child. Also in this situation the father was for the mother being kept alive on life support. What was so fucked up about the other one was how it was being done against the consent and it was pointless because the fetus was so damaged. ,BabyBumps,cfd144k,15,t5_2s7cl

327696,0,t3_1xuau4,This is strictly my personal opinion but I had an elective induction when I was exactly one week over due. It lasted  hours and ended in a csection because P was trying to come out all wrong plus he has a huge head. I really really wish I hadnt been so anxious and would have just let my body go naturally. It was possible I would have still ended up with a csection because of his position but at least I would have had the peace of mind that my body went into it on its own. That being said many people have routine boring inductions and everything goes wonderfully. For me personally I think I tried to make him come before he was ready and my labor was really hard on me.Ask lots of questions at your next appointment and do what you feel is best for you and your little one  obviously no matter what route you go its completely worth every bit in the end.,BabyBumps,cfeqiuf,2,t5_2s7cl

With my past pregnancy no one ever really looked into it other than sending me to get blood work once a month but never actually doing anything but keeping an eye on my levels.

For me it helps my anxiety to buy things bit by bit so we dont get overwhelmed plus it helps our bank accounts recoup after big purchases  we have bought and received WAY too many clothes first baby girl in his family in  years and havent even had a shower yet haha but we are having fun and the family is excited so we are just going with the flow.

367195,0,t3_1yaosk,Are you high risk? If so that could be the norm for your practice for high risk patients. Because otherwise I havent even heard of getting a  week ultrasound let alone additional ones unless your fundal height was way off your weight gain was way off or things seem way off in general and they want to check on the baby. Or I guess if you get past  weeks they often do ultrasounds to check fluid levels.So to answer your question that doesnt SEEM like normal practice. The only difference between nd and rd trimester appointments is the increase in frequency instead of every  weeks you go every  weeks.. and I believe weekly starting at week . If at any of the appointments there are potential problems like protein in urine or other pree signs THEN they might want you to come in more often. If you havent been having issues this seems strange to me.,BabyBumps,cfitppq,2,t5_2s7cl

Obviously it is bad parenting to stick your child in something restrictive for a long period of time because you do not want to engage with the baby. That would do damage to them. But letting them entertain themselves alone for a bit in a portacotcotplay yard I think is good for them plus I think it is unrealistic that a parent has to engage with them every second of the day.

I would get so angry at nurses in the hospital telling me to wake up my sleeping newborn! Uh no thanks were both gonna nap for a bit. As someone mentioned there are an ass load of hormones quickly leaving your body and thats bound to make you feel poorly. But it never hurts to call your doctor to just let them know plus they may be able to suggest a med that can helpYour emotional feelings while completely normal are scary. I learned the hard way that there is nothing wrong with seeking help. Again maybe its just baby blues a term I began to hate as I dealt with ppd but it never hurts to let your doctor know. That way  if it gets worse and theres no way to tell doctor will already be aware and ready to help. Physically and emotionally this is the hardest time of your life and you are not alone!!!!Big hugs!!! And dont forget to take care of yourself!

The dr said we could still have sex since I didnt have any symptoms besides the weird discharge  no smell or burning or itching  but I still didnt want to do it. Honestly  at this point I could take it or leave it. And because I could take it or leave it Id rather just not risk it and not do it. I feel sooo guilty because SO is such a great sport and I do LOVE having sex with him when Im not pregnant. I dont want to bruise his ego but I honestly reflexively want to punch anyone who touches me so getting into the mood is tough.

431930,0,t3_1yzkem,I put a few pricey things on my registry but only because I was specifically told by various relatives that they wanted to buy the stroller or car seats or cribs and I wanted them to know exactly what brandtypecolor we wanted. Otherwise I probably wouldnt have put those items on the registry. I was also surprised looking at other registries to see breast pumps and whatnot. I basically decided that anything that had the words breast or nipple on it I would leave off the registry. I just feel more comfortable buying all that stuff myself and Im not sure who would look at a registry and think yeah Im totally going to get her that nipple cream! I didnt think anyone would buy the more practical stuff for us like burp cloths and bottles but those were among the first things people purchased for us on the registry. So that was nice.  As for clothes I registered for quite a bit of clothing not because I thought people would buy those specific items for us but so that people looking at the registry could get a sense of our style. I thought that maaaaybe if people saw over and over the kinds of clothes we wanted they might understand our aesthetic. But nope we ended up getting a TON of gender specific stuff for our boygirl twins we wanted mostly neutrals. So much pink and blue. I mean dont get me wrong I actually love both colors. My iphone case and my nintendo DS are both pink! But jesus christ I cant believe how much pink stuff people got for my girl. And nothing but dinosaurs for my boy. Im totally going to mix up their wardrobes so that my daughter gets to wear dinosaurs and my boy is gonna end up in some of the pink stuff.

She takes the baby for about an hour every night because LO ends up screaming around the same time every night  and my mom somehow knows how to get her to stop crying.

My SO also thought he might have a problem as he was in a long term relationship before and they didnt really take precaution but it never happened...I thought I might have a problem because my cycles were semiirregular and I wasnt sure if I even ovulated every month.Second cycle of trying and we found out that we are both functioning DALSO!!!!A lot of women in Greece do not want to have kids in their s. My cousins were telling us that over there most women focus on careers and that they dont want to ruin their bodies so they wait until their s...

Because its totally possible that eating food alone wont provide the necessary nutrients. I am allergic to whey so I cant consume any milk products but since my bloodwork has come back fine my midwives said I dont need to take vitamins to get the calcium and vit D that I am otherwise missing from not eating those foodsI happen to eat leafy greens and such instead and it works for me. Anyway Im not implying that anyone is cheating by taking pills or that theyre not putting in enough effortyou just read my comment that way because you already feel disappointed that you have to take a supplement.

This pregnancy was so different from my first that I was convinced I was having a boy and was horribly sad about it. So I took myself to baby stores and looked at all the little boy things and tried to make myself excited about it so that whenif we found out it was a boy I wouldnt be sad.It turns out that worked so well for me that when I found out she was a girl this time too I got a bit sad because it felt like my boy had been taken from me.On another note youre  weeks.

Youre the patient in this situation.

You inviting her is clearly a formality. If I were her Id take this as a deliberate slap in the face and your way of saying you dont care enough about her to plan your new date far enough away for her to get time off to be there. Your mental health issues have nothing to do with this. You could have set the new date for May but clearly you care more about your own plans than you do about having your sister there.I would bet solid money thats exactly how shes viewing this and you owe her a massive apology for treating her as disposable in your life.,BabyBumps,cfxnju4,8,t5_2s7cl

If its a little low they will check after an hr if within normal range they check every  hrs. My daughter was given some formula because her glucose was on the low side it did get better after that and the rest of her glucose was fine.

Not to mention fears of the actual birth.This is so me. My boyfriend had to sit me down and have a talk with me the other night about how I speak to our daughter. He will see me after a long day at work give me a hug and a kiss and then lean down and ask my bump How is my little Hermione today? I dont really do anything like that. Pretty much the only time I speak to her is when I say stop kicking me and usually in a pissed off tone not a funny one.gtI dont want to share my partner now that things are finally stabilizing. I want him and my family all to myself. I want to continue being the youngest. I dont want to be committed to being an adult all the time.I dont know what to say about sharing your partner or family but as I hear it becoming a parent brings you close to childhood again. Imagine all the time you can spend playing imagination games that people will respect you for doing because youre playing with your kid. gtMaybe hormones are making things seem worse than they are. Maybe Im just being a drama queen. I dont know. I think its anxiety. Sometimes Im surprised by what anxiety is making me think or feel. I think that because youre experiencing dissonance between having these feelings and not wanting to have them its not so much that you REALLY resent your son or REALLY dont want to share your partner and more that you have an anxiety fueled thought feedback loop going on that is making you have these intrusive thoughts.Do you have a therapist you could talk to?

I had to say it because we could only bring  parent helpers due to physical space on the coach. Obviously  the more help the better but sometimes its just logistics. That time a parent came in the car as he was desperate to come no probs I gave him a group of children to be responsible for. The fucker got bored I guess halfway through the day and left us at lunch and a group of children without an adult without even telling me. Another time I had to say no to a very pregnant literally about to give birth mum because we were going to the zoo and there was a pot of walking. I didnt want children to miss out on learning because she was exhausted or baby decided to turn up.Okay so the middle part was a vent but there will be another side to the story.,BabyBumps,cg5pfhl,12,t5_2s7cl

Amazon has a nifty feature that allows you to add items from other sites as well so I had items from Target and Ikea on the registry too. Another nice benefit to the Amazon registry is that people can just have the gift shipped directly to you which minimizes the hassle for people having to travel. I also found that people are going to go and pick out stuff they like too. Most of my guests stuck to the registry but a few picked out some other nice things on their own from local stores and from Amazon.,BabyBumps,cg5q923,7,t5_2s7cl

They are more like nothing else sounds good except fill in the blank. And if I have something else I feel pretty blah about it and still wish I could be eating blank. And will continue to want blank until I finally eat it. Sometimes food will even taste weird or off if its not the thing that I want.  Like right now Im always craving Indian food. If I have a normal supper of fish and rice and veg everything will taste bland and boring and I will have no motivation to eat it and I will be grumpy about it. And sometimes even the smell of the food will make me turn up my nose even tho hubby will say that its good and tastes normal and will chow right down.  So basically they are nothing at all like the cravings you see on TV. Id call them more consistent preferences that alter the desire for other foods more so than cravings. ,BabyBumps,cg6t9gn,1,t5_2s7cl

Itll be hard but stick with it. Well isnt labor sort of the same? And even nonbaby related things...if you say you want to lose  pounds or stop smoking its the same reaction You can do it!

Ive read stories of women who got a second ultrasound from a different technician and the nasal bone was actually there.I had my NT scan friday but had already done the first blood test so they were able to give me preliminary results.  It only takes a week to get the blood test results back so hopefully you will be able to put your mind at ease soon. I can understand the anxiety... before this pregnancy Id never made it past  weeks pregnant and my mind is full of all the things that could go wrong and had gone wrong.

681594,0,t3_21ytnl,No. This is not what you get. He needs to step up to the plate or move aside pretty much. He needs to do what he has to do. Not because he wants to or when he feels like it. He needs to do so because he NEEDS to plain and simple. Dont be afraid of being too hard on him. Worst case scenario rally some people to drive your point home or speak to his parents about your concerns for him and his unwillingness to do what needs to be done. He may be afraid and thats ok and I sincerely hope he changes his tune but to trying to avoid it isnt the answer for him. You should not be babysitting him by filling out his applications...thats absolutely ridiculous.  You can do it. He can do it. You need him on board to be able to both do it though. Have a serious conversation about what needs to happen and hopefully that helps. Good luck.,BabyBumps,cghqxnt,3,t5_2s7cl

Ive seen women gain massive amounts of weight and not look bad at all and Ive seen women not gain much but puff up like a parade float.  Its not real its not weight.

We had one tv and we never had cable. Now I look back and realize that I did so many great things during my childhood. I spent time with my family I loved the company of my siblings and I embraced everything I had. I think kids here in the US are way too spoiled when it comes to the latest things.

767846,0,t3_22xwth,Like many others have said you need to talk to her and stop her in her tracks. Its okay that shes so excited but you have to set clear boundaries. With my MIL we told her that its fine if she wants to get stuff for her house for the baby but it isnt really okay if she dresses a whole nursery for herself while we have little to nothing. She was so okay with that and the result was that shes been basically buying us a ton of stuff we need. Shes going overboard but as my husband is her only child and this is her first grandchild were not going to stop her. Chances are that once you give her a reality check and remind her that this is you and your husbands child that she will not being watching the baby alone for quite some time that what you say is law she will probably calm down. It doesnt have to be a negative conversation but it does need to be honest and clear so she has no room for interpretation.Good luck to you!,BabyBumps,cgrk4u2,1,t5_2s7cl

Relax and wait for your sweet babe to arrive.Word of caution if these fools are bagging on you for staying at a hotel while youre waiting to go into labor they are going to have ALL KINDS OF DUMB FUCKING OPINIONS AND IDEAS after the kid is born.

769662,0,t3_22ypny,I was  weeks when they started. They are uncomfortable. Change whatever youre doing. If youre lying down walk around. If youre moving around a lot take a breather. Go pee drink a big glass of water. Dehydration or having to urinate can cause them. It sucks but you will adjust. I find putting something warm on my belly or taking a warm bath relaxes my uterus and they subside. Dont automatically freak out. Have you felt the baby move yet? If you have just take note if you feel them move again in the next few hours. Go to the hospital if you are bleeding. ,BabyBumps,cgrrk66,1,t5_2s7cl

791514,0,t1_cgtve3t,Not at all to personal. We kind of had the best of both worlds you could say. They took her and tried resuscitation but it wasnt working. The Dr. then approached us and told us they could keep trying if we wanted to but they would not recommend it. So we were given that hour with her wrapped up in a little blanket with her cute little hat. Just like a normal baby. I was wheeled back to the room with her and they got our parents so they could meet her.  The hospital staff was busy taking pictures that we now cherish. After she had passed they bathed her and put her into a little diaper and took even more pictures. We have all of that in a memory box provided by the hospital. They were wonderful.The only advice I can give is to value each second your baby is inside of you. I hated being pregnant but now I miss having her inside of me. Next to meeting her the night I spent in the hospital hearing her heartbeat and hearing her kick at the monitor she HATED it made me feel closer to her than anything else had. ,BabyBumps,cgu8z44,1,t5_2s7cl

If nothing else it will give you peace of mind.I dont know that the laws are like where you are but even though youre not married you may be considered de facto since youre living together and are having a baby. The lawyer will let you know what exactly they can help you with but things like child support custody. living arrangements etc. It may be that if you leave your shared apartment the onus is on you to find a place to live whereas you may be better off staying and kicking your ex out.

849002,0,t3_23tusb,Wow this is good and hard to read. My little girl is  days old at this point and is NOT a fan of the breast. She was in NICU for  days where they gave her formula but since we got home shes been on breast milk exclusively  the only thing is its almost all from pumping. We were so focused on making her gain weight she started small and was perilously close to the dreaded  drop that I havent been too bothered but now she is gaining and it is time to get on the breast! Its good to hear a story of success although it has obviously been a long and difficult journey for you!

Personally I dont feel I have to wear a ring to prove to other people Im married.  Anyway story time...  When I was visibly pregnant with my first my husband and I traveled to Pennsylvania to visit my best friend who I hadnt been able to see in almost a year.  She lives in Amish country even though shes a pretty liberal atheist lol.  We stopped to get gas late in the evening right before we got to her house and there was an Old Order Mennonite man filling up his passenger van next to us.  If you dont know Mennonites are willing to drive vehicles theyre a bit more liberal than the Amish but still super stuck up.  Anyhoo I got out of the car to stretch my legs and stand with my husband while he pumped gas and while I did we got the nastiest looks from said Mennonite man.  The crazy thing is that I was wearing my weddingengagement rings.  Now trust me these are the type of rings you cant miss  big and shiny.  But apparently that didnt matter a bit because he would look at my husband with a disgusted look then at me.  Then at my rings and all the way back around.  I eventually had had enough and asked him if he had a problem.  He just shook his head.  Ugh!,BabyBumps,ch1rghb,0,t5_2s7cl

It may take some time for Medicaid to kick in so the Planned Parenthood advice is also ideal I think there are  locations in my state  offer prenatal care or affordable referrals for prenatal care.My best advice would be to start Googling adoption agency in blank to find agencies to start calling. They can probably give you better guidance. I had hoped to find one site that served as an aggregated phone book of various agencies but couldnt find one. Most adoptions now are various forms of open adoptions which could bode well for you a family gets to be created and you still get to have a bond and relationship with your child.Look many people have been in your situation. There is a solution and there is a way out of it. I went through infertility and if we had the money would have loved the chance to adopt in my case ended up conceiving naturally after some time.As others are saying this could also mean paid medical and living expenses for you for the remainder of your pregnancy. ,BabyBumps,ch5dgx1,7,t5_2s7cl

897180,0,t3_24dq4i,The drink was not bad.  It was like uncarbonated orange soda.Heres what happened to meI was fasting overnight.  I went in first appointment of the day.  Because I was predisposed to GD I was already in for  hours even though it was my first test.  They drew my blood and then the phlebotomist offered me my choice of orange lemonlime or fruit punch.  I went with orange because I figured it would taste like orange soda.  The bottle is about the size of one of those Chubby sodas you see kids packing around with them at school and they ask you to down it before leaving the room.  I left and then sat in the waiting room for an hour.  In that hour I had a very mild headache and my baby threw an absolute fit  or Im sure he would have if hed been born.  Ive never felt him move so much.  After the hour was up they drew my blood again rinse and repeat.  My headache got a little worse at this point but I am also on a very strict breakfast schedule due to the way that I work and it was about  hours after my usual breakfast time had come and gone by this point so Im unsure if it was the drink or the hunger that was starting to get to me.  By this time there were a lot more women in the waiting room and I was really glad Id scheduled at  AM.After the third draw she sent me home with instructions to eat a highprotein breakfast so I went to McDonalds lol and got two sausage egg sandwiches with no bread and devoured them and almost instantly felt better.  I did need to nap after I got home but that was it.I also passed despite being overweight insulin resistant and having PCOS.Woop!Its not always horrible.

Since she was a girl we decided to give her both of our last names MR. Figuring at some point shell be old enough to determine which one she wants a bit backwards I suppose but it worked for us. Now heres where it got tricky he M took on his step dads name after marriage to his mother since his biological dad D wanted nothing to do with him so step dad adopted him. R is my by marriage last name because my mom was bat shit crazy and changed it because she didnt like my biological father S who is in fact an amazing parent. When my daughter was born due to insurance reasons I had to give her my by marriage R last name which was bitter sweet. SO my daughter has two last names that in reality have no tie to either one of us by blood.If youre concern is long term what if this doesnt work? I would do the your last name or doublebarrel it. My daughters first name is Jillian Elizabeth but she goes by Jillian  in all she has  parts to her name and while a mouthful she always get compliments on how pretty it sounds but everyone is different and maybe Im a horrible parent.

Your doctor is trying to scare you. Second all you can do is take care of yourself now but do not try to lose weight.  Just try to slow the rate down keep a journal to see what works best. The worst thing about gaining too much weight while pregnant is being overweight and pregnant and having extra weight to lose after.  ,BabyBumps,chitans,13,t5_2s7cl

Im not an expert so thats why I told her to research it herself too. I just listed what works for me. OP could also look up the differences to simplecomplex carbs. I am just suggesting that she doesnt cut out carbs completely and rather goes for the healthier options of carbs. Generally if you are picking the brown version of things rather than white then you are making a better choice.

1013294,0,t3_25ojok,I have three boys two are my own. Im having a girl this time sorry lol so I cant compare as she isnt here yet but let me tell you some things about my sons. Theyre awesome. Especially my oldest and I think its because he and I were on our own for the first couple years of his life before I met my husband. Hes seven now and he is ALL about me. He never wants to snuggle or hug or love on anyone but me. He tells me he loves me a zillion times a day. And hes a super awesome big brother who cannot wait for his little sister to be born so he can protect her. Hes even already volunteered to be a guest at her future tea parties. Hes picked out a few of his stuffed animals to give her when shes old enough. My stepson the middle boy and my youngest are also super loving and sweet but theyre a bit more independent in that regard. My toddler would rather be running around like a crazy person literally running in circles until he wears himself out than spend much time cuddling but that just means when he does cuddle its even more special. He gives me kisses and says adorable things like thank you mommy. He also wants to do everything his big brothers do at all times. He mimics even the smallest gestures and he goes where they go. In fact now that I think about it he DOES love cuddling he just prefers to cuddle with his big brothers lol. Its really sweet. My boys all together are hilarious and goofy and yes theyre gross but its funny as hell. I wanted a girl each time I was pregnant. I had major gender disappointment with my second since I already had one boy I had really been hoping for a girl. But its trueonce theyre born you totally dont care anymore. You forget all about the girl you imagined and you fall in love with your son. Yes there will still be times when youll walk past the girls clothes in the stores and youll sigh. Youll still feel a little twinge of jealousy when you see parents with their daughters. And then youll see the teenage girls and youll be glad you had a boy because teenage girls are awful haha. ,BabyBumps,chjgvo5,2,t5_2s7cl

My pastor actually sought me out to praise me because he saw me at the store wearing makeup. He wanted me to know that he was glad and thought all women should go back to looking nice before going into public. Every girl who went to that church had that praise given by the men in the church who we should listen to because they are men and older so they know everything s. It was just my upbringing and life until recently. My friend raised in the church is to the point where she shows up to college with no makeup hair in every direction and just not caring since she just wanted to learn. I hope to be to that level by the time I graduate  Keep being a nice guy who doesnt judge.

1023775,0,t3_25tnbe,Im a dog trainer my dogs are also driving me crazy and I love them to death! Some things you can doSince your husband isnt on the same page as you with couchesfurniture go buy a bunch of those super cheap fleece blankets and give him a treat every time he lays on it. This will show the dog that good things happen when hes on it and well encourage him to lay on it more. You can also say blanket when you give him the treat. Then as the dog catches on you should be able to just say blanket and the dog should go there.For the begging if your dog has a bed you can do a go to your bed command. Throw a treat into the bed and when the dog gets it say bed. The dog will soon associate the word bed with going to the bed. Then try just saying bed and see if hes caught on yet. Dobermans are very smart and should catch on quickly. For the whining when the dog isnt whining say quiet and give it a treat soon it will associate being quiet with the word quiet and hopefully stop so much whining. And when it does whine you can tell it quiet and hopefully be quiet for you.As far as neutering goes I would do it if youre not planning on breeding. Not only will it make him behave better but the rate for testicular cancer is pretty high if you keep them on. I hope this helps I know animals can be frustrating especially when hormones are flying everywhere. Also a disclaimer this will not work unless you and your husband are consistent. So make sure you get on the same page. PM me of you have anymore questions I would love to help. Good luck!,BabyBumps,chknr8s,8,t5_2s7cl

1028880,0,t1_chl7gmg,gt how awesome breastfeeding isThis pisses me off there is a poster in my local medical clinic that lists all these lovely words about breastfeeding... empowering enjoyable so forth.. but I just find it not only insulting to those having trouble with breastfeeding but giving some false expectations to those about to start.The real message should beBreastfeeding  It is tricky to learn and hurts if you do it wrong. Its exhausting boring awkward and judged by society. Why do we do it?Because it has been medically proven to be the best for your baby unless advised otherwise by your doctor and the biggest part of being a mother is putting your baby first.I personally hate breastfeeding but I am quite good at it.

1054159,0,t3_2652th,I feel like I should expound on the crib thing a bit more. She called me late in the evening at a really bad time to tell me she was giving me a crib. My initial reaction was elation because thats an expensive piece of furniture to cross off the list. Then she goes on to clarify that she doesnt want to just give it to me because it was her sons hes in his s and it has lots of sentimental value. Instead she wants to loan it to me indefinitely. Oh and by the way its a drop side and she knows those arent allowed anymore but all that safety recall stuff is just nonsense. I couldnt really respond and had to get off the phone. A few weeks later she calls asking if Ill take the crib. Kindly I tell her I appreciate it but Id like to have a crib of my own one that I can become attached to and maybe use for a second baby and then store in the attic for  years like she did. Besides I would feel terrible if hers became damaged somehow always a possibility with kids. She seems to accept this and harasses me about other stuff. A few more weeks go by and she calls me again to say shes decided to just outright give the crib to me so I wont have to give it back. Grrr I still dont want it. Its unsafe and also white and I want a black one for the decor.  So I lie and say my mom a first time granny is so excited to pick out baby stuff with me and I dont want to deprive her of crib shopping since she wants to buy it. Thats reasonable right? She accepts this and lets it go. Again she calls a few weeks later this time to tell me she is bringing the crib anyway. My mom can buy one for us but she will need one for the nursery in HER house! Thats quite the assumption. I tell her my mom will not have a nursery at her house and I cannot accept furniture for her without speaking to her first. Well apparently my mom and I will both see because she will want a nursery at her house and I should just take the crib anyway so well have it. At this point I have no choice but to be forceful and outright refuse. Neither my mom nor I have room in our houses for extra furniture and my mom really doesnt have a spare room for a nursery. not a problem because I intend for my daughter to live with ME O.o I suggest she find someone in need to give it to if she really needs it gone but she doesnt want it to go to just anyone. I guess she decides to keep it. One last call on the subject. She has solved our problem! She has another packnplay that my mom can keep at her house for sleepovers. It folds up and she can store it in a corner behind other furniture. Its really amazing how much she knows about my mom considering shes never met her and never been to her house. I tell her my mom has a playpen already. She tells me we really ought to have two. In utter defeat and incapable of keeping the annoyance out of my voice I let her force the second packnplay on me. The really funny thing is that she hasnt brought it over and hasnt said another word about it. After typing this out I feel like most judges would grant me a restraining order for this type of thing.

1073668,0,t1_chqbcq5,Except diabetes isnt the only way you get a big baby. Ive had three coworkers undergo csections recently because of big babies. None of them were diabetic gestational or otherwise. And dont forget that boys tend to run a little bigger I had a girl.  I definitely agree that you should keep him in there as long as feasible. My daughter did end up in the NICU briefly inhaled fluid on the way out and then had some issues stabilizing her blood sugar levels which we sort of expected. Anyway we were told that she did so well simply because she was REALLY full term. She cleared all the fluid from her lungs in a few hours and was able to eat immediately. Breastfeeding was a bit of a challenge because of the delay in my milk coming in but we were able to get that straightened out pretty quickly too thanks to a good LC. The doctors repeatedly told us that we were only in the NICU for  hours because her lungs and desire to eat were so good which was really just a function of her being so well developed.  So even if it means a csection your baby will likely be so much better off going closer to that  week mark provided all your BPPs are good and the placenta is doing what it should. Since he may have issues stabilizing his blood sugar after birth the more full term he is the better he will be able to eat and the less chance you will end up with a NICU stay its not a place you want to be. Trust me..   What is interesting is that the first OB I saw was eager to either csection me or induce me at  weeks she practically had this planned when I was a mere  weeks pregnant!.  I am really glad that I switched OBs to one that was more willing to take into consideration all the data we had available. I will also add that my daughter was measuring smaller than her finally size  at the last growth sonogram the perinatologist estimated that she would be around  lbs  oz at  weeks. Because I had so many growth sonograms the perinatologist was pretty confident in her estimation and even said I highly doubt she will be over  lbs.  Well we ended up at  lbs  oz.Finally DO NOT forget that those amazing ACs and they are AMAZING for a T have played a huge role in maximizing your chances of having a healthy baby and being healthy yourself. Size is really the least worry we Ts have when having babies. Congenital heart and organ abnormalities miscarriage and a myriad of other complications for the baby and mom are all significant possibilities when you cant maintain a good AC. By keeping your AC in that range you have done something incredible. NEVER FORGET THAT!! Youre giving him an amazing start. So you have absolutely no reason to feel like shit. Its highly probable that he would have been the exact same size if you werent a T. ,BabyBumps,chqbw0d,1,t5_2s7cl

So we walked up and down every aisle and we were in a new grocery store so we walked down some of them twice and a third of the way through I was having some really bad hip pains. Made my husband walk behind me as I pushed our cart so he could briefly massage my lower back. People were taking FOREVER and I wanted to just break down and cry. I was NOT a happy person. I remembered my mom said she got a really bad back ache the day before she went into labor with me.

Your friend was an asshat for blundering on with his opinions on birth especially since he didnt even stop to consider that his preferences might not be available to others.

1291202,0,t3_28v7gw,When I got pregnant I had almost the opposite reaction.  Id wanted a baby for... ever.  Really I went from being totally sure I wanted a baby to totally freaking out and wondering if wed made a huge mistake.  I think something that happens when you get pregnant is that suddenly things are clarified.  Many women who were sure theyd get an abortion if they ever got pregnant suddenly realize they really want to have the baby.  Women who were sure they wanted kids now have to take a more realistic view of circumstances and what that means.It sounds like this experience just clarified for you that you definitely want to have a kid... and combined with the loss youre feeling desperate.  I think it is reasonable of your husband to want to make sure youre not just acting out of grief which he may be calling hormones or the pregnancy high or whatever... sometimes we humans suck at language... maybe set a timeline for processing that event.  Since it sounds like you guys are doing ok financially perhaps you can suggest to him that you have a couple of counselling sessions to cope with your grief together as well as to explore your desire to have a kid on a sped up timeline.  That way you can communicate with each other using a third party and it might make the translation a little easier.  ,BabyBumps,cievknp,2,t5_2s7cl

1311704,0,t3_293vwg,A good friend of mine went into labor while dropping her daughter off at school about  miles away from the hospital. I didnt get a message from her until she was already checked into LampD and wanted to know if I could come pick up her  year old. Her husband was out of town on business and her oldest kids had moved out of town. When I got to the hospital I asked her why she didnt call me before or drop him off at my house on her way to the hospital. She said she was worried she was going to have the baby in her car and only had the focus to get herself to the hospital sort of a mommy adrenaline rush! I dont think any of us can say what the moment of your labor is going to entail. Theres so many stories of long labors and fast and furious labor. Because my first was a pretty quick labor I have the same concerns as you. I work in an animal hospital about  miles away from my house and it would be another  miles to the hospital. My husband and I share a car so I would need to drive myself home to pick him up and then have him drive us to the hospital. Really hoping I go into labor while Im at home or have a scheduled induction at  weeks. There is nothing on the side of the interstate between my job and home to even pull over and ask for help. I have horrible visions of having to call  to see if I can get a police escort home or to the hospital. I have a friend thats a  dispatcher in our county so I plan to give her a heads up to listen for my call! ,BabyBumps,cih6lym,6,t5_2s7cl

1317396,0,t3_2960jl,My midwife was a megabitch to me at  weeks after Id only gained  or  pounds. Took the opportunity to give me a blunt Youre fat you dont need to get any fatter. Needless to say switched to a different one. Hoping shes less of a bitch.I absolutely know what you mean about the medical bias. Its like Fat...but doesnt have high blood pressure blood sugar or cholesterol just cannot compute. First midwife told me that because my moms diabetic and because Im fat she wants me to get the Gestational Diabetes test sooner. OK cool.What bothered me when she asked about my moms medical history was that after asking if my mom had diabetes she turns to me and says Is your mom real big too?It was the one time I wanted to say Yes BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY she doesnt get off her ass ever she hasnt seen a vegetable or fruit in years and everything she eats comes out of a fast food bag or box. You can be overweight and not be a walking stereotype. Its just those kinds of attitudes that feed into the stereotype that everyone who is overweight has diabetes or is going to get it. Not that weight doesnt play a role at all it certainly does but even then you cant just look at someone and say Yep diabetic. Her entire attitude after that was just Well youre fat you probably have it so well do it at  weeks. My fasting blood sugar is around  and an hour after drinking something carbloaded like EquateEnsure g carbs its usually between  and .Im with you though. Ive seen some in the medical world who are so biased that they will continue to push you through additional testing and push drugs on you... simply because you are fat. A friend of mine went to see her primary care doctor for the first time and he immediately handed her a prescription. She asked what it was for and he told her it was for blood pressure. She responded that she didnt have high blood pressure. He took her blood pressure  which was a pretty normal ish  but insisted she had to have it or she would soon develop it.Thankfully she had the sense to tear it up and find a different doctor. But thats the sort of bias and negligence that could get somebody killed. The gestational diabetes screen makes me nervous because I can see this office trying to push me into the glucose tolerance test even if the screen comes back normal and while Im fat I fall into normal people fat range. No one would ever give me  a double take.But I can safely say that it seems like most people here get shit. Even the thin women. Youre fat you seem to get a little bit more shit but everybody around here seems to stew in their crap at some point. Im  weeks in so about what  or  weeks behind you OP? and still up around ish maaaaaaybe  pounds. Im on track to gain   . They act like at this point I shouldnt be up any poundage at all or that I should be losing weight Im actually in the  to  advised range. My weight gain for how many weeks Im at is in the low to midrange. But they wont let YOU know that!Just wanted to let you know that you are far from the only person going through this crap...I feel for you and I hate it. ,BabyBumps,cihto8o,3,t5_2s7cl

It hasnt been easy but I think my girls will grow up well it helps that we all have my amazing husband though I will not be the one teaching them most skills in the next few years as I work toward tenure. My twoyearold knows the sound of our coffee grinder all too well. But Im good with that I also sing her to sleep every night. No mom can do everything. But modern moms dont have to relinquish their identities for those of their children.

What I will say is that you wanted an all natural birth when you were  for the sake of your baby but theres nothing wrong with choosing intervention. I think a lot of us ladies put unnecessary pressure on ourselves to do the natural birth because society tells us its more acceptable. But whats the point of modern medical advances if you are made to feel bad or guilty for taking advantage of them? If you need any kind of intervention  or even if you want to just for peace of mind its your choice. Theres no wrong or right way to give birth. The main thing is that you and your child come out of it with minimal impact and trauma.,BabyBumps,cioyara,3,t5_2s7cl

She wasnt able to breast feed which the doctor said isnt unusual with that kind of difference in size and is usually a sign of a hormonal imbalance or lesser milk producing ducts on the smaller side. That said with pregnancy andor vaginalbreast problems NEVER be afraid to talk to your doctor about it. This probably isnt indicative of anything serious but sometimes embarrassing things can be and should be discussed so they are in the know. Trust me.

1402102,0,t3_2a6k71,The good news is that youre right  if they really thought the baby was in distress theyd have wanted to induce immediately and not wait the week and a half to  weeks. That said Id want more information if it was me. A sudden dropoff in weight like that can indicate that there really is a growth problem due to a placenta issue blood supply issue any number of reasons or it could just be due to how the baby is lying or an inexperienced ultrasound tech. An interesting article about the correlation between estimated and actual birth weight  Id be hesitant to agree to a week induction based on a single ultrasound. Maybe ask for a followup ultrasound and BPP before going ahead with the induction? You have to go with what feels safest to you though.,BabyBumps,cis183j,5,t5_2s7cl

I like to take a nap in my car at lunch and then take another one when I get home from work. Everyone is different and Ive found that the moms and dads to be in this subreddit are so nice and very supportive so dont be afraid to ask questions!

I told my husband we need to get as much of the big stuff out of the way now while Im in my second trimester or else hes going to be putting everything together himself!I love sushi I used to eat all kinds of sushi almost every week. I just choose not to eat anything raw or undercooked because this is my first pregnancy and Im hesitant about it. I still eat sushi I just steer away from something that is mainly raw fish.

1489490,0,t3_2b8oah,This list is excellent. One thing I would add if you are planning on breastfeeding is Vitamin D drops. Your breastfed baby will be advised to take Vit D and the one that is easiest to find at least where I live is DViSol which requires a HUGE dose that baby hates the taste of. So dont get that one. Instead get some of the ones that require just one tasteless drop like these or similar. I put a drop on my nipple before he latches or if I forget I express a little milk into a spoon and add the drop and then pour it in his mouth. Easy and much tastier!,BabyBumps,cj2zdid,6,t5_2s7cl
1489598,0,t1_cj2z1hx,Yep. Especially with long wraps because you can thread the wrap completely through one ring and theres no knotting at all other than what you would normally do with a ring sling. Basically you double the wrap up.

You know what his legal responsibilities are to you amp baby. If you cant afford a lawyer there might be organizations that help abused women and you might qualify. These are things you owe your baby and theyre your first priority. THEN you can work on developing a healthier relationship with him so you can see if you stay together. If you want that theres no shame in it and if he wants that also then you can have it. He might just be freaking out because his life has changed. If he sees that leaving you wont miraculously turn him back into a teenager with no responsibilities he might snap back into reality. But your FIRST priority right now is what the baby needs all the resources you can provide and not what you want your husband back.

1504714,0,t3_2beu07,so I work in a hoity toity area where the majority of ladies have their last names hyphenated as do the children for status reasons. oh I say good chap are you one of the Texas Smiths or the Arkansas Johnsons? The last names are never dropped when speaking to them or about them or just the initials alone. Now aside from the fact that little Baby Boy SmithJohnson is not going to accidentally forget what his last name is and other people tend to use the name they are given to call someone by....I dont really see where the issue is going to arise. Other than the fact that Id say that the consistency with which you drop one of your hyphenated names his usually? would lead him to fear this happening with his kids too.Which leads me to question that perhaps your husband isnt as new world as he previously thought and feels a little slighted now that kiddos are on the way if its an ego thing only then I dont think youll have to tie your self to a full out name change over an archaic right of passage but you will likely have to have the most over the top understanding conversation youve ever had to get to the root of his feelings. I can say that in my experience parents who have completely different names from their children as in not even one of the names is the same it is a very big issue in the ER. It is an issue to pick up your children from school clubs activities where youre not known by the other parents....etc If you are JohnsonSmith and they are SmithJohnson you all will forever be correcting the order get sick of it and THEN youll have the name drop....usually itd be for the last of the last names....since it is actually the LAST name. ,BabyBumps,cj4w0p3,2,t5_2s7cl

1554251,0,t1_cjazbvu,I know exactly how you feel.  I feel so unattractive but when you dissect the psychology behind porn watching its actually harmless.  I know for me it rarely has to do with how the people look hot or not although no one really wants to watch unattractive people have sex its more about the positions and whats happening to the person.  I unfortunately either never have enough time to imagine things and get off without porn or just dont have the creativity.  All it does is give that stimuli that speeds up the process.  If I were in your shoes Id be like Get your business done so you can come and take care of me.  Once his mind is clear its so much easier to focus on you.  Even for me its purely biological sometimes where I just physically need to get off ESPECIALLY with all these hormones.  Once I get off I can focus on work or whatever I need to focus on.Think about it how often does your SO masturbate for more than  minutes?  And after hes done its not like its lingering on his mind.  He forgets about it and moves on.  If I noticed my SO start to wander or he was suddenly distracted Id say Ok.  Go get off so you can focus.

We do what we need to when we need to in the world we live in.

1613934,0,t3_2cs70e,Especially with your experiences in mind your feelings are so so understandable. And yeah the lack of symptoms can be terrible. The first weeks months of my pregnancy I didnt feel pregnant at all. No nausea no sensitivity to smells no sore boobs. I was so afraid something could happen I didnt want to make an appointment with a doctor. At around  weeks I forced myself to go Im not in the US so healthcare is different here and it was fine. I continued to worry until late in my second trimester. I didnt tell a lot of people I was pregnant and people who rarely see me didnt learn until month  or . And looking back I think I was so stupid. Its totally normal to worry and being a parent makes you worry even more but now I think its best to take it one day at a time. Youre pregnant! Yay! Thats wonderful.  Yes something could happen... But youd be devastated then no matter if youre happy now or if you worry constantly. I know how hard it is I really do. But maybe you can enjoy being pregnant more than I did. ,BabyBumps,cjilq1m,3,t5_2s7cl

If he had any questions or I had some we just noted them and asked my OB at my next appointment. My OB appreciated that I was so wellinformed as was my husband.They have a really great infantcare video as well. I just rented from the library at no cost. I did take a breastfeeding class that was offered at the hospital and had my hubs go with because I wanted him to get to ask any questions he had about feeding since he was going to be a SAHD and be feeding baby pumped milk.,BabyBumps,cjim0ch,2,t5_2s7cl

1622943,0,t3_2cwddq,When I told my husband I was pregnant he was excited said he hopes its a boy and that was the last time we talked about me being pregnant till I was  weeks along and found out we were having a girl. Turns out he was just worried this pregnancy just wouldnt stick with my medical background and the doctors pretty much telling us not to get our hopes up. Once he saw her on the screen which mind you was the second appointment hed been to and the last he has been baby crazy. Hes totally on board with her being a girl even though he wanted another boy and he has been interested in everything ever since. Chances are he may just be a little hesitant to discuss things till he has a real moment for him. Just dont give up talking about the pregnancy because hes not. I discussed names aloud both for girls and boys and opinions on both even if I felt like I was talking to myself it made it a lot easier to communicate when he finally was ready to talk about it himself. ,BabyBumps,cjjqkg5,3,t5_2s7cl
1623784,0,t3_2cwymt,YES I have something similar going on!  Only its under my left boob not my right one.  It started maybe around week  or so week  now?  Way before baby started kicking.  It always hurts but ranges from mildly annoying to downright agonizing.  It will wake me up in the middle of the night.  It hurts to wear a bra.  My midwife has been totally unhelpful basically just well maybe its ribs expanding though its rare to hurt that much we wontcant do anything to figure out what it is suck it up.  I actually just called back today and the doctor is letting me take some Motrin to see if it helps.  I hope it helps.  Its DRIVING ME BATSHIT. My next step is to try and get a referral to an obstetric physical therapist.

Needless to say when I came out and they saw GIRL everyone was surprised PThen when she was pregnant with my brother she had the typical boy symptoms again so they all thought he was a girl hahahaha D WE ARE TROLLS!

1631019,0,t3_2czlzp,In most states she has no right to your children unless you and your bf break up or if he dies.  If you are both in agreement about her not being involved with your children in most states that prevents any grandparents rights.  But if she isnt interested in your other two kids why would she want to be involved with this one?  Your BF does need to stand up for you though she should not get away with criticizing youyour parentingetc. just because thats how she is.  Its not being disrespectful to his mother to ask her to respect the mother of his children.  I would not be okay with your BF taking your children to visit without you there.  Who is to say that she is not complaining to your kids about you?  Plus thats exactly what she wants your BF and the kids without you.  Theres a reason that  of her  kids dont talk to her.  Completely drop the rope.  Dont remind BF to call his momget a birthday card for hervisit heretc.  Let him deal with her .

1632334,0,t1_cjkw1dm,Since you have reactions I would talk about this with your OB because you are a special case. They want you to get it in your third trimester because it also gives the baby the antibodies from the vaccine. Newborns dont get their first dose of tdap until  months of age. If you were to get the shot after delivery it wouldnt really be affective for a month or so afterwards. Vaccines arent instant and need time to develop the antibodies in your body. Late than never is always better if in your case it would be better to wait until after delivery due to your reactions.Just also discuss with your doctor about close relatives who will be near the baby about getting the booster tdap vaccine. I NEVER even considered doing this  weeks ago and honestly chuckled at the women here freaking out over their in laws refusing to get the vaccine. After the news report a few days ago urging people in my state to get it due to the increase in cases....Im biting my tongue.,BabyBumps,cjkx5le,2,t5_2s7cl

During our  week ultrasound he or she was very comfy in there and the tech had to try to get it to move around.  Also I havent felt movement that Im aware of yet but it still might take a few weeks.  Im sure you will see the baby move on the anatomy scan!  I wouldnt worry about showing people show at different rates and Im sure before too long you will be showing plenty.If you have a supportive partner you will be ok.  My husband is not always as interested in doing baby stuff with me registry etc but it feels much more real and imminent to me than it does to him.

1683378,0,t3_2dn33e,I did some preemptively  I knew wed fall back on unhealthy or convenient meals once the baby was born so I made roughly two weeks of frozen meals from scratch for us to eat after baby comes.

1683475,0,t1_cjrbauz,Oh Honey! I wish youd had better medical care. Abilify is a Category C medication. That means theyve done controlled studies in animals that show fetal side effects but that they havent confirmed that in humans. We dont really know the impact but it hasnt been severe enough to show up in the studies that have been done on this medication. Buspirone is category B. It has been shown in controlled studies to be safe for your baby. Its the same category as benadryl.For reference Category D means they found fetal side effects in human studies. I was taking Depakote a Category D med before I got pregnant. That was something my docs wanted me off. The lithium and lamictal are both Category C and in my case its better for me to be on those meds than to risk taking me off. Its actually riskier for the baby for me to go off because I get so unstable my hormones go apeshit and its more dangerous for the baby. Im also miserable and thats not good for the baby either.Every pregnancy is different. Immediately stopping your psych meds was a really bad idea. If Id been your doctor you would have slowly started titrating down dropping your dose and been closely monitored for mood stability. Do you have a doctor you can talk to about this stuff? Can you read more and educate yourself so you can advocate for yourself with your doctors?Bipolar is not just having mood swings. I know you know this. It can kill us if we dont take it seriously. I hope you get more help.,BabyBumps,cjrd5cs,8,t5_2s7cl

Literally he got paid today and INSTANTLY all the money got sucked out by the bills I just want a life where we dont have to worry about having enough money.  at least our stuff is paid for. Also husband is upset at me because I dont want to eat as much...I cant help it that I dont get hungry...nothing looks good ever. Ugh. I had to force myself to eat a sandwich right now. I also miss him so much. He is working really hard to support me and the baby and I am so incredibly grateful to have  him as a husband instead of some deadbeat who doesnt give a crap. Sometimes Hes too tired after work and it breaks my heart but he still does it the next day. I am feeling so anxious to meet my son. Its like ever since I turned  weeks the days creep by. Its so annoying. I want this baby!! Also i feel fucked up that I dont want to be pregnant anymore? I feel so handicapped and I hate it. I hate not being able to do the things I want to do.

1697025,0,t3_2dsv8c,I live in Canada and we do not get an option to have a csection just because we dont want to birth a larger baby.  I know many ladies who have successfully done a natural delivery of babies ranging from  lbs. With first children csections are only done if medically necessary. I had am emergency csection with my first after an unsuccessful pitocin induction which was necessary due to preeclampsia. I have every intention to try for a vbac if everything is healed well and I have have the option to. I think its important for women to realize that a c section may sound like an easy out of the pain of childbirth or just a faster way to get it done but it is in fact very serious abdominal surgery.

1715303,0,t3_2e235j,First  THEY MAKE YOUR HUSBAND LEAVE YOU ALONE IN THE HOSPITAL WITH YOUR NEWBORN BABY? What kind of hospital is this?!?!?!? Are you in the US? Seriously Ive never heard of this before.Second  ask your doctor about the baby doing an overnight in the nursery. While it might be hospital policy sometimes once youre actually there the actual doctor will make decisionslet you do things that are against traditional policy. Also youll have just had major surgery and youll be alone  so Csection  tubal or just tubal somehow I doubt this hospital is just leaving babies and moms who are recovering from MAJOR ABDOMINAL SURGERY alone all night...I would once again strongly inquire with your doctor that this is the actual policy. I mean you could be in a lot of pain still and they could be giving you a lot of pain meds you might be in no shape to be caring for a baby and in that case they will have no choice but to take the baby to the nursery. They probably just say its not an option because they want new moms to room in.Third  from pm until am when your husband is not there if you do end up having to room in with the baby you hit that nurse button every time the baby makes a peep. The nurses will change diapers and bring the baby to you to feed. If youre bottle feeding they will get bottles ready as well. Since youll have just had surgery you probably wont be getting out of bed so they will HAVE to do these things. Youre hardly going to be able to move to grab the baby from the bassinet so they will be in and out of your room all night.,BabyBumps,cjvdjss,8,t5_2s7cl

Most of the doctors dont know how to handle a birth when an episiotomy is not given and refuse to attend one if they cant cut. They also do fundal pressure in all births which is a whole nother issue.Luckily I was able to find a birth center with a doctor who is fine with letting things go a bit more naturally. Most of expats in this country go to this center for this reason. Perhaps there is a place like this where you are? You might need to ask around.I also hired a doula who I trust.

1777556,0,t3_2eusg0,My baby is breech rather than transverse so I cant commiserate exactly but personally I found all the spinningbabies stuff to be a huge waste of time. What I would recommend is the Webster chiropractic technique. I think if I had started going sooner it would have flipped my baby but by the time I started  weeks he just didnt have much room to turn. After my first adjustment he really tried his best to flip but just couldnt make it all the way around. I had never been to a chiropractor before but it was awesome. I havent felt so relaxed in years. Its basically a really good massage that my health insurance paid for. So even if it doesnt work at least it feels great very much unlike spinningbabies.,BabyBumps,ck37rys,1,t5_2s7cl

I did accupressure on myself to help encourage labor to start lots of youtube videos with demonstrations and it definitely worked active labor began within  hours of starting but dont try until week .

Lots of supportive ladies.  you were one of them just the other day for me! Now Ill try to be one for you.Ive been through childbirth once and Im still afraid of it. I cant lie I dont remember exactly what the pain feels like now  I just know it was unpleasant! But I lived and on a scale of  my pain tolerance threshold is at a  on a constant basis. I cant even know when my blood is being drawn or I will cry. I stub my toe and it is the end of the world. Im not even allowed to go to Weenie Hut Jr.s. I have to go to Super Weenie Hut Jr.s I sure hope youve watched Spongebob. If not forget the reference. My point is it does suck but it is less than one day. The real shitty part is the constant dull pains the following few daysweeks afterwards. Not because theyre unbearable but because its really annoying. Before you know it youll be right back to complaining about menstrual cramps again like you DIDNT just pass a watermelon through your bajingo. Bodies are weird. When its over you wont even think about it again unless you get pregnant again  it was the first thing I thought about when I saw the two pink lines.I would recommend looking at womens shelters. I understand the pride being an issue thing. I never went to a shelter but I did live off of just about every type of welfare for the first year of my sons life after he was born. It didnt feel good but these programs are in place for us to use them to better ourselves. Its not a permanent solution and they can really help you figure this stuff out because its hard on your own! Youve got a million things you want to do and have no idea where to start. Utilize these services its what theyre there for. Nobody is there to feel sorry for you theyre there to help you become independent. Its quite admirable.You and I get the added bonus of playing the parts of both mommy and daddy. Lucky us! I say that sarcastically because it is shitty to know that for whatever reason our guys cant step up to the plate and help us take care of what they helped create in a gentlemanly fashion. We did not fertilize these eggs ourselves! Although sometimes I wish I did because then we could probably make buku bucks with science research. You and I seem similar. We have our good and bad days  sometimes we have both good and bad days in the same day. Such an unnecessary roller coaster that is not intended for us to be ridden right now while we are trying to grow healthy juicy babies. Your responses to my thread the other day comforted me. Hopefully this helps you a little bit too although I know its small consolation for the experience we should be having right now.You know my inbox is always open to you. ,BabyBumps,ck647sk,2,t5_2s7cl

Fivepoint harness is the way to go!I am having twins soon and have an older child so I registered for the Valco Zee Two.. which is very similar to the BJCMD.  I got it because of the rd seat option which BJCMD doesnt have.The things that mattered most to me in strollers were . LIGHTWEIGHT amp Compact fold. Hoist  lbs every mall trip? NO thanks. Both of these strollers are the lightest fullfeature ones on the market at  lbs.. SidebySide.  Easier pushsteer and no child feels unloved.. Reclining seats for naps.  wBJCMs canopy they practically have their own nap cave.. Narrow enough to fit through doors.  Both ZeeTwo and BJCMD are the width of a wheelchair.. Fivepoint Harnesses.

As hard as these first daysweeksmonths will be theres one thing I can promise you for sure it WILL get better. It really will. My son is . months old now and there were times when I cried more than him. I thought my life was over that this child is the worst mistake Ive ever made. But it got better. I have the most adorable little guy I could imagine. Im starting to study next week. My life is awesome.So dont beat yourself for not feeling like a moms supposed to feel. Theres nothing like that.

I spend much of my time in that room and can keep an eye on them for signals. Once they know to head for the potty when they feel that urge I gradually move the potty closer to the big toilet until they use that instead.With my son we worked on standing up and peeing in the big toilet first. Every time my husband had to go I made him take LO in the bathroom with him and show him what he was doing. Dads are also great at helping with this stuff!

2121059,0,t3_2j8li8,You can do it!  Ive only been dealing with it for a couple weeks but the diet changes have been pretty easy.  I miss sweets but Ive slowly been adding them back to my diet and so far havent had any problems.  I eat the healthy meals and snacks and have had cookies and ice cream  just  cookies instead of a whole pan and a small vanilla ice cream instead of a giant banana split.I talked to my doctor today about what to do if I just NEED hibachi or cake and how to survive Thanksgiving and all the delicious carbs.  His advice was moderation but as long as your glucose levels are controlled one hibachi meal or some birthday cake is not going to be the end of the world. Just get things back to normal.That being said I did get depressed about food this past weekend and just wanted to binge eat a pizza and some Ben and Jerrys.

You did great I know you said you dont want to figure out how to post pictures but Ill leave info here in case you change your mind later as it makes it easier to share family photos online with everyone and you can always reference this.The most popular site to use is imgur.com. You make an account for free. You can store pictures on their site and sort them into albums or whathaveyou. It doesnt share photos with strangers unless you make an album with the public setting. Anyway you login to imgur.com and hover over your username at the top right click images then click the big Computer button on the right then select the photos from your computer files that you want uploaded. It then stores those photos under Images. To make an album of images you go to your username click Albums New Album select the style and the Hidden button click save click the bottom tab All Images and click which ones to add.To SHARE photos you click on either the album itself and copypaste the url when viewing the album or for single photos you click the photo and it pops up and then copypaste the Image Link or Direct Link. To post on HERE on reddit you create a post and in the URL spot you paste the image or album link ex Anyways best of luck with the little one!

Im not pregnant but I do have one of those too helpful moms. I love her to pieces but some things I have to put my foot down. My worry has little to do with this incident but COULD be a catastrophe later. You can compromise with your mom on this issue but she needs to know that when the kid is born that she cannot force you to accept her help. Parenting differences between you and her may be a problem but my biggest concern is that a kid spoiled and given everything they want becomes a brat. My cousin has gotten away from this problem after not coming to as many functions with my aunt and uncle. They would totally undermine her as a parent letting her daughter get away with more and more each visit.

Everything can be bad for you in massive amounts and once again some mothers have to be reminded not to eat certain things every single time they eat.As for the stigma.. People will tell you not to eat sushi... But if you turn around and ask why? they dont have the slightest idea as to why. There is definitely a stigma with it.

2191265,0,t3_2k5v4d,Oh geez  I totally forgot to write some advice for other potential C sectionNICU moms! I hope my post didnt come across as a big complaint I just got really into writing a long dry story without getting into info that might help!If you get a C section make sure sure you take care of yourself. You might feel helpless with your newborn but it is very important to make sure you are well enough to give your baby the support he or she needs. The first day off the mag I was feeling great and overdid it by shuffling by myself to the NICU to check on Ian. Thats what nurses are for! Your baby has the best babysitters in the world at this moment and you need to take advantage of it.Remember to pee once you get the catheter out. It wont feel like you have to pee but trust me a full bladder will make your abdomen very very painful.Chapstick! Thats all. Bring three if you lose things easily.Sorry if I scare other diabetics here but I am going to be blunt about the this whole experience so you all know that this could be a reality. Not saying it happens to everyone but as I said before your initial plan might change drastically. Nurses will be interrupting your chance you have to rest before during and after labor. Take whatever you can get! Remember to eat! I had zero appetite after the c section and didntt eat much and boy did I feel better after my husband forced a meal on me.Make sure you let your husbandsupport partnerfamilyfriends know how valuable they are.Edit I forgot to mention nurses! Thank your nurses and be kind to them. Its a hard job keeping a smile on your face and keeping such a great attitude while caring for a laboring momtobe and they deserve to receive polite and goodnatured treatment from the other end ,BabyBumps,clid360,5,t5_2s7cl

2212735,0,t3_2kg0ia,We are just  days apart in terms of due date...Im wd.  My morning sickness kicked in last week but seems to have tapered off for the last few days.  Im keeping my fingers crossed that it stays away.I found that plain Cheerios were good.  I would kind of constantly snack on them all day and it seemed to keep the worst of the nausea at bay.  Also plain pasta which is boring but settled things down ginger ale and ginger tea and cuties clementines.  That was all I ate for about a week.  And yes my boobs have gotten huge.  I need to find a bra solution because I cant wear my normal ones any more.  But Im afraid to buy anything too expensive since I dont know if they will get even bigger!,BabyBumps,cll3bjj,2,t5_2s7cl

2220509,0,t1_clm1a0s,I see well I was just stating that it SEEMED that way by the way OP described it. Im aware that formula was pushed hard in the s  s but the way that she is describing what her family has stated it almkst sounds like theyre jealous.  I only say that because when my family said similar things to me about bfing thats where it stemmed from jealousy insecurities and regret. They wish they would have chosen BFing as a path and their egos are insulted that Im doing a better job at making decisions then they did. Again NOT knocking formula feeders. Theres Nothing wrong woth either.

Youre  right I cant put my kids in that spot and feel like a good parent.  Its not something Im aware of happening before but it sure as hell wont be happening again.

2229136,0,t1_cln47ma,Just to  chime in again  starting with a birth class NOT the standard birth class that might be available at your hospital would be a good place to start. Your husband and you will learn about a bunch of options and the idea of the doula might be more appealing after he hears about it from others. In any case I have heard from midwives i know that the birth class makes a huge difference  some people show up for birth like I want to do it naturally but have done no preparation in terms of techniques breathing etc. and they are kind of shooting themselves in the foot.,BabyBumps,cln6ctb,3,t5_2s7cl
2230379,0,t3_2kmp6w,To me it reads more like a comeback. Ive seen so many mothers who have had csections get slammed. Its unfortunate that csections have kind of been rebranded in pop culture as elective procedures for lazy moms who dont want to go through the work of real childbirth. Its like people have forgotten that they are a medical procedure that can be a necessity. Before csections and especially before modern csections many women and their babies didnt make it. How wonderful that these women can now more safely give birth!My motherinlaw had two csections her first birth with my husband was an emergency after she went in for an appointment and they found out that his heart rate was dropping. I forget what the problem was but I think she had the same thing again with her daughter. She mentioned not too long ago that she dealt with shame and guilt for a long time over that like she had failed herself and her kids.I dont get the csection hate. I really dont. Not only is it a decision that should be between a woman and her doctor but csections are NOT easy to recover from. The recovery time is usually doubled. Ive known of some old friends who struggled to even get off the couch...until those areas are affected you dont realize just how much you use them on a daily basis.Im so sad that women tear each other apart for things that are at the end of the day so ridiculous. Does this post read a little smug? Sure. But Ive seen oodles more natural birth smugness. Im looking forward to the day where we can just flippantly say Yeah I had a csection Yeah I had an epidural Yeah I went natural and its assumed the mother did her best with the circumstances she was handed...because birth is so different for all of us.,BabyBumps,clnc1hk,2,t5_2s7cl

2235098,0,t1_clnxhnw,My ob looked at the wound and didnt think it was anything more than a bug bite. Ill have to go to my regular doctor to see what they think it is. The bites are mostly on my legsfeet and they tend to go away within a week. At this point they just look like open wounds.,BabyBumps,clnxno0,1,t5_2s7cl
2236181,0,t3_2krq9i,Personally I would try to show that I am not that worried because from what Ive read its ok and not abnormal at all to not feel a connection to the baby when baby is in utero. From what you have said he is doing everything right. Doing everything in his power to care for you which is the only way that he can provide care for the baby right now and hes doing a great job at it. I can see where it would be a little disheartening that he doesnt share that same giddy feeling about the baby you havent even really met yet but its really ok. My husband and I frequently stay up talking at night about all of the things that we are so excited to do with our children. Everything we are excitednervous about from introducing them to video games that we love and reading books to visiting different places and having those awkward talks. Its possible that discussing things like how we would answer questions about God and how we felt about censoring bad language put us in a position to think about the baby as if they were already here. Maybe casually chatting like that could help some.,BabyBumps,clo2m18,3,t5_2s7cl

Because of the hospital rules and whatnot I had to state the reason I was there and the procedure I was having  or  times. Internally processing was hard enough. Saying it out loud to multiple strangers was horrible. Recovery wasnt so bad. I was sore for a few days but it was ok. I remember being shocked at how much tubing came out of my hand when they removed the IV but it was also my first IV ever.Its not easy and for the most part people dont know what to say...even the doctors and nurses.

I had just washed my car yesterday so I used a crap ton of washer fluid to get rid of most of it. Plus not to mention I had to sleep in the guest room last night because my husband was snoring so loud I could hear him through the ear plugs yes I have to wear ear plugs due to his snoring and he decided it would be a wonderful idea to use the humidifier on high even though I have told him before I cannot be in the room when he uses it because it leaves a horrible metalicesk taste in my mouth and it makes me nauseous.

Basically they were recovering from a csectionrough birth and were not up to visitors. One person was like not even me? Ill be super helpful but most people respected their decisions.

I think my RBF is just enough to keep them scared. ,BabyBumps,clutlcj,3,t5_2s7cl

2298293,0,t1_clvq1xu,Relaxin is in semen as well and that does act to literally relax muscles and ligaments. We also produce this while pregnant so our hips are able to spread. I could not find if relaxin is a prostaglandin or not but it seems possible. However semen also produces prostaglandins which help  control the contractions of muscles and other things too like vessels. We already naturally produce prostaglandins. This is what I found after some digging because I became increasingly interested. Either way lots of sex when you get near the end I guess.  ,BabyBumps,clvs9n9,1,t5_2s7cl

Im a huge fan of them. But only if your a certain type of person. I wouldnt recommend my mum to ever buy one the way she was with my one on me!

I didnt start exercising again until like  weeks and even then it was a slow build up. You may feel better about not exercising if you can do a little bit here and there. You know at least you tried type of thing. Denise Austin has some great free yoga videos on YouTube and I love the prenatal cardio one. So what I did was just start one up and try if I did  mins great if not oh well.

2400381,0,t1_cm81ybc,Okay. So I have done my research for the state I live in which is Florida.In Florida they can not seize an asset like my home or send you to jail for debt. If I own my home it is safe from all creditors except for those that have a mortgage or lien on the home.  See more at  They can garnish my wages unless I qualify for the head of family exemption. However they can not garnish wages from Social Security benefits Workers compensation Unemployment benefits Disability benefits Veterans benefits Pensions K plans Life insurance proceeds College and medical savings accounts.I am aware that medical debt that is sent to collection candoes affect your credit score. However I am also aware that eventually all collections are removed from credit reports. Under federal law they may not be reported seven years and  days from the date the consumer first fell behind on the original bill regardless of whether the account has been paid or settled.The way my financial advisor put it to me when we were applying for a loan to buy our house was not to stress the medical debt and try to pay it off to raise your score because its already done its damage and paying it off at this point wont really help your score. The loan processor informed me at the time they ran our credit score they they dont consider medical debt due to unforeseen circumstances and take this into account when considering someone for a loan.,BabyBumps,cm8e8qd,2,t5_2s7cl

2430363,0,t3_2nb2tw,You sound like me and my DH a few years ago. Honestly. Almost eerily verbatim.  We went through some counseling and discovered that we just were SERIOUSLY lacking in the healthy communication department.  I dont know if you have the means but even just getting yourself to some counseling so you can talk through your own frustrations and stress is helpful.  If he would be open to going as a couple WONDERFUL.  I was at the point of getting a lawyer and filing divorce and counseling saved us.  We still have issues about a number of things but I realized that we can work through them together.He is sincerely the worst...THE WORST...at doing things around the house. He comes home from work changes into his PJs and plops down on the xbox. While I go to school full time work and have to do every single errand and thing around the house.  He will do things but I have to ask.  Its been a big problem for years.  It was never an issue until I recently took on the full time student thing and have been completely overwhelmed.  I sat down with him and he and I worked it out so I can quit my job.  So now Im supposed to have more time to do other things...nope. Still need help.  Especially now that Im pregnant.  So the other day I sat down with him and explained that we need to work on our plans and routines for around the house.  I drew out a chart of things that need to be done daily weekly monthly and quarterly.  We filled it out together and he actually spent  hours on Saturday cleaning without me asking while I worked on  lesson plans.  It was awesome.  Its all because I explained to him that I needed some burden removed from my load and that when the baby comes it will not be an option AT ALL for him to sit on the xbox ALL DAY.  He understood.  I explained that when I am completely crazy and sleep deprived we will need to have the routine down. He agreed and is stepping up.  I can say with absolute certainty though without us working on our communication in counseling this never would have been achieved.One tidbit of information that I really took to heart and maybe you could try with him is we were not connecting anymore.  Our therapist suggested that each day we make it a point to walk together holding hands for atleast  minutes.  We did this religiously.  Some days we walked in silence other days we walked and talked.  It really helped.  Another thing you could try is asking him about the game.  Seeing if you can play it with him.  Youd be amazed at what that might do.  I took up playing Minecraft with my DH just because it was us spending time together doing something that relaxed him so much.I dont know if what Im saying will make you want to rage dear hormones are such a fun thing ugh or if youll find any help in it.

2491765,0,t1_cmjmd1j,I became the same way after our daughter passed away. I needed a baby. It took a while for my husband to come around because he didnt even want to think about having another one for a while and I really dont think he was fully ready when we did get pregnant the second time. He did it for me and I felt guilty about it for a little while at the beginning of my pregnancy like I may have pushed him into it or something. So after the anatomy scan when he could see all was good and the fact I was having more doctor appointments this time I think thats when he got into it. I wasnt eligible for maternity leave either for my second so I had to take my three weeks vacation for it and I had budgeted to save money like it was my second job. Anytime we could use cash we did and had a change jar for change and dollar bills. If I got extra money at work it went in if my husband worked freelance job it went it. Literally anything extra.

2529223,0,t3_2oldtl,I have the Britax Chaperone infant car seatcarrier and I have conflicted feelings about it.  I also have the stroller frame that you can place your infant seat on to make a travel system.  I like this.  It is easy to move baby from place to place and the stroller frame is super light and efficient.  It is heavy bulky and nearly impossible to get the infant car seat on and off its base without massive effort.  It is also well built provides excellent head and neck support and quickly adjusts for height.  In the end game all that matters is safety and I am pleased with the positive reviews this seat received.  As you are deciding what to purchase I would advise a travel system with infant carrier and stroller.  Even if you transition to a convertible car seat later on you will already have the stroller and baby carrier style car seats are useful in places where you use shopping carts and cannot otherwise navigate with a stroller.,BabyBumps,cmopeqc,1,t5_2s7cl

Im not in quite the same situation since my mom has been detached about most of my major life events graduation wedding etc. rather than pregnancy specifically but I definitely understand your disappointment.  In my moms case Im her firstborn so any sort of milestone in my life reminds her that shes getting older.  She tends to initially react unenthusiastically Mom Im engaged!  Oh cool.  Mom Im pregnant!  Thats nice. she then avoids talking about the upcoming event until people ask her about it at which point she gets angry at me for keeping her out of the loop.  Once the actual event is over though she develops a much more positive view of it.  I usually just wait it out and send periodic email updates that inevitably go unanswered to minimize her anger over being left out knowing that shell come around eventually.  She always does.The thing that has helped me the most is finding other people in my life who can fill the role of enthusiastic supporter when I need it.  In the case of pregnancy its definitely my motherinlaw.  She asks about the baby every time I see her she texts to see how Im doing she offers advice shell be in the delivery room with me along with my husband.

2669935,0,t3_2ql34e,A few things we didnt do first I skipped registering for clothes and stuffed animals since I figure people are going to buy them for us anyway and probably pay more attention to what they think is cute than what is on the registry. I checked with my health insurance regarding pumps to see what they cover before I registered too. DH and I also bought the really basic necessities ahead of time ourselves so wed be sure to be able to bring the babies home and care for them safely for a few days without having to scramble to returnexchangebuy things after the shower. So weve got the car seats bassinets dresserchanging table changing pad changing pad cover and some day to day basics. If you can afford it its a huge load off the mind!As for what I did register for I set myself a few guidelines. For one I kept in mind that I cant predict what the babies might like. Theyre not going to care what kind of diaper caddy I pick of course. But for things like pacifiers and bottles I went for small numbers of things from different brands to give us the chance to see what works best before we commit to large quantities of something that might be a bust. For laundered things like sheets I figured three is a good number one to use one for the laundry and one for when theres an accident and you havent done laundry yet. And then I figured there are a few things that you probably cant have too much of so go wild swaddling blankets flat cloth diapers etc....things with multiple users andor that are easily soiled.I hope that helps!,BabyBumps,cn731b0,4,t5_2s7cl

2703443,0,t3_2r0jpi,With kid  I took an utterly useless weekend Lamaze class offered by the hospital that gave me no clue as to how I could cope with labor. I had an epidural that unbeknownst to me had been piggy backed with a narcotic. I had been assured by the LampD nurse that I wouldnt be given any narcotics during the pushing stage but apparently no one passed that memo on to the anesthesiologist. At first I could still feel the contractions running down one side so anesthesiologist upped the amount until I was completely numb. I had no control over how much I was given. Pro Contractions were barely noticeableCon I had to be told when to push although I eventually noticed a vague sensation. Pro I got plenty of sleepCon I kept drifting off between pushing. It felt like I was pushing the entire time because I only had time to blink before it was time to push again. Pro the LampD nurses were attentiveCon I became more of an observer than a participant.  Giving birth was something that happened to me. Pro I wasnt scaredCon I wasnt remotely bothered that my daughter needed to go to NICU for  hours of observations due to difficulty breathing. I knew that narcotics make you not care about the pain but I had no idea that I wouldnt care about anything!Immediately after birth I thought it was awesome to get through it all pain free. But as more time passed I began to realize how much I had missed and Ive come to regret not taking the time to better prepare myself. ,BabyBumps,cnbddj5,6,t5_2s7cl

I dont know how you divide housework at the moment but whatever you are good at and whatever he is good at make it an extension. One thing I have heard of that women seem to really benefit from is having the dad take care of dinner and bath time every second night  so that the mum has dedicated time off every second evening. Its tough to trust anyone with a baby I see so many mums around me not trusting the dads until the kid is like one or older and thats silly. I imagine if you married him you know and love him and that he is a good person  and so can be good at this even if his style isnt exactly yours. Talk about what languages you want to use  if he will use his native tongue. Talk about what babies like  being around their parents being responded to being spoken to. Try and see what he imagines when the baby comes. Try and see what you imagine and then what you can find that you agree on. I guess just talk about everything. Make it safe and friendly. And good luck with grad school if thats what you choose to do. All the best!,BabyBumps,cnh9fdt,2,t5_2s7cl

2778280,0,t1_cnixihs,I dont know the extent of her social and developmental issues clinically speaking. What I do know is she acts like a  year old girl and thinks like a  year old girl but shes  years beyond that in age. Her development issue that I know of is a reading comprehension learning disability and I dont know if that would have any overflow effects into other aspects of her life. No stealing that I know of. Lots and lots and lots of lying she has a terrible poker face and will lie right to your face then just stare unresponsive when called out until she can think of a way to twist it on the spot. No violence toward others but shes attempted to self harm one time that I know of. So Im judging her based on what I know  she has daddy issues me too and many of the same social struggles that I once had and worked through with a professional. Of course its possible likely even that her issues go deeper than mine. But Im absolutely sympathetic to the challenges shes up against having gone through very similar myself and dont expect any magical generic effort. But to say that shes completely incapable of forming relationships is false. She has friends shes had boyfriends a couple serious. If her social issues are only isolated to my dad me and superiorsauthority then I think its reasonable to ask her to treat me like one of her friends and see how it goes.At the root of all this my only expectation is to stop being blamed for the state of our relationship. If something positive grows from that then great! If not then were no better or worse than today. Our whole lives my challenges were not recognized and hers were somehow worse or more important. So I was the one expected to put forth extra effort I was expected to accommodate her. Never the other way around because I was closer to normal. I dont think thats egotistical I am standing up for myself finally. Arguably its egotistical of her to expect the world the bend around her.,BabyBumps,cnjvq6u,1,t5_2s7cl

A little back story weve been married for a year known each other for  and had planned on waiting to have children for another couple of years. Im  and hes . I was also just diagnosed with PCOS and was told getting pregnant might be a little harder for me. When the test came up positive I basically went into shock. I timidly came out of the bathroom holding the test like a bomb thats about to go off. Babe.... He immediately jumps up excitedly oblivious to what I had been doing in the past five minutes. I found out later he was actually under the impression that sexytimes were about to happen. Which makes his reaction even more understandable. I stammered something about not knowing if I know how to read or not and handed him the little stick. He stared at it. Without a word he grabbed a cigarette and went out back to smoke. He remained pretty much silent for the next  minutes before finally making a joke about how happy his mom would be especially since his sister had just gotten married and she has gone fullon emptynest crazy.

2804383,0,t3_2s6xol, weeks today. Its normal to feel weird pains randomly. Or get weird cramps in your sides and ribs. I dont know if anyone else is like me but I was freaking out about every single little pain until about  weeks. Id spend like an hour on Google trying to comfort myself if I felt mildly crampy. Your body is changing in ways that its never changed before and stretching and moving your organs. Its normal for it to be really uncomfortable at times. I mean do your research for peace of mind. But try not to let the weird pain anxiety overwhelm you. And be careful with food but you dont have to completely give up everything they tell you to. There are so many foods that you can get listeria from that arent even on the listeriosis dont eat list. Its impossible to list every food that could be dangerous during pregnancy but the chances of it happening are VERY VERY small. Just do your best to eat wellcooked things that have been prepared under sanitary conditions. And make sure vegetables are washed. And its illegal for restaurants to serve unpasteurized dairy products in the US so you can definitely eat queso blanco or feta cheese at restaurants that was something I was so freaked out about at first.

I look back at a wedding I was in at the time and my face ohhhh my face!! And its even more swollen now! The swelling was painful in my handsarms I had to wear braces and felt like I had carpal tunnel but I thought that was just part of pregnancy as I had literally no bad symptoms before then.... I ended up in the hospital for observation after a  BP reading at a doc appointment at  weeks.After that I was on modified bed rest and annoyed because I didnt feel like I needed to be there. THEN I started noticing my blood pressure creeping up bitbybit over the past few weeks. The swelling increased again and now just taking a nap puts me in the nearly  range. Not horribly dangerous but enough for me to realize that my Thursday induction at  weeks probably isnt the worst idea in the world and franklyId rather be prudent then satisfy my whims to go into labor when the baby is done cooking. ,BabyBumps,cnur09x,2,t5_2s7cl

2887057,0,t1_cnw4ycl,I will tell you I didnt care before either. Its mostly after everything is said and done and everything hasnt gone the way you wish it would have. You start to doubt yourself you feel a bit of regret and maybe even start to judge yourself. Then peoples comments start to grate on your nerves. I had to have a csection with my daughter I dont regret it it was amazing it brought me my daughter. Unfortunately the way that it happened I will never be able to deliver vaginally. My uterus will never be able to labor. I had the realization that I will never know what it is like to go through labor for my child. That hurts a little bit and when someone you dont know gives you a look or makes a snide comment its like pouring salt in the wound. Because of the years of judgement from society we have learned to judge ourselves so harshly. If the judgment wasnt there from society we would go easier on ourselves and therefore the wound wouldnt be as harsh.,BabyBumps,cnw9eyg,3,t5_2s7cl

2925651,0,t3_2tma1y,I had a senior Midwife amp a student Midwife I consented present during my first birth. My labour was very fast amp so the Senior Midwife knew that Id been examined only a couple of hours earlier and that despite my waters breaking or membranes rupturing contractions were not detected on the monitor.I was sent home fair enough amp very understandable. I had to report back within  hours if things werent progressing infection risk etc. By time we drove the  minutes home my contractions were soooo strong and I was bleeding a lot. I called the hospital repeatedly and even though they kept telling me to eat something and go to bed we went back in  contractions were every  seconds or so at that point.I was escorted to a birthing suite amp the Senior Midwife would not examine me. She repeatedly said Youre about cm now repeatedly I was so distressed blood is all over my skirt so I just pulled all of my clothes off except for my bra hahaha no thoughts about anything except that I needed my clothes off. Even after throwing up she didnt check how I was progressing. I started demanding an epidural. I felt stoned amp confused from the gas told my husband that she was deliberately not helping me and thats when she examined me amp said Oh youre cm its too late for an epidural lets see how you go I think you can do this.Mine is a very... privileged? complaint I know. Despite this she was very competent during active labour and despite how sour my story may sound I dont think she did anything wrong simply that she was probably tired and had  years experience telling her that I was still hours away from being at that point. It stays with me though the feelings of distress amp confusion I really did feel very alone.tldr Midwife was very competent amp experienced but didnt believe that I was as progressed as I was and therefore didnt check. Doesnt change how positive I feel about midwives though if it didnt take so many years Id consider going back to school after the new baby arrives!ninja edit Sorry sorry!! for how long this is... it felt good to get that story out though it was a couple of years ago youd think I would have done that before now!,BabyBumps,co0nmiy,2,t5_2s7cl

I was skinny and miserable bags under my swollen eyes from all the crying and burst blood vessels in my face from chucking up so much. I broke down at my doctor appointment one time and told her she needed to call me and make me come in next week because I could feel myself losing all motivation for everything and if I felt any worse by then I knew I wouldnt even feel ok enough to make an appointment to follow up on my not feeling ok. It sucked I managed to feel better after Id discussed options for what wed do if I felt any worse didnt end up needing antidepressants etc but it did make me feel better to know there was a plan there if I needed it. Also once my hormones eased up a bit I felt more like a real human being and even though I was still sicky sick was able to deal with that and the tiredness a lot better without feeling like a complete failure. I was lucky and my sickness settled a couple weeks after that but I know thats different for everybody. My best friend wasnt as lucky and hers lasted right through her pregnancy though disappeared as soon as baby was born and she tells me hospital food never tasted so good! Even if it continues though it does get easier to mentally deal with as your first trimester hormones start settling down. Hope you manage to feel better soon ,BabyBumps,co3sspq,2,t5_2s7cl

2995649,0,t3_2ufkio,My little one is about to turn one in  more days but I remember the whole experience wasnt good. I had severe preeclampsia and had to be transferred to another hospital. So while Im at the original hospital where they are waiting for the magnesium sulphate to get my blood pressure down so Im safe to transport my mom calls asking where I am that her and my aunt are already at the new hospital. So that was strike one.Strike two she made it all about her and how being a preemie was going to affect my daughter and what they were going to do to her etc. It was at the point the NICU nurses had to come talk to her and my nurse came and told me my mom is freaking out. So Im getting more stressed out blood pressure rising. Now because of the magnesium I was only allowed two people in the room after seeing my moms freak out the nurses agreed to say my husband was the only person allowed in the room with me which kept my mom out.But the final strike was caused by my husbands dad step mom and step sister who ignored me when I told them I was only allowed one visitor at a time and they all came in the room. This upset me because I dont like them and caused my blood pressure to spike big time so then I had to wait a whole day to see my daughter because they couldnt take me off the magnesium. Anyways after deliberately putting my baby at risk while visiting her in the NICU I forbid anyone from seeing her once she was released from the hospital and my husbands family gets all butt hurt saying Im being selfish. To this day I think my husbands dad has seen her  times his grandma  times and his dad just told us yesterday they arent coming to her first birthday party this Saturday. So yeah it sucks that they are still upset with me because I did what was best for my baby but I have no regrets over it. If they truly wanted to be a part of her life they would get over it.  Next baby Im totally going with the waiting until heshe is born so I dont deal with the hospital crazies. TLDR Family made me even sicker than I already was with preeclampsia  they still are upset about me protecting my daughter. ,BabyBumps,co8hw9m,3,t5_2s7cl

If I waited til the end of a bottle to burp her she wouldnt burp very well and she was uncomfortable. All babies are different. And I remember how nerve wracking it was to feed her and how much I worried is this too much? Not enough? Is this formula messing with her belly?

3119508,0,t3_2vq3t5,I got a  on the one hour test which is quite high. I took a deep breath ate some chocolate and and drank a coke to say goodbye and then started researching. I stocked my pantry with brown rice and whole grain pasta and filled my fridge with good healthy proteins. I didnt know whether I had it or not but my result was high enough that it seemed very reasonable to assume and I didnt want to risk throwing my blood sugar out of whack unnecessarily. It really made me look at my diet and realize how dependant I was on white rice and potatoes and how much I was giving in to sugary cravings. Due to taking the three hour test on a Friday and there being a snow storm on the following Monday there was almost a week between learning Id failed the onehour and that Id passed the threehour. It was a very stressful week! I reevaluated and altered my whole diet. Now that I know I dont have it Im still glad that I made those changes. Im keeping up with the plan to cut way down on sugar and include more whole grains in my diet. I feel very good about it and I think the scare was just the wake up call I needed to remind me to be more healthy in my choices. I dont think the changes I made contributed to passing the threehour test since its testing your shortterm reaction to sugar but i definitely recommend if you fail the onehour test taking the intervening period as a chance to look at your carb intake and see if there are changes you want to make whether you have GD or not. ,BabyBumps,colc4ag,1,t5_2s7cl

Maybe try just sitting down with your mom and talking with her about how its making you and your husband feel when she specifically excludes him like that. Ive only had one real big hormonal crazy lady incident and it ended up being quite funny actually. Now I cant tell you what it was that my stepdad said to make me have a hormonal melt down I honestly cant even remember. But good Christ was it ugly. I dont know if Ive ever cried like that before it was bad. I just crumbled onto the bed bawling kicking and screaming incoherently for probably a good  minutes. And my poor husband was just sitting there next to me with this lost expression on his face. Then he makes the mistake of saying sweetie you think this could just be your hormones? To which I shrieked ITS NOT MY FUCKING HORMONES!! and shoved him. Now this is where it gets pretty hilarious. Not only did I shove him with the force of a  year old but I also made this childish NYAHH! sort of noise.

Obviously with girls dresses are easy but on comfy days we went with the kind of short body suit things ? Its like a onesie but with short legs and arms so its like they are wearing a tshirt and shorts without the hassle but in all honesty it got so hot one day we found the lightest floating thing possible for her cause she hates the heat.And last of all an easy sun cream!

3170540,0,t3_2wgb8s,I had an unplanned c section. I really didnt want one but it wasnt so bad. It wasnt an emergency so everyone was really calm while they prepped me. My husband had to wait outside while they put the spinal in but then he was right next to me holding my hand for the rest. I was pretty nervous but the drugs they gave me calmed me right down. I started feeling nauseous and let them know and they immediately gave something to relieve that.  Once the baby was out they cleaned him and wrapped him up and put him on my chest until my arms got tired. It took a little while  minutes maybe to close me up then they moved me to a recovery room. We got to do skin to skin as soon as we got to that room. We spent about an hour there then moved me to my room.  I was pretty itchy from the morphin but luckily had packed my back scratcher it was a sanity saver. My c section was at pm so I had a catheter until am when they took it out and had me get up. It was actually kind of nice to be able to sleep without getting up to pee constantly. Once I was ready to go to sleep they took my baby to the nursery for the night and brought him to me when it was time to nurse. This was the plan for a vaginal delivery anyway. We dont have family nearby so I wanted to rest as much as possible before going home. The pain was pretty bad at first but not unmanageable and slowly got better until about  weeks pp when I finally felt like I could move fairly normally.  I took colace but wasnt able to poop for  days after. All Bran is what finally got me moving. All in all my c section wasnt too bad. My best advice is take a back scratcher and All Bran.,BabyBumps,coqmia8,3,t5_2s7cl

3175293,0,t3_2whqio,Some things I appreciate about my husband right now He does more than his fair share of the housework and I rarely have to ask him to do anything specific. Im exhausted all the time and most of the energy I do have goes to my pretty demanding job. So its just amazing to have him pick up my slack and it means we can keep paying the bills. He is open and honest about most of his emotions related to the pregnancy. He doesnt really like discussing his fears which I wouldnt mind if he did more. But he doesnt leave me wondering of hes really excited and he discusses his concerns rationally and openly. He gets the difference between hormonal and irrational and knows that only one of these words applies to me. He asks what I need. A lot. But not so much that it bugs me. And then he follows through on whatever it is if its reasonable. Sometimes even if it isnt. He learns about pregnancy and infant care. He doesnt read the same books that I do or look at all the same websites. But he went to the classes with me and he does his own research. Hes still attracted to me and lets me know it. He comes to most of my prenatal appointments if he can. He almost never eats any food on which I have even a vague claim. Well there was that one time. But he learned his lesson.

3186787,0,t3_2wmlyq,You are more than welcome to post here. I am so sorry that this has happened to your family...it truly is a nightmare. OB nurse here it is completely normal for a mom who went through a traumatic delivery  to not feel bonded to baby after birth. Mom typically will need to recover emotionally and mentally from this event in order to start developing more positive feelings. Like others that have posted I believe therapy is a GREAT way to sort these feelings out. The human mind is an amazing thing and recovering from something like this will take time. Please reassure your wife that this is not her fault. Sometimes these things happen and it is a miracle that she has you there to support her during this time. That is what a partnersignificant other is there for...to be there and be supportive and help start your new babys life off while she recovers from this traumatizing event.,BabyBumps,cosb7a8,6,t5_2s7cl

3190177,0,t1_cosfkpx,Yea that stuff is dangerous. The thing about it that makes it so dangerous is the fact that itll get outlawed but the manufacturers will just simply go in and change one single molecule in the chemical set up and suddenly theyve created a loophole where they can sell it because its technically not the same thing that was outlawed. Well when you go in an change one molecule then another molecule then another molecule now you have a completely different and potentially lethal group of chemicals that is now being ingested by people and a lot of time it is lethal. There have been many deaths associated with synthetic weed for this very reason! Its almost better to just smoke the real stuff.

Ive even talked with my dad about it and he flat out told me You cant handle an unmedicated birth. Not in a mean way he was smiling as he spoke and everything but its true. I have the lowest pain tolerance of anybody I know. Even my cousin had her appendix burst when she was  and told her mom that it was a  on a scale of  which for her basically meant emergency. I guess my genes screwed up I dont know. But I can barely handle a papercut. Theres no way I can go through something of this caliber without any help. That wont make me any worse of a mom. Edit Dont worry hes not making the call. I am. When his pain tolerance suddenly disappears and he has to push a baby out of his stretchedout genitalia he can decide whether he can do it natural or not.

Some of that was vacation time not paid maternity leave but it seems from reading that a lot of the difficulty in coming back to work is going straight from  with baby to a full  hour work week. Now her baby also had some medical issues that meant no daycare until  weeks so I dont know if that was what she would have done had that not been the case but I thought it seemed like a good way to ease back into a fulltime schedule.

3316202,0,t3_2y4z9m,I spent a few hours in the hospital I will be delivering at on Sunday for what might have been preterm labor but wasnt.  They ended up giving me an IV to try to stop the contractions but the nurse examined both of my arms from like hand to elbow asked me which arm I wanted it in and then asked about the positioning.  She put it about halfway between my wrist and my elbow on the top part of my arm.  But she seemed open to whichever location I preferred.  So its entirely possible they will let you pick.As an additional note my hospital doesnt require an IV unless you get an epidural  but you do have to have the tube thing put in you arm for quick access just in case.  But its my understanding that you can pick the location of that too.Also for whatever it could be worth someone brought that up in my birthing class she didnt want anything in her arm either.  The instructor said that of the battles you could pick to fight that one wouldnt be worth it...but if you have a severe phobia I would imagine that changes things and makes it worth fighting for. Its probably worth bringing up with your doctor in advance to see what the policy iswhat exceptions could be made.,BabyBumps,cp69wew,3,t5_2s7cl

3338790,0,t1_cp8u4zq,Thanks... Yep he has some serious mood swings and booze sometimes makes them worse. Hes not a heavy drinker as in he doesnt get drunk often but he does drink most weekends... Most places that hire him run a tab for him. Hes a big guy   lbs former power lifter and he might have  or  Jack and cokes in a  hour period on Friday nights and Saturdays. Sometimes he will have a beer with dinner... So the fact that he got drunk last night really speaks volumes as to how horribly he is dealing with this. As far as his ex goes shes been an issue since we started dating... She has a current boyfriend but would do just about anything to get back with CR... He was honest with her but he could have easily said were happy... grrrr men!Thanks for being mad on my behalf... He texted me about an hour or so ago saying I guess you arent speaking to me...

Get a heart rate monitor and use it   is on the low end for someone whos already used to exercising but you do want to keep your heart rate in check and pregnancy will do all sorts of crazy stuff to your heart rate even when youre not running.  As baby gets bigger and your joints loosen it may get a lot harder to run... dont beat yourself up for it. Walking is good for you too you can also use an elliptical to take some of the pressure off your joints.

I dont really think your birth barring health problems has much to do with your life. I always thought it was for the mom.  ,BabyBumps,cpbklyp,6,t5_2s7cl
3363253,0,t1_cpblsst,At the time I felt so detached from the whole situation it was like being in a bizarre dream.  I had seen enough episodes of Birth Day on Discovery Health channel to know that his heart rate wasnt good.. but I guess I figured that if it were a true emergency they would be rushing me into the OR?  Even though my gut feeling told me this isnt okay they need to do something.  After a couple hours of pushing in all sorts of crazy positions the midwife left the room briefly not sure why.  I asked my nurse Am I going to have a C section? as she was squeezing a bag of fluids into my IV.  She said something like Its very possible that you will and made a weird face looking back now I think the face was her disgust at the fact that nothing was being done in her experience with mostly Drs or sane midwives attending births she would have seen my baby born by cesarian hours ago.  I knew then that I should be having a cesarian that my baby was in trouble.. but I didnt want to speak up or offend the midwife!!  Once his head finally came out I saw how tight the cord was around his neck it wouldnt slip off his head they had to clamp and cut the cord while it was strangling him how purple his face was.. Thats when I had an Oh Shit moment and it clicked that this was not Okay.  Then of course once his head was out and the cord that was strangling him was cut his shoulders got stuck!!  So I have the midwife ordering the nurse to apply fundal pressure AKA the nurse leaning all of her body weight onto my abdomen and pushing my baby out from the top.  When he was born she said Youre done RorschachBulldogs.  I caught a brief glimpse of him in her hands as she lifted him up to hand him to the NICU team that had magically appeared without me realizing their presence.  The moment I had to look at him seems like a much longer time when in reality was probably less than  seconds.  I really thought I was looking at a dead baby.  I dont remember panicking or freaking out just thinking So this is what its like to have a stillborn baby.  The reason Im telling this isnt to put anyone off midwives.. I have one now who will be delivering this baby.  I just want you all to remember to speak up dont be embarrassed to be demanding or bitchy or whatever you need to do to be heard.  Also to not get so caught up in having this notion of an ideal perfect birth all according to plan that you lose sight of whats the most important that you stay safe and your baby arrives alive and healthy.  ,BabyBumps,cpbmwn8,12,t5_2s7cl

3379056,0,t3_2yvv28,My mom warned me that after every pregnancy she had a huge hormonal need for another baby from about week  to week .  It didnt matter what plans shed made or pacing or what was going on.  At  weeks after delivery she was always certain that she needed another baby immediately.  She said that once she made it through week  that hormone craze lifted and suddenly she could think rationally about babies and planning her next kid again.I dont know if thats the situation with you or if this is more than just hormones but if you can convince yourself to wait a month it might give you a little insight to that.  If you still feel the same in a month then you will have had another month between pregnancies to let your body recover a bit and heal.

I emailed the restaurant and they said that they followed storage and prep procedures and that the fish was freshly caught. I will not go near raw fish until this baby is out and even after that I dont think I would be able to eat it again. In saying that I am totally happy to eat mayo store bought and kept in my fridge. I ate a mozzarella baguette the other day that turned out to have aioli made with raw eggs in it and I was worried about how long it had been kept but all was well. Im a vegetarian but occasionally eat fish so deli meats etc arent a concern for me. ,BabyBumps,cpdij7a,2,t5_2s7cl

3381816,0,t3_2yw038,UTIs suck. constantly feeling as if you MUST pee when you know damned good and well that you will pass a few drops of urine and pay for it with the burning and bladder cramping is awful. Drink as much water as possible  it dilutes things which makes burning less and helps flush out bacteria.It sounds as if your UTI was resistant to the amoxil. Your doctor should have sent a culture and if they didnt last time they should this time so you get the right antibiotics going forward. Ask whether preventative antibiotics are safe in pregnancy.  You may do better taking one dose of an antibiotic after intercourse to prevent an infection or take three times a week.,BabyBumps,cpdr43j,4,t5_2s7cl

Watch videos on youtube go to a class or two read rbeyondthebump as much as rbabybumps  take others advice with a grain of salt and remember that what works for some wont work for all. You have instincts that you never knew you had that will come out of you when the time is right. Sometimes that isnt until the postbirth depression period is over but they are there.

3447006,0,t3_2zpajj,Mother of   . A swing was a life saver with both of my kids they adored their swings. Get one that plugs into a wall because if you run out of D or C batteries and you kid wants the swing its going to suck! Personally I dont like the papasan type of swing and neither did my kids.  . Lots of extra crib sheets as diaper explosions and leaks are really common.  . If its something you are into get a nice carrier but not a Bjorn look at an ergo or beco those are my favs  . dont get button up sleepers. They suck and I really hate them. Diaper changes and everything else is so much easier with a zipper!  . Both my kids really liked their play mats when they got to about  months. My daughter really liked the fisher price piano one we kept it to use with this baby as well its pretty awesome.  . I really generally liked the graco travel systems as well as chicco but if you have a babies R us or a large walmart near you go check them out you dont need a baby to try them and see what feels the bestlooks the best to you.  .Put a convertible car seat on your registry. I was shocked that someone actually got it for us but my kids didnt tolerate the recline of a regular infant bucket seat after  months and we switched to a convertible. there are lots of good ones but I really like the headwise from graco and the diono radian.  .I have a video baby monitor and I love it. gives me peace of mind when I go out to play with my son outside or am not withing ear shot of baby during nap.  . Bath time I never got a baby bath tub or bath seat. Personally I just gave baby a bath in the tub with myself holding her and daddy nearby to help us out. Though for when they are very small I liked the bear sponge to lay in tub.   . I really like burts bees or babyganics soap. My kids both had negative skin reactions to johnson and johnson soaps so I wouldnt reccomend them personally. I suggest registering for a gift set of soap.  . I coslept and still bedshare with my daughter but we side cared a crib now so she sleeps on her own when she is not with us. If that interests you look into it as we love it.    . If you will be nursing make sure you have a nursing pillow I like boppy and some like breastfriend but either is great.   . Again if you are nursing make sure you have a nice big comfortable spot to nurse baby in. I have a s rocking chair that fits me perfect and is essentially a glider in my living room and It was where i spent a lot of time in those st few months.  .Breast pumps. If you have insurance contact them! they might get you a great one at lower cost or free to you its worth the call. If not well I have a medela freestyle and I really like it.  . If you are unsure about breastfeeding or dont plan to breastfeed register for a couple newborn packs or bottles and a bottle brush. Also do this if you plan to pump and feed.  . You dont really need special laundry soap for baby things I just suggest switching if you notice baby gets red skin though mine never cared.    . Definitely look into car seat safety to make sure you know and understand car seat safety and correct use of car seats with you infantchild.   . Also register for a lightweight but not quite an umbrella stroller. The systems can be heavy and after a year I sold mine in favor of a lighter stroller.    Sorry this is all over the place this is what I thought of as I though of it. Let me know if you have any questions ,BabyBumps,cpl6o0x,4,t5_2s7cl

You have no idea how you will be after baby comes you may need to take extra time to heal you may have health issues you may have a hard time working more than X many hours a week because of taking care of the baby. I dont know you or your job so its tricky but recovering from childbirth or a section is a lot more involved than people think and if your job has physical demands it may limit things Your Fianc is probably thinking along these lines as is the manager. I think you need to talk to your fianc before you speak to the manager Id think long and hard about the benefit to your family one of you getting this promotion is before you risk both of you not getting it.  If you do approach your boss say you were disappointed as you felt this was promised to you is there any way to put you on a time table to getting those perks when you return from maternity leave as you feel you have earned it.

My only advice is that if you are going to get one off of Amazon make sure you are getting the same as what you tried on. There are a lot of different levels of support as well as sizes.  I ended up ordering  before I found one that works for me.  One was great support but too big the next looked exactly the same and fit great but no support and the third one is just right.

3503248,0,t3_30e06j,For me hard candy particularly these mints were the only thing that really helped enough to suggest. Every time I started to feel really sick Id pop one in my mouth and within a few seconds I felt a little better. I never actually  threw up with one in my mouth or right after I had eaten one. Also I read somewhere on here that a woman would humm when ever she got the urge to throw up and in the few times it has happened to me since then it has worked! probably something to do with your gag reflex being so close to the vocal cords or something I dunno. So I suggest getting some Jolly ranchers some mints whatever hard candy you usually like and when you get the slightest feeling of being nauseated pop one in your mouth and hope it settles. And remember that this is temporary! I was at my worst at  weeks and thought it would last forever. Now at  weeks I get nauseated about once a week.

Plus you will likely still be bleeding making travel inconvenient. And leaving your tiny infants behind is not an option either. They need their mama! I was a bridesmaid in a friends wedding a month after I had my third baby. I was glad to be there for her but even with a monthold it was hard and extremely inconvenient. I brought my baby with me but Ill be honest everything about the experience was tough from being in an unfamiliar location with people I for the most part didnt know to trying to schedule breastfeeding around the rehearsal and photo and ceremony times to changing into and out of the stupid nonbreastfeedingfriendly bra I had to wear with the strapless dress that I felt hideous in since I was still puffy and holding on to a lot of extra weight after giving birth a month prior.Anyway all that to say that Im sorry but attending a wedding mere days after youve had two babies realistically is not going to happen.,BabyBumps,cpsb8a3,4,t5_2s7cl

If you have any concerns at all contact your OB. Its always best to be safer than sorry!

3604497,0,t3_31n0rj,Ask yourself how you would feel if the girls were yours and you were in a shared custody situation with their other parent.  Wouldnt you want them to be around their new sibling as soon as possible?  It is important to show your husbands daughters that they are not being replaced by the new baby and for them to learn their new role as big sisters.  At  they should be somewhat independent  its not as if youre adding two yos to the mix on top of a newborn.  They can help by getting you things when you are holding the baby wipes diapers blankets etc or by watching the baby while she is in her swing amp secure if you need to go to another room.If your husband has said that he will give the girls to his mother while you are in labor hold him to that  while youre in the hospital you will need him more than his daughters will.  Also  I dont know what your relationship is with your MIL is but maybe she can come help with the girls while you guys adjust to being a family?  What about your family? Another set of helping hands could go a long way to helping everyone get used to the new routine.  And honestly being left alone with the baby is not the worst thing in the world especially for the first couple of weeks.  Unless you are recovering from a csection you should be able to cope very well on your own  and chances are you and the baby will want to sleep most of the time those first few weeks.  There is also the chance that you will not have delivered yet when the girls are there.  As a FTM  you are more likely to be overdue than not.  If he is taking them the last  weeks of July their presence may be a total nonissue. I understand that you are nervous but you have to keep in mind that the girls are your husbands children too  and to some extent they are also yours.  Finding a way to be supportive of your bonusdaughters needs as well as meeting the needs of your biodaughter will be an important balance to strike in the future.  I wish you luck  Im sure you and your husband will get this figured out in a way that works best for all of you.,BabyBumps,cq34zve,12,t5_2s7cl

I agree with a previous poster that you can politely point out that she is being rude then ignore if she doesnt change her tune. Is she doing it in front of her parents? Does she think that because your husband works for her daddy she can say and do anything? Are her parents very busy and do they tend to not pay enough attention to her?

3647305,0,t3_324km0,I disagree with almost everyone here who says first come first served  thats a selfish point of view. I think it depends on circumstance. Ive had a girls name Ive loved since I was  years old and known I will use no matter what. If my sibling just suddenly picked that name when they got pregnant Id be pretty pissed. Obviously they havent had their heart set on that name for  years like I have... they could just as easily pick an alternative and it wouldnt be heartbreaking for them to give up like it would be for me.The fact that shes bringing it up now before shes pregnant makes me think its something shes been dreaming of for a long time and for you to take that from her on something you only decided in the past few months sounds pretty awful to do to someone you seem to love so much. Especially given this isnt some far off dream for her but she is planning for another kid sometime soon.,BabyBumps,cq80qb6,4,t5_2s7cl

I was a little nervous but theyre totally fine with our son. They never showed aggression towards kids but were unsure about them. They still are with my friends kids so we just keep them separated to be safe. With our son theyre much more mellow bc theyve slowly seen his progression. They have a chance to get used to new skills like walking over time and it isnt scary to them. That being said we ALWAYS supervise and keep things like food and dog toys out of the area so no one I.e. The jack mix gets too feisty.

3718221,0,t1_cqg35b2,gt gt Heard of MANA Stats? The study that the authors said showed homebirth was just as safe as hospital birth? It showed no such thing. Perinatal death rates were low in an absolute sense but when compared to hospital rates were greatly elevated and that was true only for truly low risk women. Add in VBACs twins and breech and the numbers are awful by any measure. The survey didnt even try to measure rates of morbidity for babies things like brachial plexus injury and encephalopathy.Did you seriously quote a study nothing of the sort that said this According to the CDC Wonder database the neonatal death rate for low risk white women at term from the years  is .. As Judith Rooks CNM MPH noted in her review of Oregon homebirths intrapartum death among low risk babies is essentially nonexistent in the hospital so the neonatal  intrapartum death rate for the hospital is still ....SO you are using Oregon stats for lowrisk white women not dying in hospitals... to conclude that natural births are somehow less safe than hospital births? Thats a shame and doesnt do your argument any favors. I can cite many many studies that conclude that home births are either as safe or safer than hospital births. There shouldnt even be an argument about that. P.S. can you call your local hospital for these statistics? they wont give it to you as a consumer of their service.

I caved and used the sinus rinse thing from the same company but made sure I dealt with my ear before that. I used vinegar  alcohol rinse in my ears for a few days burned like crazy then hydrogen peroxide a couple times before the possible infection subdided. Then waited about  weeks yesterday with no ear itchiness. The directions on the box specifically say to not use if u have an ear infection. I forgot to take my Zyrtec yesterday and was out running errands all day. I was dead by night with chest  breathing problems and unable to breathe out of my nose plus it kept dripping every  mins destroyed  boxes of Kleenex. The rinse helped open one nasal passage so I didnt snort to death sleeping lol. I think it works a little different from neti bc I tilt my head down and only gently push water thru.

3757261,0,t3_33eiqg,I bought a Vista when my now . yearold was a newborn and Im incredibly happy with it. The pros it comes with a very comfortable bassinet which we used very often on walks however the shade only goes up  degrees so depending on how high up the sun is you need a swaddling blanket to provide additional shade.The stroller sits up so the baby has a pretty good view to look around.Its comfortable for toddlers it reclines far and the shade on the chair extends very far down towards the seat so if the chair is reclined you can shield the babys face. The chair can face toward and away from whoever is pushing the stroller.Wheels are soft so its comfortable on different types of terrain.You dont have to remove the seat in order to fold it down.Large storage basket thats easy to access.Can fit a standup board I think its called a rumble seat for your older child to stand on while another one sits in the chair.Cons its big. Even after you fold it down it takes up a lot of space. Although it folds down the middle of the seat if you lay it flat in your trunk there isnt much room for other things.Doesnt come with snack tray or cup holders. Sure this is a minor annoyance but on a stroller this expensive you really shouldnt have to buy additional accessories. It does however come with a rain cover and mosquito mesh cover.You cant fold it with one hand so it can be a bit of a hassle at first. You get used to it though but I know some strollers fold up easily with one hand. Not this one.The back wheels stick out and sometimes its a pain maneuvering it in crowded places. Just for comparison I initially got a Stokke Xplory. After using it for about two months I sold it because I haaaated it. Its so huge when it folds down and the storage is really tiny. I wanted that stroller while I was pregnant and thought it would be the best but after using it with a baby it was just too impractical. I also tried a Graco travel system and Beitax B ready and city mini. All had lots of positives but the Uppababy Vista still wins out. Source I received several strollers through Amazons Vine program for free. ,BabyBumps,cqkk0ay,2,t5_2s7cl

They were even calling it by the Boys name we had picked out. I wanted to check for sure but everyone would only hand it to me when the baby NEEDED to eat according to them. So I couldnt even take a peek in the diaper.Everyone says you have some sort of intuition so when I found out I was having a girl... I was shocked.  I was also sad because as much as I loved the idea of having a baby I never saw myself with a little girl.  I was a Tom boy growing up I have never had a good relationship with my mother... I just... Thought it would be a boy.I became angry with people who were trying to help especially the ones who told me girl things are so much cuter! Yeah... I suppose they might feel that way but I wanted little bow ties to match daddy and cute jeans and button up shirts under sweaters for the holiday...It took some time.

3780818,0,t3_33pr0l,My daughter has her fathers last name. I took my husbands name too but she was  months old when we married so when she was born we werent married or planning on it.The reasoning was so that in emergency situations nobody would ask twice if he was her father. Our society is pretty sexist when it comes to parents. When I registered her for daycare no one asked if I was her mom. When I took her to the ER nobody asked if I was her mom or for ID. With my husband the first time he picked her up from daycare they requested ID even though he was on her registration paperwork they already had a copy of his DL and theyd seen him with me before. At the ER they took her back and asked him for an ID to follow her. Both times all they did was check his last name. And this considering our daughter looks just like him not just like me. She has the same eyes same mouth same smile same expressions and hair color and texture. The only thing she got from me was my mothers nose and a slightly more tan skin tone. But people take the phrase my daughter at face value with me and dont with him.Im not saying thats how everyone is.

I realized the second one will get so much more time with me talking cause I talk to a toddler all day and all the reading bed time stories etc. If you have the time perhaps get out more perhaps volunteer somewhere where you would get to chat a little with someone even an hour or two a week can make a huge difference. I do better if I get some human interaction though not everyone is this way. Do you like singing along to the radio? That might be an idea. My husband is deploying soon too so I have been looking into some ideas for the kids. Hopefully you will have skype because everyone says it really helps and Ive noticed it really has with my parents and my toddler. My dad would always sing one particular song to my son and it became their thing.  For babies recordings of dads voice and have your husband send home a gently used shirt that smells like him but not bad every month of so to stick in the crib with baby.

I dont hold out hope I love me some cow juice. Theres oat milk available too if youre looking for other variations. I love milk so the first times I tried soyalmondetc. everything tasted gross. For me the trick is not thinking of them as milk. Soy milk is actually just its own thing and not milk at all. And its alright in its own right. I actually find rice milk less satisfying than soy or almond because it has a much thinner yet grittier tastetexture. gt High protein Boost meal replacement drinks any nonanimal based protein I can handle.

3827243,0,t3_348jcx,My dear I know exactly how you feel. My mum was diagnosed with lung cancer when I was at  weeks. The pregnancy wasnt planned but all the more welcome  still my first thought was I cannot be pregnant while my mum is sick how will I be able to support her?. Thankfully she already knew about the pregnancy and told me straight up her greatest motivation to beat cancer would be to see her grandchild and get to watch him we found out later grow up.Her tumor also spread to a nearby lymphnode is inoperable and they wont do radiation because it is too close to her trachea. She had intestinal cancer almost five years ago so most likely thats where it comes from. The fact that it has taken so long to spread and develop means it not a particularly aggressive form of cancer. She is currently on her th round of chemo and is responding great! She has hardly any side effects except general fatigue has only lost two pounds is eating well and feeling as good as anyone could expect. The last MRI showed that the tumor is no longer visible yeay! The cells are still there though. She is having two more rounds of chemo she has treatment two days in a row every two weeks and then shell have a two month summer holiday.The oncologist says he expect the tumor to grow again when theres a pause in the treatment that she most likely will never recover completely and that shell need intermittent treatments for the rest of her life. However we all nourish the hope that this is something she will die with rather than from. As long as her body tackles the chemo in a stride she is fully prepared to continue treatment for as long as it takes.It took me a while to reconcile with not being able to be there for her as much as I wanted. I struggled with guilt for a long time and felt selfish for choosing to remain pregnant at a point where both my parents needed me. Thankfully we my mom dad brother my SO and I have been able to talk openly both about the hopes and fears we have and my brother has stepped up in a way I didnt think he had in him and taken on the role I had during our previous round of cancer  accompanying my mom to treatment having late night conversations with my dad when hes needed support and calming me down when Ive freaked out from not being able to contribute telling me that my part of the job now is to give birth to a healthy baby the greatest motivation my mom could have for soldering on.Reach out to the people around you  they may surprise you with their ability to provide comfortassistancea sympathetic ear. Do not feel guilty for being pregnant. Be honest with yourself and those around you about your own limitations and accept that you at times need to make priorities based on your LOs and thereby your needs. You are the only one who can care for the baby growing inside you hopefully there are other people around who can help you in supporting your mom.And keep your hopes up! Stranger miracles have happened. I never believed my mum would deal with treatment so well and maybe just maybe the knowledge that she will soon get to meet her grandchild is making a difference.The best of luck to you and your family my dear.

I told my oldest sister in English bc my parents only speak Spanish in front of my mom amp then my sister lit up and hugged me. Mom immediately said what did she say?! Why are you hugging her?! Is she pregnant?! My sis spoke to my mom so shed calm down. I want to say I was about  weeks at the time. By Christmas time I was nearing  or  weeks but I hadnt told dad. Hes very much into the cowboycharro thing so I decided I would get little baby cowboy boots and wrap them for him to open on  Christmas Day. So thats what I did he was shocked. He said congratulations but was silent for a good while after. He went to his bedroom without any words after that. Both of my parents have warmed up to the idea of their baby girl having a baby  Im  weeks now and momampdad check up on me everyday. They make sure I walk eat nap and stop by to see them dad gets sad if I miss a day lt I feel very supported by them and its helped me overcome some cruddy days.

Not gonna lie  its been hard on her doing it alone living alone but she has a network of very supportive friends and family. One thing that likely made it easier on her was that she knew from the beginning that he wouldnt be around so there was no halfin halfout kind of thing. In that regard you might find things a little less stressful now that youve separated. You wont be wondering if hell be there for you or how much you can rely on him. I know that might sound kind of skewed but I really think that knowing where things stand might make you feel better.

Is there any way you can take the rest of the day off?  Or even a  minute mental break to unwind a little?  And can anyone else take your grandma to her appointment?  Or are you her only option?  You will get through today.  Tonight focus on YOU and do whatever you need to do to unwind.  Maybe even put your yo to work massaging your neck   Buy a pint of ice cream.  Whatever it is that will help.  Ill be thinking of you and sending warm thoughts your way!!  HUGS,BabyBumps,cqz7d5t,2,t5_2s7cl

3888856,0,t3_34zd4f,Vaginal birth was not terrible or scary to me at all. In fact the thought of a csection scared me much much more than delivering vaginally. A csection is a major surgery and it is my understanding that the recovery is a lot tougher and more painful. I do not like the thought of being cut open. Delivering vaginally I was up out of my bed as soon as my daughter was born. I had a shower and felt great. I didnt go on any pain medications except for a simple ibuprofen which they gave me a script for but I never even bothered to get it filled because I didnt need it. Ive definitely got my heart set on having baby  vaginally. Anything else scares me way too much. ,BabyBumps,cqzkaiv,1,t5_2s7cl
3889223,0,t3_34zd4f,I was a Pilates instructor prior to getting pregnant and I began teaching again when my LO was about  months old. There are exercise that I cannot do because my abs do not work the same. Many women have areas of numbness around the incision for the rest of their life I had numerous clients with that issue. The numbness can make it difficult to feel when your abs are contracting. I am overweight now I was before as well but now I have a pouch of fat that looks weird in clothes that I cannot get rid of. My monds remained swollen for about  months post surgery.It is generally thought to be safer for the baby to go through the birth canal than the sunroof. Ultrasounds are notoriously unreliable this late in the game. I obviously did not like my csection for various reasons and I will try a VBAC if I decide to have another child.

But I only packed PJs feeding tanks and such nothing actually appropriate for leaving the hospital or sitting around during the day in labour. Ive got to throw in a maxi skirt or yoga shorts or something at least.And our hospitals only supply singlets and nappies for premmies and each baby gets a blanket regardless of term. All clothing and stuff you have to supply yourself which Ive had packed for ages Ive got a dozen premmie outfits and small newborn sizes because I was told at  weeks theres no way Im making it to term. If I make it to  weeks Ill pack nappies then because you cant buy premmie nappies here and the newborn sizes start from lb.Ill admit the one thing that really impressed my midwife when I was admitted was that I remembered to bring my maternal healthcare book so they didnt need to search through the computer files for my due date test results etc it was all there for them.,BabyBumps,cr49cx0,1,t5_2s7cl

3953129,0,t3_35qr9k,My suggestions Get out and do stuff. And make yourself accountable for eating. My husband and I have started going over a checklist of stuff at the end of every day. Mine includes things like Wake up at  eat breakfast brush teeth and wash face leave for work by  take vitamins eat one fruit and so on. At the end of every day when I get home we go over our checklists together try and do stuff we missed and then we each do one chore in the house whatever we want that needs doing. For me this has really helped me start eating fruit and its helped me make sure I brush my teeth after breakfast and before work. For my husband who works nights its helped to keep his sleep schedule on track so hes not exhausted all the time. Maybe having a checklist and involving your SO would help you to remember to eat? But it might also help ensure you get out for a short walk even just to the end of the block and back and add other healthy things into your life.

Its perfectly healthy and normal for kids to ask to nurse and nursing to an older age is very beneficial healthwise.

I imagine the game will change once baby becomes more alert and active as hes still in the sleepy newborn phase a bit. But at least it will be transitional.

Almost all women need a few stitches after delivery. They give you a local anaesthetic like at the dentist whether or not youve had an epidural!

Thyroid levels can also drop during pregnancy and cause you to be exhausted and drained with a low metabolism. Both are important to know if you have because you can be taking iron and or thyroid supplements. Also if youre also feeling depressed which no doubt sleeping all that amount will cause you to feel then you should make sure you are taking enough Omega  vitamins and getting healthy doses of sunlight.

4155212,0,t3_388wgh,I have a  lb German Shepherd and everyone told me that.  He can get excited and forget his obedience training every once in a while but never around my daughter. He runs in to check on her when she cries and hes in another room. When someone other than me or my immediate family holds her he sits at their feet and doesnt take his eyes off them except to turn his head if he hears something. When I leave the room to run to the bathroom or something hes laying right next to her swing when I come back in. I had her wrapped in the same blanket all day the day before we got out of the hospital and my husband took it home and put it in rebels bed. When we got home I sat on our bed thats really high and we let rebel sniff her while my husband kept his hands on his collar. Then we let him hang around but not get too near her for the next couple of days while he got used to her being around then with a hand on his collar he was allowed to sniff her in the swing. Weve had absolutely no incidences and he just loves her to death and gets visibly upset when she is upset. If Im not in the same room hell come and get me when shes crying. I just got up to pee and she sleeps in a bassinet next to my side of the bed. When I got back he was laying in front of it he usually sleeps on my side of the bed but I guess he felt he needed to be closer since I left the room. ,BabyBumps,crtwnw2,3,t5_2s7cl

But later thought theyd want two of each and now shes expecting a boy and shes quite upset even  weeks later itll be okay! Girl or not this is your baby.

Dont always need to pump yourself full of drugs sometimes antibiotics etc are needed but it shouldnt be the first course of action  typically.I went into this pregnancy wanting midwives low or no intervention and if possible a home birth in my home surrounded by my midwife team my husband and my feline family as they are calming to me.  weeks in I got horrible horrible morning sickness that hospitalized me for  days. Before that hospitalization I ended up in the emergency room  times. Once for a  hour stint of no eatingdrinking and once because I had a severe blood clot in my leg cutting off most of my circulation to my leg.My birth now? In hospital with OBGYN at one of the highest rated for high risk pregnancies in my country that Im aware of seriously woman went in with ruptured membranes at  weeks and it was like it was another day in the office. Hospital here in my town would lose its shit. Im being induced semi early assuming all goes well between now and  weeks but my labour and delivery is the furthest thing from what I wanted.

Ive had my crying moments of mourning the loss of my control and my delivery I wanted but in the end I want this baby happy and healthy and I want to live through this too.

I also had people just give me Amazon gift cards which will be nice when I finally clear it out. I did also have a Target registry for people who wanted an instore option but almost nothing got bought off of that I had the majority of my stuff on my Amazon registry to begin with. Oh also I didnt register for clothes at all and still got several outfits at my shower that the gift giver thought were just so cute! so I figure even if I had registered for clothes they wouldnt have picked the ones I wanted anyway.I didnt realize till recently that you can apply your Amazon gift card to your account and itll hold the balance for you so you dont need to keep track of the physical cards once youve entered it in. ,BabyBumps,cs1w2e6,1,t5_2s7cl

They were successful in getting pregnant and didnt tell me until they came over for a dinner party and she was obviously showing at four months.  It was a confusing and upsetting way to find out.  One of the things that upset me is that I felt that I was denied an opportunity to be happy for my friends and celebrate their happiness. My friends were so worried that I would be upset that they didnt realize I would be happy for them.

I hated having to dig around opening zippers everywhere looking for wipes and powder. Only to find clippers a nasal cleaner clothes toys THEN what I actually needed. I never carried a purse to begin with so a big bag was a HUGE obsticle for me. In the end I got a tote bag and took like  diapers wipes cream powder towel or burp cloth to lay on and maybe a few extras onesie hat pacifier. Just the basic things to change a diaper. Its quicker and cheaper and looking for a stylish tote you like is a lot easier then finding the right diaper bag. But thats just me.

Most hospitals either have their own department that handles collections or a rd party that does it for them. Paying on an account for  years is pointless with a hospital.

Weve also gone with disposable diapers over cloth because the amount we would need and the extra load of laundry every other day just about sent me over the edge thinking about it. My dad confirmed my fears by saying that they used them with me and it was a pain so when my brother was born they didnt even bother with cloth ones due to hassle. But they make great burp rags from what Ive heard so you could get some for that purpose.

To me the reaction shouldnt be any different whether it was planned or not a baby is on its way whether it was planned is completely irrelevant to the person asking. Its pure nosiness. If the answer was No it wasnt planned then is the person going to go Ohhh Im so sorry your life is over?? No of course not. The only acceptable response is to say how exciting and wonderful it is. In fact a woman with an unplanned pregnancy might be more in need of encouraging words and excitement.

You have no desire to have a baby shower hosted in your honor where you have to sit and open gifts and play baby shower games in front of a large group. You dont want pictures taken of your belly! Where it makes others feel special or happy it makes you feel uncomfortable and on display.Maybe try going back to your friend and letting her know that you understand that her wanting to do all of these things for you is her expressing her love for you. And you love her for that. You really do. You recognize and acknowledge her expression of love. That said these things are actively making you feel uncomfortable and you know that isnt her intention. You feel it would be really disingenuous to let her do all of these things because you would resent them and you just could not appreciate them in the right way because of how uncomfortable the situation would make you feel.

4366094,0,t3_3azhnz,Id take the online reviews with a grain of salt.  Even great doctors can have a handful of bad reviews.  Usually its a problem client not a problem doctor.  If its not something verified like a complaint to the medical board or a malpractice ruling may not be accurate.  Especially if you liked the office.The drive times can be important.  Your wife will be there once a month to start once a week at the end.  Every few days if she goes over due date. That hour long drive will add up.The emergency aspect is less important though.  Labor is rarely as fast as the movies show.  Especially for first time moms it usually takes hours to even need to go to the hospital.  You wont have to speed across town to be at the birth.The most important thing should be if you trust their expertise and if you feel comfortable with them.  Did they answer questions respectfully?  It can also be interesting to know the hospitals Csection rate.  Can be an indicator of overall level of intervention.

4439577,0,t3_3bwkod,I want to send comfort that putting on the right amount of weight is important for the health of the baby as well as your health postpostpartum. I lost a ton of blood with my first birth and my little one took to breast feeding right away which sucked my really dry. I lost lbs. by the time I left the birth center  days later. Although getting big was very hard I was so happy I had some backup cushioning.I totally agree with prenatal yoga some classes can be more about bonding and meditation also important! than getting a workout. Have you thought about aqua aerobics? It felt amazing to be weightless especially toward the end and I was definitely able to get my heartrate up. I was nervous about being in a bathing suit until I got o the class most of the women were over  with all of the lumps and sags you can imagine.Also you mention not wanting to buy a new wardrobe. Have you looked at Craigslist or goodwill for maternity? I was able to find a handful of wellfitting quality items at really great bargains.

I dont really want her to be in the room when I deliver but she was a little sad when my little sister told her she couldnt so I intend to let her come as long as she stays by my head. I have thought about wanting to adjust but right after you give birth you have a hard time with hormones your vagina recovering etc. It just makes it hard to adjust when you still arent quite you if that makes sense. That being said if you dont want her there be strong about it. You dont want to be annoyed and hormonal those first few days and it might just be easier to say Ill let you know if we need you but we want to see if we can figure this out ourselves. ,BabyBumps,csu73b9,1,t5_2s7cl

4507515,0,t3_3ct37a,It seems that most people in this sub are really crapping on OP and his wifes poor decision.  Im gonna chime in here as someone who does this sort of thing for a living.  Im a webcam model who sells videos and photos.  Where OPs wife went wrong wasnt that she sold pics...Because honestly who cares..Theres a zillion naked pregnant women on the internet.  Theres a few problems here.. OPs wife probably didnt charge enough for those pics.  People are far less likely to redistribute picsvids if they shelled out a good chunk of change. Chances are she was offered something like  amazon gift card which isnt much to a horny dude. Had she said Yea sure Ill send you  nudes for  Im willing to bet he wouldnt have posted those pics around.  She absolutely didnt conceal her identity.  If youre going to be sending nudes to anyone for free or not expect the worst out of the receiver. Which unfortunately is what happened here.  OPs coworker found the pics and knew it was his wife...Because she showed her face. By expecting the worst of the receiver dont show your face unless youre willing to face the consequences.   It sounds as if OPs wife also did this in secrecy. If youre gonna be sending nudes to anyone and are in a committed relationship for fucks sake people TELL YOUR SO. Have them in on it...Maybe take the pics for you and have it be something that turns the two of you on. These are just my opinions based on experience.  At the end of the day if youre going to post or send sexually natured pics to anyone expect the worst and expect that it WILL come back to you in your real life.  For the record my mother and all my family is totally aware of what I do and while its not their  career choice for me they know Im happy safe and will have all the time in the world to care for my babies and still work from home while theyre napping. EDIT Id like to add something else as I reread some of the comments here.. A lot of us pregnant women are going through major changes in our bodies and quite a few of us for the first time. Were hormonal self conscious..And it sounds like maybe OPs wife is going through some low self esteem and maybe getting a message from a random stranger really did a lot for her self esteem.  How she handled it was clearly not the best but its no reason for this community to pull out their pitch forks on this couple.  Some are even recommending counselling lawyering up or preparing for custody battles...I dont think any of this is necessary.  This guy OP is just trying to save some other families some heart ache of what him and his wife are going through.  Lets be a little softer on them. This is a place of SUPPORT not judgement...Unless youre that lady who peed in the gas station because the attendant wouldnt let you use the employee bathroom..Feel shame pee lady. ,BabyBumps,csytm1z,4,t5_2s7cl

4509896,0,t3_3cko4q,Yep I have averaged between  migraines per week for the past  years or so.  This is my second pregnancy in  years and Ive had to take medication during both.  I have also gotten Botox for them during this pregnancy and that helped lessen the frequency but not the intensity.  The key for me has always been taking medication early enough to stop a migraine before it totally blows up.  During this pregnancy I take Norco same active ingredients as Vicodin instead of my migraine med Imitrex because that drug inhibits blood flow to the placenta.  Ive tried every kind of natural treatment there is  chiropractic acupuncture meditation PT biofeedback manual adjustments by a neurologist.  Sometimes medication is the only answer.

I dont have the money to buy a whole newborn stash that hes just going to outgrow by lbs. That said I highly recommend checking out the Facebook buyselltrade cloth diaper groups. I have a stash of about  and all but  of them were bought second hand off these groups. You will save sooooooo much money buying them second hand however Alvas and sunbaby are both pretty inexpensive on their own! Im on mobile right now let me get on the pc and I will try to find the links to the groups. DEdit Here is a link to a site that lists a bunch of CD groups.I am members of these My favorite Cloth Diaper SwapCheapies CD group all  and under.BumGenius BSTFuzzibunz BSTAlso check out rclothdiaps!Our personal favorites are Twinkie Tush Rumparooz and Sunbaby. With our son I just cannot get a good leg fit with BGs which is unfortunate because they are really good CDs! Mentioning this to second that you should build a stash with much variety not all CDs are equal and it takes a little trial and error to find what works for you. Edit Also want to mention that it is a good idea to get plenty of inserts. There are many different kindsmicrofiber hemp bamboo and blends all with different levels of absorbency over time. For example bamboo holds a lot more wetness but takes longer to absorb so I usually layer those under a microfiber insert which absorbs fast but holds less. And never left microfiber touch your babes skin! It will pull the moisture from them and can cause irritation dryness and rash. Edit  lol Resource about CD inserts,BabyBumps,ct0r23j,2,t5_2s7cl

My local Urgent care does it and it is so much nicer than the ER though if it happens a third time the ER it is to see if there is anything else that can be done.And if you are already dehydrated anything you try to get unnauseous will not work.  Dont worry about food at the moment and sometimes Water is too harsh for me so liquids are the priority. Gatorade coconut water with pink lemonade bubbly stuff with sugar etc.The UnisomB route worked for me in early pregnancy.  Zofran can contribute to birth defects if used in early pregnancy so there may be a risk calculation to take.  I didnt start taking it until week  and it was good.

4593305,0,t3_3dw2ea,I had always been extremely afraid of needles just getting a shot would cause me to be light headed and to pass out but I did get an epidural and let me tell you something... Its nowhere near as bad as it looks. The worst part of the whole thing is staying still while they are putting it in since you are mid contractions. You get a shot of lidocaine first to numb the area and guess what it feels the same as a REGULAR SHOT! Then they insert the little catheter which is mostly just a feeling of pressure. What helped me was to lean forward with a pillow under my stomach and squeezed my husbands hands. The actual insertion only takes a few minutes especially if youve got a great anesthesiologist and the catheter that actually stays in your back is extremely thin. Within  minutes of insertion you are amazed at the lack of pain. The nurse would tell me Youre having a huge contraction right now! Literally didnt feel a thing. Even if not for the pain control what was most amazing was being able to sleep and get my strength up for pushing a delivery which is beyond exhausting. Dont worry when you are ready to push you will definitely be able to feel it youre body just takes over and does what it has to do. I am  happy with my choice and will definitely get an epidural again with my next kids. Hope this helped to ease the fears! ,BabyBumps,ct9kuyc,1,t5_2s7cl

That way the choice is removed for me regardless of if I change my mind in the heat of the moment. But they do offer other forms of pain relief if needed which is reassuring.My list of pros and cons is much like yours so I signed up for Bradley Method classes and have read a lot of natural childbirth books to try to prepare but dont really have a birth plan other than no epidural or spinal intervention but open minded to most everything else.I also have been freaking out over he risk of tearingcutting lately.

4646047,0,t1_ctfcyeq,I have bipolar I take medication and Im staying on two of them Lexapro and Lamictal through pregnancy.Different medications have different levels of safety. Prozac Lexapro and Zoloft are IIRC considered the safest to take during pregnancy. There are probably some risks namely heartblood pressure issues but the additional risk is around  or so compared to a mom not taking SSRIs.As my doctor puts it the additional  risk there DEFINITELY outweighs the risks resulting from not taking care of yourself eating right high blood pressure from stress that sort of thing.The good news is that Ive been on my meds since TTC and Ive had no depression relapses. Ive had a few days that were pretty obviously OMG all the hormones but they havent slid into the deep depths of depression like I was afraid of. And Little Dude is measuring totally healthy no problems at all!So based on personal experience I would suggest giving meds a shot if youre comfortable with it. Maybe a different med than youve taken in the past would work differently Ive certainly had some that made me feel more flat and zombielike than others.

They press you on it because they cant think of anything else to pretend to care about and it seems like a safe and friendly topic. Like the weather. Theyre just feeling like theyre on the spot.     Personally I try to to be as polite to those people as theyre being to me. Because you know what? It is a safe and friendly topic. Even if you genuinely dont care whether its a boy or a girl. Just engage in their game.     Oh haha well I heard boys are difficult as toddlers but girls are difficult as preteens so I either way i guess. or Well I saw some cute baby girl clothes at the store the other day! or Ive always hoped Id have a daughter to go fishing with but my partner would rather go with a boy because they can pee standing up.     Whatever. You dont have to mean it. Just smile and banter politely with them because thats what theyre doing for you and then both of you can be on your way.,BabyBumps,ctj0qs6,6,t5_2s7cl

4683093,0,t3_3f345c,One thing Ive learned from reading posts similar to yours is that trusting the word of the medical office or practitioner is never the best move. Always always always contact your insurance company first.I have a lot of confusion and still do have confusion about insurance in general. I call my insurance company way too often and always ask them to speak to me like Im five years old so I understand the ins and outs of everything. I know youre extremely frustrated amp I myself have had some issues with getting weird bills in the mail and having to argue my point for someone. However that someone is always my insurance company not the medical center or practitioner. Note  I never got any kind of notification from my insurance company that something wasnt covered it was always directly from a lab or a medical center. So Im not sure if the insurance company is supposed to contact you though I think they should it kind of makes sense because they dont care who pays them but even if I dont get any communication from them I always contact the insurance company directly. This is exactly why I always recommend for those new folks who join the subreddit that one of the first things they should do after getting their positive pregnancy test is to talk extensively with their insurance company says they understand the nuances of all of this crap.

4726113,0,t3_3fnks7,Honestly in that case it might just be easier to go straight to a convertible. Youll need to baby wear which is honestly easy and kind of awesome. I have a Graco Snugride that we used for my son as his infant seat and I liked it but after the first couple months it was a pain in the ass carrying it around because he got heavier. When choosing a convertible try it out in your car to see how it fits. Babies R Us and Buy Buy Baby will let you try out seats but what I would do is try out the seats at the store and then order them on Amazon its often a bit cheaper that way. I recommend the Graco MySizeFiteSizeMeContenderHeadwise same seat just different names at different retailers and with different patterns Chicco Nextfit Cosco Scenera Next or Evenflo Sureride... Or Graco Ever or Britax MarathonBoulevardAdvocate Clicktight if you wanna splurge. Avoid at all costs the Safety First Alpha Omega Elite its horrible and youll wanna burn it immediately.

4726248,0,t1_ctq1t7f,This sounds cliche but its really true.  Every single pregnancy is different.  Im on my th and until this one I really truly thought that all the other pregnant women were BSing about how tired sore and sick they were.  Im miserable.  Theres no way I would be able to go to the gym and even walk on a treadmill this time around let alone do a crossfit class.  I struggle to go on my daily walk and thats a short half hour walk.  I havent vacuumed but maybe once or twice because I end up with painful contractions round ligament pain its no joke feels like youre being stabbed in your sides and back pain.  Its ridiculous the amount of discomfort Im in.  So yes while as a general rule pregnancy should allow for moderate exercise not every individual pregnancy allows it!  Also some doctors will tell you not to exercise even if you are having a normal pregnancy.. Ive had a Dr who told me not to risk it at all with my last pregnancy.  Even though I was in decent shape and already exercising.  He told me to tone it down rest as much as possible on my side and delegate chores to other people.  Then Ive had midwives tell me Im fine to do whatever as long as Im comfortable.  You also have to take into consideration her individual health and fitness before she became pregnant.  If shes been used to daily vacuumingcleaning and incorporated regular exercise into her routine then she would have an easier time than someone who just isnt going into the pregnancy in the best shape.  If shes in crappy shape vacuuming could actually be a bit of a cardio workout which in some pregnancies isnt advisable.  Id give your wife the benefit of the doubt on this one.. Even if she is sort of using pregnancy as a get out of jail free card.. Well shes probably somewhatextremely miserable right now.  Its temporary!  JMC,BabyBumps,ctqa84p,1,t5_2s7cl
4726413,0,t3_3fnua6,Sorry this is a bit long I hope my experience gives you some insight!I never had an official diagnosis but I was an overexerciser and undereater for a long time before trying to get pregnant. I also wasnt underweight but I think my body fat just got too low. I had very long irregular cycles but still didnt think it would affect me. I was wrong! Once my husband and I started trying I realized that my unhealthy habits had actually affected me. I was tracking my ovulation at the time and would notice that my body would gear up to ovulate for a few days not ovulate then try again a couple weeks later. That would result in like a month cycle sometimes.Eventually I told my husband what was happening and that I suspected my unhealthy habits were to blame. He helped me ensure I was eating enough and exercising moderately. I gained around  pounds and then had another REALLY LONG cycle and ended up conceiving on cycle day ! The pregnancy was completely healthy with no issues or scares.If you are ready I dont think there is any reason to wait for your cycles to regulate unless your doctor has told you to do so. Good luck!Also wanted to point out that after my first was born and my period returned it has been very regular for the first time in my life and Ive been able to get pregnant immediately the past two times we tried. ,BabyBumps,ctqaz28,1,t5_2s7cl

4766817,0,t1_ctvcnmf,oh I see what you mean. I dont know if this info helps at all or maybe you already have heard all this but just in case its helpful here goesOur vaginas have incredible capabilities that they rarely get credit for and that are usually not seen because vaginas are on the inside. However they can swell and grow as much as a penis if not more. They have incredible abilities to change shape stretch increase bloodflow and yes bounce back.Also I dont know if this is kosher to say but of all the births Ive attended after the baby is born the vast majority of vaginas and vulvas look virtually exactly the same as they did before the birth.In other words someone who didnt know that woman had just given birth basically wouldnt be able to tell. The owner of the vagina obviously can tell every tiny detail thats different because it is hers but to the outside eye the tissues look pretty much EXACTLY the same. Even if there is a small tear its barely visible most of the time. Im not saying it doesnt feel a whole lot different for a bit lol but just because there is some discomfort that doesnt mean damage has been done.  Given these were very normal births but still I think the idea that vaginas get destroyed is very very misguided and not true except in a small amount of births. Dont know if that helps but just throwing it out there our bodies really are incredible and aweinspiring ,BabyBumps,ctvefw6,3,t5_2s7cl

Some people it breaks apart others it comes out all at once.Clear or slightly white creaminess is another joy of being pregnant that can make you feel wet all the time.  This one is really common.And I think Im not sure but I think its ok to have sex as long as your water didnt break.  Thats a different feeling all over again.  Some women feel it pop some dont others drip a little some gush.  And its  like water.  Itll pool inside you if you lay down then come out or just pour out rarely and even drip while you stand.

4771760,0,t1_ctvy0jn,I was sent to U of M after the initial scary diagnoses and the CT scan at my local hospital. U of M did a simple heart echo and told me I was misdiagnosed. They were fantastic doctors. They did diagnose me with low amniotic fluid and intermittent high BP but they decided that baby and I were no longer considered highrisk and gave us the option to transfer back into the care of our original OB. Our original OB was not the one who misdiagnosed us that was my cardiologist. We agreed to go back into his care because U of M is  hours from us and the thought of having to go out there twice a week or monitoring plus delivery seems like to much stress on us if it wasnt necessary.As far as the steroids I started them yesterday morning. My doctor told me I should have relief by tomorrow morning so Im jumping the gun a bit on saying they arent working... I was just hoping for a miracle cure! I hope your baby cooperates and takes pity on you and agrees to come out soon!!! I feel so bad that you arent getting any relief for the PUPPPs. I am thankful that at least my doctor is willing to try to find me some relief. Ive been putting cold compresses on the itchiest parts of my body but at this point I am almost covered in cold rags!

4779548,0,t1_ctwz7ty,gt Gifted kids especially in the age range that I teach  absolutely think differently than other students their age. There is much evidence to suggest this idea has more to do with perception and background among other things of parents caregivers and instructors and as a result the way in which these children are responded tointeracted with at an early age than reality i.e. inherent ability.I too have worked in a field that differentiates students into and along regular and gifted programs and trajectories and given that the bar for entry into the gifted programsclasses is more often than not that a simple observation was made by someone somewhere along the line whether parent teacher counselor etc. that the child is gifted I tend to give a lot of credence to this theory. The idea of baby geniuses is becoming a thing of the past and with good reason. Prodigies as a result of differentiation on a physiological level are SO rare compared to the number of children who are deemed gifted that it really calls the structure of the whole giftednotgifted instructional system into question. Consider the wealth of research that suggests a childs educationaldevelopmental experiences relate more strongly to their academic outcomes especially when were looking at longterm than assessments of intelligence and the advice still stands. Instruction that is attentive and appropriate for a childs individual learning style something that children deemed gifted more often receive produces much more desirable results and reliable outcomes than that which is based on standardized or nonstandardized assessments of general intelligence or giftedness.ETA No offense to someone who works within such a system certainly plenty of evidence suggests that these classrooms are a better educational environment Im just reiterating the findings of the most current research into this phenomenon to speak more towards how these children got there in the first place. At the heart of the discussion is the ageold question regarding the effects of nature vs. nurture which will always be somewhat controversial to distinguish. PS On a note more of commonsenseobservation consider the number of kids who are separated into the gifted category in childhood compared to those who continue on this path in high school...then college...and the number of exceptionally gifted and talented adults? Clearly there is a dropoff and a disconnect somewhere. While many many industries exist to profit off of parents belief and desire for a gifted child and as such have a very vested interest in perpetuating these notions as the bias of caregivers becomes less relevant you gradually have far fewer exceptional people in general society which only makes sense when you think about it.,BabyBumps,ctx045j,4,t5_2s7cl

I had surgery a year before I gave birth and didnt do well with the pain meds they gave me nothing seemed to make a dent except the most hardcore drugs. My biggest fear was that I was going to be in labor for a long time decide I couldnt take it anymore have the epidural and have it not do anything when I really really needed it. In the end I was cm when I got to the hospital and only there for  hours before the baby arrived. It all happened so quickly that I didnt really have a chance to have one and I ended up not needing one. Im hoping it will be the same this time but you never know. Im still open to an epidural if theres time and will just see how it goes. I think being flexible is the best plan.

My husband was immediately excited I cried for an entire day I am not much of a crier normally. I called my mom and just cried on the phone without saying a word for about  minutes because I couldnt get myself together. In your wifes defense I will say that I felt MUCH better and more excited after telling a few people. Even if she is excited she is probably also very scared. I really needed to know that my close family were there for me to talk to people who had been through this my mom just told me over and over again honey its going to be ok. I promise. and it helped that everyone I told was over the moon excited for us. And more than anything I needed my husband. He wanted to wait a few months to tell anyone but I just couldnt. I needed my support network and thankfully he understood.

4813599,0,t3_3gng7d,My first pregnancy took five months to conceive and it ended after  weeks. We took some time to heal and eventually decided to try again. My second pregnancy took  months to conceive and sadly it too ended but this time at  weeks. The mindset that I had after two losses was not good! I was convinced that I was broken. But after more healing time we decided to give it one last shot. My third pregnancy took six months to conceive. The entire  months that he grew in my belly I was cautiously waiting for that ball to drop. I tried not to bond too much or get too attached out of the fear of having him ripped away from me. But my son is now  months old and daily kicking my ass! We accidentally surprisingly conceived again and I am currently  weeks with my fourth pregnancy. Even after having a successful pregnancy the same fear and anxiety grips me into this pregnancy. I still have nightmares about pregnancy loss. I do not know if I am qualified to give advice but I would say to take it one day at a time. Thats how I got through ttc my last pregnancy and am approaching this one.

Several times in the past few years Ive ovulated DURING my period which is not super helpful when trying to conceive. In June I had a  day period. Then my husband went away on business.  Then I started spotting for  days though not full blown period.  Then it stopped for  days.  During that  day time frame we had sex.  Then I spotted again for  days.  Then on the th day I got a positive FRER.  So here is how this went down.  Either I was still on the June cycle meaning I ovulated on day  or something like that.  Or the spotting was a new cycle and I ovulated on day .  US monday to give me a better idea of what went down.  ,BabyBumps,cu31t76,2,t5_2s7cl

We plan on keeping the baby in our room until its bit enough for a toddler bed which will be a regular bed with the attached rails and stuff to make it for a toddler so theres no point we figure. I also dont see the point in hanging up tiny clothes that require infant hangers so everything will be in drawers in our room because we just dont have that much stuff. We might put a rocking chair or glider in the livingroom and aside from that the only thing that would go in a nursery is a changing table which just seems really pointless. Im much more comfortable changing baby on the floor on a portable mat and my husband has said the same after trying to change his niece on her changing table while she constantly rolled and fought!

Im in KW and we have a few independently owned baby stores here that sell them. I know there are places in Woodstock London Toronto and most major cities too. I dont think the EMAB site ships to Canada but Amazon.ca has the products...wont help you for tomorrow though.  Another thought might be contacting a local midwife clinic. My friend used a midwife and they gave her a bag of mixed herbs for a postpartum bath. She ended up not using it and gave it to me for when the time comes but I wouldnt be surprised if theyd be willing to either sell you a pack or tell you where to get it.  Finally you could look up postpartum bath soak postpartum sitz bath or something along those lines and you might be able to find a recipe you could make yourself.

Maybe because its exoticizing something which is a normal everyday thing to other people like Orientalism? To me mixed raced babies or kids can be as cute or ugly as any monoracial baby and saying mixed raced babies are so cute just makes it seem like youre unnecessarily exalting them to some exotic ideal status.

Wasnt much comfort at the time but later I was just happy that the mass was noncancerous and since then the swellinghardness has relieved a bit.. could be that I switched to a maternity bra but cant say for sure.My point being pregnancy causes weirdness especially with your breasts and even doctors are liable to simply chalk things up to that.

Pregnancy is so much worse than having a newborn I have watched my share of newborns and pregnancy is the WORST and I have yet to meet anyone who misses it. If I do I will think that person is lying. For sleep you may want to ask your doctor if you can take unisom or melatonin. I take a unisom and a tylenol every night and it helps me sleep WAY better I mean I still wake up to pee but its only like  times a night and I can sleep in between.On a funny side note I told my husband I wish I had a unicorn pregnancy and my husband replied yours is more like a centaur its still magical but not quite as pretty It made me laugh so I hope it makes you laugh too.EDIT if you ever want to complain  PM me  I get it.,BabyBumps,cuf1jyc,3,t5_2s7cl

4970210,0,t3_3izetj,Typically the doctors want you to get back on birth control ASAP after the birth as many women are EXTREMELY fertile right after giving birth.  I got an IUD right after birth at my six week follow up appointment.  I chose the mirena which I loved. As far as Sprintec Im not familiar with that brand of BC but I do know that they typically recommend the minipill if you want an oral form of birth control right after giving birth if you are breastfeeding  the higher doses of hormones can affect breastfeeding negatively is my understanding.  Id talk with your OB now and figure out what you want to do after giving birth but one thing to keep in mind is that the hair growth and acne are also common side effects of pregnancy not just going off of birth control.  Edit I totally just stalked some of your history so I see that you probably arent planning on breastfeeding and you want a pretty serious form of birth control in which case I would HIGHLY recommend getting an IUD  theyre long term very easy in terms of maintenance a monthly check of your strings is just about all you need and have a very high success rate.

I feel its more personal and I have enjoyed being cared for by midwives much more than when I was seeing an OB.A couple hospitals here also offer a midwife option but from my research I found that they do not follow the true midwifery model and are closer to the regular medical model of care.

I know that doesnt take the fear away completely particularly when people you know go through them my sisters friend had one recently and found at the  week scan very sad but just remind yourself they do not happen that often and heaps of peoples symptoms come and go all through pregnancy.

5059629,0,t1_cuvuqrx,I wasnt sure what your financial situation was like. For some reason probably because Im in the US I equate being a single mom to also mean you area struggling financially. That would be my biggest hurdle if I was a single mom. Even though I make ok money if it was just me it would be hard to support my kids here in the US. The important thing to understand is that as a momma bear you will get through this. It seems bleak now but you will find a way to make it work. It sounds like your SO at least right now is not the support you need and may even be doing more damage by still being in your life. You cant expect him to change. Yes he may one day but you cant count on that. You know single moms all over the world make it work. Being financially independent will help you tremendously. You can afford good child care when you go back to work and you wont have the added stress of money to worry about.I know in our area there are local mom groups that meet up and go to parks and set up play dates.

5064219,0,t3_3ka3dm,Hello I had my baby a few months ago and I was exactly where you are. I was so depressed I couldnt even get out of bed. I hated being pregnant I hated my life I hated how much pain I was in. I wouldnt talk to anyone around me. I remember after one of my doctors appointments finding out I had not dilated any since the last I just sobbed for hours and hours straight. Even though I rationally knew it didnt mean anything I wanted some proof of progress dammit. Well I was induced for very mild high blood pressure. . And I had the most stress free relaxing amazing labor. Seriously I wouldnt change one single thing. Whether you end up being induced or not I dont want you to feel bad about it. I was terrified on this sub  there is such condescension towards inductions and so many horror stories. It wasnt anything like I was led to believe and spoiler alert most of the horror stories werent even from ladies that had inductions themselves! So Im not quite sure why there is such an anger toward inductions around here. However thats not why I posted I just wanted you to know it doesnt make you bad! As soon as I had that baby I felt like a million bucks. Seriously an hour after labor and I felt bad than I ever did during pregnancy even the supposed niche of the second tri. I had a horrible pregnancy. My depression was lifted and I have been in high spirits since then. I had the opposite of the baby blues I was finally feeling better and could finally bond with my baby without being so miserable. I just wanted to chime in and let you know that youre most definitely not alone and it will get better!  Take it a minute at a time if you have to. I was so afraid that I wouldnt ever feel better and I would hate my baby but its not the case. Best of luck girl you  have this. ,BabyBumps,cuwfi42,2,t5_2s7cl

While mine wasnt that bad it still hurt insane amounts. I would be tears very often. I would see if you could see a chiropractor or someone who get help you. Good news is it really does go away the second you give birth! ,BabyBumps,cuwm2c5,1,t5_2s7cl
5065888,0,t3_3kdm50,I had this same problem and all it took was one physio session and a sacroiliac belt I borrowed one on deposit sorted my hips right out. I also got a couple massages after which helped too. It should be a solvable problem! If you can get the belt you just wear it really snug over your hips and under your belly whenever youre going to be walking around it helps push your bones back where they are comfortable again. ,BabyBumps,cuwmq4w,1,t5_2s7cl

But its more of they are afraid they might anger the ancestors or gods or someone and that will jinx the baby so most of the time people wont buy anything for the baby until the baby is here. I dont like being unprepared so I buy things on sale and clearance as I go along. What is worse is that this pregnancy I am a little small compared to my first so my MIL and FIL is worried.

5093356,0,t3_3kprl7,I train dogs. When working with clients its not much more than advanced obedience right now but I am still at  weeks doing protection training with my GSD. I no longer catch dogs on the bite sleeve I havent since I found out I was pregnant as I felt there was to much risk of a dog punching me as she hit the sleeve. On a good day handling my dog I am holding back lbs of solid muscle while the decoy agitates him and gets him incredibly amped up send him on a bite probably the easiest part...let go of him and say a command walkjog after him to the decoy tell the decoy to stop fighting my dog and tell my dog to let go of the sleeve. On a bad day I have to do all of the above plus manually take my dog off the bite we are still working on getting his outing . I also do tracking and narcotics detection with my dog. The tracking consists of me trying to hold back lbs of solid muscle as he bulldozes his way down the scent track he gets VERY amped up to work as I walkjog behind him. Detection isnt as physically demanding on me as tracking or protection but it still involves a lot of walking around often in the heat.According to my doctor since I was doing all of this before I got pregnant as long as I feel up to doing it I can continue just to make sure I listen to my body and dont over do it. My best friend trains with me and will pick up on subtle changes in my behavior or my dogs behavior he is also my service dog and VERY in tune to me that tell her I need a break and she will remind me to take one.

5114990,0,t3_3l1xun,We had our baby shower last month and it was such an amazing time!So many people from different walks of life came out to celebrate with us. We had yummy food and I was in such a great mood the whole time! My face hurt by the end of it because I was literally smiling the entire time! It was fun seeing so many people who have supported us over the years all in the same room we tried for over  years to get pregnant. I did make a registry with different items on there ranging from small items under  to mid sizes items . And we also registered for a couple of big ticket items in case parents wanted to get those or anyone wanted to go in together. I was really surprised but almost everyone either purchased from our registry or gave us gift cards to the store we registered at. Maybe  guests went off the registry and purchased us clothes and blankets  and they were all super cute things. Our family and friends really spoiled us. I do understand your concern. My husband and I do not like to own a lot of stuff. We prefer having less things but things we love and will hopefully use. Of course its our first time being pregnant so we will see how that goes once little man gets here  but we tried to stick to the basics only diapers creams wipes car seat crib sheets.  Also we love the idea of buying things we need that are gently used for a fraction of the cost because why not save money both our crib and stroller were previously loved which are normally two very big ticket items. The idea of someone spending their hard earned money on something I dont need makes me sad. If you do receive items that you simply do not want everyone has different tastes and opinions or too many of anything you can always try to return those for store credit to use towards the things you do need you can try to resale them or you can always donate them to families who may need them more than you.

Its hard to be objective when you just want to keep busy be useful and provide an income. Remember that you have to take care of baby by taking care of you. That means accepting that you have limits that didnt exist prepregnancy or at this point in the game limits that you didnt have even just a few weeks ago. I was very physically active prepregnancy weight lifting running two physically demanding jobs and now just call me Jabba the Hutt. I felt like a failure when I turned in my final date but Im so glad I listened to my body. So be Jabba with me until baby comes.

Try to hold out on an induction until late on week  if theres no other complication but we are also concerned about your placenta getting tired in week  and an induction can take  days...

I have been setting aside my Walmart gift cards to use during maternity leave. I have been couponing through swagbucks so I earn swagbucks for each coupon used on top of getting a discount and found some great deals on the dog and cat food I use so I am stocking up. My goal is to have enough dog and cat food set aside that I dont have to buy any until I go back to work. There have also been some awesome coupons for baby wipes so Ive been starting to stock up on those too.SO and I have been very frugal since we moved in together but now we are being even more so to cushion our savings even more.After our baby shower we are planning on buying used for anything we still have to get for the baby.For our birthdays both came after we announced that we were expecting and christmas when asked what we wanted we asked for gift cards to costco walmart amazon and visa gift cards.As soon as we both have time to go to the DSS office we will be applying for WIC and Im going to look into the possibility of getting food stamps too while on maternity leave.,BabyBumps,cvfpya5,1,t5_2s7cl

5244461,0,t3_3msgzl,I am struggling HARD being off my meds and baby brain is compounding it. Like to the point where I have had to scale my work back to one WFH day per week. Ive just given up and set a very low bar for myself during pregnancy. Ive been showing up at wrong places and wrong times for appointments being an impulsive spender interrupting people and Im now the queen of non sequiturs. Try using a planner on your phone that sends you reminders. Paper planners dont work for me cause I have no impetus to look at it but having my phone buzz at me works great. Also writing out checklists for my morning leaving the house and evening routine and posting them on the wall and just following to a T every day. Soon enough the list will turn into a habitual routine and habits tend to override ADHD. You have to get your husband on board with this. Aside from the ADHD its his kid too and it seems like you are bearing all the mental physical and logistical burden of keeping it growing and alive. You need to tell him that while unmedicated for the baby! That belongs to both of you! you literally cannot manage logistics and he will need to release that burden from you as his contribution to gestating his child. If you put it very clear cut terms he will be more likely to understand. Hes gotta help you with appointments and keeping track of routines checking in on you gently about your agenda for the day etc. Tell him hes your coach. But you will have to be more gentle on yourself during pregnancy. Your symptoms are gonna be so much worse I am learning to ride the wave and just accept that despite all good intentions my productivity will be shot. Just celebrating the good days and understanding that its temporary is helping.  ,BabyBumps,cvi5anu,2,t5_2s7cl

Both of them move sporadically and its completely unpredictable at this stage. Some days I feel one a lot and the other not at all and the next day itll be opposite. I guess what Im getting at is that its still kind of early to worry about daily movements and keep in mind there is a good chance your guy is moving while youre moving and thus more difficult for you to feel. ,BabyBumps,cvi99z9,3,t5_2s7cl

His dad sees our son every few months or more and his mom a little less than that but its never pleasant. Last time his dad came over it was the first time in  months since hes seen his grandson and he spent the entire time nagging at my husband. His mom is a little better but shes weird and unemotional and its hard for my husband to be around her. Luckily my parents live locally and are a lot better lol. Hopefully yours kind of chill out a bit.

Also firm transverse abs are what stops the mummytummy pooch belly so its a good thing for them to be activated and firms up rather than letting your belly hang out for them to stretch and get weak and separate. Also activated absreduces lower back pain. I personally try to keep keep mine activated with tail tucked under and have never had lower back pain duringmy pregnancy.

Target has great sleep nursing bras that I use for aroundthehouse wear that are NOT great support but are enough to hold nursing pads in place and keep things from flying everywhere. I wear a  GG so you know Im not kidding when I say these will fit big boobs. They are the Stella in XL. I have lived in this thing at home for almost  months. I love it.  Forget nursing bras in your size. FORGET THEM. Theyre expensive and only online and you cant try them on. Instead do this buy a bra that fits you well and is good quality. I suggest Nordstrom or Lane Bryant Nordstrom does excellent fittings possibly in combination with the internet once you find your brand size Nordstroms Elomi bras are  bucks in store  Ive gotten then online for . Then CONVERT them. You dont need to know how to sew. If you can stick a needle in and out of fabric you can do this. I bought enough supplies to convert  bras for about . So far Ive done four. Theyre cute they fit perfectly and they cost me about  each.Instructions hereAnd an extra I find that the Target Gilligan amp OMalley nursing tanks actually have a good bit of room for the bustier gals and arent terrible at support.

I found this thread while searching the babybumps archives and I actually found a bunch of threads with people getting reassured about this. If you havent tried that yet its very comforting. Edited to add My sense is that overall there is around a  chance of the baby being growthrestricted but this is my favorite study found on the subject so far. Unlike many studies that either looked at the placenta itself or doctors notes which would be more likely to note MCI if it related to a later outcome this study looks at people diagnosed with MCI in the midterm ultrasound.

His protocol and many doctors do this is to begin viral suppressants at  weeks to prevent an outbreak during labor which would mandate a cesarean I ended up having an outbreak at  weeks so we started the suppressants early. I was able to avoid further outbreaks had a healthy baby boy vaginally with no complications.

Ultimately she is parenting very differently from you and once you have your baby you will see bad parenting pretty much everywhere. Its sad and scary and our emotions tend to start to carry us away but I like to think pretty much every mother is doing her best. It sounds like she definitely is making some choices that could be negatively affecting her kids but we are all going to somewhere down the line and its good to keep that in mind when you think about how to confront the issue  because you will do something she disagrees with somewhere too and how would you like her to approachnot approach you? This is the reason I dont talk to moms who put the carseat on top of the cart. I dont think what Im going to say is going to change their opinion any and probably the BEST way to share information is to like an article on facebook so that youre spreading good info to those subscribed to your feed.Glad you vented though...because God knows how many women I would have corrected by now if I didnt have my husband to complain to!,BabyBumps,cw1hchu,13,t5_2s7cl

Other than that they have you come pee on a test to confirm the pregnancy and then they make your first appointment.  But you dont even see a doctor or nurse when you come in for the urine sample.

I talked with the SO who I had been dating for a similar amount of time was against abortion and so I took a few days to myself to really think about it. I obviously changed my mind but it was a tough life changing decision that took me time to make. His kneejerk response shouldnt deem him as the scum of the Earth automatically. You will be pregnant for what feels like forever trust me so just give him a few days. He may come around he may not. Either choice is his to make and I doubt he will be making it lightly.

However if you arent sure if you really like this doctor then I think its totally fine to ask him for a recommendation explain you want something closer to home.

5500640,0,t1_cwer7nr,As a follow up  as for feeling in the dark  that shouldnt be the case.  Talk to your care provider and ask them to explain things better  let them know that youre feeling lost about the whole process and want to understand what the next step in the process is.  I think some doctors just assume everyone knows whats going on and need to be reminded that they dont.  If they dont get you up to speed and arent willing to answer questions then find a new doctor but hopefully just asking to be kept more in the loop will help.

5534741,0,t3_3qwmv6,gtthoughts.    I wrote a little bit about this in my ish weeks Pregnancy Journal  So Ie definitely been thinking about it too.    I hope the baby gets my inquisitive nature. Ive never stopped wondering about the world and the experiences of others. This helped me as much as a counselor as when I was a physics student.  I hope the baby gets my restless nature. Because abundant energy works well with the inquisitiveness.  I hope the baby gets my ability to advocate for self and others. Because Im a competent fighter. I dont like doing it. But damn I do get results where others fail. My whole life people have said I should be a lawyer. But as my mom says in a family full of lawyers that is not necessarily a compliment.    I hope the baby doesnt get my tolerance for risk. For it has given me many adventures. And many stories. But of course as a mother I hope she is tamer than I was. Because I feel shell be safer.  I hope she doesnt get my jitter. Not as in fears or anxiety. Because I dont generally have a lot or any of that. But I do have a kind of ticking in my head that never lets me stand still. Its useful when applied to problems that need solving. Or crises that need help. But at am you come to want some calm. I didnt sleep much until my midtwenties.     Egg Fertilizer is the same way though. With a kind of restless ticking although his manifests more as anxiety and mine manifests more as endless project makingtaking. Similarly when we found a  box of Ferties childhood report cards for temperament notes they all said Fertie is an extremely extroverted child who has no problem making friends but needs to learn to be more careful about not hurting himself. Careful we are not. Neither one of us.        When I was kid I climbed to the top of a very tall slide and then jumped off the side. Why? Thats a good question.  When I was  I rappelled down the back of a waterfall without batting an eyelash at the lack of a harness.  Street racing experimental recreational drug use bad boys anything and everything under the sun stimulating  until just a few years ago.      I have no regrets and Im not dead. But oh boy. I hope this kid is less of a sensation seeker. But isnt that what every mother hopes? That their kid keeps themselves safe?     gtHow to go about things    I was raised in a family of scientists in addition to the lawyers. So Im mostly in the nature camp about temperament. Its very possible emotionally that this kid could get all genes that would for lack of a better term make them an extremely difficult person to manage or control. So what to do? My only guess is be more permissive than my own parents.     My parents were hard core authoritarian power and control wheel people. So Ive always wondered if I wouldnt have thrashed so hard if I didnt have anything to thrash against. But I kind of also accept that as the inevitability of the way Im built. I was adopted. So I wasnt raised in a family that was like me genetically or socially. If how I am was built on social modeling I could not have had a more riskadverse template. Temperamentwise although I was raised to be extremely different wellmanicured polite demur I still ended up much more closely resembling my biological family of origin than the people who raised me.     My biomom loves heavy metal spicy food loud men leather arguments talking to everyone and anyone who crosses her path etc. My adoptive mother isnt warm and cuddly either but she paints daffodils and will hardly cross the street alone. Put it where one will in my life nature won.    So what to do about this kid? Just hope its happy and healthy I suppose. I dont believe you can control lifedevelopment anyway. Too many external variables.     I will encourage himher to explore their world. Let himher take age appropriate risks. And hope they develop enough powers of discernment to keep himherself safe once out of my range. I think interests decide themselves. They definitely did in my own life.  ,BabyBumps,cwj41g3,1,t5_2s7cl

5579623,0,t3_3rhqax,I think part of it depends on when you get your epidural and how long you continue to labour.I had my water break at am got an epidural at roughly midnight that night gave birth at am the same day. They didnt insert a catheter right away but before I pushed they pushed on my stomach and noticed my bladder was fairly full so they did an in and out catheter. Basically they set the cath emptied my bladder and removed it right away. They did this one more time before we were wheeled into the recovery ward as they werent certain how soon Id be able to get up and pee on my own. I figure if you end up having a csection you have to get one due to the whole sterile environment blah blah blah but when just in a regular labour room having a vaginal delivery I dont think you have to. Ask your midwifeOB what their policy is regarding catheters if you get an epidural. Plus side as others have mentioned if you have an epidural you likely wont feel anything when they insertremove the catheter. I literally felt nothing with mine. They let you know they are doing something so you can prepare take a deep breath and all that but I just sat there going so is it happening....?

5642273,0,t3_3sdme3,Mine dropped at exactly  weeks. I could tell because breathing was easier and my boobs didnt rest in the top of my belly anymore. Im also a FTM too.Ive been feeling what I would have to call pressure down there. The best way to describe the feeling is that its very similar to the feeling when you have a very full bladder. Like when youre on a road trip and you really have to pee but theres no rest stops nearby so you have to the shaky dance until you find one. Its like that. I dont necessarily have the urge to pee just the full feeling down there. Like Ive run out of room.Ive heard too just for some extra info that you can drop a couple times before birth especially if you drop earlier in the third trimester. Also that dropping isnt an imminent sign of labor. You could drop now but still not give birth until  weeks.Definitely let your doctor know though at the next appointment. If they havent already theyll start checking your cervix now since baby is sitting on top of it. At least thats what happened to me. My doc said she started checks at  weeks but when I came in and said I dropped she started at  weeks for me. Good luck!,BabyBumps,cwwh893,2,t5_2s7cl

I dont even know I get to meet the obgyn. First appointment they did a pap and pelvic exam breast exam and lots and lots of medical history and family history questions. They also had to do the glucose screen but only because I have multiple risk factors for gd. Otherwise they wait until later on. I am overweight and have a family history of diabetes.  We talked about when I would have ultrasounds and discussed the nt scan and genetic testing.  They gave me an edd based on lmp and said it might change at my first ultrasound.  They asked alot about my symptoms and if I needed prescriptions for insomnia heartburn nausea or headaches. And gave me an opportunity to ask questions. It took about  min or so and then I had to go to the lab for blood draw and to give a urine sample.,BabyBumps,cx3e7fy,1,t5_2s7cl

We got married this summer and pregnant a month later... Were both excited and happy but jebus its hard and I sometimes wonder if this was a really dumb idea. Husband works way too much this time of year and is too tiredstressedsore to give any fucks about my myriad of stupid first trimester pregnancy symptoms. Im really lonely so ridiculously exhausted the sex is infrequent but fantastic so got that going for me and we dont really see each other often. I try to show him I love him and bring him dinner at work or go make nice at parties I dont want to go to or send him silly text messages but its not reciprocated so most of the time I just want to give up. I think he wishes I would just pretend Im happy and feel good all the time so he wouldnt have to deal with me.

My nausea was terrible this second time around so if I wanted to eat something I ate it.  With the first I was just trying to eat and not too worried about what it was that I ate.  My OB told me the baby was a pretty good parasite so my only job was to get in nutrients the baby would take care of the rest.By the second trimester my cravings and nausea had calmed down and I focused more on trying to get a good diet into me then.  This time around my appetite was pretty much gone until about  weeks I was eating maybe one meal a day and snacking on watermelon frozen lemonade apples and candy.  It got calories and fluid into me my OB and MFM were ok with it.  I gained about lbs in my first  weeks with twins theyre still ok with that.  Long story short dont beat yourself up for craving sugar and carbs if thats what your body wants eat it.

5796833,0,t3_3ukq09,Im sorry. Its amazing how much people talk about how others look especially women once you realize it. Our culture can make it seem normal and appropriate. Ive been trying to get SO and I and immediate family to stop making such comments especially since were having a daughter. And thats just comments on regular nonpregnant people or celebrities. Ive had comments on how I look at Thanksgiving apparently my face has filled out and my feet areswollen but I had commented too because this is the first time in like  years that Ive really gained weight. I try to counteract negativity with positive remarks. I plan on being consistent and mentioning how I will not tolerate that kind of talk around my daughter or would prefer not having my daughter hear comments about how people look. I will talk to her about the culture and everything when appropriate but until then Ill prefer that kind of talk to be kept at a minimum when possible when shes around. ,BabyBumps,cxfnh1h,4,t5_2s7cl

5806353,0,t3_3upwq1,My inlaws live on the east coast and we live in the midwest MIL is throwing our baby shower out there in a couple weeks. We are using babylist for our registry which she included on invitationsI know some people think this is tacky but its super helpful in getting people to send stuff to your home rather than bring it to the shower and so far the bigger items have already been purchased and sent to our home. Im sure well get a bunch of little things like clothes toys and blankets at the actual event but so far anyone interested in getting us bigger items has had the forethought to have it sent to our home. Since we live so far away we also chose to have a coed style party so that we have a chance to see all family and friends when we visit not just the women folk. Although MIL did not like the idea of not having a traditional shower you know games and stuff so shes also hosting a small shower for her friend group bless her heart the day after the primary shower. At home some of my friends have offered to throw me a shower but I have turned them down so far because I have very few friendsfamily in the area and Ill probably get everything I need at my east coast showers. That being said it would be sad to not share that memory with this small group so I may have a meet the baby party or perhaps a small diaper shower to say hey we dont want you to spend money on us but wed love for you to celebrate with us!Sorry for the tangent just wanted to show you that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Maybe people will come maybe they wont you just never know with these things. One last thing I almost forgot if you do get things you cant physically take with you return them and rebuy them when you get home.

Looking back though i should have listened. You will adapt and if your breastfeeding eventually you will be able to sleep through most feedings if your not then pass that off to your partner.

5870273,0,t1_cxp3qb4,OP indicated that in this neighborhood it isnt uncommon for dogs to run around off leash. That makes it seem like culturally this neighborhood is more accepting of dogs being off leash in which case the onus would be on OP to indicate she isnt comfortable with that. Its also illegal to speed but people still do it because its culturally acceptablesame with leash laws. If the majority of the neighborhood allows their dogs off leash and no one complains about it then everyone is going to assume that its an acceptable thing to do unless told otherwise. Im not saying that it is ok to allow your dog on others property but if its the norm for the neighborhood and no one complains assuming its ok doesnt necessarily make you inconsiderate it just means youre accustomed to the status quo.,BabyBumps,cxp4h6o,1,t5_2s7cl

Your inlaws sound similar to mine very traditional and often judgey though I will say my MIL has surprised me with how hard shes been trying to just go with whatever we likewant for this baby! so I was super scared to try out any weird names on them. In the end it turned out to be my own normallyeasygoing mom who was much more vocal about what she liked and didnt like and she didnt like the name we ultimately picked. Not to mention that the name we picked Emerson for... Gasp... A girl!! is extremely divisive! People either really love it or they hate it to the point that they get angry and mean about it.

Id talk to your OB about it if you want confirmation though.As for SPD I had that and round ligament pain with my first starting around  weeks.  It was uncomfortable but never was debilitating.  Staying active didnt help prevent it that time around.  This time around the pain started in around  weeks and has ranged from in tears from the pain debilitating to huh just a little achy today.  Ive been in PT and it does help me but both my OB and the therapist said it doesnt do a lot for many women but it cant hurt.  For me it manages the pain it doesnt alleviate it.  The therapist also told me that for an average singleton pregnancy the muscles respond to new training and challenges up to about  weeks after that theres even less PT can do if youre having multiples the muscles give up the ghost about  weeks.  That being said I dont know if your OB will give you a referral for PT before you have any symptoms.

5969030,0,t3_3x6clk,If you want my opinion I dont have a lot of respect for the way hes behaving. Nobody is perfect but now is the time to solidify the family not destabilise it by dating others. If polyamory were you guys shared perspective I wouldnt judge but it sounds new and more about insecurity and  or trying to make you unhappy so you do what he wants. Thats not cool especially now.I feel like you could go two ways. One would be to lay down some expectations if you want to be a father to this baby I need you to help in these ways... We need to get back to monogamy and strengthening our relationship and focus on saving money.Another approach would be to focus on setting up a life where you dont have to rely on him probably by moving home and preparing for life with the baby with your parents. My opinion is that if you were able to decide and feel peace with the idea that you care about the guy but that he wont be a good life partner this approach might bring you the most long term stability and happiness. It sounds like youre a hard worker who could find a way to provide for yourself. You could also find a partner who shares that value. Trying to rely on someone who doesnt want to be reliable during the pressure cooker of early parenthood sounds miserable to me. If knowing that your parents doubt him causes this much turmoil what will happen as the demands of your family increase  will he flake out and then act like the problem is that you dont trust him to do what he says hell do? I suspect hell repeatedly let you down so the sooner you rebuild a life where his flakiness isnt your responsibility and doesnt cause problems for you the sooner you can be on stable ground.Thats just my two cents based on what little I know of the situation. You sound sensible and strong so youll get through either way but I think itll be nice to be able to focus on your own life and not try to rely on him.,BabyBumps,cy22k6m,13,t5_2s7cl

And for some reason this seems to involve imposing a lot of negative predictions so that they have a reason to talk about the things they maybe didnt get out of their system.And then she told me to tell them to stop talking because I didnt need to listen to any crap and that their experience had nothing to do with mine.Maybe thats not how you want to talk to your sister but you are well within your rights to tell her to stop.

6051310,0,t3_3ydo1v,Like others said youll want to ask your doctor about this. While continuing to exercise is good for you as long as its at or below the level of intensity you were doing prior to getting pregnant actively trying to lose weight is probably out of the question now. If you were within the normal BMI range prior to your BFP your goal now for the first trimester will be to maintain  gaining  lbs. Actively trying to lose weight is not advised though some women do in the first trimester but not purposefully  instead its because of severe vomiting and food aversions. It stinks I know. I also was trying to lose a last  lbs before I got pregnant. But once I found out I had a baby in the belly all weight loss efforts were off  my starting weight was my starting weight and thats the number that will inform my total weight gain of the recommended  lbs and I am okay with that! There will be time to get to my goal weight after the baby is here  For now shits all about nurturing and growing this babe. ,BabyBumps,cyctuda,4,t5_2s7cl

If youre looking for more flavor top with cilantro sprinkle some lime juice or stir in sour cream hot sauce or shredded cheese. Microwave for two minutes eat with cornbread Jiffy mix  add an egg some milk bakes for  mins.If you have leftover ingredients use them with tortillas and shredded cheese for quick beancorn quesadillas. Just lay out a tortilla sprinkle it with cheese spoon on a beancornsalsa mixture and brownmelt it in a skillet. When the cheese gets melty enough to hold the beanscorn on fold it in half!

6233729,0,t3_40xvh0,No it is not all needed. Especially in a small place. But keep in mind a pack n play is big and bulky. If you use it in your room you may not want to drag it around your house every day. My new LO is three weeks old. We have a lot of crap but we have the space and shes our second so we had a lot from our first. We have a PNP downstairs that we use mostly as a changing station place to put extra blanketsclothesdiapersetc. she doesnt sleep or lay down in it  but thats mostly bc Im not going upstairs to change every diaper. She sleeps awesome in her swing so we use that all the fricken time. same with my first. For us a swing is a must have. We keep the bouncy seat upstairs which is great for when I take a shower it goes in the bathroom with us or folding laundry cleaning up etc. We use a cosleeper in our room. Same concept as the pack n play just easier to reach into to get her in and out. We also have a rock n play which is my more portable sleeping device. Well be going to my parents weekend house a lot so well be taking the RnP because its smaller folds up easier than the PnP. We could definitely do without both the RnP or the PnP and the cosleeper although thats much less portable. But like I said we had a lot of stuff from my first and from other family members. ,BabyBumps,cyy7gvy,2,t5_2s7cl

The intrauterine noise intensity was reported to be about  decibels. The study had ethical approval from the medical center review board.gtThis setting was considered ideal the investigators explained because it stimulated the fetuses without causing excessive fetal movement and tachycardia which can occur with longer stimulation. After stimulation the fetus was observed on ultrasound for  seconds.gtThe results showed that intrauterine crying was not a fluke. Of the  fetuses who showed crying behavior after being stimulated three exhibited all the characteristics of crying on two different occasions.

She should give you a timeframe anyway come in when contractions are  secondsmin long and  minutes apart but since you live far away they might suggest you leave sooner than someone who lived closer. The one thing I can say from experience is that there is something about being in a car during contractions that SUCKS and it makes it really uncomfortable.

6374110,0,t3_42xr3e,Im a dyedinthewool traveler and while we didnt do any large international trips during this pregnancy we ummm conceived the night before leaving for Turkey for two weeks though! I totally would have around weeks . Oddly my peeing was still limited to about every  hours so the bathroom thing wouldnt have been a huge deal.My main suggestion would be to plan to go a bit slowermore lowkey than you normally would. Im also pretty active and tend to jampack days and I know I would have wanted to slow down just a bit.The second week we were in Turkey I was already suspecting I was pregnantI was already feeling miserable and nauseated and exhausted and just totally shitty. We ended up slowing down more than Id wanted but my SOs are both much slower travelers than I am so they enjoyed the pace. I figure it was probably a good lesson for traveling with a kid. Its different for everyone but for me the discomfort switch really tripped at week . Not sure why but literally the day I hit  weeks I woke up and everything Id felt before was intensified by quite a bit. Also the fatigue came back with a vengeance.So yeah DO IT!!! Im so insanely glad our Turkey trip timing worked when it did but if Id had to wait until late second tri I would totally have done that as well. Even now at just about  weeks Im tired and really uncomfortable and finally starting to get hormotional and Ive had to slow waaaay down... so I wouldnt want to spend money on a trip if my MW was ok with me traveling at this point but if someone wanted to pay for a trip somewhere for me.... I sure wouldnt turn it down. ,BabyBumps,cze5zwt,2,t5_2s7cl

6376948,0,t3_430dsn,Dont pump after shes eaten  that stimulates more milk to come not less!! The breast works on a supply and demand mechanism  if you have too much milk you demand less of the breast by taking out as little as possible i.e. just what your daughter is drinking and no more. This encourages the breast to produce less milk as the milk is not all being used. On the flipside if you ever experience a time when you have not enough milk you take out more milk by offering more feeds and adding more pumping sessions. This encourages the breast to produce extra to meet the increased demand.The engorgement naturally relieves itself over a period of days as your body adjusts to the amount of milk that your baby actually needs. In the meantime if your baby is ever having trouble latching express out just hand express not pump! a tiny amount just enough to soften the breast around the areola so she can latch. If you hand express rather than pump you can feel your breast softening more easily and will be able to gauge the point at which you should stop. To relieve the pain you can take warm showers and hand express out a tiny bit massage your breasts in the warm water and take ibuprofen if its really painful. Focus the massage particularly on any hard lumpy parts. The ice packs after shes eaten are good too.Watch your breasts carefully for signs of mastitis  a painful red wedgeshaped area radiating out from the areola. If you see mastitis continue feeding the baby on that breast as much as possible even though it will be painful. The baby can help to clear the infection  Note This does no harm to the baby whatsoever!! If you see mastitis get to the doctor ASAP as you will need antibiotics.

Im so sorry for the experience you had but like you Im very thankful for your medical team.  Its especially scary because you had an uneventful pregnancy and straightforward birth plan.  I seriously couldnt get over the fact that they basically froze her after birth to stop brain damage  that is absolutely incredible.Youre amazing and your baby is beautiful.  Madeline is also my name of choice and if Im having a girl you may have sealed the deal for me!  The name just looks so good on your little one.    congratulations and again thanks for sharing.,BabyBumps,czf0utr,6,t5_2s7cl

6506987,0,t3_44rkve,Ugh that is so frustrating. I worked on a postpartum unit and if it was me Id just go with you to the car to make sure everything was safe and baby was in there properly. That being said I have had people try to leave the hospital with baby in hand and when I asked about a car seat they said they hadnt got one yet. They were just going to drive home with baby on their lap. The stuff nightmares are made of. If you cant find any way around it do you have a friend that would let you borrow the carrier portion of theirs? Bring the babe down in that and then put baby in yours? Just an idea. Kind of sneaky but would work. ,BabyBumps,czsde32,11,t5_2s7cl

So far I have agreed with all of it I did an infant seat as I was more into convenience than price especially since there are second hand cheaper options but they go through the prices best brands videos etc.  I thought it was super helpful as I am a first time mom and so far all recommendations on her list from what to buy to prepare and the number of washcloths to shoe brands have been excellent.  I just installed her convertible seat we bought based on their recommendation when we felt the infant seat was too heavy to still cary and it has been great.

6557830,0,t3_45g6r6,I would recommend focusing your explanation on the newness of having a baby and the physical recover and adjustment to breastfeeding etc. Basically tell DH that youd prefer a little time to adjust and dont want for example your father in law seeing your boobs or seeing you with a huge blood stain on your PJ pants right after the birth. Youre a little more comfortable with your parents being around because theyre your parents. So dont make it about not wanting his parents to take time away from yours but about the recovery bleeding painful breasts etc. That might be more understandable and not seem as personal? And maybe have him read this to understand how gross the recovery could be and why you would prefer his parents not witness it? ,BabyBumps,czxmtmx,10,t5_2s7cl

I tore and had pins and needles sensations there for ages.Ive also developed a heart condition which Im still being tested for. This might be hereditary.Once again though what happened to me healing wise is really rare. Most people I knew were able to be sexually active  weeks after birth. I wasnt until after  months.I guess I should mention that my son was delivered via forceps and that was a factor they even put off your post natal pap for a few weeks here in Canada at leastGetting on an estrogen replacement helped.

6588554,0,t3_45tj6i,FWIW to put things in perspective babies are considered full term at  weeks so even if you are induced now youre in the time period where extra baby growth is just gravy.  Also protein in your urine of  or less is considered normal during pregnancy so that  cutoff is probably due to an abundance of caution by your doctor at this point.Also  during my first pregnancy I had a consistently high protein in my  hour collections it started around  and I think the last time they tested me I was over .  My BP varied for a while it was  then  I managed to keep it down on bed rest so despite everything I was just kept on strict watch until my son failed an NST at . weeks.  I was due to be induced at  weeks regardless so this wasnt that much of a line jump.  Im not sure if it was a good idea or not but it happened.  I gave birth vaginally after a  hour labor and everything was good.This time around theyve been monitoring me pretty closely.  My blood work has been perfect my BP has been perfect my  hour urine collections have been high and rising but theyre still happy to just watch me.  My first was  then  last was  at  weeks.  Because everything else looks good its just watching and waiting.I dont think theres a right or wrong answer here  its whats best for you and baby and your doctor probably knows best there.  Just remember to ask a lot of questions and make sure that youre ok with whats being done and why.Good luck!,BabyBumps,d00t6j3,2,t5_2s7cl

Also make sure you put her on the DO NOT ADMIT list when you checkin to the hospital so that if shes crazy enough to show up you wont know about it.

6613089,0,t1_d02xd6h,Counting worked amazingly for me for two natural births. You can tell when a contraction is about to come and like you said the first  seconds or soI did it based on breaths in and out so for the first  or so breathsits going to get more painful that is by far the worst part. Just get through that and then for the rest of the contraction the pain is on the decline so you just have to tell yourself that. Then you get a break! Rinse and repeat.The worst part for me is that sense of oh fuck... when you can feel one coming on plus the first thirty seconds of pain. And dont forget that when it gets  pain and you feel like you cant do it anymore youre likely to be in transition and be almost done anyway. It took me  minutes to go from  cm with both my sons and thats when I had the thought of I cant do this anymore but Im glad I stuck it out those  minutes rather than getting an epidural.,BabyBumps,d03cl99,3,t5_2s7cl

The other thing we have to keep in mind is in the US we have a long and intense on going debate against GMOs and anti vaccination. We here in the states get these issues get thrown in our face constantly especially now as soon to be mothersmoms. So a study that comes from a group that has a history of speaking out against GMOs and pesticides comes out and makes a claim of correlation when most of the scientific community is still researching is a little suspect. Especially when it goes against the rest of the scientific community. Not saying that because its different we cant give it a chance but the science of this study from the Argentine scientists has to be proven just like any study from America England and Japan has to be proven.

Sometimes she goes arooo like shes talking to us but thats just cute.

6624014,0,t3_46ehno,Do you know how many weeks behind the abdomen measurement was? Did they do more than one photo and measurement of the stomach? Just know that ultrasounds are not always reliable  two different people can perform the same ultrasound and get two different measurements. This is because the picture they take of the area when they freeze the image may not be at the best angle and when they use the measurement tools on the machine it may not be on the appropriate startingstopping area for the body part. For example at one of my OB appointments my doctor does a short ultrasound at every appointment the femur length was behind a week and a half. I asked her if that is something to be concerned about and she said no because theres a margin of error with ultrasounds. She took another picture of the femur measured again and he was right on track. ,BabyBumps,d04ha9m,6,t5_2s7cl

I would actually ask your GI doctor about pregnancy rather than seeing an obgyn because they wont know as much about pregnancy and crohns. Their knowledge is more about healthy pregnancies and issues that can go wrong with normal pregnancies. And also the  age limit might not be something you should consider. Whats more important is how well youre managing your disease and how healthy you are when you start trying. For example I mostly had my disease under control when I got pregnant but pregnancy basically ruined my health all over again because pregnancy takes a heavy toll on your body.

I am almost  months so I think if something happened at this stage I would be more distraught than if I lost him early on but I do not feel the love I feel for my other kids yet. I didnt feel it with them either until they were born. In fact with my second I thought how weird it was that we were changing our whole family..adding a another baby to our perfect set up?? I sort of have the same feeling with this one too every once in a while. Its hard to imagine another human being as large a part of our family as my husband and  kids are now. I did have two  week miscarriages on the way to this rd baby so I can tell you honestly I was not terribly broken up. I was sad but I think it was more from frustration and disappointment than loss. And now that I am so close to the rd baby we were trying for I dont even really recall feeling any kind of sad over those losses I just sort of think of them as a step to this pregnancy that my body needed to take to get things right.  ,BabyBumps,d0bceq5,2,t5_2s7cl

6750003,0,t3_487alq,I was vegetarian for  years and had a similar decline like it sounds your wife has had. Tired all the time as well as other health issues that cleared up immediately as soon as I added meat back into my diet.  Being a healthy vegetarian means you need to be really intentional about getting all the nutrients you need. Hopefully your wife will get to the point in her pregnancy soon where she can eat more of the healthy food she likes.  Its really rough sometimes.  Even if a food doesnt make her actively nauseous it can still completely turn her off and seem horribly unappetizing. Protein and fat are going to be two of the most important things your wife needs to get into her diet eventually both for the baby and for herself. Hopefully you can help her make the connection between her diet and her daily health someday. Good luck! ,BabyBumps,d0hi9ha,2,t5_2s7cl

We prioritize different things like youve mentioned but nothing major that we absolutely HAVE to agree on like spanking is anything that really matters if we have one parent do things a little differently.  The overarching parenting philosophies and attitudes are the same so if she gets one parent that pushes the language immersion and structured classes a wee bit more at times and another parent who is fine vegging out with her around the house more at others it doesnt end up being a huge deal.  I see some behavioral differences in what she thinks she can get away with with one of us over the other at times or what she expects of us but again  nothing major and she only really tries stuff with the parent that shes been successful with in the past so it doesnt really affect the other one much.,BabyBumps,d0od2y2,2,t5_2s7cl

6847824,0,t3_49kftu,Depression is a PITA to deal with.  Im on meds and seeing a therapist and thats ... mostly keeping it in check but not entirely.  I feel your pain.In my case this pregnancy was planned.  But it wasnt planned as quickly as it happened we were not trying not preventing and apparently  months of actively trying for  resulted in having sex twice and getting pregnant this time and we certainly werent planning on twins.We had budgeted for two kids but three has thrown all our plans to the wind.  We cant afford childcare for three and while DH can support us like you working is a big part of my identity.  Having to give that up to be a SAHM is killing me.  Being a SAHM is hard work but its not nearly as intellectually challenging as my career has been and I worry Im going to resent my kids from taking me away from that.  I have never had big body issues I didnt love my body but I didnt have any real problems with it  until now.  During my first pregnancy I gained about lbs but a lot of it was water weight.  I got no stretch marks and my body went back to how it was more or less pretty quickly after pregnancy.  This time around... oh lord.  My stomach has exploded into stretch marks in the last week  around my belly button under my bump on both sides theyre everywhere.  Its going to look terrible once the kids get here and I cant imagine how it can possibly go back to how it looked prepregnancy.  DH still loves me and finds me attractive but hes made it clear that he doesnt find pregnancy or my pregnant belly at all sexy and I worry that those nasty stretch marks are going to be a permanent reminder.  Theres nothing I can do about it so Im just trying to move forward.Look at the silver lining  when the baby gets here youll have all new things to worry about.    If experience is anything to go by all the worries you and I have now will fade away.  The late second and third trimesters are hard.  Its good prep for Babys coming its got to be better than this!  You cant go back in time you cant undo whats been done so all you can do is look forward to whats coming ... and as for accidentally getting pregnant right away well that is something you can do something about.  Get yourself on birth control and use condoms.  Two layers of protection should be pretty good prevention.,BabyBumps,d0siagr,3,t5_2s7cl

6851689,0,t3_49lys1,I gained lbs with my last pregnancy. It all disappeared really easily afterwards and I dont really know why or how I gained so much. We eat relatively healthy food and I go out walking every day. My normal weight is a healthy BMI and Ive never had a lot of trouble with my weight before. This pregnancy Im nearly  weeks and already gained lbs. Ive been doing  steps a day with my Fitbit and Im also looking after my  month old.. so its not exactly like Im just sitting around all day. My midwife wasnt concerned with my weight gain in my last pregnancy and my midwife hasnt weighed me at all this time. My plan is to just keep walking eat as many healthy foods as possible Im focusing on vegetables lean proteins and small amounts of fruit and otherwise try not to worry about it too much. I think Im likely just fighting some genetic losing battle as my Mum gained lbs with every one of her  pregnancies and shes a smaller lady than I am!,BabyBumps,d0sy3i9,3,t5_2s7cl

6858780,0,t3_49p24i,Hello!  All of our immediate family is outofstate too.  Last time around I was due on .  MIL had booked a flight to be here from    or so going off memory here.  Baby wasnt born until   I was so worried that she would be here with no baby or worse  be here and expect to be in delivery room or that wed have no time of our own!  We had  nights at home before she arrived and honestly  she was a godsend!  She helped watch baby while we sleptshowered she helped me with breastfeeding and washing pumps bottles etc. and was awesome!  So it depends a lot on who your guests are.  Then my parents came about  weeks later when they were able to get away from work.  This time around we will shoot for the same thing  visits at least a week or so after the due date to make sure baby is here and we are ready for company.  Are your parents retired with plenty of money? Because to book the first flight out will be expensive!  Much easier and cheaper if you can book  weeks in advance.

Whenever I have had the flu I feel truly ill with body aches fever and all that jazz. With my morning sickness I just felt nauseous more than anything and that caused me to vomit. I didnt feel under the weather in the same vein as the flu. Even with first trimester tiredness I knew I wasnt sick but that I was dealing with something entirely different.But everyone is different. I can imagine that women with HG feel like crap in another way that may very well mimic the feelings of true sickness.

6978912,0,t1_d17dbza,I second the local farms suggestion. One of my old professors got all her familys dairy eggs milk from a local one once a week and loved it. If you live in an area where people hunt you might also look at buying game meat. They might also have it at some butcher shops. My husbands family hunts and thats most of the meat we eat. No farming helps with conservation especially because of depletion of natural predators and its leaner and healthier than most other meat. Also going to agree with what another poster said about your husband sounding super controlling. Reading through the comments it really seems like hes got major control issues that need to be addressed before your kid is born. Also also another poster is absolutely right about your child needing exposure to different types of foods to learn to be able to process them. Id have to go back and find it but I read a study recently that suggested part of the reason why so many kids now have nut allergies peanuts in particular is they werent exposed to them at a young enough age and now their body doesnt know how to deal with it. Thats not to say thats the only reason of course but its definitely something to keep in mind when youre making this kind of decision.,BabyBumps,d17eca6,3,t5_2s7cl
6979258,0,t1_d17ep72,OK this one needs some breakdown. First youre right animals dont just spring from the ground and produce manure. However pest animals do show up and produce manure so right off the bat you have plant consumption whether you want it or not. If youre trying to engineer a productive cycle because farming is essentially biological engineering then you want to be able to determine as near as possible which animals consume which plants and what happens with the manure. If you want to keep this from happening at all youre back to the hermetically sealed greenhouse plan for agriculture which is itself not a good longterm plan. You are right that animals mostly have nitrogen in their bodies because of plants but unfortunately its not just a matter of nitrogen in the abstract which would be much easier for farmers! but it has to be bioavailable nitrogen. Getting compost to the state of being useful on an industrially managed scale is not a game for amateurs but even if it were that easy you still end up with a very diluted source of nitrogen. One of the benefits of dung and urine sources is that they are significantly concentrated which means that you can get more nitrogen cycling more quickly in your particular piece of soil. Remember that its not enough to have rotting plants six feet deep all over your land you want your crops to get a lot of what they need at the best time for growth and concentrated sources such as manure are your best friends. In fact manure outperforms legumes on a nitrogen density scale by quite impressive amounts. Also you can add manure at the opening of your season and plant the same season. Planting nitrogen fixers means you have a minimum of a seasons growth to get any nitrogen. Again  efficiency in your cycle. You can check into this  the figures on fixing rates lower at altitude by the way because of shorter growing seasons and lower partial vapor pressure of nitrogen are publicly available for a wide variety of crops as are typical nitrogen densities per various forms of manure. As for the protein density of beans in principle youre not wrong but its more complicated than that. What you really need arent proteins so much as amino acids the building blocks of proteins and beans are not a complete protein source the level to which they provide protein is dependent upon variety and here we get to the agronomic problem of growing enough of the right kind of crops to feed the people of the world enough of the right kind of amino acids to prevent outright starvation. It turns out that we dont have enough room on the planet to do that nice as it might be to dream about it. Even if you grow the beans you love it still makes more sense to feed the agricultural waste greens to ruminants who can efficiently convert that greenery to something we can eat and that way get more mileage per acre per season than we could otherwise. Remember that there are lots of plant elements that we cannot consume but animals can. This includes everything from earthworms to elephants and incorporating them in the cycle in the interests of accelerating and concentrating that cycle means that you get more production out of the whole thing. Bear in mind that the ultimate limiting factor is how much sun you have per acre and how efficiently you can convert that. Feeding your crops with nutrients gets you more and animals help you get more from your crops. Conversely if youre willing to perform pest control why not butchery? And if youre not willing to perform pest control you wont have a sustainable farm.If you would like to continue this discussion then at this point it should likely be moved to one of the agriculture or farming subreddits where it would be more appropriate. I do not want to hijack OPs main post and I feel at this point we are going well offtopic. ,BabyBumps,d17fr7i,11,t5_2s7cl

At that point you are still recovering. People coming to visit baby affects you too. It has nothing to do with who his family is but rather about how you can only do so much as a new mom.

If its crunchy we do it... So believe me.... It is RARE that we vaccinate. Where I live has one of the highest rates of invaccinated children in the US. Anytime we go to the childrens museum or park Im so worried my daughter will catch something from one of these kids. We absolutely vaccinate. Fully. On schedule. Every time. Most of the moms I know who are crunchy are on a delayed schedule or not vaxing at all. I cannot imagine putting my childs life at risk because of something Dr. Google has pulled up. The ignorance surrounding this astounds and terrifies me. Its so selfish and idiotic. Im so glad you posted this. Vaccines for everyone. ,BabyBumps,d1cohal,3,t5_2s7cl

Add all of the little things you think youll need that people dont normally buy for babies. For example baby tylenol gripe water nail clippers butt paste etc. Worst case no one buys it and you get  off something youll use.

If you dont want it between your kneesthighs or under your head I imagine you could flip it around so the curly bits face away from you.

7214371,0,t3_4e97co,Do you know what kind of birth you want?  Are you in the progivemesomethingforthepain please camp or do you want medfree? Do you want a M.D. OB or would you be ok with midwives delivering?  Do you want anything out of the ordinary like a water birth?  How do you feel about teaching hospitals?  Often theyre very highly ranked especially in big cities but you could be asked to have students observeparticipate in your birth.  Does a hospitals cesarean rate matter to you?  You can look those up online note check your providers rate since it can be a lot different than the hospitals average and some hospitals that serve highrisk population may have higher rates.  Im not bringing this up to overwhelm you just some things to think about as your pregnancy progresses.  You dont have to have all these answers now. I can tell you how I went about finding a doc and then I can offer another way.  I knew I wanted a medfree birth so I found a doula first I wanted one who practiced hypnobirth and then had her recommend a midwives group.But what Id recommend doing is picking the hospital and provider together or at least include the hospital in your decision.  There can be huge differences in terms of style of medicine at different hospitals.  I picked my hospital because its one of a few in Chicago that offers water birth.  They also tout lowintervention and are whats known as baby friendly.  They allow midwives to deliver you can move around and eat while laboring etc. etc.  Some other hospitals that are highly rated do not offer what I wanted.  Baby friendly means among other things that they support breastfeeding and having the newborn room in with the mom.  You can find all this out in a tour and by talking to your provider.  If you find a hospital you really like you can then find docs who are affiliated and can deliver there.  OR you could find a doc you absolutely love and then find out which hospital they are affiliated.  POINT  think about the hospital too.  Its a very important piece of the puzzle.At this point you can call your insurance and find an OB I believe they asked me which hospital I wanted and I picked one close and then they found an OBGYN.  You can see anyone at first and then change.  I did because like you I didnt have an OB picked out but needed to have my first appointment.  Then I switched to a midwives group.  Some people do interview docs but I relied on wordofmouth and then once I went into my providers office I KNEW they were for me.  I didnt like the original OB I selected at ALL.  TLDR  youre looking for a doctor that practices the kind of medicine youre comfortable with.  If youre very prointervention and leaveittotheexperts type of person then you probably want an OB thats an MD and could perhaps pick a hospital based on national rankings or the like.  If you want a lowno intervention birth then consider OBs that are DOs doctor of osteopathy vs. MD  still doctors but often are a little more holistic and midwives and look for baby friendly hospitals or ones that encourage a lowintervention style of birth.  Think about whats important to you and then talk to the OB about it.  Also make sure your provider and hospital are innetwork if youre in the US otherwise its .  ,BabyBumps,d1y7uza,1,t5_2s7cl

7215210,0,t3_4e9u8h,We started trying over three years ago when I was . Nothing happened. Nothing at all. After the first year we went in for testing but all that was revealed was that hubby was fine and my progesterone levels were low. Tried progesterone supplementation and while it made me miserably sick that was all that happens. After  months of that I tried a homeopathic physician out of curiosity cost cheaper than following the traditional medicine model because insurance wouldnt pay and to kick the can down the road a bit. Tried an insane dietcleanse that caused me to lose weight and be miserable but alas no pregnancy. Cue this last August hubby convinces me to start going to my ob again. Go through some painful and expensive tests which again reveal nothing. Get back on progesterone start clomid as well.  months of that are unsuccessful so doc switched me to femara instead of clomid.

7221845,0,t3_4ed4rk,Your parentsfamily are nuts. If you are in actual active pain from this you should stop doing it! Falling is bad. Doing things which might MAKE you fall is bad. It doesnt matter what the internet or your immediate family say if you are having this type of physical consequence thats a very strong sign to take it easier.It doesnt mean you have to be a complete couch potato but youre due any time between now and the next  weeks roughly. Toning it down isnt going to be bad for you whereas maintaining your current level of activity is actively causing you some negative results. Your family need to back off if they cant be supportive.,BabyBumps,d1z2hts,6,t5_2s7cl

7232851,0,t3_4eh61t,I dont have that experience going right now but I did with my first pregnancy so I can tell you how that went for me and hopefully it helps. When I was  I met a guy and fell in love and things went way too quick. We were engaged  months later and married  months after that.  months into being married I was pregnant. I thought everything would be amazing  and I would have my perfect little family I always wanted. Hahaha. My story is a bit different from yours because my ex was actually very abusive. But we ended up separating when I was about  months pregnant because he decided he didnt want a family anymore. I moved back home with my mom but still kept hoping he would come around and we would be together eventually. I went to visit all throughout my pregnancy he was there when my son was born provided no support kept asking  me to hurry this along during labor and left an hour after he was born to go on a date. After my son was here I kept visiting hoping that spending time with us would make him see thats how things are supposed to be. At one point I asked myself why I wanted it to work so bad. He wasnt supportive he showed time and time again that I wasnt his priority he didnt even make me happy at all anymore. I was just holding on to the thought of my sons parents being together and being that perfect little family. So I finally decided to go through with the divorce. Once I made that decision I was so much happier. Its hard grieving  the family picture you wont have but I knew Id find someone someday who would be the one to actually complete my family. And I did! When my son was almost  I met a guy and he was everything I always wanted. It was hard dating at first because finding single guys that understand what having kids is about is not always the easiest thing. Especially in my case I was early s at that time. Dating is different as a single mom but not impossible. You have to find someone that is understanding about kids decide ifwhen to introduce them and you always run the risk of your kid getting attached only to have the relationship not work out. Its stressful to be honest because instead of finding someone good for you you have to find someone good for both of you. But the way I saw it is if this guy cant be understanding about me being a single parent and having a responsibility to my child hes not someone I would want to be with for the long run anyway. So it helps to weed out the bad ones. But youll find someone someday that will make you happier than baby daddy ever could. And youll wonder why you ever wanted to be with him in the first place. I found my guy we just celebrated our  year wedding anniversary last week and Im  pregnant with another son! I couldnt be happier and I think back to when I was trying so hard to be with my ex and I cant imagine why. Im sorry this is so long its a story I love telling! Good luck with however things work out for you! Either way things will happen the way theyre supposed to. ,BabyBumps,d20bm01,8,t5_2s7cl

She said she wouldnt have confirmed it if we didnt have the DNA test to back it up but ..we could tell.  That said D is not reliable. We had an elective scan at w and the tech explained that though the scan is DD they only check sex in  because D doesnt allow you to check bloodflow and its very common to see a penis when its really just the cord or some other part DD isnt perfect at getting the image.

It was nice to have my husband take a dedicated class with me but even he didnt learn all that much from it. The cool thing was actually seeing some of the tools up close and personal. They passed around forceps a vacuum an epidural needle and other such items. The other thing great for me was the breathing practice but that we could have done with youtube as well. My husband just isnt the type to practice those kinds of things on his own so it was just nice to have him rubbing my shoulders and talking to me for a few minutes.We arent taking a childcare class because Ive heard it would be the same. I did find out that there was a free non certificate infant CPR class at my local babies r us and I did attend that.

As a side note and I hope Im just reading too much into your post  Please dont try to control your wifes diet. Its great that youre concerned for her and the wellbeing of your child but a lot of pregnancy is just about getting by in the moment and thats something only she can figure out how to do.

7555087,0,t3_4it9y9,I work in adoptions. Your boyfriend is wrong. Theyre not lying. Sure theyre putting their best face forward but thats to be expected. I admire all my birth moms who make this decision. Its selfless emotional and will never be forgotten.  You are giving a couple a great gift. And at the same time they are giving you the gift of providing the child the upbringing you are not able to give right now. Open adoptions are common now so you may be able to have some contact in the future. That could be something to explore. Also your child will grow up knowing you love him wanted whats best for him and made the decision to give him an opportunity at something you cant do right now. All my birth moms love their babies. None have said they were glad to be getting rid of a burden. They all said if their circumstances were different they would keep them. So take time to meet the adoptive families. Maybe meet with a few before choosing one. You can develop a good relationship with them that will last a long time. Your boyfriend probably is struggling with the adoption idea and is hiding behind indifference. A good agency will provide you with counseling resources. And they will never put pressure on you regarding your decision. ,BabyBumps,d30z71u,20,t5_2s7cl

You go on their website go to Breast Pumps fill in your info they call your insurance company let you know what the policy is mine waits until the baby is born to ship and then they email you a list of all the ones you can choose from upgrade options etc.  You reply to the email with what you choose and the shipping address and youre done.  There are several websites that do this I think BRU does too.  With the csection question I honestly would only trust this information from your insurance provider but I would not bring it up to them until you bring it up with your doctor.  If doc says its necessary they should cover it as so but thats pretty serious and a lot of money so i would talk to them.  With that being said you know your deductible and out of pocket max it may not matter in the end if you are going to hit that regardless.,BabyBumps,d331sb4,1,t5_2s7cl

7575585,0,t1_d33apy5,No I did not misread your comments. Just because YOU personally would not see an OB as a drug user does not mean that someone else would make the same decision. And your OB doesnt KNOW which one of those people you are. And no my examples do not prove your point. My sister did not seek out treatment of her own accord. She had been hiding her problem from everyone for a year and a half. Her husband came home early and found her drunk. She was too ashamed to ask for help. She was putting her children the children that she loves and adores in an unsafe situation because she has a disease and couldnt ask for help. The same goes for most of the women I met in ED rehab. Most of them were there by force of their families. They were quite literally put in a car and drivenflown to rehab. They didnt walk into their OB appointment and say hey PS Im bulimic. And yes you are correct a drug user SHOULD be honest with their doctor. But as my examples show just because they should doesnt mean they will. Just because YOU are honest doesnt mean your OB knows this. Im not a doctor and I dont work in OB. But I am a medical professional and my patients lie to me daily. About things that are harmful to them. Ive had patients lie to me about their symptoms because they know if they tell me the truth I will call their doctor and they will have to go to the emergency room. People lie to their health care team all the time. Its great that you dont but medical professionals dont just take your word for it.,BabyBumps,d33b2i2,10,t5_2s7cl

You clearly are an intelligent woman and I can totally understand why you feel the way you do but it seems from your post like you are making leaps and assumptions about how he must feel about all women all mothers or you now that youre becoming a mother when to me this is simply one issue about the dog that needs to be addressed.Its unfortunate that hes accusing you of becoming a stupid mom who is afraid of everything but dont let him derail the conversation.  Steer it back to this ONE issue with the dog and then address the way he is speaking to you about it separately.  For what its worth both of your opinions are valid.  This is a time where compromise and understanding need to come in  neither of you is more right than the other.  Its just a difference in opinionpreference and you have to work to find an amicable solution.  Whats not okay is him attributing your opinion to you being paranoid.

7623182,0,t3_4jqm81,So first it definitely does not come down to prepregnancy muscle tone. That can be improved after pregnancy. The major thing you need is time. You need time for your uterus to go back to its normal shape and you need time for your body to heal in general and that can take a few months. They recommend not working out until after  weeks post partum. These compression things are just that compression. It is just not healthy to do that to your body. Its going to cause more damage to your organs than it is make the extra skin and fat youve gained go away. The only thing that is going to do that is a good healthy diet and exercise. You can get there with those things but there are absolutely no quick fixes. Also if you plan on breastfeeding it will take a while to lose weight because you need the extra calories while youre feeding.,BabyBumps,d38prek,10,t5_2s7cl

Im planing to use fleece liners and elimination communication with my child once they start solid food to reduce the amount of dealing with real poop messes. The liners give me the benefit of something cheap to throw out if I dont want to mess with it. The final nail for me was that I spent about  on a used stash.

7676234,0,t3_4kgblg,Almost  weeks and I work in healthcare with patients all day on my feet bending  twisting reaching to floor  overall pretty exhausting. I honestly get through it by telling myself that dwelling on it just isnt an option. That its all for my daughter  the extra money. Plus it keeps my mind busy and sometimes I really get so caught up in work I forget about the aches and pains sure they are always there and at night I let myself fully feel them. I also tell myself that I dont want to be someone that gives women a bad name in the workplace for being pregnant  so I try not to ask for special treatment u less necessary heavy lifting. I find that for me at least it is about  mental attitude. It has worked so far for me  even when I would much rather melt into a pile and sleep all day.

7682138,0,t3_4kibeo,Sigh... I started a post about my own issues with my father who is a narcissistic prescription med abuser who hates my husband because he brainwashed me i.e. I dont believe his bullshit anymore because I learned how to think for myself but it got way too rambly and I decided to start over. Please seek some counseling for this situation. It will help you tremendously! It has taken me years to get past some of the stuff my dad has put me through. It sounds like your husband is a saint like mine and would stop at nothing to ensure that you are happy and mentally healthy. I have had no contact with my dad for about  years now he sent me a letter on my birthday telling me that I needed to stop sending him cards for holidays and birthdays because he wasnt worth the postage and was a terrible father so I did. This was after a long long battle to understand why he treated me the way he did. But thats the post I deleted... lol.Now Im pregnant and am slightly worried that he will pop back up into my life and try to have a connection with my child. I do have a slight advantage as I live across the country from him now so we arent easily accessible for popin visits or random sightings at the store but still the idea that he could demand that we share our new child with him scares me. I know that I have a really good support system with my husband and have learned a lot through therapy but the anxiety is there. Please dont let him ruin this beautiful time for you! I know thats harder to say than to do but you need to remember that your husband is your biggest advocate and you chose him because you knew that he offered you what your father couldnt. Your dad doesnt automatically get to earn the grandpa title.Also the sub rraisedbynarcissists is very helpful... please visit it!,BabyBumps,d3feuqq,1,t5_2s7cl

Good with crackers sandwich cucumber lettuce etc!Pimento Cheese spread for sandwichescrackers a block of sharp cheddar pulsed in a food processor until cheese looks like small beadscrumbs.

7729691,0,t3_4l6taf,I did and I ultimately went with a hospital affiliated doula. One reason is just like the one you mentioned being in the OR in the event of a CSection. However the hospital affiliated doulas have worked with your healthcare providers more than likely and have established a rapport. They also know the ins and outs of the hospital generally know where things are located etc. Would you not be able to see your contact your hospital doula before birth? If that is something that you really want and they cannot provide that is something to think about. Ultimately I think its a good idea you are going to meet some doulas. I also think it would be wise to interview some independent doulas. Whoever is the best fit for you whoever gives you the best feeling is probably what is best in the end regardless at least in my opinion. I trusted my own hospital affiliated doulas who had been present at many deliveries where I am giving birth. They reviews on doulamatch were also great and that influenced my decision as well. I chose the one who I fit with the best and feel glad I did. Hope that helps a little.,BabyBumps,d3kt7gl,2,t5_2s7cl

As for fundal height... I getgot measured at every appointment but its so meaningless. I had a period where I was X at one appointment X at the next appointment then X at the third... do you know what they did? Poked and prodded my belly a little. Kiddo moved. Fundal height was then Xcm. They did one last measurement and it was Xcm. Fundal height matters very little because it varies so widely based on position of fetus.  Beyond that its somewhat rare to have ultrasounds beyond  weeks unless something is wrong. Some practices do rd trimester ultrasounds regularly which is awesome and reassuring but rare. The fact that you have had an ultrasound in the rd trimester means that you actually have a better idea of how baby has grown vs women who only get the fundal height measurement and weight check every appointment.,BabyBumps,d3snp46,8,t5_2s7cl

Fine at birth four hours later a little off.. Sick at  hours and dead by a day old.  Catching a gbs sepsis too late doesnt help either by the time it sets in earnest its a toss up whether the baby lives or dies.  Its truly horrible.It doesnt happen nearly as much as it used to with the guidelines and screening in place before both and after birth with lab tests for baby.  Ive seen it once in the last seven years and that baby had someone who recognized something was off early on.  This baby was started on antibiotics but the big was already doing its damage.  He was put on a ventilator blood pressure dropped the baby needed central lines fluid boluses drug infusions to help his heart pump.  Then  steroids to help counteract the poisons GBS was spilling out into his bloodstream wreaking havoc with his body.  It took his days to make gains and slowly to recover.I dont mean to scare you but nature is no joke.  Although there is actual quite good evidence this garlic and natural remedies can kill bacteria and even drug resistant bacteria  it doesnt treat a systemic colonization of the body.

7880595,0,t3_4n8l6k,Getting yourself off of sugar is very difficult.  Ive had a sweet tooth my whole life so I can really understand the struggle.  It really is all about getting your palette back to normal and not depending on additional sugar for things to taste pleasant as well as replacing sugary snacks with protein snacks to help keep cravings at bay.  As Im sure you know from the documentary sugar content has been slowly increasing in regular healthy foods.  Sauces cereals flavoured yogurts granola bars flavoured oatmeal.  You can eat relatively healthy foods and still go way over your daily recommended sugar amounts.   teaspoons is the daily recommended amount  you get more than that in a can of coke!! It really puts it into perspective how much sugar the average person consumes versus what is a healthy amount for their body.My advice is to start with one thing and do it every day until it becomes habit.  Yogurt for example.  It is easy to replace flavoured yogurts with plain yogurt plain greek yogurt is yummy and has more protein even better! and sweeten it a little bit i.e. a teaspoon per cup of yogurt with some honey.  You can even flavour it with some vanilla or lemon extract.  I made this change months ago and havent looked back!  When youre used to this new yogurt add another healthy swap.  Once you have a few or these small changes integrated into your routine it gets less and less difficult to resist temptation as your body will become less and less dependent on sugar.  Small changes will make a big difference especially if these changes are sustained over long periods of time. My goal is to include some kind of protein every time I eat and to eat healthy  of the time.  That to me is more sustainable than trying to white knuckle it through a complete absence of sugar in my life!! ,BabyBumps,d41up1t,8,t5_2s7cl

7930068,0,t3_4nw5vu,Thats interesting.  Latin cultures say that the best way to tell is to give it a knock if it sounds hollow it means its ready to eat.  Funny enough I bought a perfectly smooth green watermelon last week followed the latin method or rather... someone did for me trying to explain how it worked... not sure I believe it personally but we and it was super sweet.  It didnt have any yellow spots or course webbing.  Maybe it depends on the type of watermelon?    Edit am at the supermarket right now... Some watermelons definitely have bigger yellow spots and more webbing than others! Itd be interesting to try one of each to compare     Edit  its a bad idea to add a watermelon to your basket when its the kind you carry in your hand.  FML.,BabyBumps,d47exe9,3,t5_2s7cl

So we put a metal plate over his hole rather than buy a whole new door and he chewed through that as well.Sharpeis get bored very easily and have a fairly high intelligence plus they are stubborn and can have a hard time bonding.  They get creative and amuse themselves in bad ways.  It sounds like this particular dog isnt a good fit for your family as you have other priorities than focusing  of your time on her.

8108152,0,t1_d4re0a4,If I didnt lose so much first trimester from throwing up I probably would my everyday is closer to intermittent fasting with  meals a day  constant liquids rather than  squares a day and snacks type eating but with the prior weight loss and probably moreso with being at a point now where going too long between a meal or snack  nausea and a bigger meal  heartburn fasting is not gonna happen. Probably a good thing though because aside from the health side of things Im sure Id be hearing about it from the family if I didnt take advantage of the exemption they tend to think I dont eat enough in general let alone now. And my husband Id imagine really doesnt want to deal with how Id be if pregnancy hormones and dehydration rage combine I get seriously cranky without my water.  If its any consolation as long as your SIL is getting in the amount shes supposed to during nonfasting hours it most likely wont be an issue. I talked to my doctor and an RD about it before because my default is far from the smallbutfrequent eating youll hear being suggested so I wanted to know if it would be a problem they said the main point there is avoiding nauseaindigestion and if Im not having those issues and getting in the needed calories and food groups no problem. If not change it. I know some people Ive talked to dont find it more difficult than usual to fast while pregnant but arent able to while breastfeeding another exemption. I cant think of anyone I know who was the other way around fasting while breastfeeding but not while pregnant it seems to be either make it up later for both majority or make it up later for bf but do it during pregnancy.

Just to make sure it gets an official order and can be documented. We generally dont have to much of a problem with patients taking home meds as long as we know a head of time. The reasoning is if god forbid something bad happened like a death or serious injury we need an accurate record of everything that was taken for review because it might have contributed and it just helps us build a fuller picture.

After that things were a bit rough but once he finally told his parents I was pregnant which was a major factor in wanting the abortion in the first place and they accepted it better than expected he was on board. Mind you I was  months along at this point. Anyway it turned out alright for us and now hes super excited for baby. Either way though dont let anyone influence your decision but you. You will be an awesome mother with or without him as I know I could have been. You do you and forget everyone elses opinions and guilt trips. Like you said the relationship couldnt continue if you aborted your baby so what would you be doing it for? I felt the same way and I stood my ground.

8394123,0,t3_4uin5r,Unfortunately we actually had a falling out with husbands parents a few months before falling pregnant. It seems like no amount of family meetings or counselling will help while they are in this mindset. We have had nothing from them in this entire pregnancy except for a can we tell the extended family in response to our annoucement email. They apparently never talk about the baby their first grandchild too and seem not to care at all because Im the one carrying her. So we are trying to accept that our relationship with them is over and our daughter is only going to have one set of grandparents. We give them no information because they dont seem interested.

8423499,0,t3_4uzavq,My sisters first kid was . lbs. Pushed him out vaginally. Not sure of the head circumference but it was definitely up there and was shaped like a cone when he came out. Babies heads arent rigid their soft and they mold as they find their way through the canal. So unless you have a very narrow pelvis their is no medical reason to do a cesarean without other medical complications. The hospital Im at has said it will under no circumstances suggest a cesarean if the only concern is the size of the baby. If the mother prefers a cesarean that is a different story. I really think you should get another opinion on this. Im not a doctor so dont just listen to what us nonmedical professionals say. But I urge you to be more concerned with the body you have to live in for the rest of your life than being a good patient to someone who may not have your long term health as the number one priority in this case.,BabyBumps,d5uh99g,2,t5_2s7cl

I think that was surreal and I didnt get that immediate rush of love because I was abstracted from the moment it took a few days and now I want all the  babies.  although that first night he lifted his head off my chest in the semi darkness he had a super strong neck at birth and looked at me right in eyes and I had this wonderful feeling of awe. like life really is miraculous. hes a fatty already and see decided he only like to sleep on me. although hes fine sleeping in his crib at night just a pain during the day. although hes so cute and asleep on me I dont mind too much. just dont like to overheat him.  anyway thats my rant over. seen so many cute babies born that it reminded me to post. more recent photo,BabyBumps,d5v39wg,12,t5_2s7cl

I know you said further down that he lived in BostonNYC before and couldnt get one but there are so so few jobs in Western Mass that if he sends out applications to many geographic regions his chances are better to get one. If he doesnt help around the house right now anyway it might end up being better for your family if he gets a job in another city moves there and rents a cheap apartment. He needs to make money to pay off his loans full stop. Thats his responsibility and if hes going to be huffy about it then let him know that divorce is becoming a real possibility due to his debt. In Massachusetts it seems that student loan debt incurred before the marriage stays separate property so you wouldnt be responsible for it. In this case a divorce wouldnt so much be a reflection of your marriage having truly ended or failed but just the fact that you cant go on supporting him and his debt.,BabyBumps,d5w6g2a,4,t5_2s7cl

I have ADHD  I know how hard it can be but medication is a useful way to deal with that problem. It may also help him keep a job. He can try it for a couple of months and then go back off of it if it doesnt work  its not going to fry his brain or anything.I had to give my husband that ultimatum to get his depression under control when we were in grad school. It wasnt fun but I went to the doctor with him the meds did eventually help after trying a couple of different ones and he was able to wean off of them after a year or so and a few lifestyle changes getting a job and getting out of grad school. He can deal with his depression now just using CBT. You cant keep carrying an entire household  actual children  a manchild and working full time. Its an insane situation.

They generally disregard these readings because triage readings are done when youre in a heightened state of anxiety.If they only did one reading I wouldnt read super hard into the BP thing especially since you got a beautiful reading at home. A range of BP readings in a calmed environment is more indicative of a problem than one reading when youre nervousexcited at the office. Its so easily manipulated especially in drs offices because of anxiety levels.Like others have said Id wait to be upset about your weight until after your GD screen.  doesnt seem like that big of a deal to me but again not a doctor.

She wants you to follow your instincts and your support people should guide you but dont obsess over things like am I breathing how the book said?? If you are a natural breathe through pain person youll just do it. If you arent you can get fixated and feel like its a test and you should be going inside yourself not worrying about breathing etc. As far as a plan goes I basically told them I dont want a plan I want options.

If you want to take a class etc just take one but bear in mind that your labour and delivery will be your own and it might not look like any they discuss with you. Midwives are very different to Drs.

8581812,0,t1_d6d7f3c,I found this piece to be way more nuanced and much better written than the Just Get the Epidural argument in the NYT recently.  Theyre different articles with different points obviously but I think they come from a similar place.After reading your replies I can see how this resonated with you.  I also had complicated feelings about my birth for a while.  Like you it was my ideal birth to a t unmedicated in a tub and yet it was traumatizing in its own way.  I truthfully wasnt prepared to feel that kind of pain.  It was mindalteringly painful.  I most definitely didnt come out feeling empowered.  I felt raw.  Hurt.  I most definitely felt like transition was something that happened to me and that was frightening. Do I feel empowered about it now?  I dont even know.  I suppose I feel like its an accomplishment in so much as I finished something I set out to do.  I am going to try for another unmedicated for this one and I have many thoughts and feelings about it.  But Im not going to be waving any flags.  Some women do and Im fine with that.  I just think this is all more complicated than is easy to convey in articles.  Im glad you found one that resonated with you.  I think some of the commenters have misunderstood the article.  Its not saying that one shouldnt feel empowered but that something like morality as you point out good vs. bad is a social overlay onto a biological process which is entirely neutral.  One can feel empowered but the idea that birth is somehow inherently empowering aka more natural is just a social construction.  We can make what we will of our births.,BabyBumps,d6eb8ri,3,t5_2s7cl

8650567,0,t1_d6mx0on,You absolutely can force him to wear one. Wear a condom or no sex. There. Done. Especially because you posted that it was a new and shortlived relationship it is that much more important to ensure you are protected by any means necessary. No condoms are not perfect at assuring this but they will protect your from most STDs and most unwanted pregnancies. It would be difficult and certainly limit your birth control options to be sick on any kind of ordinary birth control. I myself an unable to tolerate most versions of the pill because of the high estrogen levels so I do actually understand that it makes things a little more difficult on that standpoint. You are still responsible for making the decision for taking the risk of sleeping with someone essentially unprotected. I hope that you do instill strength and independence in your children. Many children do not have the opportunity to do the same but it is also important to teach children the values of community trust and that sometimes it is necessary to keep your heart open to feel. Things can be hard sometimes. Life is messy. Its sad happy angry... life is just a roller coaster of emotions but its necessary for all of us to feel these emotions with all of our hearts. There are also benefits to leaning on a best friend counting on our moms or dads to help us in times of need giving a stranger a helping hand when they really need it. Being part of this world we all live in enjoying the benefits that it can give us also means being PART of this world. So yes. Instill all the positivity you can while teaching them how to take care of themselves in this world but make sure that you leave room for them to learn that while sometimes there is risk involved in getting or asking help from others there are often benefits to it as well. Friendship love loyalty.,BabyBumps,d6mxmnp,3,t5_2s7cl
8651404,0,t3_4ydzyb,I have a friend with UC and shes mentioned before that whenever they have kids she will be treated as high risk because of the nutrient absorption thing.

8672901,1,t3_4yq42u,I smoked all through the first and second trimester and my baby is healthy and actually in the th percentile as far as weight goes. If you need to smoke to eat and regulate got anxiety then go for it but you are going to want to wean yourself off of it in the third trimester because hospitals will test you and the baby for certain drugs at birth. There is no real conclusive research one way or the other as far as marijuana use during pregnancy is concerned Ive looked and read most of the studies that have been conducted and most are looking at other drugs as well as marijuana and the negative effects are from those substances. Use your own desecration when it comes to smoking. I never got stoned stoned I would just smoke enough to get rid of the urge to vomit and get myself to eat.

However there is some risk of placental failure the later you deliver with GD so we ended up scheduling an induction at w  d at my w appt. Of course I went into labor on my own that day.

8788281,0,t3_50i0tw,I know every situation is different but...I had the exact same thing happen. During my first pregnancy my SO traveled an hour away for work training for a while sometimes overnight. I dont know why maybe just my own insecurity but I snooped into his emails and found some Craigslist conversations. In reading them it was clear that he didnt actually follow through but its still a very crushing thing to find hardest part was that some of the messages were sent at the same time that he was texting me so its not like I wasnt in his mind. I confronted him and like you he turned it back on me for snooping. I get that its not right to snoop but at the same time if there werent things he was hiding my offence wouldnt mean anything.It was a very hard time for us he actually packed a bag and left which made it even harder. I felt broken even more so for the baby  I told him that he could leave me but he wont get to leave his baby. I dont quite remember how we got past it but eventually it was OK.  years later were still together with a better understanding of each other and two kids.He does still do questionable things sometimesno more craigslisting as far as I know but he did get curious about Ashley Madison after that whole scandal among other things that I occasionally find out aboutwhich again is always my fault for snooping but now I stick to my guns for the life weve created but I believe that its never an earnest attempt to hurt or get away from me. What I dont get is that I really have a more open view of relationships and wouldnt normally hold it against him  but that is based on us both being open and honest which is hard for him sometimes.I know its a crappy situation that nobody wants to be in but I hope you can get through this in the best way for you and the baby.,BabyBumps,d747jjh,3,t5_2s7cl

I MIGHT share something with my mom if Im feeling keen to but other than that nobody needs to know about all the things that happen in my pregnancy.Now I dont live in the South and in Seattle we dont really have the church ladies but we have plenty of people with no social skills to think of who ask too many questions. I typically just say Im doing great and baby is doing greatits an exciting time for us and it sort of routes people away from asking anything further about my condition and they go on to talk about how great having a child is and I can drown out the stories about sleepless nights and whatever else they choose to throw at me.My husband is a rather open person and he has flat out told me Im being rude by not including people in my pregnancy.

8810260,0,t3_50tsug,So this answer may not be what youre looking for but.... You will be the kind of mom your child needs you to be. Heres the deal. I am pregnant with my fourth child. The other three are much older. My oldest is  and a senior in high school. Next is my  year old who is a freshman. And the third is  and in th grade. Next year I will have three teenagers at the same time though one will be off to college. Parenting them is completely different now than it was when they were babies toddlers and even elementary school. Their struggles are so much more adult. Their problems are so much more impactful. And each one of them is unique in their reactions and coping strategies. Its hard. Its wonderful. Its terrifying. And its beautiful. They are becoming men right before my eyes and I am having to coach then through life lessons I could never teach them. Gone are the days when I taught them colors shapes and letters. Gone are the days when learning to divide fractions was the most frustrating part of the week. Now we talk about gender equality and the impact of the current political climate. They are preparing for the world and I am not ready. But I have to be ready. I didnt think I could do it when they were tiny babies on my womb. But mothers are stronger than that. We love our children fiercely and its an evolutionary love that moves with them. We hold on as long as we can and we learn when it is time to let go a little bit at a time. You wont know how you will react to a situation your teenager is going through until it happens. But you will love them through it... Even when they do things that make the thoroughly unlikeable as humans.  They will make mistakes and you will be there to catch them. They will do amazing things and you will be there to bawl your eyes out in pride. You can do it mama. You really can. ,BabyBumps,d76vgev,31,t5_2s7cl

Always acknowledge her feelings as valid. Ask her why shes upset about something thats happened. Ask what she thinks would help her feel better. Theres going to be exceptions of course especially when theyre kids and ridiculous things will upset them but as she grows listen and dont judge what gets to her. Just be open to people being different regardless of being girly vs tomboyish. Instead of letting frustration or confusion show give her your perspective honestly and explain why the same thing wouldnt upset you in case that does help her.

8855626,0,t1_d7c9of3,I was certainly very very sad for my cousins and aunt regardless of my dislike of my uncle. I hurt just knowing that they were hurting. Any tears I had over it were for them. I was not expecting a lot of support from them. But even a single moment of recognition of my son even in the weeks and months following would have been nice. They were out of state and wouldnt have been able to be present in person even if he hadnt died. But maybe even a simple text asking if I and my son were ok would have been plenty enough for me. There was concern beforehand about abruption and cord issues because of his positioning and I lost a concerning amount of blood. I know they couldnt possibly have acted happy for me but they could have at least been minimally concerned for our health and lives.    And yes it was mostly the lack of reaction and support from my own mother and grandmother that really really stung. My mother is an astounding piece of work with whom I no longer have contact. She is bipolar with bpdnpd traits very difficult demanding disagreeable manipulative and likes to use guilt as a control tool. There was no part of my wedding plans last summer she liked or agreed with. She threatened to keep my siblings from attending if I didnt change the date hated my colors hated my dresses hated my seating chart etc. My grandparents withheld financial help on purpose as punishment for having my son first.    She announced she was divorcing my dad step and engaged to sucker  and posting pics of her engagement ring all over facebook only weeks before my wedding. Later she went to court to rake him over the coals to get alimony and take his pension. I woke up one day last fall and realized she would never ever change and continuing the relationship would make it impossible for me to ever fully heal from her damage.  So yeah my younger cousin who got married first and whose father is now a holy family paragon is having a shower thrown for her that my grandmother will go out of her way to fly down to attend. When she didnt lift a finger to even think to ask if anyone was throwing me one. And I just....cant. Because I care about my cousins I cant.

Taking it at night before I go to bed gets me through the morning period when I really need to break my fast before my body rebels against me and that keeps me eating little bits throughout the day which keeps the nausea at bay.

Anyway quick story time I was at my sons birthday party at a play space wed rented out and the first guest was leaving and requested a balloon to take with him. I tied it to a pinwheel and he immediately started banging it around and the balloon untied. The ceilings in the play space are high so I tried to lunge for it afraid we werent going to have enough balloons for all the kids. I was wearing socks without grips on the linoleum and I slipped and landed hard on my butt. There was a collective gasp from guests and I got up laughing and telling everyone I was fine. And as I stood up I realized that I peed myself so I attempted to graciously make my way to the bathroom. My underwear were soaked through to the back of my dress. And stuff was still coming out even though I didnt feel like I was still peeing. I did a sniff test ew I know and then shoved some paper towels into my underwear. I really did think that Id ruptured so I told my husband and drove myself to LampD  minutes before the party ended.

Meds are good but some gentle manual therapy and some movement exercise can help you a lot and then when you are feeling better get an good exercise program that you can do all the way up to birth. A lot of the time the bulging disc is not the main problem but most of the times the back seizes up to protect you from hurting yourself again  especially if you have a history of back pain and the brain perceives it as danger.

8942281,0,t3_52ozgb,So I think youre outside of the norm here thats perfectly OK and that a registry like that might not exist at a store because items get knocked off the list by people purchasing them. If your family is technologically savvy I would suggest making a list in google sheets of what you need. So it would have all the items in one column the number desired in another column and then the number purchased in a rd column. Give the link out to your friends and set it so that anyone with the link can edit it. Ask your friends and family to update the list by changing the number purchased column. If you want to be really fancy you could do conditional formatting so that when an item is fully purchased it will turn grey or cross out or something like that. Personally though I dont think ANYONE will find it weird for you to pick out the specific items. You could always add a note at the top of your registry that says something like while Ive picked out these items I would be more than happy for you to substitute any item on the list for a similar product that you like more.,BabyBumps,d7mqb5f,1,t5_2s7cl

Ask to switch or see if hell be willing to do ice duty at least in exchange for you wiping down the ketchup bottles. Maybe offer to roll  of his silverware for the uneven trade. Ask your managers to assign your section close to the kitchen. If possible for you think about switching to day shifts or cutting availability to every other day or something similar to avoid straining yourself too much. You could also ask about switching to host or togo shifts once in a while if serving is starting to wear you down. Have a buddy someone near your section that you dont mind asking to keep an eye on your tables if you are in need of frequentlong bathroom trips. If this buddy is the same person all the time it wouldnt hurt to bring them a thank you Starbucks or something once in a while. Keep easily concealed snacks on you. I kept a bag of sunflower seeds in my apron. Helps with nausea protein for energy and they dont leave a smell or crumbs. You dont need to take five to eat them just pop a few in and go about your business. Find a place to sit. Even slow shifts can wear on you find somewhere you can sit down that management is okay with. I spend a lot of time rolling silverware sitting on a sideways glass rack. Theyd be fine with me just sitting but I dont want to just laze around unless theres truly nothing to do. Avoid the walkin at least until nausea ends. Every smell just gets trapped and jumbled in there its a recipe for disaster. Alternatively once the nausea is gone  find every excuse to go in the walkin that place is heaven. Stay hydrated. Its easy to go through a shift without thinking about what your body needs. If youre allowed to keep a drink in the kitchen take a sip every time you walk past it. If not get a cone cup sip every time you pass the bev station.Have an open up front conversation with management. Discuss your plans and restrictions. Ask for clear expectations from them and counter anything that makes you uncomfortable. A job is important but not more important than the health of you and your baby!  ,BabyBumps,d7tnypm,3,t5_2s7cl

So I am an academic librarian and scientific publishing is a messy world and I can tell you that many of the research studies that are the backbone of our vaccine policies are not going to be available for free online. You would have to be affiliated with a university or hospital with a subscription to the journal or database to find the bulk of scientific research journals. Also and this is in no way trying to put you down...these articles are heavily heavily scientific. I have students who try to do vaccines as a paper topic and they simply cannot get through the articles. I couldnt either. That being said there are article that synthesize these studies there are literature review articles and there are qualitative studies that are more easily digestible. The reason we have the CDC and the AAP is that they are experts and they dig through the studies and make recommendations.OK aside from that spiel there are some articles that may be available by looking at the CDC and AAP websites. Doing a quick google search I found this from the CDC website  Articles are not linked but you can search them and find abstracts.

Its seriously one of the oldest hospitals in the US. They also had only  labor and delivery rooms and the postpartum rooms were practically closets they were so small. But you know what?

9033986,0,t1_d7xf1n9,Its too early for me to know yet but Im hoping for a boy! I dont think I could relate very well to a daughter or other moms of daughters because Ive never really related to women well in general. Always a tomboy best friends were always boys never had more than  really close girl friends including my sister who is my best friend and a mom of a boy. I do things girls dont usually like. Working in a slaughterhouse hunting and fishing bull and bronc riding extreme sports drinking beer and jam sessions with the guys etc. I hate shopping and makeup and fashion and being popular and other girly things and I feel like if I had a daughter she may resent the lifestyle I would want to raise her in. It would take a lot of effort to give her a normal girl lifestyle... Which I would do if she wanted it..So.... Fingers crossed for a boy!

I ask if they will allow DH to come back once he arrives and am assured that they will as long as he checks in with my name. Turns out they had me on the techs schedule at  and I didnt want to hold them up so I shot him a text and we got started. I got a little upset when by  he still hadnt shown. Im the late one of the family so I assumed he got held up at work. Scan finished at  I check my phone and find a sea of text messages. Apparently he had come in two minutes after me they told him to have a seat and they would bring him to me and they never did. He sat in a corner of the waiting room so the girl who helped him didnt see him from her desk so she assumed someone else had told him where to go. He missed the anatomy scan and spent the whole time getting worked up and angry in the waiting room. It was not the happy memory I planned it to be!

9082798,0,t3_54marw,We actually had baby in the rock n play in the living room for the first  months probably. Breastfeeding wasnt an option for us so being closer to the kitchen to make bottles every  hours was important. One struggle I had though was our son was a VERY noisy sleeper. He groaned and grunted due to normal gas for hours every night. Getting up every  hours to feed him was rough because I could never go back to sleep in between. I woke at every single movement or noise. We also never used a changing table. Baby is  months and still never have at home. Weve always just had a diaper caddy with everything we needed and kept a blanket on the floor where we changed him. Youll find a set up that works for you and its okay to have baby on dads side or rearrange something so you can sleep better as well. I understand easy access for breastfeeding so keeping the halo next to your bed with a diaper caddy and blanket to change baby is probably a great simple setup. ,BabyBumps,d83lrz1,1,t5_2s7cl

We didnt do cry it out we tried a few times but my kid works himself up more and more instead of calming down after a while. We did BLW because it was easiest for us but we did use those puree pouches sometimes love them!.We followed our kids lead in most things. We will likely do the same this time around. I think as things come up as parents we should definitely do a bit of research. There is lots of information out there that can help us protect our kids and help them be healthy and happy and it can also help us be better parents. I like doing the research.

9169671,0,t3_55w6fo,SO and I were in a pretty similar situation though were unmarried. We will both be  when the baby comes and at the moment were both working for our families businesses so telling parents meant telling our bosses too. Ill be honest it sucked. My mom was aware of my pregnancy from  weeks but she was very adamant that I consider my options. Which I did. When we chose to let nature do its thing I was on birth control so there was an element of kismet involved she was disappointed to the point of rejecting a sonogram I wanted to give her and saying she wasnt sure she wanted any involvement with her first grandchild. I was shocked..it felt like a total betrayal. Luckily I have friends and extended family that nearly overwhelmed me with support and mom has slowly been come around. As for my dad.. I try not to think about it It helped a LOT that SOs family was far more supportive... they made it clear from the beginning that they were here to help any way they could and even sent us a couple things from our registry with a card telling us how excited they are. His grandmother even offered to take me shopping for maternity clothes and cant stop herself from buying all of the cute consignment clothes she finds. Its adorable. My advice is to seek support where you can.. friends other family members etc. and try not to take any negative reactions too personally.

You may be experiencing an unplanned pregnancy but that doesnt change the fact that you are the parents and you cant expect anyone else to provide for your child but you.  Unplanned or not you still chose to bring this child into the world and raise it yourselves.  Your parents are giving you a free place to live despite already having one childSOgrandchild living there and a brand new baby on the way.  Housing you for free sounds like a pretty huge contribution on their part IMO.I get that youre feeling overlooked but remember that fairness isnt about equality.  Your teen brother and his baby mama were more in need of support than you are so they got more assistance.  It does not mean your parents dont love you as much.  My parents have a townhouse that my sister and her two kids live in for free.  I would kill to be able to live in a place as nice as hers but she is a single mom and needs the support whereas my husband and I are able to live comfortably and support ourselves in our small two bedroom apartment.

They tried to replace it a few times but eventually determined it was the pressure of babys head on the catheter causing the issue? I still am puzzling over it!

9409387,0,t3_59hfzf,The risks have to be weighed. Yes you should talk to a doctor but until then stay on your medication. For instance I am bipolar type  with major depressive disorder and I am on mg Wellbutrin as well as mg Latuda. These have been approved by my psychiatrist and my obgyn. Initially I was on Lamictal which they did not like due to the increased risk of cleft palette so it was replaced with Latuda when it was discovered that I wasnt handling being off the Lamictal very well. I cannot be off medicine. There are risks taking it but they are very small when you consider the risk of not taking it. However some women can come off of it just fine and everything is alright. Dont try this without a doctors approval or monitoring in case you have physical or psychological reactions. ,BabyBumps,d98pf0o,2,t5_2s7cl

9416103,0,t1_d99i2or,Ive actually had first hand experience dealing with pregnancy discrimination here in Chinatwice!  Although it is illegal to fire a woman because of her pregnancy many people do it or try to push you out by demoting you making you travel farther etc.  The reason behind it is because in China all pregnant women regardless of nationality must received at least  weeks fully paid maternity if they are working for a Chinese company.  I did the math on this and this meant that in order to replace me the small business I worked for owned and operated by my good friend and maid of honor at my wedding would have to shell out around  in order to pay for my maternity and the worker who would replace me on maternity leave.  BUT I got EVERYTHING in writing and spoke with a lawyer.  In the end I settled with them out of court.  In the long run it ended up costing the company a lot more when they lost me.  The nd time around was when another company actively recruited me but declined their offer actually ghosted me because I was  months pregnant at the time.  I threatened to sue report them etc if they did not apologize which they did.  In that incident again I got EVERYTHING in writing but I had no legal recourse because there are no hiring discrimination laws in China. Best advice to give is to be informed of your worker rights and know how to go about enforcing them.  ,BabyBumps,d99k1p4,1,t5_2s7cl

After my losses I know it was very hard for me to look on the bright side and welcome new life into my family and into my heart when the next baby in my family was born but I decided that I was going to make the best of it and when I held that little boy I fell in love with him and it genuinely changed my mindset my nieces and nephews became the people who healed my heart the most and I loved and cherished them even more.On top of this I think itd be easy to feel a little bit of jealousy. EVERYTHING going on right now in that family is focused on OP naturally and that may be adding to sisters feeling of being left behind. OP certainly doesnt have to put up with this behavior but should try to see it from sisters POV and cut her a little slack.Kudos to you uHobbelu for being such a kind sister and considering your sisters feelings.

9499895,0,t3_5avr3v,Clear blue doesnt say weeks pregnant it says  weeks from ovulation. If you read the instructions its explained there. That said the first two weeks of pregnancy are free. So you were really only pregnant  weeks but from here on out everyone will call it weeks. Glow and LMP are correct. As for what next? Waiting! A whole bunch of anxious waiting. Assuming youre not smoking and drinking and guzzling mercury or meth or something you can basically carry on with your normal life. Do try to eat smaller more frequent meals and avoid having an empty stomach. Dont worry about feeling cramps or bloating or other impending period symptoms. Its normal. Even a bit of spotting after sex can be normal too. Start to plan big picture things. Are you doing daycare and working? Its not unreasonable to pick daycares now especially where I live there are month wait lists. Just take a few days for you and your spouse to be happy and excited and then get to work.

9548907,0,t1_d9ptzs4,I agree that surgery is not the best comparison.  The passing a stone analogy is more apt.  I have experienced that and you can bet that I was begging for pain medication which they administered morphine.  I think the key distinction is that if a person has stonesmigraines and has gone to the hospital or medical provider with a particularly painful attack that lasts hours and requires ongoing treatment and monitoring possibly even surgery episiotomies are performed in quite a few births and cutting is involved with that nobody is going to say to them afterwards Did you do it naturally?  Did you turn down any pain medication?  Did you feel the moment that the stone pushed through the duct?  I felt it with my gallstone and it was so beautiful!  Its such a shame when people pass a stone and they cant feel every moment.  These are the types of things I have heard about labor and I havent even delivered yet!  With my gallstone attacks nobody ever questioned any of these things.  I have never met anyone who passed a stone painful enough to need to go to the hospital who intentionally turned down pain medications for any reason besides a medical one.  If someone cant take drugs for medical reasons like addiction or allergies thats a totally different scenario and I dont think thats what this is referring to.  I think its more like people who somehow think its morally superior more natural more beautiful etc. to decline pain management during labor and delivery.  ,BabyBumps,d9q3m43,3,t5_2s7cl
9551115,0,t1_d9qaw4j,It was a perfect storm of problems. My mom had a poorly healed spine injury that led to the epidural not getting place right after  attempts a poor reaction to the medicine the person placing the epidural was inexperienced and actually punctured the spinal sac multiple times and the doctors at the hospital did not react at an appropriate speed when things started to go downhill. All in all it led to my mom having to get put on a machine that breathed for her and other things to save her life because everything was trying to stop functioning. It nearly killed me by nearly killing mom. In the end I was delivered by csection due to being breech and the botched epidural. I was born limp and blue and had to be brought back basically. Honestly if you have an experienced person administering the epidural and no spine injuries it is unlikely to cause problems but I cant bring myself to get one.

Also they dont know why the correlation between closelyspaced pregnancies and autism exists but they suspect folate levels have something to do with it. This is why prenatal vitamins are so important. Chastisting pregnant women for not being cautious and trying to guilt them about overpopulation is inappropriate in my opinion and it is at odds with the mission of the subreddit.

9642814,0,t3_5d2vdr,These ladies have solid advise talk to your care provider! Additionally it can also be the baby blocking you from releasing as well especially if youre early and started with a tilted uterus. If its baby you can try doing an inversion.  Have your knees on pillowscushionscouchlow stair and slowly lower the front half of your body so your but is straight in the air and your heart is lower than your bum. Hold it for  breaths. Stop immediately if you feel unstable or any discomfort other than light stretching.   The goal is to let gravity gently encourage the pressure off your bladder.  Also if it is due to pressure from baby your care provider may be able to manually adjust your babyuterus so you can pee easier. Also this may sound crazy but if your constipated try some stool softeners.  A large stool can also make it hard to pee. For real it happens..,BabyBumps,da1oc5w,1,t5_2s7cl

I have always had issues with my weight once was lbs and more recently  and I put on weight very easily. I have had a wonderful pregnancy not even a wave of nausea passed my glucose test no high bp etc. and he keeps telling me if I keep gaining weight I will have to have a csection and go on lovenox shots due to high risk of clots. Ive never even had an IV before in my life or been in the hospital  I have gained almost lbs and while that is a lot I understand my husband and I both work in healthcare I have tapered out and barely gained any in my rd trimester.

So I have a background like yours maybe not full on PTSD but people fighting or yelling makes me panic cry freak out extreme anxiety you get it. You know where Ive been. My husband on the other hand is a Yeller. Not at me not once ever at me but at everything else. Sports season is horrific! So here is the good news. Even at our worst most sleep deprived month after baby he did not pick up yelling once. If anything he actually got WAY quieter. Now Im not saying we didnt fight or anything. We fought constantly. But we never ever yelled. Even his extra curricular sports yelling was almost nonexistent for about the first  months. He never once raised his voice at daughter. And we did not get an easy baby. She basically cried straight through the first two weeks she didnt sleep through the night until she was  years old she didnt nap ever she woke up every  minutes at night. We were sleep deprived I had fairly severe postpartum depression it was an all around bad situation. But he was quiet as a church mouse. So dont worry too much!

Occasionally had feelings of real nausea but nothing like before I left.When I got back the jet lag going back to US from Europe really did me in and my nausea came back with a vengeance worse than EVER before. I got sick multiple times a day and itd just strike me at random during that week I was readjusting to this time zone. After about a week it got better and for the past  weeks I havent thrown up at all but still have occasional nausea bouts. I actually forgot to take diclegis the other day and was generally fine the next day  had more nausea than normal but no actual vomming occurred.What I like about diclegis is that it seems to curb the need to eat  to keep the nausea away that I had before I was on it.

Another friend though couldnt care less. Shes grossed out by any baby talk. Im hoping shell get over it once the baby is here but also understand kids arent for everyone and it isnt always fun to be around an infant. Most of my friends in a previous state had kids at  and then when I transplanted to a new state I fell into a group that had different aspirations. Now Im on the opposite end and know how both sides feel. Ultimately Ive seen that it can be difficult to balance friends and a baby because babies require so much of your focus but it gets easier as they transition into toddlers.

9668068,0,t3_5dig8x,This is the perfect reason to post here.  It took us  years  months I believe to get pregnant and was only achieved after substantial weight loss and a medicated cycle.  Before I was pregnant I hated not really but you know... every single pregnancy I encountered.  I unfollowed people on Facebook and found it physically difficult to be around young kids.  I remember sitting at my husbands Grandmothers couch while his cousins daughter was playing and it make me physically ill. This little girl is adorable and lovely and my husband loves to play with her and I felt like I was going to die just watching them.  So I totally get the infertility perspective.Thankfully our first medicated cycle was successful and our pregnancy has been flawless and now were on the other side officially one of The Pregnants.  I was lucky enough to share the infertility experience with a friend.  Like we knew each others cycles I knew what meds she was trying she knew when I took Clomid and helped analyze my OPKs... except she was well into a year of medicated cycles and I did just one and mine worked and hers hasnt and Im sure its devastating.  I now feel immense guilt about my pregnancy.  Shes supportive and great but it still feels unfair.  We definitely still talk about it but I dont share the mundane insanity of all the weird things that happen while youre pregnant.   Changes in body smell being unable to lay on your stomach the way my feet hurt the cravings.. its too much to share with someone who isnt going through it.So I kind of get it but also cannot imagine how incredibly difficult this must feel when that person is your partner.  Once your babe is out I hope that the fear and.. not resentment or animosity but something like that.. fades and you can just both enjoy her.  Good luck and were always here when you need to vent.  ,BabyBumps,da4sikv,28,t5_2s7cl

With my second my belly would just tense up and tighten. Waited until they were about six or so minutes apart headed to lampd and both times had my epidural within an hour. The anesthesiologist the second time had the nurse check because he didnt think I was actually far enough along in labor because of my lack of pain. But also the second time I was on bed rest and medication to stop preterm labor until weeks. So I knew what to watch for. Everyone is different.

Since our apartment at the time was carpeted we didnt really use the rocking feature that much but it was nice as a portable little bassinet to move around. It also helped us transition to a crib when we were ready as we just started putting the rock n play in his room with the door open we almost had a line of sight from the bed around  months so he got used to sleeping in there.I dont think they are technically supposed to be for sleeping but we were happy with it and it seemed really safe mesh sides nothing to get on their face etc. ,BabyBumps,dan8o80,1,t5_2s7cl

The contractions are no joke. Im supposed to call them back if they get worse pain wise which they have because Im an idiot and walked around for a few hours after getting out of the hospital but I feel like my body is just doing this for the sake of doing it so I assume its prodromal labor and running back there every  minutes wont change that. |,BabyBumps,dasov1r,1,t5_2s7cl

This dressers condition and the stores reaction to this situation are not acceptable. We would like a new unit ordered and delivered at BBBs expense or we will immediately seek a refund and take our money elsewhere.

9891989,0,t3_5h2qzl,I believe they would want to look at your BMI prior to becoming pregnant just as a baseline to figure out how much would be a healthy amount to gain and to your point that BMI is hardly reliable for telling the health of a person Excessive weight gain during pregnancy regardless of beginning BMI is what is dangerous. A person could have started as underweight and gained  pounds to put them in the normal range but that certainly doesnt mean that just because they are now in the normal range that the  pound weight gain was healthy. ,BabyBumps,dawy6uk,5,t5_2s7cl
9893067,0,t3_5h0eqe,Personally I would wait it out. Going overdue isnt really that bad if you can manage to relax and not stress about the idea of it. Ive btdt twice now. And I fully expect to go overdue again. Its the idea of being late that can get to you. But physically if you and baby arent having issues its perfectly safe. The baby wont gain a significant amount of weight in just  or  weeks. And the weight that is gained in the last few weeks is mostly squishy fat which wont really have much effect on birth. But you might be surprised how big of a baby you can push out! My first was lb oz and I was a little  lb  year old. It took  hours but I did it! My nd was lb oz face up... And she was a piece of cake  it only took  minutes to push her out. I went to lampd for an NST at  days late with her and they tried to keep me to induce me.. But I was like nope! and went home. Ended up going into labor that very evening and it was so much more relaxing and easy to labor at home for the first  hours. You could always ask for a membrane sweep at your next appointment to jump start labor. I personally would at least try that before jumping straight to induction.,BabyBumps,dax38x9,1,t5_2s7cl

9900645,0,t3_5h6g83,Ive put on almost . I was smack dab in the middle of average when I got pregnant. My midwife is not at all concerned and people I talk to about it have a hard time believing me when I say Ive gained that much  I guess I carry it well?Im certain for me the reason I gained so much has less to do with a huge caloric increase and more to do with being hugely limited in how active I can be. Im not a gym person or anything I just have a very physically demanding job and I work hard at it. Pregnancy severely limited my ability to do that from pretty early on and I started gaining weight more rapidly than I should have. But it was still pretty gradual a pound or two a week never a bunch at once which I think is partly why my midwife has never been worried.Basically if you took away all the actual baby related weight Id be maybe  lbs overweight right now which I guess is actually not that much in the grand scheme of things. Its certainly a reasonable amount to attempt to lose with simple diet and exercise  months postpartum. And thats all Im shooting for and if I dont make it Im not going to be that upset. Its overweight but not an unhealthy level of overweight. Its fine.,BabyBumps,day2s84,1,t5_2s7cl

9931997,0,t1_db12b6y,Ive always put mine in the dryer with no issue.  Our old house was a rental so we werent allowed to install anything outside to dry clothes. I plan to do so in this house but I dont see how they would take longer than normal clothing to dry.  Theyre just a couple layers of cotton.  But I can imagine theyd take a little longer to dry than flats that are essentially one layer of cotton.  If you bought the gerber Birdseye prefolds I really really wouldnt recommend using them as diapers.  I go a little cheaper with nighttime solutions.   I use fleece covers.  You can get them for around  each on Etsy.  I think I just paid  with shipping for XL ones for my toddler.  Okay so here me out on this.  I hear people talk about using cloth during the day but not at night or having diapers leak at night.  News flash disposables leak at night too and smell horrible.  With our first we used disposables at night and even tried every overnight extra absorbent brand.  They didnt work.  I tried just using cloth at night and the absolute best solution I came up with even with a heavy wetter and a toddler who still takes a bottle aka sippy with water at bedtime is this fitted diaper in a pul cover with a fleece cover over it.  Ive also done a prefold and hemp doubler in a pul cover with a fleece cover over it.  When I first started using cloth I bought pockets thinking they were easiest and also put them in the dryer thinking thats what I was suppose to do.  It killed the elastics.  But instead of throwing them away I just use them as my nighttime pul.  But you can use any combination you come up with.  You dont need  layers and the most expensive wool covers.  Also my daughter who has the most sensitive skin doesnt get anymore rashes.  We use to use fitteds and wool covers and she wouldnt get s diaper rash but a rash on her inner thighs from where the wet fitted would sit against her legs at night.  I used the pul cover just to try and prevent that but noticed the wool cover wouldnt even be wet where as just with a fitted it would be.  I still have my smaller wool covers and I plan on using them with the same system with this baby.  When. I sized up i just chose fleece instead since it was a lot cheaper.  I also throw them in the wash and dont have to worry about hand washing wool or waiting for it to dry for  days.  I use flip covers.  I buy them from cotton babies.  I usually wait until they have seconds which are around  instead of .  Seconds are new diapers that have cosmetic issues when theyre made so theyre sold at a discount.  Theyre all guaranteed to be fully functional but usually have an extra stitch or something not really noticeable.   Almost every flip I bought was a second.  One had a slight grey stain  on it probably from the sewing machine that was used and it came out in the first wash. Since then Ive only had one cover that I noticed the extra stitch.  Ive tried pretty much every other cover brand out there.  I loved thirsties but always went back to flip.  For the  they are also the easiest to fix the elastics if you need to.  All you need is a sewing needle thread and elastic.  No sewing skills required.  There are a ton of YouTube videos and blogs that show you how to do it but theyre extremely easy to fix.   ,BabyBumps,db25x9p,1,t5_2s7cl

10008738,0,t3_5izfn5,Disclaimer  I dont know your situation but I hope this helps in some way!Broke up with my first sons dad when I was around  weeks. I feel for you! Two things that really helped me through it were. I was able to control the environment my child grew up in. Partner was abusive? Your child doesnt have to live with that. Partner couldnt commit to the level you needed? You dont need that stress and uncertainty. My ex was not the nicest guy and unfortunately it never came out until after I was pregnant. I made myself think about it as a blessing that I saw it then and not after the baby was here. Even if your partner is an awesome guy but the dynamic isnt working or theres a chance one of you will be really unhappy if youre together then sometimes a single parent environment or a co parenting environment is better.. I could raise my son according to my morals. Once I got pregnant I really started to notice how different our views were. He was a homophobe and a racist  these things didnt come out until later in the pregnancy when we were discussing certain things. Also this means I have had the opportunity to find a partner with all cards on the table  and have found someone who I know through experience is an excellent father. It sucks I still feel that feeling sometimes of how hard it was at first. But now you get to be the number one advocate for your child. And I hate that there is a certain shame attached to being a single mum but you will find people will surround you in love and support when you need it most youll realise how strong you are and you will not regret a minute you have with your baby.,BabyBumps,dbc615c,16,t5_2s7cl
10009291,0,t3_5izsge,Its a really hard question and many times is nearly impossible to tell. I was only working when I had my second but I left at  weeks ended up not delivering until  weeks! You will most likely have many warnings that the end is near but unfortunately near can be a few hours to a few weeks. I would say when your pretty much done and have wrapped everything up and it doesnt make sense to start a new project or your super uncomfortable is the time to leave.

10012345,0,t3_5izsge,So Im only  weeks but Im also a software engineer. My plan is to try to have at least one other person working on the same project as me when I get closer. Our team does scrum and so Ive just been fairly detailed in documenting the descriptions of stories and tasks for my project so far. The stories are small enough  week or lessthat if I have to leave in the middle of one its not the end of the world if my work is lost. Ill try to send out code reviews often to prevent that though. Im also going to write a launch plan for whatever remains on my current project which is more to give myself peace of mind that they wont miss anything. I am the most senior dev on my immediate team so Im just planning on continuing that role until I have to stop. Ill probably setup some knowledge transfer sessions around  weeks for the few systems that I know the most about in an attempt to make them more prepared for my absence though. Worst case they can read the code and figure out what it does if they need to while Im gone. Its also working out well that a lot of new projects are starting up right now so I have some ability to impact design of them before I go. Its sad but my teams stack has sort of been my baby up until this point so Im mostly scared that bad design stuff will happen to it while Im gone. Im just trying to remember its out of my control and so there is no use stressing about it. ,BabyBumps,dbcmyas,3,t5_2s7cl

10016874,0,t3_5j3u36,The reason they say its safer for them in your room that Ive read anyway is that the sounds you make in your sleep help keep them from falling into too deep of a sleep so if they stop breathing they can wake themselves up. Dont hold me to that as fact I just remember reading that somewhere. The only kid that had a nursery was my first. It was mainly just a sanity project for me while I waited for the baby to come. He ended up sleeping in a swing in our room for the first  months due to reflux issues. We started transitioning him to the crib at  months by just doing naps until he was totally comfortable in there then we did nights too. My second had a playpen in our room and a dresser. She stayed in our room until about  months then the kids started sharing a room. Pregnant with  now and we bought a little lounger rock n play knockoff that she will sleep in in our room and we still have the playpen if she prefers that. When she gets bigger we will figure out the next step since I dont foresee  kids in one room working out very well lol,BabyBumps,dbd86wq,1,t5_2s7cl

But we were told that the test is typically  to  if not covered by insurance so we went ahead and did it. The problem is they tested early  weeks and the results were inconclusive so they tested again. Now weve got two tests to pay for and its looking like its going to be a lot more than a few hundred dollars.  Just wondering if theres a chance for wiggle room if I deliver at age .

Throughout the pregnancy he pushed for an abortion and lashed out and afterwards when she was born continued to blame my sister for their financial state which was pretty fortunate but he didnt like spending his money on people other than him. A few years later they got pregnant and she did have a miscarriage and he was scum to her. Ill spare the details but basically I believe in hurting no one and it makes me want to punch him.Flash forward some more my sister finally leaves him when my niece is . It took a long hard year plus but now shes incredibly happy independent and has carved out a new life for herself and my niece.

10104461,0,t3_5kh0pu,I have those fears too. I look at other family members parenting styles that are much healthier than my moms. I also talk to my husband a lot about my issues with mom and he helps me recognize my own narcissistic tendencies when they come out. Its hard because some of them feel so normal until someone else points out how crazy they actually are. The main difference is that we try to stomp them out like you said instead of gaslighting denying that theres anything wrong with us and shifting the blame. I think just being aware of the potential damage we can do as parents and worrying about being good parents goes a long way. ,BabyBumps,dbomfyz,1,t5_2s7cl

10116713,0,t3_5kmco9,I didnt have a csection but I studied to be a nurse and spent time in postsurgical rehab know a few friends who have had a csection and my moms best friend had something like  abdominal surgeries because her intestines are awful so maybe some of these secondhand tips will help... I let my friend borrow some foldoverwaist lounge pants for her recovery. I think they were George brand sold at Walmart for . Wouldnt be surprised if the exact pants are no longer sold but look for something in a super stretchy fabric that doesnt compress whatsoever. These hug very very gently. Favorite pants on earth!! Im on the lookout for another pair if I find some Ill try and find your post and tell you where I saw more. Have little stations set up in at least two places you expect to spend a lot of time. You could get something like one of the carts from IKEA or set up book shelves with lots of baskets lined up. Find somewhere to stock diapers wipes diaper cream new onesies at least  burp cloths batteries or chargers for remotes to whatever TV or entertainment consoles youll be using to keep yourself occupied swaddle blankets a throw blanket for you a gallon ziploc bag full of granola bars fruit snacks singleserving bags of crackers trail mix whatever you want to keep your energy up. If you plan to breastfeed plan to be ravenously hungry. The last thing you want is to have to get out of bed and walk down or up a flight of stairs to be able to feed yourself. My husband has a oz mug that he fills with ice water. The bonus to those is its literally more water than I could drink in an entire day. If youre breastfeeding you will need a fuckton of water and the oz mug the hospital sends you home with will likely need refilled  times a day. Plan ahead and get at least a oz mug if you know youre going to be down for hours at a time. Or if room temperature bottled water works better for you cool. We actually had a minifridge that I was gonna move from the office to our bedroom or the nursery but it ended up being kinda noisy and I wouldnt want it right next to my bed. You could always get a cooler and reusable ice packs and have your spouse swap those out every morning and fill it with bottled water Gatorade or whatever else so you do have a way to keep drinks cool. I just know I got real sick of room temperature drinks real fast and the mug the hospital sent home didnt work for keeping my drinks cold for extended periods of time.Have extra parts on hand for your breast pump if youre going to use one. Have formula if thats what youre going to use. Have  bottles on hand if youre going to pump or formula feed. Plan for spitup and projectile barf. Clean sheets a stack of clean shirts and extra pants or dresses to change into when it happens. It will happen. Have any pain medications split into two bottles maybe just ask for an extra one or dump an old prescription and rip off the label so you can split your pain meds to each of your survival stations. Few things suck like knowing its going to hurt like a bitch to get up but its gonna hurt worse if you dont because you left your meds in another room and youre stuck in a loselose situation.Words from another friend about her csection recovery... It wasnt fun. Cant lay down cant stand cant really walk. I had to be lifted off the couch help sitting down help up the stairs help into bed. It took a solid week with lots of drugs before she could move without someone helping her. What hurt the most for me was the jiggling. This new flabby belly bouncing around was was killed the most. And our house has  floors so going up and down those damn stairs was very painful. I would hold onto the railing and drag myself up. We talked about belly bands  in  Postpartum Support  Recovery Bellywaistpelvis Belt Shapewear Nude  This is the one I got. Lifesaver. I still wear it. It is great back support as well. Instant relief when I put it on. Only complaint is that it can be hard to wear and sit down without it riding up. Will your husband be able to take off  days from work to be home with you? Do you have a sibling or parent or other close friend that can assist you if your husband cant take time off? Ask in advance for help. And not just hold the baby so I can shower help but someone willing to do two loads of laundry because your baby has projectile vomited after multiple meals and you need your clothes their clothes and your sheets cleaned.I would also recommend keeping some hygiene items in your survival station. Deodorant hair ties to pull your hair up and maybe a travel size mouthwash. Lotion if you have dry skin. I avoid chapstick since I know it cakes layers of dead skin to my lips... you can use lanolin nipple cream as a lip balm as well as coconut oil. Have several options for entertainment. Adult coloring books and colored pencils a bunch of apps on your phone to keep you entertained maybe a Gameboy with a game you havent played in  years find a new YouTube channel with cool videos to queue up may I recommend scishow? Do anything you can to have things within reach. If things need to be a few feet away get a grabber. No shame. So many movements require your abdominal muscles and you just dont comprehend how much your core muscles affect your entire body until you cant use them to even twist or pull something closer to you. You just avoid all movement possible for several days and even going to the bathroom is exhausting and painful. Stool softeners were also a must with surgery recovery a lot of pain meds will completely shut down your ability to poop. Browse around and find some csection recovery posts Im sure there are a bunch of super helpful tips and tricks that wont end up getting shared here!And you will be ok. A common theme I saw was despair that the pain would never end. Especially with postpartum hormone crash and exhaustion from no sleep and having to be on a constant medication schedule so you dont feel like youre dying. Prepare yourself for possibly feeling doomed and know that the pain goes away and you learn your babys cues and you will sleep again and everything will be fine. So many people focus so hard on preparing for the surgery and recovery that they forget that they also have to be a mom afterward and that transition alone can be brutal. There are people who handle it just fine. I was not one of those people. I thought I would dive right in and just struggle with exhaustion ya know? Told myself I could handle that. And I just didnt comprehend how things magnified each other... it wasnt just sleep deprivation  breastfeeding pain  stitches and severely bruised tailbone  screaming baby no not for me. Change the plus signs to multiplication signs. The pain and exhaustion and crying was like torture for me. Have a plan for someone to call if it gets like that for you. A best friend a neighbor a parent someone who can come be there to help you with short notice. They need to know that an SOS text means Im falling apart I need you are you able to come over? I think that so often we read these birth stories on babybumps from moms  hours out from birth and they say their baby eats like a champ and its so worth it but then you dont see their posts on breastfeeding and beyondthebump when they feel like theyre drowning and we just get this false hope that if we can make it through birth everything will be fine. Prepare for the worst anything better is a tender mercy. It doesnt last forever but its really common and it can be really isolating. You will survive. Just know your limits and know who will be there for you if you need help.,BabyBumps,dbq7rpe,2,t5_2s7cl

10154145,0,t3_5lcg3v,Not plus sized but I have preexisting back injuries so I feel your pain literally. Try a belly band with an optional back brace. It totally changes my posture and offers so much more support than just the band. Its counterintuitive but try to stretch if you can. It will hurt when you do it but over time it will help. Ask your doctor about safe stretches for you. Bonus points if you can get a pop. Ive had my lower spine and hip pop a few times over the past several days. Its terrifying and takes your breath away when it happens but them it is the sweetest relief in the world for a few hours to a day. Have sleep support. I use a snoogle but really just make sure your hips and shoulders are aligned. Before snoogle I did this with two extra pillows one between my knees and one to hug. Alternate hot and cold. Hot alone is nice but both makes a big difference.Make sure youre getting your calcium! Dont be afraid to take it easy. If that means teaching from your chair then so be it. I promise you noone will take issue with you for it and if they do they need an immediate meeting with HR.Get help with chores where you can. I didnt want to dump everything on hubs but I get him to help. I loadunload the top rack he does the bottom rack. I load the laundry and detergent he switches to the dryer for me and then brings clean clothes to me to fold while sitting.

Its in the fabric of your being theres nothing less of a problem when you arent sure if youre going to make it through the month.

She said squatting and standing positions are best for getting the baby moving down the birth path.  When it came to pushing I do not think I would have had enough strength to stand or move its exhausted.  Midwife always said holding legs up and slightly reclining back opens pelvis.

Bending over because your family are just the type of people who are demanding enough to HAVE to be there is not fair to you or your baby. My inlaws were the same. It greatly affected my ability to bond with my baby because they all had her more than I did the first two days. Those days are crucial especially if you want to breastfeed as the other commenter explained very well. Having visitors once youre at home and settled makes a huge difference and theyre only having to wait a couple days.Labor is exhausting. The first few hours and days postpartum are awful and youre a completely different person during that hormone crash. For your babys sake heshe needs to learn YOU. Not your extended family who just want to oooh and ahhh over how cute they are. Postpartum is no party.The reason Im saying all of this is because you deflected my first question on whether you want this many people there.

The banking would likely be free but the procedure which is just an IV for about a half hour is about k. If you Google Dr. Kurtzberg hydrocephalus youll probably find some results. My now two year old had a golfballsized tumor removed at  days and has had four brain surgeries. She had a shunt placed at  mos old and it failed a year later. Shes had roughly  MRIs almost all under general anesthesia but thats because of the tumor and a blood clot she had and not related to the hydrocephalus. I dont remember any of the measurements from the anomaly scan but it was definitely a scary time.Shunt surgery is a fairly standard procedure I think our hospital stay for the shunt revision was only  or  days. Expect head measurements to be taken at every pediatrician visit or ask that they be done until the skull bones are fused. Youll probably see an opthalmologist to check for any damage to the optic nerve from the pressure. Rapid MRIs may be done in the future to check that the shunt is functioning properly.There isnt much to do with a shunt besides avoiding powerful magnets. There will be an incision on the scalp that youll probably keep covered with bacitracin and another on the stomach. Programmable shunts have a magnet in them to control the pressure setting and the setting should be checked after every MRI. Medtronic a programmable shunt manufacturer recommends staying away from iPads because of the magnets but some independent studies have shown its not as much of a risk as they make it sound like. In our area hydrocephalus is an automatic qualifier for Early Intervention therapies. Look into that. We did physical therapy because of weakness on her left side which they believe was a result of the blood clot she had in her brain but shes since caught up. We did a couple speech therapy sessions which at that age covers eating and tongue movements not actual taking. Our daughter has hit every milestone on time but obviously everyone is different. I like to attribute some of it to the stem cell treatment but have no way of knowing.Be kind to your doctors and nurses but make sure that your an advocate for your son. Ask questions. If something doesnt seem right ask someone else ask the next nurse when shifts change. Heres a before and after from the shunt revision  The pic on the left wasnt the worst it had been and her ventricles have shrunk some more since the picture on the right which was a month after surgery.

10508464,0,t3_5qgit9,To be honest there are sources you can look up online about how meth metabolises but telling your doctor or anyone at the hospital might not be a good idea. Even if they just open a case against you you do not want to be in the system. You do not want your child to be in the system. CPS will check up on you and they get to determine what is a good house and many of the workers will be prejudiced towards former drug users and low income women.  The child welfare system is HIGHLY punitive to low income mothers especially drug users especially injecting meth users. Your dr and it looks like a lot of people on this thread might be very judgemental and think the best option it to alert CPS or in the case of your dr they might have to legally alert them . You know what you have to do to be healthy I would suggest an AA group or counselling to get at the root of your use in the first place. You as the mother need support for yourself. People fuck up all the time but it looks like you are on a path to recovery. The dr will already be checking for abnormalities at each appointment so you do not need to tell them you are worried because of the meth use. In Canada they dont even ask questions about drug use and they do not test for drug use at delivery. The US has some messed up policies towards pregnant women.  ,BabyBumps,dcz8uqx,-16,t5_2s7cl

And then maternity leave is over and youre like wtf did I just do for the last three months? but youre so tired you dont even want to remember. Regarding the positive feedback you will get it way earlier than three months. We started getting genuine smiles around  weeks and even before that there are other things that are going to be huge accomplishments for you. It seems silly now but OMG we got her to bed easily! or she pooped really well today! or I had a really good nursing day! or we got out in public without a meltdown! will be your new measures of success...but its temporary. These things are huge deals in the beginning and they really keep you going. And then you get back to work and everything is just weird. Youre in for quite the ride. I would suggest finding some shows youve been wanting to watch or some new recipes youve been wanting to try if you think youll need something to keep you entertained...but my guess is those things will go on the backburner once baby comes  ,BabyBumps,dd54ztj,1,t5_2s7cl

In the UK the advise is that you can eat Sushi but as with most food dont go to somewhere that just looks like it is going to give you food poisoning. Although these are normally where you find the most amazing food  Here is the link to the NHS advice  Any half decent restaurant should not be preparing vegetables on the same surface as raw or even cooked meat. There should be color coded chopping boards. Besides anything  what if you are vegetarian or vegan you dont want your nice avocado maki rolled in salmon or beef! I still eat Sushi but only from the same reputable restaurant I have been going to for years and so far no ill effects. As always I would research where the advice comes from what are you actually trying to prevent and how likely it is that you would contract it and make an informed decision based on that.

I dont like getting shots but as an adult I make the decision to because I realize why I should. However I do think that its important to discuss clearly why some choices are taken from them. To my daughter I say what we are doing and who will be protected by her getting shots. She hates shots but she understands why she still has to get them. With my son who is  I explained gardasil to him and why he needs to get it. I told him flat out this prevents you from getting warts on your penis.

Im not sure if this is something that has been mentioned to you but virgin gut is not a thing. For the first couple of days maybe but definitely not at four months.  ,BabyBumps,ddguo59,5,t5_2s7cl

10725269,0,t3_5tbq8i,If you end up staying with home birth...make sure you set up a backup plan and everyone knows the drill. Most hospitals do pre admissions paperwork with you ahead of time so set it up so they have your basic information etc. and can get you in as quick as possible. Know the signs for more complicated situations and be ready to call the hospitals LampD instead if you have a gut feeling its not going right.Some hospitals can be pretty accommodating for your needs as well. Make sure you check with your local ones. Mine does do various degrees of medication or non medicated birth. They advise you labor at home for as long as possible if you live near by so you can feel comfortable. They also have wireless or wired monitoring for baby and mom so you can choose to be more mobile and walk around. They have been telling me forever now that they will try skin to skin and breastfeeding right away unless I refuse or baby need NICU. If you make up your mind either way dont let embarrassment get in your way. Be brave for your baby. Just make sure you consider all the factors distance to hospital baby sizeposition.... ,BabyBumps,ddm8cnm,2,t5_2s7cl

10727314,0,t1_ddmau9x,The main concern with deli meat is listeria. Listeria can grow in the absence of oxygen meaning it will grow happily inside the ham whether or not its sliced. So even if its cut fresh if the ham is contaminated with listeria then its still a risk. However youre right that generally deli meat spoils faster once its cut because most spoilage bacteria requires oxygen to grow cuthigher surface contact with oxygen. It will taste funny faster but its unrelated to listeria.The chances of deli meat having listeria are very low but the severity of the consequences if you do get it are what leads to the recommendation to avoid deli meats. I personally still eat deli meats but only from one brand Maple Leaf. They had a major listeria outbreak a few years ago and now theyre known in the food industry for being leaders in listeria controlmonitoring. So I trust their deli meats. Unfortunately the small ma and pa type places with the specialty meats tend to have less funds to invest in food safety technology so those I avoid for now unless I take the time to heat the meat before eating.,BabyBumps,ddmfxqq,2,t5_2s7cl

10750793,0,t3_5trh2a,Not trying to be a downer since everyone else successfully started eating fruits and veggies after the first trimester but I didnt. I was a very healthy eater prepregnancy and adored my fruits and veggies however now pregnant I can only stomach very few of them. For reference Im  weeks so I just entered my rd trimester. Salads have been a no go for me this whole pregnancy. They give me the worst stomach pain imaginable. Most vegetables I have to force myself to eat. My tastebuds reject all of them. Everything I loved and craved prebaby like broccoli zucchini beans etc all continue to taste awful and I make myself choke them down. I can also only handle certain fruits. Fruit in general tastes good to me but I have a lot of issues with acid reflux this pregnancy so there are only certain ones I can eat. I brought my less than stellar eating practices still living on carbs up to my OB and she told me to relax and not worry. Im taking my prenatals and get at least some noncrap food in. She said Im fine baby is fine and every body will need something different through every pregnancy. In case youre freaking about potential weight gain Ive gained a total of  pounds with  weeks to go.

I drink a cup of coffee every morning which is usually all I had prior to this. I was never much of a drinker but since I found out I was pregnant Ive had exactly one small glass of champagne on NYE and one half glass of wine mixed with juice a couple of weeks ago. Someone yesterday asked about safe protein powder because most have artificial sugars in them but I still consume artificial sugars since as far as we know they are safe. With only one scoop of protein a day and maybe one fake sweetened drink Im not overly concerned about it.I dont take medication on a regular basis anyway but when I had a bad headache last week I took some Tylenol since thats whats advised. Otherwise I havent taken any meds since finding out I was pregnant no need for it as of this moment.I was an exerciser before I got pregnant and have continued my routine. I run K twice a week this will need to increase as I have a Half Marathon and a K as part of a relay race in May. I go to BodyPump twice a week and Ive continued to play dodgeball with my doctors consent. All of my exercises have definitely felt much harder than they did previously but Im keeping up fairly well.

10944492,0,t3_5wbfmd,Also  weeks and swap out the breast pain for an irritable uterus and we could be twins.  Right down to the stupid pillow I have to sit on to drive and the ridiculous number of people we see to just keep us functioning my lineup includes a pregnancy chiropractor physical therapist and acupuncturist Before pregnancy I was really active  weight lifting swimming and long walks with our dogs most days.  Its a little depressing for me to see and hear about other women who are staying active up until their due date because thats always how I imagined this would be for me. Now I can barely walk without pain and its the same frustratingly slow and small steps you described.  My husband reminds me that everyones body is just different but its hard to not feel like Im just bad at this or a wimp or something.I have a less active job than you do hats off  I was an elementary school teacher for a few years and its hard on the body to work with littles but a recent reorg has left me needing to travel to sometimes multiple buildings a day to meet with new colleagues.  All of the extra driving  carrying around my laptop coat etc. to meeting to meeting since I dont have an office in these buildings has resulted in a pretty significant increase in my SPD and I suspect the irritable uterus problem.

Inverted nipples tonguetie reflux allergies...there is a lot that can go wrong but if you have a professional there to spot it and help you may be able to overcome them.  The best advice is to hire a lactation consultant to visit you and your newborn in the hospital for my hospital they claimed to provide one but all they sent were nurses with TERRIBLE advice that ruined my nipples and establish a good latch early on.  I have inverted nipples but I had no idea that it would be a nightmare to breastfeed. The nurses at my hospital gave conflicting advice which ended up wounding my nipples to the point of serious bleeding and risked infection. My baby wasnt eating and I had an emergency appointment with a private lactation consultant.  She gave me medicated ointment to help heal me helped the baby learn to latch and pointed me to the right sized nipple guards. See a consultant even before birth to know more about what to expect edit regarding any complications specific to you your body etc.  I desperately wish I could go back in time and see someone before giving birth to learn more. end edit,BabyBumps,decai6p,1,t5_2s7cl

These markets were found on my baby. I am sure that your US tech also looked for further markers and its good news that no other markets were mentioned on your paperwork.

11100156,0,t1_deq5x9i,Haha yeah I just rolled my eyes at him when he said no he didnt give him a bath  I honestly think it didnt even cross his mind. We both work fulltime and have the same days off but Im more quick to just simply do things that need to be done than he is so most of the time I just find it easier to just simply do it than ask him to do it and have it not get done for  minutes. Sometimes I just get upset because Ive not been able to sleep in ever since our son was born because my husband does instead and the amount of effort I would have to exert to simply get him out of bed would have me awake and angry anyway. Whats terrible is hes told me sometimes he thinks I dont do anything even though he knows I do he gets mad because in the moment he feels like hes doing everything. He does a lot of regular household chores like garbage recycling dishes and his own laundry  and he does pick up the toys a lot more often than I do. So I think honestly we are pretty even for the most part if you lay everything we do out  I handle more of the kid and he does more of the household stuff. But its tough to look at it that way. Hes the youngest of  childrenand very much acts like the baby of the family that were raised by a SAHM that has even now that hes almost  empty nest syndrome pretty bad. He was her last baby and I think she spoiled him a bit more. I love the man hes absolutely great most of the time but just not with childrearing haha. Even then hes not the worst. Just needs to learn to communicate  and as you say grow up. ,BabyBumps,deq6yjq,2,t5_2s7cl

In general theyre mostly looking to take measurements or make sure specific organsbody parts are developing the way they should. Its stuff that is important to your medical team but not so interesting to look at for anyone else. My last ultrasound at  weeks was entirely body part shots and baby was head down and so low in my pelvis that they couldnt even really get a look at his faceprofile and had a hard time getting the measurements for his head.

11131796,1,t3_5yxqiy,Stressing out about it will only make it worse. While many pregnancies do end in miscarriage in almost every case there is little to nothing that can be done about it and they usually happen for a reason something went wrong with the fetus during development. This reason is just something Biological. It sucks its not fun for anyone and it can be very upsetting obviously but your body does what it is supposed to do. Causing yourself to cry over something that just might happen is going to just make your pregnancy experience awful. Its normal where Im from to only have one ultrasound the whole pregnancy at  weeks so I got used to just trusting my body and knowing that it knows what to do. When I woke up nauseated I knew that was a pregnancy sign. When my right breast hurt like hell same thing. All of those little symptoms are signs things are happening just as they should. When you have these thoughts try to push them out of your head theyre not productive or helpful and will only serve to increase your stress which we dont want during pregnancy.,BabyBumps,dets1xx,1,t5_2s7cl

Failing that a Facebook group with likely individuals can get the message across and hopefully avoid some of the issues youre fearing.At the end of the day youre probably going to get food that isnt to your tastes and you may or may not care new parenthood can be all about survival sometimes. If it isnt going to screw with your digestive tract keep it in your fridgefreezer as long as possible. Just remember to always be gracious.

11216781,0,t1_df39r3s,Thanks! Im doing pretty well its been really crazy though. The hormone crash is intense and I wasnt prepared. The hospital stay was so crazy it didnt have time to hit but as soon as we got home I sobbed. Constantly. We walked in the front door and I cried because I wanted to move and buy all new things because nothing I owned was good enough for my baby. I cried when my husband read a novel because it reminded me of our honeymoon and how much I love him. I cried because I was tired and tired of pumping but I need to do it.As far as the blood sugars holy lows! Stock up on juice and juice boxes and any low  blood sugar snacks you like i got Costco boxes of granola bars. I cut my insulin in half immediately after baby was out and still have been dropping it daily. I get so busy that I forget to eat sometimes so its important to set the baby down for  minutes and have a meal. Youve gotta do it. Overnight lows seem constant. I havent taken a bolus since pm yesterday and turned my pump off at am for an hour to prevent a low. Hopefully once my milk supply gets established and we get into a better breastfeeding routine Ill be able to control those numbers better. Doctor just advised to run higher for the time being and we will tighten up later. No one wants a low sugar at a am feeding and blowout diaper. Otherwise Im healing up quickly and trying to nap whenever I can!!! ,BabyBumps,df3epvi,5,t5_2s7cl

I think a sprinkling is fine maybe a diapers and wipe only party not a full blown registry every baby. As some other women said Im also not a fan of gender reveal parties. What I think would be ideal is the meet and greet only for each baby. That way you are able to have a party and celebrate the new life that has actually arrived. It also means mom and dad only have to entertain everyone once for a day instead of everyone coming individually at all hours during the first few weeks after birth. ,BabyBumps,df3tevi,4,t5_2s7cl

She didnt report it with the intention of getting the person fired the OB fired her because what she did was wrong.Even though I think justice was served here because the action was illegal I would feel horrible if I made a complaint that cost someone their job. I know it seems harsh to lose a job over kind words on facebook but this is the law. She cant be trusted with sensitive information. What if this happens again in a more serious situation?

11306551,0,t3_618n16,Im sorry you feel this way. I have had both experiences. My first child  years ago was a surprise. My husband and I were just married I was in grad school. It was an easy pregnancy other than the delivery. Three years ago we started trying again and I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor a macroadenoma.  It made me infertile and removal could have killed my pituitary it still may they dont know whenif it will happen. When that was removed I was diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve and saw an RE. I had two early losses then I got pregnant again. I was a participant on this board under another username. I lost that pregnancy at  weeks last February. Then I had two more early losses. Then I had IVF.   Since I lost my pregnancy I have been so bitter. I tried to not be I try to work through it but the losses and the infertility and the pain of people being so casual with their pregnancies  like I once was!  is ever present. Its permanent heartbreak. Its seeing somebody else be happy when you are consistently getting pushed in the mud.Is it the happy persons fault? Of course not! Does the happy person deserve to be happy? Of course!! If anyone specifically commented to you and tried to take away your happiness or joy of your pregnancy that would be horrible and beyond cruel. But if people are commenting elsewhere about their pain and you are reading it  dont. Its not about you or your joy its about dealing with their heartbreak and pain that is beyond comprehension. So I would say dont take it personally and dont visit the communities where people support each other through some shitty stuff. I dont visit the childfree community you know? Its not for me. ,BabyBumps,dfdkwr6,5,t5_2s7cl

Again its best to just call and have them add it to your chartrecord.I spotted around  weeks that turned red and had a few gushes to it periodlike quantity for an hour at a time.

11353174,0,t3_620xvy,I felt really weird creating a registry but it actually helped me organize what I needed for the baby and make a concrete list. at some point youll need to figure that all out anyway and if you use a registry you usually get a completion discount. Maybe try reframing it to yourself as creating a list of baby things that you need and if your friends want to give you something then at least they know its not something you already own or dont want.As another poster said though you and your baby completely deserve the love and attention  I was amazed at how excited people got over our little one. I felt like I was disrupting our mostly childfree friend group by having a kid our time will be limited we may not be able to host things etc etc but our friends were so generous and sweet in celebrating our babys arrival. I think we can come up with a million reasons of why we dont deserve something but in the end all we can really do is be grateful of our friends generosity if they choose to give it.,BabyBumps,dfiv0k8,5,t5_2s7cl

She couldnt have held a full time job that would support two kids without help because two kids one with Down syndrome but she did what she could to provide. I grew up with these kids.Whenever people judge others for WIC or terminating a child with Down syndrome I get so annoyed. Just because you are on Wic doesnt mean you arent working your ass off sometimes the ends just wont meet for reasons outside of your control. And for Down syndrome I just see and saw how much of a toll it took on her. Its nobodys decision or right to force it on anyone who doesnt want to do it.

In fact the current CDCobstetrics guidelines are if youve had a previous pregnancy with neural tube defects spina bifida or anencephaly issues you should be getting  mcg of folic acid per day which is x the usual pregnancy recommendation  mcg. Also keep in mind that lots of pastas and breads have folic acidfolate in them! Which is great because that is pretty much what I was able to eat the first trimester. At some point hanging around in this sub youll see lots of recommendations for the book Expecting Better  I highly recomend reading it before or as soon as you get pregnant.

Some people just abandon pets as soon as the test turns positive or dump them at the shelter the minute the kid comes home because its just too much even though theyre dealing with a well adjusted dog or pet with no major issues like the one you describe.Ive dealt with a food obsessed dog. We got her from the shelter and when we added another dog  years later she would flat out attack if he got too close to her bowl or scraps. She was clearly wanting for food at some point in her life and felt the need to guard. It was a stressful situation that would have made a baby very difficult.  months before I got pregnant she deteriorated very quickly due to lung cancer I was insanely upset and miss her a lot but she would have ended up at my parents if shed been around when we had our child.

Butterflies and pink for girls navy blue and cars for boys etc. I really want my child to grow up in a neutral environment where they can feel free to choose something on the sole basis that they like it and not because its expected of them to so I purposely get things that arent particularly aimed towards any specific sex and it frustrates me when others undo that. I aim to take the same approach with most things in my childs life as I want them to feel free to choose who they are.If someone tried to push their religion on my baby I just KNOW itd grind my gears.

He doesnt really eat properly  lots of junk too little real meals  but thats also just how he has always been. His view of body is definitely framed by his own size and he views normal sized people as fat etc. Even myself i am ft and usually i.e not pregnant  and he will note im holding weight on my thighs etc. Thanks  That said! He is definitely not like that about my eating  has always encouraged me to eat im also not a good eater   and definitely now that i am pregnant he encourages me to eat is on my case about etc etc I think try to keep in mind his frame of reference  his own emaciated body pounds at ft?yaa and dont let it affect you.

My doc does two guaranteed  amp  weeks three if insurance covers it either growth or dating and they have a portable one that the midwives will use if they cant find the heartbeat. Im havinghad four formal scans and have had one quickie. The first I had because I have PCOS and we couldnt be sure when I ovulatedconceived dating scan  approx  weeks. I had the standard  amp  week scans with a quickie portable scan thrown in because the baby wasnt cooperating for my  week check. And because of my weight and age obese  ftm my midwife wants to do another formal scan at my ish week appointment just to be sure nothing weird is going on.

Maybe your doctor has personally treated a few patients where a miscarriage has occurred while breast feeding in a patient with no previous history and he believes that it was linked so hes just trying to advise you as he feels best.

Relax and push your stomach outwards and make a hissing sound all at the same time this relaxes your pelvic floor and is the proper way to poop.Take a stool softener. Take a small amount of fibre ie Metamucil mixed with orange juice in the am. Dont dramatically increase fibre just slowly add it in.Your baby wont fall out. Your pelvic floor is probably just stressed from having so much pressure. If you think youre actually constipated then putting a bit of Vaseline on your butt to protect the skin as things exit isnt a bad idea. And call your doctor if you have issues.DO NOT avoid going to the washroom because youre scared.

She massaged it and focused on the knot that somehow formed there and it is so much better now. It can lead to sciatica but its not a long term issue. I am seeing her biweekly. Shes also recommended not crossing my legs when sitting. I would go and see an RMT or your Doctor so that they can take a look at you. I would also recommend going before your next training session so that you dont aggravate it further.

I know a lady who was obese and pushing  so she assumed shes hitting menopause. Never had kids before and thought it was an ulcer when labor started. ,BabyBumps,dgvrbri,1,t5_2s7cl

11786572,0,t3_67zbql,If youre looking for something specific to pregnancy the podcast Stuff Mom Never Told You covered a few maternityrelated topics in episodes. There was a great one on maternity fashion another great on on maternal mental health. Then their sister podcast Stuff You Should Know had  episodes on feeding babies one about breast feeing and another about formula. I found them all interesting!,BabyBumps,dgw1phc,1,t5_2s7cl
11787499,0,t3_685lca,Yes! And I suspect at least a couple of the girls who constantly ask have ulterior motives. Theyre bigger gals and have always given me a hard time about being small. I suspect theyre tickled pink that Im now lbs heavier... My TINY sister actually cried at my wedding because she isnt the pretty one any more. So excuse my body conscious self if Im in no hellfire hurry to document immortalize and share my huge new body with people who relish in my excessive weight gain. ,BabyBumps,dgw5hu1,7,t5_2s7cl
11788130,0,t1_dgw6ne7,They do but the band from ours was cutting into our daughters arm! It was a soft material but their newborn skin is so soft and she was dried out from being under the bili lights. Our options were to remove the band or let it keep cutting her. We opt out and just made sure she stayed with us at all times. ,BabyBumps,dgw82ng,3,t5_2s7cl

11797997,0,t3_68c1ab,Im small like you   and  lbs before pregnancy  and I was ravenous my first trimester and instantly gained five pounds and started showing. Now into my second the pace of weight gain and appetite have both leveled off. I think when you start off smaller you gain more quickly to catch up.,BabyBumps,dgxcdf0,2,t5_2s7cl

11805139,0,t3_68frwq,I know for me I wanted gender neutral stuff toUse for future kids like clothes and gear but everyone found out I was having a girl and bought all pink and dresses.  Im not trying to sound ungrateful but there was no guarantee I was going to have another girl.  I like to be practical and not waste so its nice to get additional use out of stuff they use for such a short period of time.  Also people have a bunch of shit to say and feel like they should have some type of say in what you name your child.  Or at least thats what I encountered and a lot of women here say similar stuff.  People were trying to go behind my back to convince my husband to get me to pick as different name as if he also didnt agree on said name.  People tried to make us feel guilty for not choosing a name they thought was good or naming the baby after another family member.  Even this time around our rd and only boy people wanted us to name him a family name rather than the name we had chosen to the point of getting upset about it.  Im in the same mindset as you and people can fuck off if theyre gonna get themselves butt hurt about things like that its just annoying to even have to deal with ,BabyBumps,dgy5j4c,3,t5_2s7cl
