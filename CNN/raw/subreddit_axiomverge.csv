Go forward not backward!,axiomverge,cq0q297,1,t5_2wscp

3624839,0,t3_31rxnh,The fact that I saw this was developed in Visual Studio has really brought back a little passion of game development that I may go back to continue my RPG.  I know I wont but the fact that I thought about it at least reminded me that I was doing that.,axiomverge,cq5gisq,2,t5_2wscp
3988397,0,t3_35yy6t,Really nice work. I tried out some more obscure codes and at least h varies your weapon bullet speed. At zero the bullets stay still whereas at max they move really fast.G is tied to the Bioflux Accelerator shot cooldown. If you have instant cooldown zero accelerators create a continuous stream of bullets whereas obviously with max it takes a long time for the next shot.C affects the jump power. At max you hit the highest point of the jump really fast. The increased power also makes you to jump higher. At zero you can only do really small jumps.E changes the drone gravity.I affects your damage dealt. Im oneshotting every enemy when i is at max.J affects the damage taken by the player. Those discoballs at the end of the game kill you in  hits when j is at max. J at zero means that you enable the god mode and cant be killed at all.O affects enemy health drop frequency. At max every enemy drops health.P changes the health drop size. At max health drops are huge.So really gamebreaking codes God mode AXIOGXXJYCYA Wreck everything AXIOPNXM,axiomverge,crawuk1,2,t5_2wscp

When you first get the drone you  could shoot it through walls but theres no way you can follow the drone without the drone teleport. In order to get the drone teleport you need to have the trenchcoat which already enables you to go through walls.It was quite sad that it got patched just when I found out really cool way to use it it ended up unclear whether there were more places where this couldve been done ,axiomverge,cs6abmw,4,t5_2wscp
