2379275,0,t1_cm5s10a,Fair enough.One topic I realize I did forget to cover is that of universal tool dealers in each town. Lets be honest every groupguild wants to livereside in their own towns and the majority of tool dealers in other towns are either missing entirely or pretty lackluster in what they offer. I very rarely need to buy potions or traps or bwings but some classes will end up using high amounts of gems and some classes would probably really like it if they didnt have to constantly travel to comodo or lighthalzen for berserk pots and Im willing to bet that new players wont know that some classes even have the option of something better than Awakening Potion.,ggRO,cm5sc8r,1,t5_34ikg

2399561,0,t1_cm895k1,Which is why MVP cards need to stay at x with no BBG. But lets say the ideal happens and within  months all these cards show up in game. Only  are gamebreaking so keep them out of WoE and BG. Problem solved? ,ggRO,cm8al36,1,t5_34ikg
2405710,0,t1_cm91jtr,The only work around would be using the in game Mail system which is annoying since you can only send  item at a timeyou can send stacks of pots and stuff but only  equip per mail Also wasnt even introduced until episode  so we wouldnt even have access to it immediately. So unfortunately the only workaround is  a trustworthy friend or a second computerunless they are blocking multiclients by ip?.,ggRO,cm91z6h,1,t5_34ikg
2405774,0,t1_cm91p3j,I dont know how to use Reddit formatting so please forgive me on how I am about to respond. Assassin Cross Card I personally do not care about that but I do understand the viewpoint of it ruining the uniqueness of assassin.GTB Yes I do believe the pros of the card completely outweigh the cons.Maya P I wasnt trying to put those in the same tier as Maya P. I was just trying to say there are alternatives.FBH Yes this card is really strong and I can see why people would be upset with it because wizards can do extremely high AoE damage with it. The main problem with it is that people would be feeding SP items to the wizard or whoever the user is of the card. So I can completely understand why people wouldnt want it.Thanatos Card Yes you are most likely right about it being after trans. and I meant useless in pretrans because most people wouldnt have high defense. Honestly I dont know episode progression very well but that was a mistake. During trans timeperiod it will be strong but it wouldnt put me off of the server.,ggRO,cm929g8,1,t5_34ikg
2417818,0,t3_2n5a1f,Bug?  Doing mi at orc archer shows it drops Orc archer bow older than this patch. Dunno if it drops it but its possible maybe other drops have the same issue. Maybe its a bug too not sure but arrow crafting with red blood gives  arrows and with wind of verdure gives Suggestions  Multilvl on  The endure on the mobs its obnoxious and they didnt use to have it. I would remove it if you are looking for old experience.   Make an option in the warper to be able to warp to dungeons once uve been therepaying a good amount more expensive to towns and maybe same to towns.,ggRO,cmajuaf,1,t5_34ikg

2786713,0,t1_cnktull,You could always make your own hunter for that. Besides that I dont see why people are whining its unbalanced. Its like saying nerf TU because it one hits anubis. Nerf assassin because it can cloak and hide and kill huge mobs. Nerf GC because crusader too tanky and can heal.,ggRO,cnku88n,-2,t5_34ikg
