519013,0,t3_1zwcfo,Lucky! We were supposed to get her but she got worried about crossing the border and cancelled. Edit Anah aka Hoopalicious was my favorite workshop. Although I am currently taking my rd Hoop Path with Baxter. I love them both. ,Hooping,cfz9krq,1,t5_2sgxx

567522,0,t3_20lnxe,I have an LED hoop from Cosmic Hooper! I chose him based on the reviews I saw in a few places the fact that it has a wall charger instead of batteries and because he could fully customize the colors. Rob was awesome to work with. He was very responsive and helpful and I had a LOT of questions throughout the ordering process. I think my hoop arrived about three weeks after I ordered it so delivery time was also quite good.The hoop itself is gorgeous! The colors are amazing and just what I ordered. The charge seems to last for a good amount of time though I mostly use it in small sessions rather than long ones. As for durability I cant really comment too much on that since its only a couple months old and its winter where I live so Ive had limited hooping opportunities but so far so good.One thing I should say and you probably know this already if youve read the same reviews I did is that the hoop is a bit on the heavy side. I actually like a bit of heft though and to be fair I did order the midsize tubing knowing I wanted battery life more than lightness.I hope this helps! If you have any other questions let me know!,Hooping,cg4s6j2,1,t5_2sgxx

725443,0,t1_cgmqhje,Also turning the direction the hoop is spinning gives you much more time and means that part of the hoop is in contact with that portion of skin for longer allowing you to maximize your time while doing it,Hooping,cgmqipx,3,t5_2sgxx

1318436,0,t1_cihvuy2,Thanks for the tips. Im trying my best to stay patient with myself! Its tough seeing others shoulder hoop so gracefully and not be able to do it as well! I will try bending over and recording myself tonight to see if that helps. Thank you!,Hooping,cihxvxs,2,t5_2sgxx
1323529,0,t3_297zqt,Nice so beautiful and fun! Did you learn most of your tricks in person by video or just by trial and error? How long have you been a dancer before picking up the hoop?,Hooping,ciiiigt,2,t5_2sgxx

2430368,0,t3_2nbdp5,Exercise hoops will bruise you. I suggest finding a beginner hoop from a shop on etsy just search for beginner hula hoop. The diameter of the hoop should be the length from your belly button to the floor. Not trying to get you less excited but if your goal is to hoop dance exercise hoops arent really good for that. ,Hooping,cmc3mmf,4,t5_2sgxx

2966503,0,t3_2u4xbd,I definitely agree with your title statement! When I hoop I enter a meditative state. The mind shuts off and you retreat to intuition. You and the music move together in synchronization without thinking. And  hours pass and I realize I hadnt had any thoughts at all.,Hooping,co5b1ye,2,t5_2sgxx

3784878,0,t3_33ql0r,Youre going to want to downsize fairly soon no matter what. Id get a  to start and once youre moving forward make that your loaner hoop. I still bring out my  with me so if someone asks I can show them the way.I would also recommend making your first few hoops and then finding your perfect flow size and going all out on that. You can get irrigation tubing for dirt cheap and sand the inside for grip or drop the  for some gaffer tape at a guitar shop. The connectors are under  each and the pipe cutters are under  IIRC. This way you can make a bunch change sizes quickly and spend about the same as you would for a decked out hoop.,Hooping,cqnpeqc,1,t5_2sgxx
3936805,0,t3_35hjym,Shoot I just started hooping this month too and I wish I could move it up my body.. Really good at dropping it though!Google the elevator trick on YouTube. Its pretty easy and I only sack myself in the face like  Good luck!!!,Hooping,cr513ui,1,t5_2sgxx
4125281,0,t1_crqd73w,I did the same thing while waiting for an hdpe in the mail thats taking longer to ship than it took my polypro.  just starting hooping.  I got my polypro from hoopnerd on etsy though.  Theres a girl on Instagram  body.mind.hoops I think?  Im not sure her webpage on the top of my head but she makes some awesome reflective hoops.  Once I get better I think Ill try her out of her prices are decent for some fancy hooping.  I can grab her webpage and double check her ig tag if youre interested ,Hooping,crqi9nk,1,t5_2sgxx
4127345,0,t1_crqqggw,Heres a bit older of a picture of my costume! Its changed a little. For walking around I usually keep my mask on my belt which now has an latex axe that I weathered the heck out of and an actual dagger thats pretty small. The sword was my sisters so I dont have that anymore since I was only using it for the photoshoot right after I made it. My beltweapons would obviously have to come off. I was thinking of trying to make a backholster that can hold both my ace and my hoop so it would be easy to come off and still functional!  I also have a dragon puppet thats going to be pretty annoying to take on and off but I couldnt dream of going to the faire without him! But I go there to meet people and hang out so spending a few minutes to put down my dragon so I can enjoy myself wont bother me one bit. Meet Malikai! I also have a smaller black and white dragon who usually sits in whatever bag I have or on the shoulder of a friend. ANYWAY I found some nice Harem pants that I want to buy and maybe make a new version of my costume. For Hoopa Id be doing a gypsylike outfit with harem pants anyway. I actually already have a pair picked out I dont have a sewing machine right now boo. All I need to find is a nice top accessories and a wig and Im pretty much good to go. But the con isnt until next year IF we can even get tickets for it. I want the outfit regardless just for hooping so wigs and horns will be a later purchase of course. For the rings around the horns I was thinking of just some thick gold bangles or something. I actually have a ring on the horns for my Faire costume. The shape of Hoopas horns should keep them on unless I do some serious hooping which I hope by then Id be much better! A much less complicated outfit too so more jumping and spinning yay! Theres an anime convention in my city I think in July? I wish Id be able to put everything together and get better at hooping by then. Im just going for one day. Its pretty small but Ive never been to an anime Con. Ill have to ask my bf when it is maybe Ill try to throw it together anyway. I can just walk around doing isolations and isopops haha. LOOK INTO MY HOOPS NERDS. Edit Also heres the hoop i ordered! My friend ordered one from the same shop and got hers already despite ordering after mine but she paid extra for rush shipping so she could take it on vacation with her. So jealous I just want my hoop! Also for Hoopa theres a store I found through instagram mind.and.body.hoops that sells beautiful mirrorreflective hoops. So I figured I would either get a gold one through her or a similar store. ONE DAY I WILL LED HOOP AND FIRE HOOP. One day. lt,Hooping,crqqpty,1,t5_2sgxx

11497569,0,t3_62peh8,Go to Home Depot but some PVC and a cutter and get the appropriate sized insert connector. You can get a bunch of supplies for under  and make yourself new sizes as you learn! Ill find the instructable if youre interested but basically you . make a circle with the tubing so it goes about to your belly button . cut it to size . Dip one end in boiling waterto soften it . Insert connector . Boil the other end . Join hoop togetherI can find the tubing size specifics if youd like. I made a TON of these when I was a beginner to have biggersmaller size options I got fun tapes I even gave them away at festie. ,Hooping,dfz8z45,1,t5_2sgxx
