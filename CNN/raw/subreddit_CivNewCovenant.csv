Realistically it would take a person about that long to replant it all if theyre harvesting the whole thing at once. Unless its going to be botted  in which case its effectively a private farm clay doesnt pay off because its growing faster than you can work the farm.,CivNewCovenant,cf2rtfb,1,t5_2xizz

381270,0,t1_cfk92a1,Yeah Ill fix it up soonish. I need to redownload a bunch of stuff before I start doing more than tree farming thoughI feel naked without radar and journeymap. I need to track down some spruce. If they ever get around to making trees persistent we can have an awesome farm in the tundra but its a little tricky to find mass quantities of it for me right now.,CivNewCovenant,cfka8a5,3,t5_2xizz
