1378337,0,t3_29mkud,I would say just knowing your voice is the short answer.  I grew up doing strange voices and accents so I know what kinds of voices I am capable of and I know what kinds are out of my ability.   And you would be surprised at what you are capable of.  I have typically very low voice but I can do some crazy sounding voices.  It also depends on the work.  For example there is a character in a narration work I do who is effectively an  year old girl.   Now Im sure my falsetto sounds exactly what you might expect....a deep voiced guy trying to voice a young girl...however in that context of a narration it is what it is.  For that kind of long narration with a bunch of different characters it is more about giving the character life than sounding exactly like a childs voice.  The same doesnt apply if the voice is say for child character in a video game where it would be completely out of place and stand out like a sore thumb.,VoiceActing,cip268b,1,t5_2r878

The others felt a bit more put on.Overall to be honest the whole reel kind of felt like one note. Minor variations on the same theme accent take aside. You have a great sophisticated sound which is awesome for financial cars watches technology etc. But I wanted to hear your range!I would love to hear your gentle caring voice charity work your upbeat hip voice teen products your guy next door voice soft sell products your cocky voice trucks and beer and your radio call voice Jack FM!. I guess it will boil down to what type of work you are looking to do but I would seriously consider adding some dimension to the reel.Hopefully this is helpful!

3133147,0,t3_2w03tu,Nice setup!  Like unoblesonmusic said sometimes its nice to have that natural echo in the recording.  Have you tried soundproofing the whole room itself?

3261734,0,t1_cozv8vk,. The skills needed for animation and video game voice acting are the same as those needed for commercials.  Any chance you get to hone your skills on the mic are worthwhile and will benefit you.  You arent going to find many agents who are interested in someone who doesnt want to take every opportunity to work that theyre given.. Im a bit torn when it comes to voice acting classes.  I briefly taught a class at a friends school but it didnt enjoy it.  I found that most of the students simply werent talented enough to develop into proper voice actors and it was a waste of my time and their money.  That being said the few talented students I had did improve during our time together.  I cant recommend any specific classes for you but Word of Mouth by Susan Blu is a good book about voice acting with a lot of specifics about acting for animation.. The demo is a bit rough.  Id consider doing away with the accented portions until you develop more consistency with them.  Your strength seems to be in the deeper end of your vocal range.  You have nice rich tonality there so Id work on developing characters in that range.,VoiceActing,cp0391t,6,t5_2r878

3852140,0,t3_33sm03,Just my opinion  I dont like the direction Adobe has taken Audition. If you can find an older standalone version for a reasonable price then I recommend doing that if you must have Audition. I prefer Pro Tools and you can find good deals on eBay that include later versions of LE and lots of plugins. Any version of Mbox has Focusrite mic preamps and is absolutely fine for VO work so you can gear up for just a couple of hundred bucks. In fact I saw brandnew  Mbox Pros with the lite version of Pro Tools on Amazon for  not too long ago. Stay away from USB mics if you can avoid it  too much noise and latency. Audacity is free and if you have limited funds I recommend putting what money you have into a decent mic and preamp and then running with a free recording app until you become established. ,VoiceActing,cqvdnvl,2,t5_2r878

The website they host for you is very very cheap like it belongs in the early s on geocities or freewebs.  I ended up not using it and making my own on Squarespace,VoiceActing,d7c92ye,1,t5_2r878

9102164,0,t1_d85ilg7,Unfortunately the entrance period is already over and they only allowed one submission in the first place . Haha yeah speed is definitely a bit of a bitch. When I was going through it it was either too fast or too slow and I thought I found a happy medium but still much to learn on that one! Im flattered youd use my takes as an example though!  Though Id advise to try and do some more vo since you seemed to like it and improve from there and maybe have it as a side thing main job one day! As for more things on your Tough Merc.Feed your family...problem. Pronounce youR more clearlyNot too much to mention other than maybe try and convey the directions a little more clear. Sometimes it feels as if he remembers part way through the line hes supposed to feel a certain way. Though that could just be personal taste. Again best of luck moving forward into voice working!

9200180,0,t1_d8hwehf,Thank You again for taking the time to write this out. I was in a great hurry so my method only consisted of taking the script that was given me reading it in my head then out loud once through.I broke the script into segments and recorded each segment repeatedly ish times until I was satisfied with that segments take. Then stitched them all together in audacity. I then switched gears into video creation. I started taking professional singing lessons about  months ago. I wanted to elevate my singing from decent to something to be proud of. Im all for practice and my instructor tells me its showing or shes blowing smoke up my butt cause ya know she probably wants to keep getting paid.lol Do you know if developing the singing voice would translate any to voiceovers. In my head it seems like it would but I could be very wrong.The primary reason why Im asking for feedback is because a few people have mentioned to me I may have a calling for doing work like this. Its hard sometimes to trust people you work with for constructive feedback because A they might not be qualified enough to have a good opinion B they dont want to rock the boat and C because I did bang the whole thing out in an evening.,VoiceActing,d8i6vgt,1,t5_2r878

9502524,0,t1_d9kb02n,It is a contest. Its more of a thing for fun. Im willing to bet that the number of people who submitted to have it as part of their professional portfolio are waaaaay outnumbered by the people who said HOLY COW I CAN BE IN MASS EFFECT?! Its not like it was advertised as an extra role that only working VAs auditioned for.Im hoping  because it seems like  this is treated as the for fun thing that it is.,VoiceActing,d9ke03v,1,t5_2r878
9576550,0,t1_d9thxu3,I also have a ton of questions especially after I talked to ACX. I listened to the sample that existing narrator did and its something that Ive read. My version has a later date I see so its likely updated. I just hope he didnt break any terms. I wanna push the date back til we figure this out since Saturday is the day or I couldve just not called ACX or sent a message to him and proceeded onward. Edit he said its a different versionedition. And that i could finish it early next week which gives me more time. ,VoiceActing,d9ti76q,2,t5_2r878

Getting the training a kickass demo and then relying on PPs is actually doing yourself a disservice you can make tons more if youre good at marketing.BTW you know that WhisperRooms require more money put into them to get them sounding optimal right?
