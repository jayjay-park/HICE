4769614,0,t3_3g7g8z,Only got through the first chapters.I thought it was nice enough at first but it quickly became extremely boring with all the tests. What was the purpose of reading all that? All the Naruto love was also completely unnecessary at this point in the story. He starts out as a complete idiot and improves over time with hard work and determination.Now we already know he is superawesome and has superawesome chakra and superawesome reflexes and is actually quite intelligent etc.What the hell? Also he is superawesome not only with wind but also earth and fuinjitsu and taijutsu.Completely deflated the story for me at that point but the last straw was the treatment of Sasuke. Instead of making him a complex character and creating a tension of whether he will heal or still defect in this forwantofanailstory we know hes just a sociopath. Oh. No chance of redemption. Sorry youre just evil hope youre evil for us and not against us!Btw your family was inbred! Sorry its a fact! What a great psychologist... shakes headObviously Naruto secretly knew this all along as opposed to canon. How could he not? Hes superawesome!Maybe the story improves later on Im not sure  but this start really turned me off of the story.Most of this I posted previously as a review of the story on fanfiction.net,NarutoFanfiction,ctvr4ji,2,t5_2yhj6

6703830,0,t1_d0bscet,The one story I liked it in was a story I wont name because its a massive spoiler but essentially the final conflict looked unwinnable and by figuring out where Madara got his Rinnegan from Naruto is able to create his own and with it create and use something like a very powerful Rasengan to win sounds cliche but was very wellwritten.The reason it worked was because it wasnt just the Rinnegan that let him win and the Rinnegan was clearly a storyending powerup  basically a sign that says now the protagonist has won.

7086806,0,t3_4cmkoo,My first impression is that there isnt really anything in here that shows me that this is a Naruto fanfic. Thats not such a bad thing in and of itself  something like this could lead into a completely separate novel not tied to the Naruto universe at all.However given that it is submitted as a Naruto fanfic it needs to have something to link it to the genre. By the end of the first chapter I would want it to be clear that its part of the fandom  otherwise as a Naruto fan that wants to read about stuff to do with Naruto there is little to entice me to read further.As others have commented a hint of the plot that is to come should probably have been included as part of what is there to entice more readers. Within the first chapter or at least the first chapter plus the description you need to show people that you have an interesting idea or two that will be explored in your story.After all there is such a large and growing amount of fanfic out there that you need something to entice readers to yours from the rest.,NarutoFanfiction,d1jnnmh,2,t5_2yhj6

He hits the patch of air next to the twigs the twigs and ends up copying Shirous Trace ability.Interesting.

Watching Lee who only has Taijutsu compete with the monster that is Gaara was amazing. And it gave a sense of how powerful both are. Neji vs Naruto. The fight itself was short but had lasting impact on both characters. This fight not only gave neji a different view on life but also showed the change of attitude the village as a whole had for naruto. Gaara amp lee vs Kimimaro Gaara and Lee have become bench mark characters for power levels. We know both are stupidly strong. And it takes both of them to fight Kimimaro.

7865321,0,t1_d3zaiwn,I have a similar approach to starting to read a fic but I have a couple of other personal bugbears as well. First person usually gets shut pretty quickly even though its a valid writing style  it just doesnt seem right for fanfiction in my head. Its already a universe weve observed from third person. Some of the tropes that cause me to usually nope out include neglect harems and bashing. The first two can be somewhat forgiven if the writing style is very good but the third is literally a case of bad writing.I think a lot of the fics Ive read lately have been time travel based and in part thats because it opens up a lot of possibilities to explore. Some do it well others dont. Im super OP because Im from the future and trained for all the years and now Im going to steamroll everyone and have sex with all the older ladies generally gets me to nope out pretty quick but stories which explore the tension of wanting to get back to where they came from or bring back a character that cant just steamroll everything get pretty interesting. Im particularly enjoying Reverse and Pain Hunger and Betrayal at the moment even though the latter features a lot of first person writing.,NarutoFanfiction,d404uhz,3,t5_2yhj6

Then you ranted and said killing intent isnt a thing in naruto. Which is what me and you are arguing about. I dont know much about HxH. But bleach I think killing intent is mentioned once. With kenpachi. And its effect is that ichigo feels like Hes about to be stabbed. Kinda similar to seeing a Kuna in your head. My point is this. Killin intent in naruto is a Canon thing.

7993305,0,t1_d4ed072,Yeah thats a great way to think about it.  Ive always treated chapters as big paragraphs I mean they kind of are as an amalgamation of all of the paragraphs therein and oftentimes its important to transition between paragraphs.  So I sort of extend that to chapters where its important to end a chapter on a particular note so that you can carry on that note in the next one.I love cliffhangers because you end a chapter with heavy suspense and can then know exactly how to start the next one with resolution of said suspense or with more suspense!

8000162,0,t1_d4f9plk,I agree with the first part of your comment and disagree with the second. Naruto definitely gains more tails as he becomes more provoked but the seal limits that really heavily until later on in the story.Naruto already had an experience where he thought Sasuke was killed the bridge fight vs Haku and still didnt lose control enough to kill someone hed only met once. The battle at the end is much closer timewise to that than to the Orochimaru fight so I dont think he could get more than maybe two tails. After the Valley of the End fight Jiraiya teaches him to use the Kyubi chakra opens the seal some more and three years pass and he still doesnt get beyond  tails until after the Pain invasion where the village is destroyed a load of its inhabitants are dead and Hinata confesses her love to him and then appears to be killed right before his eyes.,NarutoFanfiction,d4fals6,1,t5_2yhj6

8273182,0,t3_4sq3fx,Naruto stared up at the dark skinned mustachioed interrogator and his longhaired counterpart with a look of fear and confusion. He really wasnt sure what was going on only that it seemed hed been somehow captured by Kumo nin in his own dingy hotel room with Jiraiya nowhere to be found.Taking stock of his situation his head hurt he was tired and he was bound to the kitchen chair. Oh and he was hungry and the bowl of Ichiraku ramen he vaguely recalled unsealing for breakfast was sitting tantalizingly on the table nearby.And to make matters worse the Kumo nin had somehow discovered What was sealed inside him.Would you care to explain to me why Konohas jinchuriki happens to be in Lightning Country? mustacheman as Naruto now dubbed him casually asked though the hard look in his eyes clearly conveyed how serious he was.Naruto fidgeted in his bounds in a futile attempt to make placating gestures as he started to stammer out erosennins lame cover story a civilian boy and his uncle on a trip to visit relatives before he was silenced by the sharp pain of a kunai being jabbed into his leg. He grit his teeth at the pain but didnt scream. Hed felt much worse after all.Oh Im sorry. Did I break your concentration? I didnt mean to do that. Please continue. You were saying something about being a civilian?Naruto remained silent Not really sure what else to say. Obviously the Kumo nin didnt believe him one bit he wouldnt have either and his reaction to being stabbed confirmed it for him.Whats the matter? Oh you were finished? Oh well allow me to retort. The Kumo nin continued before leaning in closely. What does What look like?Naruto stared at the Kuno nin panic starting to set in. This interrogation was no laughing matter now. Descriptions of the Great Questions were closely guarded village secrets. None could gaze upon their form without going mad but the insight the Questions provided was invaluable to their countrys Kage. Thus jinchuriki were created to contain and channel the secrets of the Great Questions for the benefit of the Hidden Villages.What? was all Naruto answered all he could answer. Even if he werent honorbound to protect the secrets of What he simply couldnt tell him. Most did not understand the true nature of the Questions like a jinchuriki inherently could. They were incomprehensible constantly shifting.The Kumo nin was clearly dissatisfied by his answer as his casual demeanor was washed away by a wave of anger. The table flipped and Naruto watched in dismay as his precious ramen was spilled all over the floor. What country are you from!?What? Now Naruto was legitimately confused more so than before. Didnt the Kumo nin know he was from Konoha? Where was he going with this? Gaara would probably know he mused he was the container of Where after all. Naruto being the container of What widely considered the most powerful of them all.The Kumo nin somehow managed to get even more angry at that reply and was now looming over him.What aint no country Ive ever heard of! Do they speak English in What?What didnt speak English as far as Naruto knew or any language for that matter. It was incomprehensible. All the questions were. It was the reason jinchuriki were required to be a medium for them. So there was really only one way for him to reply to that.What?Apparently that wouldnt fly as the Kumo nin was now it a frothing rage. Naruto couldnt help but sympathize. Hed be pretty angry too if the roles were reversed.English motherfucker! Do you speak it!?Ohhh. Now he was making sense!Yes. He replied tightly as he leaned back away from the Kumo nins invasion of his personal space.Then you know what Im sayin?Yes? he was still pretty confused but yes he could understand his words if thats what he was getting at.Describe what What looks like!What? He already asked him that. What was he asking again for?The Kumo nin clearly wasnt having any more of this as he decided to press his kunai against Narutos throat his longhaired partner still silently observing in the background.Say what again. Say what again! I dare ya. I double dare ya mother fucker! Say what one more Kamidamned time!Clearly he would have to try to explain things another way.Itits a Question? he gulped very conscious of the cold metal of the kunai on his jugular.Go on!He scrambled for something more to say. The Questions could not simply be described at will. They had to flow naturally and only came when they truly needed to be expressed.Its confusing? he tried. It succeeded in merely drawing more of the Kumo nins ire if that were even possible.Does it look like a CRASH!! At that moment the Kumo nin was interrupted by several hundred pounds of armored battle toad and Sannin smashing directly through the ceiling and landing directly on top of him.The Gallant Jiraiya has arrived to save the day!Nartuo was never so glad to see the pervy sage do his ridiculous intro routine. His head was seriously hurting from all this confusion not to mention the tragic loss of his ramen. He let out an immense sigh of relief as the kabuki music played in the background while his mentor hopped around.

8346160,0,t3_4tu5cx,Warning unpleasant descriptions of injury and deathThe village of the leaf was nestled in the lee of a cliff surrounded on the other three sides by pristine forest. The few roads that wound their way under the leafy boughs were the exception to the forests allencompassing embrace that proved the rule. The buildings were piled high reaching upwards instead of sprawling out. Red tile roofs were the main colour visible from above. The other splash of colour in the village was a dark purple looking like a bruise or stain  a rectangle of decay at the heart of a vibrant creature. And in that wound stood six figures three facing three.Hiruzen faced his wayward student while his clones pinned his two predecessors in place. He shuddered as the Death Gods had reached through him and grabbed at Orochimaru. His eyes swam for a moment and then he could see more clearly than he ever had before.Ghosts! All around him walking floating flying dying. The shade of the ANBU whod tried to enter the barrier was the clearest. Over and over his last moments replayed while he screamed in fear and pain. Jump hit the barrier burn die. Elsewhere there were fainter spectres the Sandaime recognized one of them as an infiltrator whod been discovered and made her last stand nearby. The womans intestines were spilling out of her stomach in endless coils and she was trying to stuff them back in while stumbling towards the next roof only to blink back to where shed been wounded every few seconds. The two weeks since her death had made her outline faded like clothes that had been washed too often.There were also some ghosts who were older still. Hazy outlines and not much more they drew the eye when they moved but might just as well have been invisible when they were still. A man clawing at his eyes after a chemical attack. A child impaled on a spear. An old woman riddled with shuriken trying to draw one last desperate breath.In the half a second it had taken the Hokage to see all this hed seized Orochimarus bare soul with his borrowed hand. The icy grip of death was close around him but he could still feel the strange sensation of cold steel sliding through his torso. He knew though with a bonedeep surety that he wouldnt leave his own shade behind. Where he was going noone could see.Im going to do what I should have done all those years ago Hiruzen Sarutobi forced out past the blood flooding his insides. It was spilling out of his mouth and down his front. Orochimarus eyes were wild and looking not at him and not at the Death God but at...Was he watching the ghosts?You fool! Well both die his erstwhile student hissed. Idly Hiruzen wondered if the mans snake experiments had affected his vocal chords or if the speech patterns were intentional.That is the plan. Talking was becoming harder. The strength was leaving him but there was one task left for him on this windy rooftop with birds above him and the sounds of death below. Do you regret?Madman... look at ghosts. I want to live. Any price.Hiruzen chuckled. Then flee not fight. I lack the strength to seal him. But...I hereby pass punishment. You shall be denied your arms for the rest of your unnatural life the Third Hokage of Konohagakure said in a voice that for the last time sounded out strong and clear. With the downward stroke of the Death Gods knife the decision was made and could not be undone. The dead body now no more than meat and bones fell to the ground beside the traitor Sannins furious form. His arms were decaying before his eyes flesh rotting and melting away and bones crumbling. The first bloom of pain from the cut would stay with this body for the rest of its life and the ghosts and ghouls of the dead would accompany his spirit for as long as it remained on this plane. His teacher had managed to pass down one last punishment one last curse before slipping away.,NarutoFanfiction,d5ktn9p,4,t5_2yhj6

8384959,0,t1_d5pntt0,Holy shit. I thought you said you read the fic. The room was as busy as it ever was when the trio made their way into it. Ino was shamelessly flirting with Sasuke in the corner most of her competition having failed to pass the genin exam it seemed. Kiba was talking with some small dog. Choji and Shikamaru were just munching on some chips or sleeping.The only set of two seats available were next to Sasuke. And that was only because Ino was too busy standing in front of him to actually be sitting next to him. Sakura had thought Sasuke was actually cute a couple years ago. But then she realized that Sasuke was like her brother Neji. And Neji was an ass. And therefore Sasuke was like an ass. This meant Sasuke was a dick.Smiling as she leads Naruto to the two seats she set him down at the end while she took the one between him and Sasuke.Hey Sakura what do you think youre doing? Ino said before Sakuras bottom even touched the seat. Thats my spot.I dont see your name on it Ino. Sakura shot back as she finished sitting down.You didnt even look! Ino growled as she began to stomp her way up to Sakura. Sakura smiled as she activated her Byakugan. Nope no name. She smiled as Ino got within two meters of her. Frilly underwear Ino?Inos face went bright red. You You Ino stuttered as her blood froze. She looked frantically at Sasuke who simply raised an eyebrow at her. That was more emotion that she got out of him in fifteen minutes of talking. Pervert! Ino yelled slapping Naruto hard across the face before stomping away. Thats all ino was mentioned in my fic. And here. Sad thing that it was Hinata may very well be the closest thing to a friend Sakura had. Hinata. Somebody who Sakura hates. Is the closest thing she has to a friend besides Naruto. I admit. Sakura becomes friends with Ino after she puts the girl in a coma. But where the fic is right now. In the first chapter. Theyre barely aquaintances. But no they didnt start out as friends. And yea. More of Sakuras past will be revealed in time. ,NarutoFanfiction,d5po2g8,1,t5_2yhj6

8683950,0,t3_4yvwuc,I kind of did something different as I think it is a fascinating and often less explored discipline in the Narutoverse. I also think a lot of authors butcher it with their outlandish summons and hand out Sage Mode like its candy. No contracts with fantastical or mythical creatures no dragons etc. Summoning clans must be composed of real animals or creaturespreferably with them or a species naturally occurring in Asia. Caveat animals who have been warped or mutated by chakra into something unnatural ex. Pains selfreplicating multiheaded dog. Contracts are exactly that a contract. Summons serve their summoner when called upon and the summoner serves their summons when needed. I dont understand why all these powerful animal clans would serve ninja for no reason or benefit to themselves. Summoning clans exist in the physical world and have their own society separate from humanity which includes conflict. The flies wage war against the spiders because they are natural enemies etc. Summoners are recalled to help their summons fight these battles. Whilst everyone has the ability to enter into a contract few do as the summoning clans are looking for specific unique or otherwise powerful individuals to represent them and serve their agenda most average ninja to not have the chakra needed to call upon the larger more powerful creatures which relegates them to small noncombat support or auxiliary creatures which are inherently less useful for combat. Most ninja do not see the benefit of having to serve a summoning clan when the summons they call upon are not explicitly useful or powerful. Summoning clans have innate knowledge of how to access and use natural chakra but not all know how to teach this ability to humans. Only an exceedingly rare few are able to teach humans to become Sages. Sage Mode in addition is less of an ability and more of a state of being. Sages dont just use natural chakra they become attuned with it. ,NarutoFanfiction,d6r4b5y,9,t5_2yhj6

8757326,0,t3_5010if,Crossovers arent bad just make sure that its plausible.One thing that irritates me about most crossovers is they usually start with Naruto as a kid getting beaten until unconscious and then making a deal with Kurama and winding up in the new world. The other options are either Hiraishin Seals and RasenganChidori clash.Ive seen all of these enough to be able to skip through it without missing anything.Next make sure that the story is going to go somewhere. It would be pretty pointless to have a story thats going to go nowhere after a point.

8854170,0,t1_d7c4rly,gt I reluctantly chose the name Hiro. I really like the name but I know it might bother others because of the pun. It makes me cringe a little but its the name I like the most so I settled on it. The others I liked were Akira Ryuichi and Satien.The name is decent but I recently read a short story The Sword of Good that had the protagonists name as Hiro in a world where everything is named like that e.g. the Prophecy of Destiny goes as follows A new Lord of Dark shall arise over Evilland commanding the Bad Races and attempt to cast the Spell of Infinite Doom.  The LongLost Heir wielding the Sword of Good shall kick Evils ass. so I was quite aware of that sort of thing.gt And sorry for overusing the whore joke. I remember reading it on the Tsundere Kiba post and thought it was funny so I decided to do the same.No worries. Id been meaning to say something about it for a while and this just happened to be an opportunity.gtAnd I thought I said he was attempting the shadow clones which is what punched Iruka? Which is why there was only one but it looked retarded and didnt do anything remotely valuable.I thought Iruka asked him whether hed learned the Shadow Clone and he said no? Also it only showed him learning sensing iirc. I might have misread or misunderstood that part then.gtAlso you didnt seem to criticize the last part of my story with his moms trial and his conversation with the hokage.At that point I wasnt as invested in the story and there wasnt much to pick up on in terms of criticism that I hadnt already said. The general Konoha bashing and the types of grammar issue didnt really change so I didnt feel like there was much more to say other than maybe heres another example of an issue I pointed out earlier.In terms of constructive things to do i.e. what helped me personally write better  read real fiction. Anything published has minimal mistakes and youll pick up better grammar and writing techniques by osmosis. Also read a few bashfics until you recognise it in your own writing. Lastly reread the early parts of canon. The later parts are completely different in tone characterisation and style. Something I noticed in myself was that after I read too much fanfic I had a very distorted view of early canon.Good stuff to read online as in not published but with good writing anyway I always love to plug Worm a rational superhero story.

I also tried reading slash recently due to some of your comments but couldnt because most of the stories focused solely on the slash and even had most of the cast becoming gay. So I am biased.                                                    gtWho gets turned into a girl is irrelevant the point is that in a genderbent situation you wouldnt pretend that they were just good friends.You are right on that one but the fact is that neither one is female and there are no romantic overtones between them Kishi can barely write regular romance whatsoever something nuanced like this. While we normally associate the kind of devotion Naruto has for Sasuke  to romantic feelings fraternal ones can also be quite strong especially in a easter setting.I believe it may be either because Kishi sacrificed characterization for he sake of plot or because of cultural differences regarding familial bonds between east and west.I do have  a headcannon regarding the whys involving Narutos externalizing his view of his life but normally I just attribute it to Asura subcouncious desire to save his brother Indra from himself that survived through their many lives which is condizent with the themes of Karmic Cycles.,NarutoFanfiction,d7w4ja1,2,t5_2yhj6

9531364,0,t3_5bedj7,Over the last three days Sasuke had come to define his life by three things his traitorous brother his inadequate strength and this. Glancing over from his spot on the ground he saw the same terrible horrifying annoying sight that had come to haunt him scarlet hair floating like nine tails in the wind and angry violet eyes like those of a vengeful god. And yet for all the womans anger she had a grin so wide  so annoying  on her face that it made him grimace.Shes definitely his mother he thought. A loud yell ended his reflections as the woman shouted over and over How could you? Why me? Why my son?!And then shed stop. Shed look at him closely and  dare he say it  fondly and her face would light up in that terrible grin again. Oh I cant stay mad at you! What would Mikoto think? Shed be so proud of you after all youre just so adorable! Not as adorable as my son of course. Thats no surprise though I was always better looking than her dattebane!She never stopped. Always switching back and forth furious one moment gushing the next. Anything would be better than this. Tsukuyomi? No problem. Narutos incessant boasting? Easy. Listening to this woman nonstop? Hed rather carve out his own Sharingan.Eyes once again alight with fury her incorporeal form strode toward his spot on the training field determined to make him repent for his sins. And oh how he wished he could change things. How he wished he could go back and change the day that was quickly becoming his biggest regret. It should have been a happy day. His graduation from the Academy was meant to be joyous  one step closer to killing Itachi! Yet like the rest of his life someone had managed to mess it up.How could you steal my sons first kiss?!Oh how he wished he could go back and kill the person whod bumped Naruto into him.,NarutoFanfiction,d9nxvu5,12,t5_2yhj6

9575973,0,t3_5buz8b,Youve reminded me since Ive been trying to assemble a list of the best fics Ive read in the fandom but Id like to finish some more highly regarded stories before sharing it.As this thread demonstrates people have different expectations from fanfiction and going by whats popular on ffnet whats good is ultimately what people enjoy reading. Most responses are a subjective standard revolving around avoiding pet peeves. However if you add an objectively before good  then good fanfiction is just good writing. That means judging it by criteria like on my working list plot characterization and dialogue worldbuilding action and technical writing. That also means I agree with uAneurysmIncoming that black and white restrictions are irrelevant because what matters objectively is execution.But that also brings us back to fanfiction as an outlet for readers desires. Writers mold the original world into their own subjective interpretation and readers need to have an interest in that expression. Even if someone writes a truly touching tale of love and loss in Naruto someone whos only looking for action might never take the first step in that direction.,NarutoFanfiction,d9tfn4d,1,t5_2yhj6

9813089,0,t3_5fkjml,Strengths? Well I dont have any problem with writing too little half the time. My plots are usually complicated and interesting enough to hold someones attention and I write some decent cliffhangers. Ive got a decently sized vocabularyskill with SPAG and a pretty solid pop culture reference repertoire with which I can pull from so that gives me the ability to write pretty okay metaphors and similes and other figurative bits of language.But Im very longwinded when I write my scenes are disjointed and dont really follow each other well and I have an issue with perfectionturnedI dont give a shit anymoreism. My foreshadowing is far too nuanced sometimes and I really dont have a clue what Im doing half the time to be completely honest.

10042682,0,t3_5ji8pr,I would really like to see a fic that carries out this premise in a sophisticated manner but if Im being completely serious this will never happen.Creation of all things is literally the most powerful technique in the naruto universe. It is the pinnacle of yinyang manipulation. The technique is powerful enough to control the very fabric of realty. A character who can use this technique is on the level of a god. Only people like Kaguya and the sage of six paths are able to use this technique. And this is exactly the problem people are probably going to give Naruto or a complete random a technique that requires complete mastery over yinyang straight off the bat. Not only does it remove almost every potential conflict in the manga and therefore the plot but it will presumeably become a powerwank.It would not make any sense if some random or our loveable MC could utilise a technique that is in all essence the unlitmate Ninjutsu straight off the bat. It will eliminate the plot after a few chapters of exploring creation of all things. The fanfic would die because of a lack of plot.If the character that can use this technique has experienced extensive and intensive training or mastered the theory of Chakra Im completely fine with that. But lets be honest when will that ever happen?,NarutoFanfiction,dbgl5pc,4,t5_2yhj6

10286160,0,t1_dc12nl5,I couldnt make it much farther than chapter .The entire idea of the prank was dumb and the premise of Naruto was actually prodigious hes just been foiled by the incredibly elaborate misteachings of his academy teachers! is far too played out. It was played out in  it was played out in  when this was published and its definitely past played out now. The only thing it accomplishes is making everyone look like an idiot. It makes the Hokage an idiot for not ensuring the village nuke isnt being mistreated. It makes the teachers look like morons for risking their lives on a daily basis just to be petty. And it really makes Naruto look like even more of a complete dumbass if he cant realize hes been singled out by his teachers and let the people in power know.Couldnt stand how long Narutos academy days were being dragged out. Whats the point of all these super cool and totallynotoverpowered clone techniques if hes constantly in the safety of the village?

After HTTYD will only comment a minimum on how that actually happens. The reasons are always bullshit trying to explain it only makes suspension of disbelief less accessible.Starts off in Suna probably journal format still hesitating on thatHiccup overhears about the whole Jinchuuriki thing from a group of scared civilians and decides that hes done this before. Story centers around numerous attempts to train a   year old Gaara. No intention whatsoever to turn Hiccup into a competent fighter in the universe that would pretty much kill his character Clumsy weak against violence nervous listens to his own morality instead of authority etc... pretty much the antininja. Its also what keeps him alive close to Gaara  Shukaku thinks him too pathetic to bother killing. This is why Im hesitant on the journal format Gaaras point of view could be amusing from time to time.Hiccup would look into sealing make a science out of the art and get quite apt at it with the purpose of further understanding Gaaras situation. Uses seals to create a number of major improvements for the civilian population. The butterfly effect to keep it interesting would stem off an improved economic situation in Suna.Ive considered doing the story in Konoha instead as it would give a more solid base to build upon. Would make it easier to write in the long run. My concerns are that Naruto does not fit the role quite as well as Gaara so exaggeration of character would be necessary something I dont like doing. Also the contrast to Berk is even greater in Suna. The first contact scenes would make for a very easy light start for the story.Again any feedback is appreciated!,NarutoFanfiction,ddgiqdr,1,t5_2yhj6

11111367,0,t1_derepaf,gtYou are implying these countries do that because its the right thing to do and ethics and morals and all that good stuff well you would be wrong.I think if we go down this path were going to end up in a bit of a chicken vs. egg scenario. I think you can definitely say that by raw dispassionate costbenefit calculus you could make a very solid argument that a lot of modern day countries that mostly buried the proverbial hatchet did so because the benefits of peace outweighed the benefits of war. I would also claim that my argument that a lot of these countries legitimately no longer have any real popular desire to go to war with one another and probably would abstain from doing so even if there were a scenario in which it would be clearly beneficial is pretty valid. You could argue that this is a social shift engendered by the change in the basic underlying realpolitik being a conquering nation is no longer profitable or beneficial so people stop perceiving themselves as conquerors or you could say that the change in political structure is a result of changing social attitudes towards war. I think probably the most nuanced and correct answer is its both. We never really see what benefits the ninja attain from waging war on one another either though. Resources? What are they spent on when ninja seem to be paid directly from mission prices by the clients? People? I guess but recruiting from defeated enemies always carries a certain risk. I guess really what it comes down to is prestige and maybe bloodline limitssecret techniques and there are theoretically social structures that could be put in place to compete over those things nonviolently. Ultimately I just dont really see what it is about the Narutoverse that makes it inherently unsuited for peace? ,NarutoFanfiction,dergprg,4,t5_2yhj6
11135088,0,t1_dettubh,I like the fact that you see the errors in your own work. These scenes that you have shown me didnt catch my attention at first. Even though Im looking for advice I was about to throw away your reply simply because it was too much writing and it didnt look very useful.What kept me writing however is that you acknowledge that you would isnt as good as you remembered it to be.You helped me realise something in my work. When I first started writing I told myself I would never describe something unless it added depth to my story. Over the years of writing i think I forgot about that but I see it now in your writing. You might be describing just as much as me but your words have a depth that Ive forgotten. They make you forget that their are words there to read and instead your mind drifts away into the emotions flowing through your mind.That seems like an excellent writing tool thank you for helping me to remember it,NarutoFanfiction,deu5gly,2,t5_2yhj6

11150998,0,t1_devxt98,True that often helps when you arent trying I find that you effectively make a better dialogue.I absolutely hate it when people come back to you on a scene and say they found a particular event funny when you were writing it with the intention to be scary or otherwiseI had a scene where my character was being threatened by the Hokage and his home was being watched. He felt like he was going to find an Anbu team in his home ready to kill him when he got back. It was dead frighting....But people respond. That scene was so funny I wish I could be there to see the look on his face,NarutoFanfiction,devyc7a,1,t5_2yhj6

11315022,0,t3_61hlhc,Without going too indepth I really like the sound of this AU and could see it being successful. People love Minato. People love Konan. Hokage!Kushina is simply badass. As for whether I enjoy these type of divergences it depends on one thing how well the author manages to incorporate and clearly show the far reaching consequences. Often these stories fall into the trap of something changing Naruto doing something cool and then... nothing. Everyone in the story treats the event like it didnt happen and we never see the effects. You however seem to have put a good amount of thought into what this change would cause as well as the farreaching effects. Thats the main reason I believe this idea has potential. Even a lame idea can be successful if presented well and it just so happens that your idea is already pretty cool.,NarutoFanfiction,dfejftv,13,t5_2yhj6

11795128,0,t3_68agoi,Lady Tsunade? Shizune asked with a light knock on her door frame. Tsunade lay on her bed with one arm over her eyes to block the light stopping her from enjoying an afternoon nap it was a simpler solution than getting up and closing the blinds. Yes Shizune?The words came out bitchier than she would have liked. I umm I have something you should take a look at. Shizune stepped into the room though she remained near the door frame. Likely because she knew what day it was and was well aware of Tsunades command that she didnt want to be disturbed. And what could that be? Tsunade groaned and sat up on the bed looking older than she ever had before hell she felt older. She needed a drink maybe if she kept drinking shed never have to deal with a hangover again. Shizune stepped forward and handed her a small book with a teal cover the color reminded her of her grandfathers necklace. the title   The Snail princess and the Frog knight raised so many flags she nearly dropped it. But it was the cover art that caused her grip to tighten. A near exact portrait of herself was smiling warmly she wore her grandfathers necklace and had her hand clasped over anothers hand. Behind her stood a tall man with a large face and a mane of white hair. He held her like a lover would. It was Jiraiya there was no doubt about it. Kakashi says the writing style is the same as well. As Jiraiyas that is. Shizune explained she looked ready to exit quickly or hug her. And he said that umm your umm... breast measurements are in there as well. Tsunade felt her heart beat quickened. She opened the first page and found the publisher. Shizune pack our things. Were going to find out where this came from. XXXXThey followed the paper trail for what seemed like months trying to find out where this book came from. Tsunade stared at the small seaside shack that blended so well into its surroundings she would have walked past it were it not for the strong scent of curry and booze. The locals had said that the shack was inhabited by a kindly sage of a man that had pulled out from the river. He was well liked and a great help and a wonderful story teller. The only reason he lived out of town was because he preferred the view. She knocked on the door lightly. She could already feel the tears welling in her eyes. This had to be it. She couldnt take a let down right now. Whatever hope she had yet to spend in this life was riding on this moment. Her assumptions had to be true. There was no answer and she knocked louder. I heard you the first time! A raspy broken voice wheezed out a shout. It was more like a loud whisper. It sounded almost nothing like how Jiraiya once sounded who was just plain loud. But still there was something about it. The door slid open and Tsunade gasped. The man gasped. For a moment they just stood their with their mouths opened and tears flooding their eyes. As one they spoke. Its you. It was Jiraiya. He lacked his face make up and was missing an arm and his throat had a nasty scar along it but it was Jiraiya. They both walked forward and hugged each other. I cant believe youre alive. Tsunade felt herself smile for what seemed like the first time in forever.I... Jiraiya began his voice shattered and weak. I know you youre in my dreams I wrote a book about you and me. But I never thought you were real do you know who I am?Tsunade gasped and pulled away from him. It was Jiraiya his eyes said as much they held the same love that she had been a fool for not seeing that he always looked at her with. She smiled at him and whispered. Dont worry I can fix that it felt so alone without you.Jiraiya smiled and pulled her in tight with his one strong arm. Well then I can fix that. ,NarutoFanfiction,dgx0nbd,16,t5_2yhj6
