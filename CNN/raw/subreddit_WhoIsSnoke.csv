8100228,0,t1_d4qiys6,Yeah star wars is extremely rich in lore though most of it has been made noncanon by Disney. However holochrons in particular have always been used as repositories for the teachings of past Jedi or Sith. While Jedi holochrons where almost always used solely to preserve knowledge sith holochrons meanwhile where also used as components to weapons temples and other devices typically acting as keys to unlock doors or in the case of the one we see in rebels activating a weapon of mass destruction. The knowladge within holochrons however is almost always mystical and related to the Force. Granted holochrons have been known to include more practical knowledge but its always related to being a Jedi or Sith in some form and is typically instructions for using lightsaber forms or force powers. Holochrons essentially preserve the philosophical teachings and practical force knowledge of the Jedi or Sith who created them and I cannot recall a holochron ever having scientific or technological knowledge contained within though I could be wrong on this as Im hardly the biggest Star Wars Lore nut on the planet.,WhoIsSnoke,d4qjedj,2,t5_3ev6b
