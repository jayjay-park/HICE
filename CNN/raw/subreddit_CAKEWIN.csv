1365501,0,t3_29nsm8,What an adorable cake!  It makes me want to host a baby shower    BTW if you ever get a request for a portion to be vegan again there are quite a few different methods and recipes for vegan fondant out there.  They probably wont be quite the same as your nonvegan fondant but you could give them a try so you dont have to break with your theme.   ,CAKEWIN,cingdxx,1,t5_2qoxe

1733468,0,t1_cjxn2mk,you dont taste the store bought fondant one bit. the mmf overpowers the taste. But the new decorator preferred wilton fondant actually doesnt taste bad. You can use any brand of store bought fondant youd like cause the end product is all the same but wilton is the cheapest route which means you can make so much more for less money. ,CAKEWIN,cjxo296,2,t5_2qoxe

3482991,0,t1_cpp4cyy,I am a professional pastry chef but weddingfancy cakes are not generally part of my job I work in restaurants mainly.  For  years I did have my own bakery and for that I had to do wedding cakes.  All of my decorating skills were simple very few hand molded flowers since I prefer the real ones.  Over the years I have learned to make some by hand and others by piping and I did most of this by using books.  Also I took a few short classes on decorating mainly flower work.  When you want to learn a skill it is amazing what you can accomplish simply by practicing.  Keep up the good work you seem to be on the right track!,CAKEWIN,cppabhk,2,t5_2qoxe
