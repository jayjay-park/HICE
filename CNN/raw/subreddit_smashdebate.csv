2073619,0,t1_cl3561u,Axe places hella high in most tourneys he goes in and he doesnt use any of the  viable characters you use. Low tiers require more skill in Melee I prefer that to everyone gets combos free in PM. I do like that they have some brawl shit like Quick Attack Canceling but most of the brawl aspects of the game just slow it down.,smashdebate,cl3ehxl,2,t5_2z7vj
3021513,0,t3_2urtze,During events like APEX EVO Smash  release etc. there is a bit of a lowering of moderation standards but there are some things we still strictly follow. Usually we allow hype threads for hype moments at tournaments but only one thread for each hype moment.People who agree with an opinion or are hyped for a particular match are likely to upvote ALL posts written on that topic instead of picking one. It creates a huge flood on the frontpage where we have  or more posts on the same exact thing. In this case we step in and choose one post. Its a good middle ground.In this case it was a bit different than normal. I let so many threads slide past because ultimately it is a good message that generally results in a renewed effort for people to be positive and accepting. Weve seen it before well see it again. At this point things were taking a strange turn though. The community has started turning on itself the word toxic has been thrown around so many times its lost all meaning. Ive seen this happen in other communities such as Dota  and LoL where the self deprecating circlejerk is more pervasive and degrading than any actual toxic behavior certain members might engage in. At this point the exercise in positivity turns sour and so theres no point in going further.Beyond that what discussion is there to really be had on the topic of Lets all be more accepting of one another? The message has been received so many times that its a meaningless gesture. The first topic was important but the th? What value does a th person coming forward and calling for acceptance really bring to the community or to the sub?Among my duties on the sub I am a content curator. When there is an imbalance of content on the front page then we end up with situations where large portions of this diverse community feels underrepresented. The sheer amount of people who thanked me for putting an end to these redundant topics speaks for itself. This isnt censorship. This isnt a power trip. This is what it means to be a moderator.,smashdebate,cob6dzn,9,t5_2z7vj
4075429,0,t3_2uf4nz,I dont Robin or Ike would change drastically. Marth could be different since there was Shadow Dragon and the Mystery of the Emblem DS remakes which fleshed out his storyline a lot more. That in turn would change Lucinas move set as well.The one thing that would change is Fire Emblems debut in North America would be WAY different. Since theres no Melee theres no Marth or Roy in a major Nintendo title which puts less emphasis on Advance Wars and porting Fire Emblem to North America which would mean that the earliest FE game wed possibly get would be Fire Emblem If DS release June  in Japan...weird.,smashdebate,crktput,1,t5_2z7vj

5749032,0,t1_cx9lw44,gt Brawl is a fundamentally poorly designed game. Smsh is also equally poorly designedIm guessing you have really high standards then.  Then again Ive seen plenty of Melee fans with these standards.,smashdebate,cx9q1xu,1,t5_2z7vj
6375396,0,t3_3ngrly,I dont think the hardcoretechnical side of it is dumb just the unofficialness of it. I prefer Melee over PM any day.,smashdebate,czeb9q7,1,t5_2z7vj
