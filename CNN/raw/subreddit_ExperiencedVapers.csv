1704462,0,t1_cjtykiv,Oh interesting maybe they did? Idk Ive seen them available at a few different places Ive been even recently so maybe the shops are just clearing their stock in favor of vtcs? Regardless Ill be migrating away from the mnkes within a couple weeks anyhow I want to try a centiohm build for shits n giggles and the mnkes dont have a pulse rating high enough for that  or is it not advised to go below a . ohm build on an  regardless of pulse rating? Im still kind of new to mechanicals so Im not familiar on the technicalities of  vs  and their limits...,ExperiencedVapers,cju0ck5,1,t5_32993
1816188,0,t3_2f5tak,Let me clarify. So the way you set up an auto dripper is pretty straight forward. You build a single or dual coil depending on what type of Genesis style atomizer you have and you wick it with cotton preferably Japanese cotton but no qualms if you prefer something else. The trick is to optimize flavor you dont use a lot of cotton. You want the cotton to be evenly distributed on the top of the deck. For reference measure it so that the cotton comes around the center pin. ,ExperiencedVapers,ck817t5,2,t5_32993

2164038,0,t1_cleu3d0,Yeah Im not really in either the authenticsonly or the authentics are for suckers camp.  Ive got plenty of cloned mechs and drippers but I wont really trust a cloned chip without a lot of testingtime out in the market.  This seemed like a really interesting product to me so I picked up one of the early devices.Ive never bought into the current race to high wattage and appreciate companies like Evolv that are making changes that seem like real advancement to me rather than just jacking up wattage.Also now that were looking at a more widespread adoptionuse of nonresistance nickel wire Im trying to stop myself from using that label as it is a bit of a misnomer and can lead to some misunderstandings.  It definitely has some resistance but at room temperature it is very low.  The temperature control is able to work the way it does because the resistance actually changes depending on its temperature.,ExperiencedVapers,clewdno,0,t5_32993
2164324,0,t1_clewdno,Just wait for the SX V to drop. Ridiculous wattage and temperature control blue tooth touch screen support...  DNA always made a decent chip but compared to a similar SX chip it was always a little bit worse. When that drops Ill probably get onto the list for the Zero or something if it isnt .,ExperiencedVapers,clexoun,0,t5_32993

I cant believe I couldnt figure that out. Its a pretty distinct smell lol.,ExperiencedVapers,dafbcmm,1,t5_32993
