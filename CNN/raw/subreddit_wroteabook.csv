3935417,0,t3_35j52v,Imagine a poem of which each verse contained several other poems within itself. Imagine a single autobiographical poem that held within itself the whole of a poets finest body of work so that the poem itself was not as important as the journey through the poets life it led you on from heartbreak and grasping at love for someone unattainable to explorations of sexuality and family history to listening to the whispers of unconventional gurus to the unbridled scream for equal rights to finally capturing a love thats real and the healing that it brings.   My best body of work written over the last six years is grouped and ordered between the verses of Observable Acts.   I would suggest that at least on the first read through one would read everything in order from beginning to end so that they grow along with the speakers experiences by being gently guided along by the overarching poem.ExcerptLessonsThis is a poem for all thoseWho have lovedAnd lostAnd wished to God that they had never loved at all.Ive climbed that mountainFelt the stars at my feetSaw the air below meAnd dove head first into cold concrete.Ive been stripped bareLaid out shivering before a crowd of angelsShown a destiny that was never meant to be mine to holdAnd tasted the blood of the lamb.Love is a lot like religionIt requires faith to growBelief I had plenty ofBut faith never showed.So heres lesson oneNever confuse two.Faith flows in time to music.Belief will leave you blue.Your heart may ache for perfectionBut your soul cries out for grace.Never settle for perfection.Perfection will spit in your face.Love is a realm where smoke hardly ever means fireInstead mirrors are always in bloom.Never miss the opportunity to look at yourselfThis is lesson two.You may be searching for completionSomeone whose soul may melt with yours.Try to steer clear of that illusion.Complete the self firstAnd always love it more.I know what its likeTo lie awake each nightListening to the sounds of your heart breaking.Mine sounds like a frozen lakeUpon springs first awakening.I know what its like alsoWhen sleep finally comesTo dream of the one youve been longing forAnd the feeling the morning afterThat youve been beaten to a pulpBecause dreams arent realityAnd reality swallows you up.So heres lesson threeLet the tears fall easily.Baptize yourself in themAnd never wipe them from your face.The time will comeWhen you will learnTo savor their salty taste.The more you fight the sadnessThe stronger it will growDestroying both the body and mindSo let the tears flow.The hardest lesson of allIve saved for lastIts number fourYou may always love themBut learn to shut the door.Remember your love for all it wasTheir scentThe way your bodies fitBut never harbor fantasiesAnd wipe your hands of it.I know its hard and trust meIve failed at this several times.Ive tried to capture what once wasIve used misdirectionAnd Ive suffered for my crimes.But this I have faith inFaith not beliefRemember lesson oneSometimes the path to truth is found alone.Stand strongAnd it will carry you home.,wroteabook,cr4vf2s,1,t5_2xr1j

6650993,0,t3_46re3c,Buffalo West by Herbert L Hilliard and published by amazon.com is a romance novel of two army scouts and the two women in whom they meet accidentally and take as mates. The outcome is unexpected and is sure to stimulate the readers imagination. It is advised that one should have their boots on and their belts tighten before beginning the first paragraph of this book as its contents are both sexually spicy and sensuously suggestive.

Although Im hooked by the blurb Im not the most avid reader and have shelves of books Id like to read first.However its totally normal for an unknown author to price his first book for as less as . also you should ask your friendsfamily to review it on Amazon the more the better and then promote it after youve gathered the reviews. Its hard to get seen on Amazon and the only way to do that is to make connections and promote directly to people promotion websites that post your book when its on sale barely work for lesserknown booksauthors ,wroteabook,d8mmzqz,1,t5_2xr1j
