6020853,0,t3_3ryhpz,Im not sure. My store is a carhartt dealer in new england id love to be able to sell some of the WIP clothes.. Ill be honest though some are crazy overpriced. Ive only got carhartt in one store and its selling like mad for xmas at the moment. I just wish carhartt did collaborations and limited edition releases like many companies are starting to do I think that would be cool and the hype would be great,Carhartt,cy8uw4i,1,t5_2zk9u
