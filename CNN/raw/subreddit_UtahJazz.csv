2569619,0,t3_2p792q,I try my hardest to go after Millsap. Try to get him back. If we can get him back then look for a trade for Kanter but probably not look to actively trade him. Maybe trade Kanter for Millsap if thats what needed. With the draft... I dont see anyone who will be a franchise changer in this draft.

6493077,0,t1_czqwzdu,Definitely plays a big part.  The starting five all played fairly well for the whole game.  Missing Burke and Burks is a massive loss.  That is  points per game missing that the rest of the team have to make up for.  Given that it was a backtoback game with a tough game against the Bucks the night prior and we were missing Burke here the Jazz were really stretched thin.  That leads to our starters having to play more necessary minutes.  IF Hayward and Hood didnt have big games we lose this one due to our bench not producing for sure.   bench points is abysmal but hey at least it wasnt the  bench points we put up against the Bucks....Snyder does do a good job of offsetting the loss of our bench scorers by keeping at least Hood Favors or Hayward in the game when our bench is out there and man hes done a great job with these rotations.  Im sure you could imagine how quickly a game could take a nose dive with Green CJ Ingles Booker and Lyles only on the court.  We need Burks and Burke badly especially during road stretches.  Im really hoping Burke is going to be good to go when we face Dallas and New Orleans.  ,UtahJazz,czqxkz2,3,t5_2s5f0

8472951,0,t3_4vpzv1,. Utah JazzPROJECTED LINEUP George Hill Rodney Hood Gordon Hayward Derrick Favors Rudy GobertOne vote for this being the fourth best starting lineup in basketball and three votes for sixth places them firmly at No.  on the rankings. The Jazz traded for George Hill and moved Raul Neto to the bench. This lineup with Neto last season was the eighth most effective lineup in basketball of units that played at least  minutes together.The Jazz are hoping for something similar to what the Indiana Pacers went through when they traded for Hill back in . Pretty quickly they became one of the most dominant lineups in the NBA with great length and versatility. The Jazz sport a better bigman tandem and a more reliable shooting guard than Lance Stephenson. This will be a top five lineup in basketball if it can remain healthy.,UtahJazz,d60nruq,3,t5_2s5f0

9325945,0,t3_584z67,Hello!Strengths in no particular order  The front office and the coaching staff are devoted to finding and developing players that fit into its system. This has led to a Spursian type record in the draft over the past few seasons and constant progression from our guys. They have young talent at every position including a few who have risen to legitimate allstar consideration. This year we added some quality veterans to help our young guys take the next step. Dominant defense anchored by the  yr old French Rejection who is still on his rookie contract as the th pick in  has really been a calling card for this team. Dante Exum has also shown incredible potential on the defensive end. Besides these two most of the other players are average or higher on D. Chemistry. The guys truly seem to like each other. There isnt a cancer on the team.Weaknesses in no particular order They really havent won anything before. Last season the playoffs were within their reach but they fumbled it down the stretch. They lost to Brooklyn and a Clippers bench unit at home when they knew they were in a playoff race. They seemed to get flustered which stumped their offense and handicapped their defense. Injuries have really taken their toll on this team.  years ago we missed Alec Burks and Rodney Hood for half the season. Last year Dante Exum missed the whole season Burks missed  of the season and Favors and Gobert each missed  games. This preseason hasnt started out too encouragingly in this regard but since it is preseason and none of the injuries are overly serious Im not too concerned yet. The Western Conference is so overly stacked that it might be difficult to get to the next level though it seems to have calmed down a bit this year. This also could prove to be a boon for the team in that they had to be that much better just to rise above the noise.,UtahJazz,d8y4rtd,2,t5_2s5f0

Look up the warriors when they were a horrible team  ish and youll see a team that led the league in man games lost due to injury every single year.  I remember seeing the graphics during telecasts during that era and I remember how much the team resembled a MASH unit.  Remember this is the team that once played a game with  healthy players.  Take a look at this articleThis is player games missed due to injury during a  year sample.  From  to  the warriors were the th most injury riddled team in that span.  The Jazz were middle of the road.  They had bad coaching a bad training staff horrible ownership perhaps the worst overall situation in the league and etc.  Steph was drafted in  and was healthy his first year so these numbers do not include Stephs early ankle problems.  To no ones surprise at all the team that finished healthiest in the league during those years?  The Phoenix Suns and their world reknowned training staff.  Everyone has freak injuries but injuries due to wear and tear are preventable to some degree.  ,UtahJazz,daypbnh,1,t5_2s5f0

Hayward and Gobert absolutely shut down Giannis! That was nice to see. And they were beasting offensively.Im actually in favor of Quins decisions with Dante. Kid screwed up twice in a row defensively giving open threes and he needs to be held accountable.I continue to be extremely impressed with Alec and the Joes production off the bench.

Not just blocks but his ridiculous hands causing turnovers that turn into fast break opportunities. Its that  his ability to switch that gives him the argument for best defender in the league.Gobert is good on switches for his size but Green legit moves his feet like a wing and completely nullifies the strength advantage that some perimeter players use to create space Harden is a great example he guards him extremely well.

11808515,0,t3_68hfpo,Four FactorsStat|Jazz|Clippers|||eFG|.|.Turnovers||ORB|.|.FTMFGA||Thoughts. The Jazz are doing a job of moving the ball offensively. The driveandkick has been a integral part of their offense in the first half here. Utah is th in the league in team assists per game at just a tad over  but they already have  here today. Give credit to the some fantastic offball cuts as well as the Jazz guards being able to break down their men off the dribble forcing Clippers defenders to help and allow the guards to dish it off to either a big man for an easy slam for out to the perimeter for an open shot.. Derrick Favors has had a very solid game offensively with Gobert sidelined with foul trouble. Favors is  from the field and although he is defensively inferior to Gobert he has played smart incontrol basketball that capitalizes off of the Jazz guards ability to blow by the Clips perimeter defense. Most of Favors made field goals have not been because he has backed down DeAndre Jordan but rather because he has found a pocket of space when Jazz guards drive and force Jordan to switch off of Favors and onto them. Furthermore the Jazz PnR game has been while not spectacular certainly above average and has sprung Jazz guards open for drives. Goberts defense is missed as there have been numerous CPDJ PnRs that the Jazz have looked mystified by and Jordan has  points and  boards at halftime but Favors offense is been notable. . Speaking of Gobert he should play more in the second half and that means that the Clippers wont be able to have the same amount of success down low as they did in the first. The Clippers are just  from PT range and that needs to change if they want to be able to come back in this game. Sharpshooter JJ Redick specifically is just  from the field. CP has been a one man wrecking screw and Austin Rivers has been able to drive at will but you have to wonder how much of that is because Gobert arguably the best rim protector in the league has been in foul trouble. With him back in the second half DeAndre Jordan wont be as effective and that means that the Clippers need to be on their game from midrange and from deep. And even with Gobert on the bench in the second quarter the Clippers could only muster  points in the second quarter. Doc Rivers needs to make some offensive adjustments at halftime.. Finally Chris Paul has been a man on a mission. Paul has  points and five assists in the first half and numerous times he has used his handles to blow by Jazz defenders and get into the paint. The PaulDeAndre Jordan PnR has resulted in multiple alley oop finishes for Jordan in the first half. Austin Rivers has continued the solid play he has shown in the playoffs thus far with  points in  minutes. Paul has made almost every play possible and that trend should continue in the second half. As I highlighted earlier JJ Redick needs to get going in the second half and light a spark under a Clippers team that played a pretty disappointing first half.At this point Utah is playing a fantastic game and realistically should probably be up more than . The Clippers need to be thanking their lucky stars that they are still in the game at this point. If the Clips can start hitting from midrange and outside theyre in fine position to come back and win this game. ,UtahJazz,dgyjb7g,8,t5_2s5f0
