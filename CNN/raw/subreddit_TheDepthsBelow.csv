This boat was the Duane but theres another ship in the keys the Spiegel Grove.It was to be scuttled to make a reef  mi away from the keys it got to its destination but it started sinking too early for some reason. As a result it didnt land right and kind of sat upside down in a  position where one end was on the seafloor and the other end was about.. feet from the surface? That image is creepy enough. A month or so later the boat was fixed and laid flat on its side.A few years later...Hurricane Dennis rolls by and the ship the whole ship has been mysteriously righted by churning waters under the hurricane and it now rests on its bottom as it was intended to.,TheDepthsBelow,cmdarcb,1,t5_2xjsv

6178131,0,t1_cyrv5is,A lot of sharks are already Threatened to Endangered. We need them to reproduce as many as quickly as possible.While sharks are intimidating creatures a tube of muscle with a huge row of teeth at the front and some fins glued on they play an incredibly important role as the judges of natural selection. If a fish has a mutation that is unfavorable to the continuation of their species a fin that swims slower weaker digestive system or even just a sickness that kills the fish faster than a natural death they need to be removed from the species population before they can reproduce and make more problem fish.Sharks play the role of apex predators that eat these poorly adapted fish for the unintentional betterment of the ecosystem as a whole. A fish that performs worse than the rest of the species is easy prey for a hunting machine. So the fish population stay adapted healthy and occasionally evolves to create improved species of fish.Also sharks are fucking cool. You should check out some documentaries on how these creatures operate avoid Shark Week documentaries theyre just clickbait. Its amazing how intricate these creatures lives are and how little we actually understand them. ,TheDepthsBelow,cyrw0w7,23,t5_2xjsv

Also many species of salamanders will keep their external gills into adulthood in certain situations. When I was a kid there was a pond down the street that had pacific newtsthe brown ones with orange bellies but one year they all disappeared and were replaced by these greenish brown salamanders with external gills. As a herpetology geek Ive always wondered if the Pacific newts changed for some reason or if a new species was introduced and drove the others out.

Its more of a general term which we use to describe the young of many different types of animals when those young are very different from adults of the same species. For example a tadpolepolliwog is considered a larval form because they are very different than adult frogs. Some kinds of mammal marsupials like kangaroos and opossums  as well as monotremes like platypus and echidnas  are actually considered larvae when very young as well. ,TheDepthsBelow,danqkfq,88,t5_2xjsv

11279772,0,t1_dfaj0om,One of the biggest themes of the movies and the books is that you dont have to be a badass to change the world Gandalf even states at one point that its the little people in the worlds are the ones who make the big difference. I can understand not liking them as characters but you seem to legitimately hate them simply because of the simple fact that they are not badasses. Why do you think Aragon the king of gondor kneels to the hobbits out of respect at the end of return of the king.Edit Here is the exact quote from Gandalf. Saruman believes it is only great power that can hold evil in check but that is not what I have found. I found it is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay. Small acts of kindness and love. Why Bilbo Baggins? I dont know. Perhaps because I am afraid and he gives me courage. ,TheDepthsBelow,dfajnkj,27,t5_2xjsv
