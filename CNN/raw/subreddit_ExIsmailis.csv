11348326,0,t1_dfi62zz,Sadly BUI content is simply not representative of actual Ismaili Muslim doctrine. This is expected given the age group BUI covers whereas actual Ismaili theology from proper sources past and present was never written for such an age group. In all your years did your ever read or study what Imam Ali Imam Jafar AlSijistani Nasir Khusraw or even Aga Khan III or Aga Khan IV actually taught re the concept of God. If not then you simply werent exposed to the normative and correct Ismaili teachings on God. In a sense it is your problem inly because a decision to no longer be Ismaili and instead be atheist should be premised on correct ideas and correct understanding of what you reject. Do you really possess that?Youre right to reject whatever sort of interventionist elementary school level theology that you were exposed to but your experience does no invalidate actual Ismaili teachings on the subject nor should the flawed theology you heard about be used to form expectations on how the Ismaili Imamat would operate in the world. And bad theology isnt just an Ismaili problem. Its very much a Muslim and Christian problem too. Most Muslims and Christians today dont get proper theology. For those who dont tbink about it it matters little. But for critical thinkers like you it makes or breaks faith. ,ExIsmailis,dfib8sa,1,t5_3iggi
