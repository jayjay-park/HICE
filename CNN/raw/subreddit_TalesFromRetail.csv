Thats a pain in the ass to fake since they add that to the bills after its printed. Cant fake that with a printer.Hold it up to the light for  indicators. The first is the security strip anything  and up with have a vertical strip thats visible when you hold it to the light. Its actually a line of text stating the bills denomination.  will say  dollars  dollars  dollars etc  will say      . If you have one you can shine a black light on it and itll be visible under a blacklight and each bill denomination the bill will be different colors. s its yellow s its red s green etc. But assuming no blacklight is handy you can see and read the security strip itself just holding the bill up to a ceiling light. Its usually placed right next to the presidents portrait.The other thing you can see is the president in the middle will also be visible to the side when you hold it to a light. So Grant in the middle portrait when you hold it to the light there will be another portrait of grant on the right in the white space.Personally I just recommend the hold it to the light one. Hold it up. Does the face on the right match the face in the middle? Does the vertical strip say the same numbers as the bill? . chance your golden as those are embedded inside the bill and are the hardest security features to fake.

The manager in the story did his job poorly and the squeaky wheel gets the grease when it should often get replaced.However the comment about the higher ups with more responsibility needing to take the asinine complaints is backwards. Nothing would get done in the world if the people running companies dealt with the pointless issues. The managers time and stress is consumed by payroll inventory and employees. He might be thinking about the thousands of dollars of expiring meatvegetablesbread... that he has to fire sale or throw away and explain to his boss.Ive worked my way up into owning a small construction company and have to make k payroll every week even if the company makes nothing that week. I have to decide who works where what product to order what designs work and if they will please the current customer while not putting me under and gaining us more business filing and following the proper permits and keeping the IRS happy. So that occasional complaint might go to my workers instead of me. I in turn not only hear those complaints through the worker but they also complain to me that the new equipment I bought them could be bigger and more expensive like the other companies. My higher pay and responsibility does let me skip the trivial problems by consuming my time which has no end of shift dealing with issues that are rapidly turning my  year old hair grey.Sorry for the rant.TLTR being the boss doesnt mean smoking cigars and playing golf all day,TalesFromRetail,cfaj6sh,2,t5_2t2zt

The vehicle drove off and we ran out to alert our neighbor and assess the damage. Stupidly the vehicle came back to the scene of the crime after my neighbor had come out as well to see her car. Hell ensued and the drivers friends coming running from an apartment on the opposite side of our building screaming at us for holding him up from their party. Once we told them that he wasnt going anywhere due to attempted hit and run as well as he attempted to run over my neighbor with his truck by not stopping at the end of the parking lot where she was standing. They begin screaming how they are military and deserve respect and that the cops would believe them over us because they fought for their country. I cant stand when people pull that out because I have many friends and family that HAVE actually fought in war who have seen things no one would want to see. So after berating them and telling them they were nothing compared to the men and women Ive actually known that served that didnt just grab the GI bill and go to college like a punk the cops had shown.

I know my managers get in trouble if the turnover rate is too high but it may not be that way at other stores. A brand spanking new employee is going to take anywhere from  to  weeks before they stop being a burden and start being an asset due to training issues and whatever else and a crew run on nothing but brand new people is not going to get anything accomplished. They do try to keep seasoned employees on staff. So whether they care about me because Im making them money or because they think Im a swell person is irrelevant my job is still relatively secure.

866713,0,t1_ch2sjmo,Visibly impaired being the key word.  If someone had  monster drinks before arriving to your establishment and wasnt visibly impaired as some professional drunks certainly arent but then had  drinks over the course of  hours in your establishment and became sloshed you still did not over serve them.  You have to establish negligence and responsibility.  Short of giving every patron to walk in a bar a breathalyzer to establish their BAC or being able to read minds this isnt going to happen unless in the cases of extreme negligence.  If someone is witnessed being falling over drunk by other patrons or video when they enter an establishment and are served  drinks then the bartenderbar could certainly be found to be at fault.  that would be negligence on behalf of the bartenderestablishment.Another way this has been established is when someone has been in the same bar all day were talking  hours and that timeframe has been proven whether the bartender knew they were going to drive or not at that point the bartender has a legal responsibility to not have let them get to that point.  Its not just a matter of getting them a ride home or calling a cab.  Whos to say they dont get home via cab get behind the wheel of their nd vehicle and kill someone?

The annoying part was that he would come by after the customer would leave and apologize because we have to treat the customers well and if they have a problem I need to take care of it.

Ive worked as a cook janitor laborer at a factory. this is my first retail job. like . of other retail stores we have a discount card that saves you X off your purchase. costs money to sign up and all  that jazz. when i first started working there i quickly excelled at sales. making triple my quota for these cards running around the floor helping as many as  customers at once. i was also very ambitious. gtlets skip ahead to December. i had been working at my store about  months and the honeymoon period was over. i quickly realized that no promotion was coming no raise would be offered. i was simply another number in a database with percentages and pay rate tied in. i stopped caring about my quota. customers were actually grateful that i would just ring them up and cash them out. skip ahead to  months ago. it was the day after my st birthday. i had to open the store at  AM. i didnt get to sleep till . i woke up showered changed and got to work. gthalf way through my shift Im called into my managers office and there is a sheet with my name on it. it was a two week warning. it stated that if i didnt meet my quota in  weeks that i would lose my job. it didnt matter that customers would ask for me by name or that id get called in every day off.  it was all about this discount card this little piece of plastic would make me unemployed. so when asked why after  moths i had stopped caring i simply said there was no recognition. there was no benefit. i ended up making my quota. customers noticed the desperation and saw the fear in my eyes. then we had  people quit all on the same week. my manager was flabbergasted. she had no idea what to do. she only had  employees left. gt I walked into her office and put my apron on her desk and ripped my name tag off. she  looked at me about to cry and asked why i had to leave to. i simply said im not going to let a little piece of plastic define if i can feed my family. two days later i got a phone call offering me a manager position at the store i had quit. i demanded double the pay and  hours a week. only reason i took it was because my manager begged. i guess the moral of the story is that dont let a little piece of plastic define your job. because then it defines your life.,TalesFromRetail,cierrva,41,t5_2t2zt

I would then proceed to tell the customer No sir they did not. Im friends with the copy center associates from that store and they run the same exact promotions and pricings as we do. There is absolutely no  cent color copy pricing.

The only situation in which an LED wont work perfectly is an enclosed fixture heat kills em or in a dimmer made for incandescents and turned down below ish.Ill tell you though unless you get crafty you can only get about  bulbs per warranty. That means if this keeps up youll be paying  for a bulb youll get to use with replacements for  years max.If I were you Id get a rough service incandescent. They are designed for work in environments with high vibration like inside a garage door opener.

We eventually had to block the number from showing up because our switchboard was innundated with calls from people who saw our generic number didnt bother to check their voicemails and would just call the main hospital line and say Yeah you guys called me?Sure we have  floors and several outpatient clinics plus  different specialty offices working out of the hospital let me just psychically patch you through to whoever called you.  The nice thing was that we really couldnt tie up the phonelines for too long so I would usually make one nice attempt to figure out what department it might have come from and then tell them that they needed to check their voicemail and listen to their message and call back and then disconnect the call.Lordy I hated those calls. ,TalesFromRetail,cimfxs5,7,t5_2t2zt

By her getting that return done against policy in her mind she now feels entilted and that she can get away with anything. the best advice I can give you is to write down every interaction you have with this person and keep it somewhere safe. i dont know how your bosses are and i have no idea whos side they would take in this issue but it would be a good idea for you to approach them about this before they approach you about it. ,TalesFromRetail,ciwqztq,7,t5_2t2zt

But say you tag a bunch of stuff as on discount and then when it goes off you miss a shelf and dont put the new stickers on them or you dont take off the discount one. You just stuck yourself with honoring that sale. ,TalesFromRetail,cix14dh,2,t5_2t2zt

I tell them that as we are closing up in  minutes I can book the job in to be picked up half and hour after open the following day but I was not able to help them today. The group chat amongst themselves and I continue counting the register.  Its now  minutes to close. Mother pipes up by what cant you get this printed? Because we close in  minutes and I repeat that I can book it in for collection the next day. Another customer I helped earlier comes into collect his job and I give him his job and direct him to the open registers. Mother is still not getting the hint that it will take longer than I have left of my shift I dont get paid past my shift end time to do what she wants. Mother talks to exchange student and asks if she wants to leave the file for printing. The exchange student says but I need it now. Eventually they get the hint that I wont be staying back and printing their stuff and walk out unhappy.

And you are certainly right that there are individuals with milk and egg allergies that are fatal. But those are extremely rare  much more rare than peanut and tree nut allergies even.

Ok not necessarily the caffeinated part...The rest of the explanation I suspect has been played up a bit for this particular audience of readers. Also I suspect youre a bit younger than I am Im . I fondly remember a time when we took homemade treats to school and offered milk and cookies to neighbor kids. A lot of us miss the uncomplicated older days. The reality that we probably shouldnt do that anymore due to illness and lawsuits makes many people sad. gtIm uncomfortable with the fact that the childrens health and safety wasnt OPs primary concern.I hear you and I think you have your heart in the right place.

The law only applies to commodities though so only things which are depleted through normal use things like milk band aids and probably motor oil.Of course theres a sort of dont be a jerk clause to it.

2376900,0,t3_2mlc4s,I had a fun discussion with a customer once who presented an unsigned credit card once.  This happened prior to most gas stations transitioning to prepaypay at pump. I was working at a gas station in Florida on a sunny summer Saturday about noon. We were slammed with people.  Guy pumps  worth of gas comes in to grab snacks  and pay. I ring him up he hands me his card I check the back and inform him that I cant accept the card without some form of identification. That guy jumped from Im pissed at life cause Im too dumb to pre plan my weekend so I decide to drag my huge truck and boat to a busy gas station that I then have to wait. to Im going to agro out on the retail peon. He shouts a stern Why not!and I respond The back of your card is not signed.  Who gives a shit!? The credit card company that wrote not valid unless signed on the back of the card. This goes back and forth a couple times with him throwing in some awesome comments about my physique I was fluffy at the time my future  I was a  year old kid making  per hour in the late s all while the line got longer. He starts demanding I give him a pen so he can sign the card. I tell him that I still wont accept the card without out ID since I wont know if he was the authorized user. He insists he can sign it there and I refuse to accept the credit card without a license since the card was unsigned to begin with. True retail levels of awesome were experienced that day. He went inarticulate for a moment there. Starts telling me if I wont accept the card then he is not paying and will drive off. He was threatening me with a good time.  I just kept insisting he show me his identification.  Other people in line are telling him to stop being a prick. Finally he storms off to his truck to get his license.  I keep ringing people through the register. He storms back in and wings the license at my chest from a couple feet away to bounce off my chest.  Happy now!? he demands.  I hold out my hand and let him know I cant ring him through without seeing his license.  I think his brain broke at that point because he just mutters a curse picks up the license  and hands it to me. I ring him out remind him to sign his credit card before he tries to use it again  and wish him a good day. I was super fly TN fired up once that was done but I didnt care about him complaining because my coworkervideo sound recording would have backed up that I stayed calmed doing what the store manager had trained me to do.,TalesFromRetail,cm5hs16,12,t5_2t2zt

2449138,0,t1_cme886z,As you wish!I work in a gas station and it isnt uncommon for us to get some bigger trucks coming off of the highway for diesel. Close to the beginning of my employment I was working second shift on a Sunday with a buddy and coworker of mine. A smaller box truck pulls up to the outside diesel pump and prepays at the pump.Its close to the end of our shifts were both tired and hungry. In trots this little Chinese man off of the truck outside and straight to the bathroom he goes. Upon his return from the bathroom he makes some wild gestures at us one of which he motioned for us to wait where would we even go?. He goes out to his truck spends a few minutes and comes back. He hands each of us a box of soy milk and a banana and goes about his way. Aw what a sweet guy. That was so nice he really didnt have to do that right? Sure. For now.As the months go by I see him a few more times each time he brings a treat for me. The third time I see him he kind of begrudgingly hands my coworker a treat but happily gives one to me. Always some small drink box and a small snack no big deal. He drives a food truck so its just small stock off the back. Then college classes started back up for me and my schedule changed.I have another coworker N who looks almost identical to me. The only difference is generally hair color and even then its still pretty easy to mistake us. Her own brother mixes us up sometimes. Anyway its Sunday and N is working Sunday second shift. She texts and reports to me AboutTheBass that little Chinese guy was just in here. I think he thought I was you. He really begrudgingly just gave me a box of chocolates.AWWW. Im easily one of the nicest workers to him going out of my way every encounter to talk to him for a few minutes even though his English is incredibly poor. I figure hes really enjoying someone taking the time out of the day not to give him nasty looks and get annoyed. How sweet. Months go by and I kind of forget about the little truck driver who brings me goodies. School is really consuming my brain and my boss has been giving the Sundays to other workers until we had a girl leave. What do you know? Little Chinese guy comes in.This time he asks me if Id like to go to get some food with him after work. I was a little apprehensive but I figured he probably doesnt have many friends out this way. I mean he barely speaks our language and he drives a delivery truck from at least across the state. My boyfriend gives me the go ahead so whatever I give him my phone number stupid and ring his phone whenever Im done with my shift. We go get some food at one of the two restaurants in my town open after  p.m.Hes pretty normal during this entire encounter telling me about China and how lonely it is in the US this and that...except this time he hands me a necklace of hand cut jade koi fish. Ooookay. He also gives me a few packs of cigarettes in a plastic bag. I learn he drives further south where tobacco is much cheaper. I drive him back to where he left his truck at my gas station and he tries to get me to come inside of it for a few minutes. No thank you I politely make an excuse to leave.Later at home I discover inside of the bag is a napkin that says THIS FOR SCHOOL. Inside of the napkin is . I weep.School is done. Guess whos back on Sundays? I dont initially try to give back this  until I see him again he brings me a giant tray of truffles wow these gifts are getting more expensive... and whats this? hes hurried off and theres  inside of the bag.Now I start getting texts from him every once in a while. Its all barely understandable but carries a strange vibe as he says he wants to be best friends and beyond! What? Weird. I should really give this money back.Next time I see him I try to do so and he refuses. He said he traded me for it. Oh fuck. He did ask me for a cigarette...and that is Chinese tradition to trade for expensive gifts. He hands me a carton of cigarettes which he did allow me to give him the money for he expressed he hated me smoking. I come home and discover  inside of the carton. WHAT? Okay. I dont open my mouth about this at work at all in fear Ill get fired and this little man will be harassed. But this money. Has. To. Go. Back. Now more weird texts are coming through. FLOODS of them about couples in love in Boston and how it warms his heart how he wants to speak to me and see me more and KISS me. I try avoiding the texts. I have the  hes already given me ready in and envelope to give back next time. He breaks his wrist and I dont see him for a few weeks then hes back again in a cast that he wants me to sign. Instead I draw a turtle. I try giving him the money back and he gets very very offended. I try explaining to him that its way too much and I cant accept it I just want to be friends. He starts getting a little angry. Tells me I need to be nicer to myself and shoves another  in my hand and runs the hell away. I wish I were freaking kidding about this but Im not. I locked all my doors and immediately decided it was time to tell work what happened. Thankfully they just switched my schedule around and I didnt get in much trouble on their end. Unfortunately the texts were still flooding my phone from this guy and hes angrily telling me to that if I see him again I have to be his girlfriend. Nope. NOPE. NOPE. SO much NOPE. I tell him NOPE! and I blocked his number. N thankfully got promoted and works all morning shifts so he wont mistake us. He apparently hasnt come back since. I really hope he doesnt. Im still afraid as fuck to spend that money.TLDR Made friends with a little Chinese truck driver. Thought he was very appreciative of my friendship turns out  later he was trying to buy me for himself.,TalesFromRetail,cmef15k,5,t5_2t2zt

I tell the cashier to just do the price change not knowing it is for an employee.Lucky  Employee comes back to help me find it and mentions they work for another store and are using their discount mainly because she thinks she should get more off seriously... this lady was scamming as hard as any customer.Anyways this could have gotten both the cashier and employee fired had the discount gone through and depending on if they actually knew who I was myself as well probably not though as I would say I didnt know it was for an employee. EmployeeEmployee discounts will pop up an exception in the audit reports and have to be documentedexplained by a manager.  I would have felt bad for the cashier since she was fairly new and this lady was seriously overly dominating and definitely should have known the rules.,TalesFromRetail,cn8g21b,56,t5_2t2zt

2867349,0,t3_2oz0vj,It sucks your night manager did not back you up. But consider the costs and benefits here of  scenarios from the perspective of the store If you just give them the salad without question It costs the store     in lost revenue the actual cost is much lower to the store considering margins on their salad and perishability of the item and the customer is happy. Now consider what happens if the store sides with you. The manager and you stick to your guns and do not allow the discount. The gain in revenue is  for this one transaction. But the customer has a choice where they shop and this experience may push them to either shop more or completely at one of your competitors. That loss in revenue is FAR GREATER than the loss in revenue from this one interaction. That is why your manager made the decision. He should have taken some time to explain that to you. Im probably going to get downvoted to hell but this is the truth having worked in retail and in the corporate world this is how companies think. Its all about the customer relationship not about the single interaction. ,TalesFromRetail,cnu0obh,0,t5_2t2zt

That would be a HUGE violation of freedoms. No one would be stupid enough to propose that into a law and itd be overturned in a heartbeat the second it was challenged in court if someone was arrested for it. I expect if for some reason it came up in supreme court they would point to the right to freedom and liberty in the Declaration of Independence the Declaration and the Constitution being the big ones they use to determine what the forefathers had in mind for how the country should run.

Youre expected to check height weight eye color hair color look for all the little security markings expiration date and on and on.  Of course no one actually does that but the police absolutely can bust you for not doing it.  The company might not want to fire the employee but when faced with criminal charges and fines most companies are going to throw the employee under the bus as fast as they can and the legal system can be beyond unreasonable about things like this.  In many places the employee can be fined and charged personally as well.  So much is left completely up to luck it can be pretty sickening.

In the  or so minutes that followed the table across from us got their order taken and their food and whatnot and we still didnt have a chance to order.The lady who did come to take our order was another lady and apparently she had relieved the previous waitress who didnt tell her that we were sitting there waiting for service so she completely spaced with us. I admit I was kind of snappy with the lady when she first came by to ask if everything was alright and if we were ready to order.  I think I snarled something about being ignored for a half hour but she was really nice and apologetic and after I ate I was happier.  I did end up leaving her a  tip which I gave to her in person in case the other girl tried to get a bit of it and I think I remember apologizing to her too.

4430252,0,t1_csokcq9,A few weeks ago I was in the middle of a hectic day working in photo and forgot to ring up one of the two posters a lady had ordered shed done separate orders and in the chaos that ensued during the afternoon lunch rush I completely forgot to print the tag with the bar code for her second poster which I needed to scan in the POS in order to charge her. I realized my error about half an hour after shed left and immediately confessed to my shift leads and the ASM who told me to call the lady back and see if I could convince her to return to pay for the other poster. Though I felt like a total fool the lady claimed she would be back on Sunday to pay for it since of course it was just the right thing to do but Im pretty sure she never did as I was also working on that Sunday and never heard nor saw anyone coming to pay for an extra order.

It was hard for her since they took all her self esteem away. But she now much better and more outgoing. The worst thing about her parents was they were narcissistic and helicopters.  After our marriage before we could move I had the cops called on me by then when she didnt call for  days since they thought I was abusing her forbidding her to call them I mean how she not want to talk to them I must be the bad guy.

4888302,0,t1_cuakpuk,Recently my dad needed a bloodthinner. There is some new kinda that does not need to be monitored closely and his doctor in  the er decided to write the script for it and not for the old medicine. The doctor meant well but the result was that when he went to pick it up he was handed a  dollar bill for that particular medicine alone.The result was that he went without of a bloodthinner he didnt argue about the price he simply picked everything up but it. He had to go back to the hospital the following day and ask for the prescription for the bloodthinner he was used to as it had a cheap generic alternative.My point is Are you sure that the woman requested that specific medicine and it was not her doctor that changed the prescription on her? Assuming a well intentioned doc and not one getting kickbacks from the drug company rep it is possible a new drug was suggestedprescribed without going over the cost because the doctor wanted to help and didnt realize the budget impact my dad was not notified by the doctor of the expense and it was the doctor who suggested it out of concern.I am not suggesting you should give a  medicine for the price of an old generic. I am not saying a customer should be insulting or combative because the price is higher. I am simply saying that the sticker shock people have with a prescription may be very understandable if their doctor didnt go over the increased cost when discussing changing prescriptions with someone who does not feel well. How they react is still on them but I can very easily see why someone given a new script might be shocked by the price.,TalesFromRetail,cuapitn,6,t5_2t2zt

If you move more cigarettes than your competitor across town you can usually negotiate a better wholesale price for them and thus sell them cheaper without cutting into your bottom line. So if company A sells  cartons of Newports a month and company B only sells  then company A can get their cigarettes from Lorillard for say carton while company B pays .

5767170,0,t3_3u3220,I used to work at an airport.  We had a very strict policy not accepting bags less than  minutes prior to departure at the ticketing counter.  Mainly because the bag has to go through security we have to keep count ahead of time get the baggage cart out to the plane at a certain point prior to departure and even if we do get that bag on the plane if the downline connection city screws up the charge for delivery came out of our budget because we shouldnt have taken the bag in the first place according to my manager at least... dumb rule regardless.Anyway a woman came up the counter probably  minutes past cutoff.  Told her we could sneak in boarding passes for her but no way we could take her bag.  I believe I had to close the counter to go load up bags small airport only  of us working the one flight.  She ended up bringing her bag through security as a carryon which would be fine if it werent really obviously an oversized bag by carryon standards.  When we called her out on it her response was well they said I could take it on while pointing to TSA with the biggest fucking smirk ever.  TSA only cares that you dont have anything in your bag that could hurt others they are in no way there to enforce airline policy.  Ended up calling my supervisor to figure out wtf to do.  Sadly she was a bit groggy and told us to just take the bag.  Worst part is at the time we never accepted the checked bag fee at the gate so her weaseling meant that she also got a free bag.,TalesFromRetail,cxbyy3b,2,t5_2t2zt

After they finish retrieving carts for example the cart handlers will go in and help a bit with bagging or taking items out to cars at the start of their next round. Often the floor manager will be the one doing bagging just because it makes him easily accessible to both customers and staff. Means that one or two lanes will have a bagger for a couple of customers then theyll run off again. Or when things are slower and a couple of lanes are closed spare cashiers will help out with that.,TalesFromRetail,cxdqrxc,1,t5_2t2zt

And when you do cancel they can still charge you for the following month you cancelled on the nd so we have thirty days to cancel the membership so youll have to pay for next month also since the membership is billed on the first.

This assistance is the reason a place like this exists and the reason it survives in the Internet age. But it also costs more and to expect otherwise is what would lead this business failing. Its not about being nice its making sure the appreciated service is still available in the future.Item A at your local business costs the company so much more money to carry and sell you than Item A does for Amazon. Theres really not much a store can do to fix this. But if the store doesnt have anything to offer beyond simply the product then yeah theyre gonna have a really hard time competing and thats just how it goes.The funny thing is in my business generally Amazon or any other online retailer actually isnt any cheaper than buying the same product in our store.

Occasionally the caller will tell me that what I say wont help or that theyve already done that.Im above average when it comes to computers for someone who has never worked in IT.  I build all my own computers fix all my familys computers and networks etc.  And by the time Im on the phone with tech support Ive usually tried all the basic troubleshooting stuff logging outon restarting rebooting googling for the problem etc.  With that said if tech support says I want you to try X I will say I already tried X and it didnt change would you like me to try again?I do this for two reasons.  One Im calling tech support for a reason.  Theyre supposed to help!  I should listen to their help.  Two I know that users quite often say I already tried X when they didnt.  Either because they lie to not sound stupid which is pretty stupid or because they dont know what the exact terms mean.  Some people might confuse log out and log on with reboot.  They are very different.  Tech support doesnt know that Im one of the guys who actually tells the truth and knows what Im saying here and it would be unreasonable for them to believe everything every user says so if they want me to do something Ive already done Ill gladly do it.,TalesFromRetail,czp3cci,20,t5_2t2zt

I couldnt stand by the register and wait for him to finish shopping while I have  other customers waiting to be helping.I also dont agree that its treating everyone like criminals. Or are you assuming all stores do this? Most stores dont let you wear merchandise outside when trying it on. Does that mean youre saying everyone is trying to steal? No it means that any reasonable store owner would be cautious because it would make it easy to steal something if youre allowed outside. Most stores have security cameras. Does that mean everyone that walks into the store is trying to steal things so we need to watch and video tape every customer? Of course not. But again any reasonable store owner would see that video cameras greatly reduce the risk of people trying to steal.Were not treating people like criminals.

6857218,0,t3_49n0wj,My sister had a friend actually do something like this to her multiple times over. My sister is a stay at home mom but tries to craft and sell stuff on the side for extra income. She started out crocheting then added sewing and now does cookies also. But each time she did something a friend of hers would suddenly decide that she was going to do it also and run out and buy all the expensive fancy equipment for it that my sister cant afford. And because most of my sisters business was from friends and all those friends started buying from the other lady instead because they were all friends with her first my sister lost a lot of business. And the worst part is this friend has money enough that she doesnt even need the side business. Shes just a bored housewife with nothing to do.

I did the best I could with the knowledge I had I now have more appropriate knowledge so now I can do better.I have a thing with lots of noise and a thing with shouting. The shouting thing has been an issue as I was yelled at by both my father and ex husband. So yelling really makes me anxious. My daughter and I had never had a good relationship and I was still living in fear that her father would turn her against me and that she would turn out like him. So her and I went to therapy. Turns out she knew at least in part how abusive he was to me. All of his family have no concept of inside voice  and I learnt that when she is back home after being with her father she uses it as a refuge a place where she can relax and recover from the sensory overload. I realised that he doesnt have the power over me that I thought because she knows what he is like we were able to connect and our whole relationship has changed. Now since Ive acknowledged her sensory stuff and made it ok and we are working on ways to help her deal with it and Im more open to giving her the space she needs to decompress Ive noticed shes being a lot less isolated. Sorry kind of relayed my life story there. Im just so happy to finally feel this connection to my daughter.

Even if no one with half a braincell would use paper like that to roll a cig  The problem is that you need to ask them for a specific use for the paper. you cant ask what do you want it for? because thats too confrontational.

And they dont have any on display so you have to unfold it to see if its long sleeved or cropped or whatever and then what do you do if you dont want it you have to refold it and put it back and you can never fold like they do it and as I said your arms are full of other stuff.Thats why if theres anybody working the floor I go up to them and say Im sorry I know youre busy but Id like to see that shirt and it looks like someone worked hard to set everything up so carefully.

7691356,1,t3_4klgyk,You do understand that a deposit is not a sale right? It is instead a good faith payment for the future delivery of goods. The money still belongs to the customer until the time that it is exchanged for those goods. From an accounting standpoint it is considered soft money money that is not counted towards accounts receivable as it is technically refundable to the customer due to the fact that no goods or services have been provided in exchange for it. Otherwise the company would have to count the sale against their balance sheets and would show a loss they would also have to pay taxes on the sale. The reason why one store cannot exchange a deposit for another store is because it is not entered in the companys books see above and is instead being held as a credit at the local store. The nonrefundable part of the contract is meant to deter people from reneging on the agreement to exchange the money for goods in the future. Its a legal gray area that the company knows to exploit to keep the proceeds. Technically the money still belongs to the customer but by agreeing to the contract they signed away their right to demand a refund. And if the customer happens to give up on demanding a refund then the company just made  profit. ,TalesFromRetail,d3ggho5,4,t5_2t2zt

8361747,0,t3_4u44fu,I remember when I was a cashier for the th of July weekend we were supposed to ID everyone. Not policy just a do it for the weekend thing. I specifically asked our floor supervisors not managers So if I see a man whos I his s and he doesnt have his ID Im supposed to deny his sale then?Yes.Youre not going to just let him get it when he comes to complain to a manager making me look like the bad guy and make me call management for every single person whose obviously old enough and wants to complain right?Just do it. I should mention at this point I was only a cashier for a short period of time as part of training to be in another department so I think I was the only person comfortable enough to question this happening. Also we are a very busy store making over a million dollars a week without holidays. So pretty soon after the new idea started I had an old man late s in appearance and he was a military vet. I knew it wasnt going to go well. Long and short of it was he didnt have his ID I called for a manager and the manager stared at me like I was wasting his time. Told him that the floor supervisors were doing this for the day and said that Im only doing what theyre making us all do. He told me just do your job like youd normally would and walked away. That new idea was shut down immediately and the floor supervisors had quite a talking to later on in their shift to say the least. ,TalesFromRetail,d5mrqlb,145,t5_2t2zt

Im not sure parents understand that retail workers cannot look and instantly tell that their child is leaving with a stranger. If the child is leaving happily or even if they just look like theyre throwing a tantrum no one may have reason to suspect anything is wrong. Especially now that biracialadoptivestep families are becoming so common. If the kid doesnt look like the person theyre leaving with and a retail worker asks for ID when they really are the family member the retail worker gets punished for discrimination and possibly verbally or physically assaulted.

The moment she was up front either during the major holiday sales or when she was covering for a manager she folded like a cheap rug  everything was  off of course you can do that exchange with no tag it receipt we can totally hold that large furniture item for your for a week we were a thrift store and our furniture room was tiny. We had a  turnover every few days so leaving a piano in there for a week while it wasnt for sale was a huge problem. The worst was when I was on register and she was the only manager in the store and a girl wanted to buy a little plastic horse. It should have been in a plastic bag with some other toys but the bag had been ripped open at some point and she just had the one toy. With any other manager Id have called them up theyd have approved selling it for .whatever and wed all get along with our lives. The store manager was adamant that we not sell things without price tags there was a problem with people pulling tags off designer jeans and then getting a manager to price them super cheaply because they didnt recognize the brand so I was stuck up there with a toddler whos having a total meltdown a mom who just wants to buy the damn you and her on with her day and a growing line of people who are watching me tell a crying child that theres no possible way she can have this toy. It was a total nightmare and I was about five seconds from just saying fuck it handing the kid the horse and pretending I worked for a reasonable company.Fortunately a lady from the line saw a torn open bag on the floor near the register which the horse could reasonably have come from. Things worked out but... aurgh.,TalesFromRetail,d8bdk6x,1,t5_2t2zt

She of course didnt read them just pulled them off the shelf and the items next to it assuming it was what the coupon was for... wrong. It was two coupons both getting an item free with a bag of walnuts. The free items were cream and chocolate bars for baking. She only ever mention the chocolate bar so I assumed she didnt want the cream. Customers a lot at our store would give us two deal coupons when only using one but too lazy to rip it in half I had a bagger and manager help me twice to run and get the correct item and correct overrides. Line was back up as hell and I was express at the time. We are almost through with her transaction when she was like so what about my cream. I said I didnt know you wanted it maam to which she snapped. Screaming at me saying items should be side by side when it comes to a coupon but for anyone thats ever been to an heb we can only have so many displays and the rest of the items are in their normal areas. I tried to explain that and she screamed for me to shut up and that she didnt care how the system was set up and that I should just shut up and stop arguing with her. I repeatedly told her I wasnt at which she said I was and to shut up again and just take what she said and drop it and stop being disrespectful? She said I needed to go back to training because I was dump and rude. Which is funny Im almost a manager and Ive been in retail  years but ok old lady.

9693630,0,t1_da7wlpt,Im going to play devils advocate for a minute here. While what happened could be construed as assault calling the police will not have the effect you want it to. First of all the likely hood that you will see a response time within the time it takes for the customer to leave is low because your specific situation is not a priority as no ones life is in danger. But if you do get the police to show up in time they probably will not do more than take a report and send the lady away. If they actually decide to arrest her and charge her with assault you are going to be spend probably two weeks to a month going back and forth to court.The best thing you can do in this situation if you want to take action against the customer is make it clear to your management the situation that had occurred immediately and tell them that you felt threatened by the customer. They should at least consider banning them from the store. They will appreciate you dealing with it internally much more than if you get the police involved. Obviously at the end of the day you need to do what you think is best in the situation. This is just my assessment of the situation and I wanted to caution you about possible getting in over your head about something that at the end of the day just isnt worth it.

The choice they make is how much they will work and how much they will devote to couponing. You are thinking too much about money and not focusing on benefit. They make a living because they turn coupons into goods that they value and spare themselves money they otherwise would have spent. They effectively created  for their family by couponing. In the actual effect on the family it is like Mom brought home . Just like how if she works and sends the kids to daycare shes only making  because she had to spend that money.For the record Im one semester from finishing an economics degree.

Im a womans  and wear the Tirra style. It has a built in arch support so if that bothers her arch go for the girls Tirra which is flat and a much better price!Hushpuppies mary janes often tend to fit wide and many have adjustable Velcro straps. Ive heard excellent things about Clarks from a lot of women weve only carried them for a year so Im not familiar with them yet. See if she likes the smoking shoe style as they tend to be more generous in depth than flats.

Because you cant really try before you buy intimately gross or return a toy unless unless its defective you can go by Amazon reviews to see what people thought.However if I decided to go to my local sex shop and I asked about toys purchase one and went home to later discover they gave out my personal info to some random to ask me about my Hitachi Magic Wand purchase amazing BTW. Of course you are going to get bogus reviews as eith any product. But an informed consumer should read articlesgo to company websitestradeshows to research the best product for them especially if its such a big item like a roof. That way you can talk to professionals who will help you find what works best for you. ,TalesFromRetail,dct41kf,3,t5_2t2zt

Its about a lot more than looking like an ass thats actually the least of the problem here and youve missed that point entirely. The main offense is that the manager effectively scapegoated OP so as not to have to do his job. And then had the audacity to laugh about it. Yes I would absolutely die on this hill I would not want to work for a company who so clearly didnt value me or thought so little of me as an employee that they were willing to make a problem customer go away at my expense.

11733772,0,t1_dgpkk0k,Hi welcome to retail.There are a LOT of people who feed their children this way.Theyll go to a restaurant and order food for their child and then claim that the food wasnt good enough and demand either a refund or more food.Another thing youll see a lot of is parents who will bring their children in and ask for a sample of every single flavor of ice cream over and over until their child is full.When you encounter these people you want to just let them feed their child for free.The kind of person who has the lack of empathy required to feed their child on food samples is the kind of person who will destroy your business if you try to stop them too.If you try to stop them they will go to community events and tell everyone they meet that you gave their child bad food and then refused to give them a refund or that they asked for a sample for their child and that you personally told the child they couldnt have it.They will continue to do this until they put together a regimen of restaurants they can take their child to on a regular basis and feed them for free.,TalesFromRetail,dgq1wz3,215,t5_2t2zt

11750837,0,t1_dgrzc0h,I actually lied to her. My minimum is actually  but it was a black t shirt with only part of the hem missing. I could have had it done in  minutes. I gave her a price break. Why? I didnt want to do it cheaper and set a precedence. Its too easy for people to take advantage of you. ,TalesFromRetail,dgrzjbt,3,t5_2t2zt

We would have the machinery on two pallet jacks. On the way back it was a drag race. Can confirm the wrong turn on the handle thing though. ,TalesFromRetail,dgwmxi5,2,t5_2t2zt

Who is to say why she buys it twice a year or even if she does. She might have just said that to further cement her previous statement that yes you do have the shoes with paw prints on them my daughter buys them twice a year.. ,TalesFromRetail,dgx9ugt,25,t5_2t2zt
