3675312,0,t3_32g97n,The besra. I have no idea if this is a fact but it definitely feels more maneuvarable than the lazer or hydra not including hover mode and I just love flying it all around and inbetween building taking those sharp corners.,AviatorsOfGTA,cqb7jzi,3,t5_33cy5
3696372,0,t3_32hry3,Yup kind of a close call there. Too bad this cant happen with grond missiles very often. I swear them things turn on a dime.,AviatorsOfGTA,cqdm0c2,1,t5_33cy5
3869446,0,t3_32g97n,Duster or the DoDo for me although the duster being so weak is a negative. A lot of the time after one bad landing cant take off again which means ordering a new one.,AviatorsOfGTA,cqxcmo8,1,t5_33cy5

5213689,0,t1_cvefhnp,I think you already added me but it is Physical Dizzy.  Gamer tag bdizzo fo dizzo I know dont get me started on where that name came from.  Just a couple of questionsWhen do we all link up and accomplish some sorties?  Do we have specific tasks?  I once got a print out of the map and we had spice fix areas we had to fly through as well as a few intercept missions with the fighters Im looking forward to linking up with people who love flying like myself!,AviatorsOfGTA,cvefy57,1,t5_33cy5
