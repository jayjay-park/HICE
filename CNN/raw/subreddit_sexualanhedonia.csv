Have you ever been on antidepressants? Have you had any genital trauma?My gyno also had no idea what could be wrong. They dont tend to be well versed in the pleasure aspect of things so much as the reproductive aspects of things. My gyno was kind enough to discuss her own experiences with me in order to help me understand myself better. It did not give me more answers though.. A sex therapist could be the answer but I do not think it is the answer for us most of the time. What is your gut reaction? Psychological issue or biological issue?,sexualanhedonia,co1wcro,1,t5_2wdp7
