Everyone is trying to get somewhere. Other people may be in a hurry or may not know how or feel comfortable driving. The only thing you can do is take care of yourself and make sure you arent creating slow traffic.If someone is slower than you want to go either stay behind them and take it or go around them. Dont try to change their driving to suit you.If another driver is careless or dangerous stay away from them and report it. Thats all you can legally do. Riding their bumper or brakechecking only puts you in danger.,TorontoDriving,d85r61s,1,t5_33rm5

Some crazy fat lady in a range rover was honking at me going maybe ish and cause she couldnt find an opening to pass me in the left lane I guess it caused her blood to boil.  when she finally  got up next to me she was screaming like a banshee.  Something along the lines of how she regrets her life choices and wishes the weight she gained when she had kids would have been gone by now but anyway she sped off doing at least  in the  zone.  When I pull up at Sheppard who do I see mounted on a curb with a smashed garbage bin and a totaled front end? Crazy big lady.  She tried to take the hidden road turn thats right before the Northbound Sheppard and Weston bus stopbut was going too fast I guess and completely mounted the curb and took out the bins.  I loved it.
