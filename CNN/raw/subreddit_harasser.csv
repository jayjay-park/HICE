2636020,0,t3_2q37a9,Only thing that really bothers me currently is the weird striping effect on the Harasser composite armor. It should be a flat black or dark gray but it now has these huge white blurry stripes on it looks like a bug or a stretched out and incorrect texture.Happened after that combined texture change which gave us back the good colors for the Mossie and Prowler.,harasser,cn2nt0d,3,t5_32mop
2649043,0,t3_2qan7r,Before the buff I used mag size and thermals but now I run reload speed and zoom. When you already have  rounds  extra rounds doesnt seem to make a big enough effect to be worth using over reload speed. Especially since a lot of the times you dont get to empty a full mag while your target is weaving through trees rocks hills or buildings. Pretty much as soon as they break line of sight I reload so when they pop up Im ready with a full clip.I dont use thermal because the vulcan is absolutely garbage against any infantry smart enough to not stand still. Plus since you can actually shoot stuff past spitting distance I like having the added zoom. ,harasser,cn4d0s0,3,t5_32mop

2824130,0,t1_cnoikg3,Unfortunately this feeling of being the only ones flanking comes from using the prebuff vulcan as it really was only effective if you were up close and shooting at a rear.  My two cents the way the vulcan is now its more the newbie friendly gun than the halberd it requires no accuracy whatsoever to be effective just good driving to survive any reloads if youre not to the point where youre one clipping.... I think theyre gonna probably nerf the current version or hopefully leave it alone and buff the other two though really does saron need any sort of buff its still king in my eyes. I went with the extra  bullets over reload and I recommend getting your TurboFS first overall then piece together other upgrades along and along.....,harasser,cnp3ivg,1,t5_32mop

4477444,0,t1_csv0wpm,Hard to say.  Absolutely no numbers on it.  This is the kind of thing that you notice when youve been doing something longer than everyone else like if you notice something odd about your car.  Like after  KM of driving you feel your car suddenly pulling to the right.  Is it pulling to the right or do you just feel that? Is it you?  Your car? And you start asking yourself wtf?  Why is this happening when did this start happening and why are you noticing this?Im not sure how many hours you need in your career vehicle to notice changes but the ones I did notice I put in the Harasser History section of the pedia On April th  in anticipation for the then upcoming harasser changes that would enable everyone else other than ECUS to pull harassers again we noticed distinct differences in the harasser chassis from PTS.  Details here.  Notice that no one from SoE or anyone really responded.And then after they brought in those changes they fucked harasser traction while doing the Flash update stating noone would notice.  The last one was when they introduced sundererlike physics qualities to the harasser to make it mediocrity friendly.  Now you dont have to worry about becoming an amazing driver SoEDBG will have Gene Gray ride shotgun so she can stabilize your harasser for you on the go.  If my harasser came with Gene Gray  I may not mind that.  But Id like to know why theyre making my harasser feel like a bus.  Instead of saying nothing or just saying  we shouldnt notice.  So numbers no.  Personal experience is my only evidence for this one.  ,harasser,csv1unk,1,t5_32mop

I would even say the opposite racer is irrelevant if you can manage your turbo correctly.gt The catch is that doing the tight turns and precision CQC maneuvers that scrapper is capable of when youre using racer takes practiceYes it takes practice to do it with racer but scrapper still does it better. ,harasser,cxwdg5q,1,t5_32mop

Im pretty sure the post I spoke about was in the main planetside subreddit but I cant find it with the search and Im not waging through  pages to find one post. The main gist of the post in question was that if you were close enough to hit your target with all of the fullauto shots in their CoF bloom you should just hold down the trigger. I dont agree I believe its a bit more complicated than that and that the burst shot should be used as often as possible. One thing that has occurred to me though is the difference between controllers and MampK. I believe that it might be a bit more difficult to land the wave with a controller rather than a MampK were just not as accurate which might be why some gunners tend to just hold the trigger down. But thats why I tell my gunners to go for the charged shot when they can land it otherwise just hold the trigger until youre back on target.,harasser,czruqb4,1,t5_32mop

9988788,0,t3_5ifyst,As far as comp armor goes I believe you can tank  rockets if you pop your fire suppression in between shots. You can take on a deci and a regular launcher but no  decis though. I would also recommend running reload speed instead of mag size on the vulcan. Since you cant one clip a sundy with mag size i always found sundy hunting easier with reload for my fight killing needs,harasser,db9ker8,1,t5_32mop
10180543,0,t1_dbxgkn5,Well in their defense in the first clip they jumped me from behind with the GK but I was too close to the Tech plant.  Honestly they should have had more patience and stalked me a bit longer until I was out of boost range of the shield as I had no clue they were around.Later at around  they jumped me again with a Vulcan as I was engaging the infantry but I was able to hop over the hill and turn in time to kill them.  The rest of the clips are mostly me catching them as they were engaged with other targets.  IE stealth while tracking them via soundI have a tendency to make Harry crews not look good as I run stealth and constantly listen for their weapons.  So once they jumped me the first time and Im aware they are in the area I make it hard on them.  If I know there are crews working in the area I make it my business to protect my factions zerglings from them.  Its one of my guilty pleasures but I truly enjoy hearing the pop of a dying harasser. ,harasser,dby0r8v,1,t5_32mop
