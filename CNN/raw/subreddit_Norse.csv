303251,0,t3_1xjyix,Just a few thoughts...First of all that looks very much like iron albeit not particularly rusty iron suggesting a fairly recent history  Vikingage iron stuff tends to be pretty heavily eroded when we dig it up. Moreover coinage struck in or around the Viking age was usually of precious metal so that makes it an unlikely candidate. Second the marks on the coin look scratched in or engraved. Ancient and medieval coins were placed between two dies and struck with a hammer like so giving a stamped look. You can read about the process here.Third that doesnt look much like any coins struck by the Norse or by any of their likely trading partners AngloSaxon England continental Germans Byzantium the Arab world... By way of example heres a silver Swedish penny heres some information on the silver dirham and heres a website with lots of great examples of AngloSaxon coinage. You will note that all of these designs are fairly complex. The whole theoretical point initially of stamping a coin with a design was to serve as a guarantee of sorts X king was promising that this particular coin contained a certain amount of silver or what have you. A simple design like the one on the object you have would be extremely easily counterfeited.Also I dont know the size of the thing you found but most early medieval coinage is surprisingly small  say  mm on average. That much silver or especially gold is quite valuable! People used to watching modern movies playing video games like Skyrim etc. might get the idea that they used big old clunky coins like an American halfdollar coin or something but that wasnt the case in the early middle ages.All that said its still an interesting and unusual thing youve got there and someone certainly scratched those markings on it intentionally. Id try crossposting it to rwhatisthisthing or maybe rnumismatics or rcoins though I personally kind of doubt thats a coin of any description.Edit I see that the folks at rwhatisthisthing directed you here on the basis of its supposed similarity to runes. Runes are pretty tricky and Im hardly an expert at them though far fewer people know about them than claim to  for whatever reason everyone whos ever taken a look at the Elder Futhark likes to claim they can read runes but I doubt these are Norse runes of any description. If they are they dont communicate anything  this is definitely not a meaningful inscription in Old Norse or anything like that.

1582149,0,t3_2ce73o,The Vikings in particular were fulltime farmers and parttime warriors. Being great explorers but not being real big on writing stuff down or making detailed maps a lot of their day to day stuff can only be deciphered from archeology and anthropology. Im pretty sure there were a few really well kept writings but the Christianization of Scandinavia saw them almost completely destroyed. As far as culturereligion they were surprisingly ahead of their time. Women could own property fair trials for suspected criminals and tolerance for other religions were just a few things that no other culture at the time had. Norse religion is usually passed down verbally from parent to child. The adventures and misadventures of the gods taught many valuable lessons to children about how to be a good person sacrifice selfreliance and strong will. Just one of many examples is the story of the god Tyr sacrificing his hand so that the wolf Fenrir could be tied up with bonds he couldnt break. Knowledge and wisdom were also very important. Odin gave one of his eyes for knowledgewisdom and hung himself from Yggdrasil the world tree for several days to gain the knowledge of runes.When you combine a tough as nails people with a culture and religion that promotes knowledge exploring equality sacrifice for the good of others and incredible battle prowess you get the Vikings. They fought a lot for conquest and you can find a lot of info by using Google to get the stories of Iceland Greenland and their first settlers.

9957973,0,t3_5i34df,I have bought mine from a vendor at a very small folk metal festival. They actually provided printed instructions for cleaning. Basically it recommended to use those denture cleanser tablets with water in the horn leave it for a few minutes and then rinse it clean.If the inside becomes porous or less smooth use some sunflower oil to coat the inside and rinse with cold water.Edit I actually did the cleaning part about  times. I didnt have to use oil so far so I cant give any experience on that.,Norse,db5jsgf,1,t5_2scl4

10058260,0,t3_5av9q3,The Faroese say Eg elski teg. But the Faroese are generally introverted and reserved so if a Faroese wants to put into words their romantic inclinations towards another person they will most likely say Mr dmar teg. Eg elski teg may also be used but the concept of love as well as hate is not a concept that is taken lightly and thrown around willynilly in the Faroes. And the least cringe worthy use of love in that context that I can imagine would be a mother expressing her motherly love for her children as in Mamma elskar teg.This should not be taken as law as it is only based on my subjective and perhaps narrowminded view on the matter.The Norse word ann has become unna in modern Faroese and has three meanings according the the online dictionary at Sprotin not grudge t.d. I do not grudge her success give el. allow oneself sth t.d. he did not allow himself a moments rest hatta unni eg tr you are welcome to it hon er vundsjk og unnir ikki Karini henda ga drong she is jealous of Karin and begrudges her her fianc eg unti teimum sigurin I think they deserved to win tey unna sr einki they are meanstingymiserlyniggardlyclosefisted tey unnau sr ikki at liva they were too miserly to live as decent life t mst unna tr svvn you must sleep hann unti sr ikki hvld he did not allow himself a moments rest ta er tr vl unt you are welcome to it speis. much good may it do you  gl. love be fond of like unna enem love sby be fond of sby like sby unna em vl be fond of mr unti Brynhild Buladttir kv.

10214935,0,t3_5m93vq,Hrek burns some people in the saga of Olaf Haraldsson. gt One evening Harek went on board with hishouseservants about eighty men who rowed the whole night andhe came towards morning to Grankels house and surrounded itwith his men.  They then made an attack on the house and setfire to it and Grankel with his people were burnt and some werekilled outside and in all about thirty men lost their lives.Same in Trygvasons saga. gt Then Queen Sigrid orderedan attack on them in the night both with fire and sword.  Thehouse was burnt with all who were in it and those who slippedout were put to the sword.Twice gt Then the king proceeded to Tunsberg and held a Thing at whichhe declared in a speech that all the men of whom it should beknown to a certainty that they dealt with evil spirits or inwitchcraft or were sorcerers should be banished forth of theland.  ... Now when they were all very drunkhe ordered the house be set on fire and it and all the peoplewithin it were consumed all but Eyvind Kelda who contrived toescape by the smokehole in the roof.,Norse,dc1x5i7,3,t5_2scl4

10307731,0,t1_dccaht8,Well niding or the norse equivalent in the exlamative form would be ok. Realize that insults would only be thrown to a get the insulted to challenge the insulter to a duel or b to make the insulted angry enough to make mistakes social in battle etc. Remember an unanswered insult ruins your reputation jeopardizing your afterlife and dishonores your clan. So not lightly made and always answered with violence. or you are shamed for eternityThis btw is the reason bards had prominent social roles in norse society. Bards were also almost magical in their trade bringing eternal glory or shame with their poetry.,Norse,dccfql7,1,t5_2scl4
10374758,0,t1_dcgrp0h,I would second Lars Magnar Enoksen. Hes not formally trained so he avoids a lot of the academic writing pitfalls of well academic books but hes super serious about it and really good. So his books are both accessible and dont have stupid mistakes and runic magic woowoo beyond the woowoo thats historically motivated of course.Well wikipedia says that the runologist Henrik Williams has apparently founds lots of problems with Runor Mstarens Handbok but Ive talked to Henrik about Enoksen and he was actually quite positive and the cited review itself is more ambivalent than the Wikipedia article on Enoksen would suggest...,Norse,dck1i6m,2,t5_2scl4
