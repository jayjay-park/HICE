10623057,0,t3_5s1dxt,The way i see this clip is that most of it looks fine but he has no reason to be looking through the wall at the enemy mid there. The way you check sandwich is you aim at the corner of it closest to stairs since thats where Ts in sandwich hold  of the time. Except he conviniently aims in the middle of sandwich and then traces an enemy thats behind sandwich in mid perfectly as he runs. Checked this in game and theres no occlusion in that part of the map so an aimlock is plausible.EDIT timestamp is s in not  my badEDIT  As a bunch of people have pointed out he knows someone is triple and was most just weird crosshair positioning trying to wait for the guy to peek him on the right side of triple and just unluckily lined up with the guy mid.

What I was getting at was that report bots are so cheap and since practically everyone who rage hacks which is a small fraction of the playerbase has acces to one now whether it be their own a friends or one they can pay a small amount for hell there are people on hackforums doing reportbots for free the number of rage cases going into overwatch has increased a lot. the kids youre talking about who cant change their crosshairs arent the ones rage hacking.,VACsucks,de79l98,1,t5_3f17t

All while using different VPN connections and usernames it was from people reporting him to reddit admins.Who would report new reddit accounts that are given mod to rvacsucks and actually convince the admins take action? I think mods of a top subreddit with k subscribers would be likely candidates.Consider that within min of the recent gong show cheat dev thread we had the csgo mod that ran the site was able to take his site down. That should give you an idea how close of an eye the rgo mods are keeping on this place if they smell Hacis account or CSGODemoReviews account Not me it is getting reported and the admins will actually listen because they are mods of a k subreddit.,VACsucks,dgcxqw8,8,t5_3f17t
