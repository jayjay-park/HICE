10599,0,t1_ceflb0i,I got think skin so be brutally honest I can take it  I was told sand is just more of a pain to keep clean not that it was inherently bad can you explain why plz?Also I work a lot and I get home late so how often do these baths need to be and does it matter what time they are? I dont wanna have to wake up Mojo for a bath when I get home  or  hours after lights offI noticed the temp on the therm. I have rarely changes so I was planning on getting another one anyway. As for my UVB it is a coil which I have read here is not the preferred so I plan on getting the ReptiSun . I believe it is. Also I read in a guide he only need to be within  inches of the UVB for maximum UVBage. Wouldnt enough light go thru the mesh to do the job? Cuz idk how I would go about putting a new light on the inside.I am not sure what the basking temp is but I will find out as soon as I can. Also I am going to a reptile show on Saturday  the th so Ill be able to get some stuff there Im sure. I was also wondering if there were any live plants I could get for him that they prefer specifically?,BeardedDragons,cefn3r8,1,t5_2sove

58320,0,t1_cekzvpk,I actually heartily recommend waiting on the bet visit.  They often havw high coccidia loads when going through relocation stress but get it under control naturally in a few weeks.  Treating a baby with harsh meds at that age will only increase and compound relocation stress issues.OP   days isnt much.  They often go two weeks in relocation stress and often eat little in that time.  Just keep offering food and baths.  Otherwise leave him alone.  He needs to settle.  You will have plenty of time to bond and get him used to you after that.,BeardedDragons,cel2jkg,4,t5_2sove

I already had researched the most common beardie issues and illnesses with my first dragon. Faranths impaction gave me the chance to use what Id learned.The Oxbow thing is a more recent discovery. I am feeding my older girl the HCC because its lower fat and she has fatty liver disease. When Faranth went into brumation there was an issue with her not having eliminated completely prior. I had to fight with her to make her have a poop and ended up trying the HCC because I knew that timothy hay was the st ingredient.

195698,0,t1_cf0lz9x,Honestly. Doing something like printing merlyns guide and showin it to the manager may be a good idea. Idk the store but if it isnt a giant corporation like petco or something they may be very open to accepting advice. Just asking if the guide can be put out at the store as a beardie guide for free maybe. Might enact some change. Especially if they go ahead and adopt the guide might would help with how they do their own set up. That would definitely be worth looking into. And with the animal control people idk if they deal with exotics per se. Im really not too familiar with em. Might try and see if they will take a formal complaint from you. But as far as getting them in trouble. The water bowl can lead to URIs. But not always and a pet store only has pets temporarily so it may be a loophole that they are exploiting. And I hate to say it. But if pet places are expected to bathe their dragons daily then unattended dragon drownings would probably skyrocket Tldr. Maybe try printing the care guide for em. And I have no idea about the rulesregulations that govern pet stores,BeardedDragons,cf0qc7t,2,t5_2sove
198856,0,t3_1wdzve,We actually feed these daily to our dragons but with greens. It is a good bulk food to fill up babies and keep them from nipping cagemates between feedings.

534655,0,t1_cg0hxst,Good to know youre working on it! If your bulb ends up too weak you can use certain household bulbs to get a higher wattageconcentration without spending  on one bulb. Ive been able to get nice strong heat out of halogens try to avoid energy savers if possible because they save energy by producing less heat.And if you get temps right and he still acts stressed if you havent already try papering  of the tanks walls. He doesnt have to watch for predators from as many directions that way and it can help him relax. Handle only minimally give  minute soaks every day and make sure he has plenty of time to dry before lights out.As long as he is eating and pooping daily and you get the temps right with the proper UVB reptisun . tube off amazon and a regular fluorescent undercounter fixture from walmart or lowes can be had for  total usually dont stress too much yourself some babies take only a day or two to adjust some take a couple weeks. ,BeardedDragons,cg11p8z,1,t5_2sove

603862,0,t3_211fcc,Odahviing had a crooked tail tip that was always dark. Honestly it doesnt look like an issue. When you rub the oil on is it right after a soak? Part of the purpose of rubbing in mineral or olive oils is that you do them after a bath to keep the moisture in. It could be that crick in the tail is making it harder to shed but soaking really should help it come off. Sometimes you end up needing to tweeze off scales that dont come off on their own after theyve been on too long. I know were told dont pick but it can end up being needful.,BeardedDragons,cg8wv67,3,t5_2sove

Push all of the dirt to one side of the bin about covering  of it and pack it down HARD. You do not want to to collapse if you dig at the side with your hand. Pack the everliving daylights out of it. Then you should be good to go. Be aware that a dragon can make it look like the soil was undisturbed by carefully packing it down with their head in order to hide their eggs.

Was she a juvenile when you rescued her? If you havent seen this page you should find it helpful in choosing appropriate foods for Chubs. Regarding your UVB assuming you dont have a reflector fitted she should be able to get within  inches of the bulb. I think having the vet check her for parasites is a good idea.

Ive seen lizard safe soaps before but if youre not getting the face eyes and mouth then I wouldnt worry. Dont get the head and use it with running water. All soaps contain chemicals even naturally occurring ones and none are really safe to soak in. Make sure you rinse really well and use very little.Ive only soaped a dragon once because she smelled strange she had health issues.

Something you can try doing is putting your hand in the tank and just leave it there for a couple minutes dont reach for him or try to pick him up just put it in there and leave it by him so he realizes that youre not a threat. Another thing you can try is to put a shirt in there that youve worn recently so it has your scent on it so he gets used to it. I put mine in his cave as sort of a mattress for him to sleep on. You can also try hand feeding him a couple crickets before you give him them all that way he associates your hand with something good. ,BeardedDragons,cqzj5ue,1,t5_2sove

4162918,0,t1_crmt26e,Hey Im sorry for the late response. I think there might be a couple things you could try First you could place a vivarium background around a plastic container thats plenty big for your baby to help with a sense of security. Four clear walls is pretty exposing which is scary for young beardies. Second depending on the color of the container and if you dust your crickets they may blend into the container and make it harder for them to see their food. Try feeding your beardie in a container thats under a basking lamp or UV strip. I pull my UV strip to the side of the viv and have my feeding container there. It gives her enough light to see and UV is important anyways and increases appetite but I doubt that the short period of time theyre in the corner actually makes a difference. To the same effect you could put a black pillowcase or something underneath the container while feeding. Make sure you dont overwhelm you baby with crickets. Start with one or two gently plopped into the container near their head. Theyre sensitive to movement and hopefully this will stimulate the excitement to eat. Finally if they wont eat the crickets in there try another favorite food. Prickly pears are rarely refused if you can find them. Maybe try Phoenix worms or pellets too. Dubia roaches are another favorite and are a phenomenal feeder for so many reasonsId recommend looking into it. If you can establish the behavior of eating in the environment theyll do it in the future. Remember that beardies are sensitive to change and it takes time for them to settle in. Between the new home and not having a set routine your beardie is under some stress. Just keep trying and eventually you will have success. A good option if they still arent eating is Flukers Repta Boost. Its a supplement that helps them meet their nutritional needs when they wont eat and also stimulates appetite. Its a powder you mix with water and feed by placing small amounts on their nose for them to lick off you can put it directly in their mouth but have to be careful as they can aspirate the liquid into their lungs which leads to RIs. Most importantly though is to make sure you get your beardie checked by an exotics vet. Usually this appointment should be scheduled for about two weeks from when the come home. Sometimes these behavioral things are harmless but you should have an annual check anyways so its worth a visit. Most baby beardies carry coccidia pinworms and many other parasites. Theyll also be able to give you even better advice and knowledge than I or the rest of the Internet can. ,BeardedDragons,crus637,1,t5_2sove
4182315,0,t3_38mv44,She does not advocate starving them. She just doesnt think they can eat that many. During the argument she accused me of getting all my info from strangers on the internet which is exactly what im doing lol. Although i have done my own research as well,BeardedDragons,crwzjqf,1,t5_2sove
4195997,0,t1_cryf4ec,Im so glad to hear it!! The UVB tubes are an absolute essential. Bearded dragons will stop eating and can actually die without sufficient UVB. I would suggest getting a UV meter when you can so you can continually check when your bulb is no longer emitting enough UV Rays. Its usually somewhere between  months after installation. The changing colors isnt too concerning. They tend to do that in response to stressbody tempexcitementetc. If you notice that your beardie is displaying stress marks or is consistently darker in coloration it does suggest something is offprobably temperature gradient. But if they fluctuate colors throughout the day theres no reason to worry. When they shed they tend to get a little more dull or dark looking. Giving your beardie a bath daily during shedding will help the process along. Use warm water for  minutes making sure the level is to their elbows and not above it. Many beardies love to swim so it should be a good experience for him. Hand feeding is a great way to establish a bond between you two. I do it every day with her greens. It helps with trust and reinforcement that you provide food which they like you for or so I believesome people think beardies dont actually feel affection but just tolerate interaction. I disagree with that view but thats beyond my point. Collards and mustard greens are a great staple. I use those or turnip greens and will add in some other veggiesfruits periodically. Im happy to hear youre going to the vet soon. Make sure you talk to your herp vet about your setup with lightingfeedingsupplements etc. so you can make sure youre providing the correct environment and nutrition. I could supply the information Ive learned from mine over time and am happy to answer questions but I dont have my DVM degree yet so they are better equipped to give advice and instructions. I would suggest even bringing a notebook to take notes about what they say. Also try to bring a fresh no more than a day oldpreferably less fecal sample. Testing for parasites is incredibly important with new beardies but also annually to make sure any bacteriaparasites are within safe limits. Most vet offices are also really great about answering questions over the phone as they arise so dont hesitate to call if you notice something is up or just have a general question. The Internet can sometimes give you answers but not everybody who gives advice actually knows what theyre talking about. ,BeardedDragons,cryjgst,1,t5_2sove

4256257,0,t3_39dy92,Ive been meaning to finally show my new beardie off on this form but been preoccupied.. I ended up cutting out a piece of  ply wood and cut my tiles to fit. I put industrial strips of double sided tape to hold the tiles down to the plywood. Also used a sealant grout in between the tiles to make sure no poopdirtfood gets in the cracks. I left about cm of space on all four sides so that I can take out the floor to scrub it down once a weekish. Also tile makes daily spot cleaning insanely easier! Tile is the best. Just heavyawkward to take out of the tank sometimes. Make sure to get rough textured tile to make sure they got grip and it helps with their nails.

4258652,0,t3_39nvki,I always buy two of the pods you can get about  worms each at once from a local reptile store and rotate them inout of the refrigerator so that I always have a supply of the large worms. This helps them to last longer once they start getting really big or run out of food. Ive found you can usually safely keep them in the refrigerator for a few days at most without any bad effect longer then that they may start dying off.

And if you think its not the heat then Ill keep the heat bulb back on then and try to figure out what else it could be.    Ive tried testing for eggs poop reflections etc. Those never ended up being the culprit of her glass surfing so I thought maybe its just because its a new environment. The glass surfing finally cut back after a couple a months but then its just started back up again. Maybe she does just need more attention. I let her out at least once a day but Ill try letting her out more often and see if that helps...

And may be just being picky and wants something else. This is of course if everything else is proven to be ok. Mine dragons sometimes skip a meal or two if they are going through heavy shedding.

Its a sign necrosis. Tight scales and early forced shed. Signs of pain or loss of feeling. When looking for heat itll be slightly above rest of body temperature and hard to notice. To check for loss of feeling gently increase pinch on area until jerked movement or you feel like you may break something. I know that sounds cruel but they cant talk to you so you need to be their advocate for health. If the injury doesnt get better or was getting better then gets worse etc. see a vet.

7601607,0,t3_4jelx1,Your going to want that uvb bulb and some calcium supplement asap. The slight damage and struggle to walk is likely MBD. Getting her on real good calcium and a proper uvb will stop the damage and help her immensely as well as prevent the other from starting that path. Also are they housed together? That could also explain why one is much smaller and possibly has issues. When living together they can fight for territory or food. As for loosing weight diet them with vegetables and you can make them swim as long as you watch them at all times. Just letting them run around outside the tank will help top.Edit  spelling is hard,BeardedDragons,d369ife,2,t5_2sove

8168022,0,t3_4r5bp6,Beardies diets change as they age and are extremely individual.  If your dragon is healthy and doesnt want food thats probably fine.  Some adult dragons eat as little as  or  of their diet as bugs and they may prefer to eat anywhere from every other day to twice a day.  As long as they are healthy and their temperature and humidity ranges are good they will basically eat what and when they want to as long as it is offered.The only thing to be careful of is to maintain a balanced diet if they eat a high fat diet for instance captive beardies can become obese however if they dont like bugs that is not likely to be an issue.  Also for vitamin balance fruit should be served with other veggies and not too often  of their diet.,BeardedDragons,d4yjwb2,2,t5_2sove

8483411,0,t3_4vush4,Funny storyWe got Yoda for our son at Christmas and trying to be responsible pet owners we attempted just about every fruit and veggie suggested in the sidebar.  He straightup ignored most fruits and would begrudgingly eat only a handful of greensspinach and kale mainly.I had been putting potato slices in his cricket enclosures since someone at the pet store had suggested porous vegetables to keep the crickets alive longer.  One day I was out of potatoes so I threw some slices of zucchini in there instead.  That night when we were tipping his crickets in I accidentally dropped one of the zucchini slices and he went for that first and then ate crickets.So the next night as an experiment my son and I put the zucchini and the crickets in at the same time and lo and behold he went right to the zucchini and left the crickets for later.  Nowadays when we make his daily salad we put the zucchini right on top knowing that hell eat at least that.From what Ive read beardies can be notoriously picky eaterswe just happened to find the magic formula by accident.  ,BeardedDragons,d61yzln,2,t5_2sove

Just need some baby wipes to wipe off the tile! I think I got my tile at Menards. Its slate I believe but you want to make sure if you get tile that it is not slippery.

I check it morning and night we are having a cold snap and unfortunately my babies are close to the door and it can get colder there. Working on furniture rearrangment but no one is as worried as I am. We seriously have to mess with the set up every few days because either the rocks get too hot or the air is too cool. We have two heat lamp bulbs that can move closer or further away they hang from a self we built and the CHE rests on the screen top along with the UV fixture. Then the dimmer gets adjusted quite often as well. Ahh the life of a happy pet must be nice to get so much attention,BeardedDragons,dc20arn,2,t5_2sove

10552373,0,t3_5qzve3,Your best bet would be a vet trip to assess whats going on the vet could also prescribe you liquid calcium I believe you are thinking of calcium gluboinate? too much calcium can be as bad as too little and its hard to accurately diagnose without an experienced vet. In the mean time as mentioned good UV is critical and you can adjust the diet to be naturally higher in calcium to rely less on supplements. Phoenix worms are a good high calcium feeder,BeardedDragons,dd48aoc,1,t5_2sove

10871962,0,t3_5vbk3p,Usually they will be fine but to answer your question yes I believe its possible to overfeed them. Even with proper lighting my derp dragon would occasionally stuff her belly so full that she would stop eating for a few days. I reduced her insect feedings by just a little bit and she hasnt had a food strike ever since.But anyway mine is an adult and young dragons like yours are supposed to eat a lot of insects. SpikyPancakes advice is spot on. Split your feedings to twice a day if heshe still feels bloated.,BeardedDragons,de1d5wx,2,t5_2sove

11173819,0,t3_5zgfqu,Try getting comfortable letting him crawl onto your chestshoulder when he gets nervous and is trying to get away.  When hes in your hands he feels extremely exposed and the desire to get on the floor is simply so he can control how exposed he is.  If he has the option of getting onto you he can press himself onto the side of a large object like he would a tree and perhaps even partially get underneath some of your clothing or your hair like he would foliage.  Allowing him to do this gives you a better option than restraining him in your hand and potentially dropping to the ground.  Give it a try slow and steady.  Youre both going to have to get used to each other!,BeardedDragons,deyjg8t,1,t5_2sove

11653209,0,t3_669v57,Ive had my guy for almost  weeks and was in the same boat. Hes about  months old and didnt touch food for almost  days with the exception of a few wax worms on the first day. Hes been defecating every day and it had the white urates so I took it as relocation stress. Ive heard people say it can take some beardies up to a month to settle in so have patience! My guys hates baths and isnt interested in crickets at all. Ive been feeding him calciworms everyday and he seems to love catching them now hes more comfortable around me though hell only  at once.  Hes only just started to move around his viv though he wont walk around on the ground just yet with me in the room. I guess it takes them time to get to know us! I tried the trick of wrapping and old Tshirt around a cork bark piece near his basking spot and I think it helped him get used to me. Who knows?!Ive also been using a pipette to drop water onto his snout every couple of days as he doesnt touch his water and hates baths does his best to escape!. I also cooked up some butternut squash and after it cooled blended it into a paste then fed it to him from a spoon to try help him get some liquids into him and to give him a taste of veggies. Seems to have helped. Good luck with yours keep offering food and try not to handle too much to begin with!Whats your set up like? Are the temps ok?,BeardedDragons,dggwm6b,3,t5_2sove

Not trying to be rude or anything im just trying to understand this more. If im doing something to hurt my dragon I definitely will do what I can to stop it. But I also thought giving one bath a week was good enough to keep him hydrated as water is absorbed through the vent but turns out thats a myth. So im just wondering if there is anything out there as far as evidence actually showing that the reflection messes with their eyes. Because if it does about  of beardies out there are screwed.,BeardedDragons,dgqxm4l,1,t5_2sove
