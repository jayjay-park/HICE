3845431,0,t3_34fnsg,Im sure youve read that the veggies need to stay below the brine level this is the anaerobic environment which they need to ferment. It really doesnt matter if you use a lid or cheesecloth but airflow isnt really good for the surface of the ferment. The CO that is created by the ferment is heavier than air which will act like a cushion on top of the brine protecting it from the oxygen. If you move the vessel frequently you could potentially lose that CO cushion and expose the surface to air which will cause a lot more surface mold due to the surface then becoming an aerobic environment which is what mold likes. If you use a lid be sure to keep it loose or the CO could build up and explode your jar. I had three heads worth of sauerkraut that I left down in my basement undisturbed for almost  months. I put it in one of these and then put another one on top inside of it filled with water to weigh everything down. I then cover it with a dish towel and put it in a large storage bin directly on the concrete floor which I believe helped regulate the temperature. There wasnt a speck of mold or flora on it and it was the best batch Ive ever had.,fermentation,cqum34b,1,t5_2r23z

In either case I generally do sugary drinks in plastic bottles because I dont have the equipment to measure brix and the risk of exploding glass isnt worth it for me. Soda will have more fermentable sugars left than either beer or kombucha so be prepared for a shorter bottling period and be more conscious of explosion risk even if you do bottle in plastic.

If its a crazy color like black or green Id worry about it potentially having released spores into the kraut juices.Id assume it was a harmless mold though so if you want to be safe remove an inch or so off the top of the kraut. The mold shouldnt penetrate the acidic juice too far even if it did release spores however so youre probably safe to eat whats below the top.,fermentation,cu7qb6o,1,t5_2r23z

They will get boozy there is not much you can do about that except to first allow it to ferment anaerobically then do an aerobic fermentation  that will allow the alcohol to convert to vinegar.

Worst case is it will slow it down a bit.  I like to taste it many times over its fermentation timeframe to get a sense of how the flavors develop.  You could see if its getting the pungency you want even now.   I guess what Im saying is there isnt really a point where it is done.

9968147,0,t1_db6hx71,Brown rice may be a bit different than white I dont know for sure. But white rice is used to grow all sorts of molds such as koji for making miso or sake. But that is a semicontrolled situation where you use a known koji starter to encourage the mold that forms is koji and not some other strain just floating in the air. Some Asian ferments also use rice as one of the ingredients but I have not had good luck with those so far.Chances are you had a perfectly good acidic ferment it sounds like it. The turmeric probably helped. But it seems risky to me based upon what I know about rice.

Aside from the original excerpt that youve posted in one publication what are your sources?I can tell you that the same excerpt is beyond a doubt wrong in stating that all beer is not probiotic. Wild ales typically contain pediococcus and lactobacillus. Additionally saccharomyces boulardii which someone mentioned earlier is a strain of saccharomyces cervesia which is brewers yeast.A SCOBYs makeup will vary greatly based on its environment as we all know so while we may not know what the probiotic content is from batch to batch it is almost certainly present. ,fermentation,dcmkz4f,1,t5_2r23z
