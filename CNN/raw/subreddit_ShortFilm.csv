26059,0,t1_ce9eaj5,Thanks! Yeah you got it.Working with the kids wasnt too bad. Both of them had been in features Hall Pass and Cold in July so they were pretty professional.It was nice having a lighter tone on set with such heavy subject material.,ShortFilm,cehedv6,1,t5_2slee

246929,0,t3_1wx884,So stylistically the lighting is a little flat for noir. Id suggest increasing the contrast for a chiaroscuro look.Also the smoking girl seemed really young. Was this intentional for the story or a product of limited resources?,ShortFilm,cf6cies,1,t5_2slee

771403,0,t3_22vt34,Id say you could get a much bigger emotional impact with a shorter version of this preview. Some jump cuts might add drama particularly when theres some aggression.  minutes is a very long time to watch one shot but  seconds would work well. Sobbing for a few seconds cut anger cut head on knees cut anger cut calm titles fade out. Dont dwell on anything.Best of luck with it  glad to see someone taking on a tough subject will keep an eye out for the finished product. ,ShortFilm,cgryo7c,2,t5_2slee

2910310,0,t1_cnydoya,Hey thank you very much for your feedback. With our first video we had issues with camera focus and audio issues and that it something we worked on for our second. So for our third we will focus on making the dialog smoother and more natural. Does anyone know of any tricks to achieve this without making the scenes feel rushed?We all learn from experience so we will keep making more videos and improving along the way ,ShortFilm,cnywrcn,1,t5_2slee

4179146,0,t3_38nynf,Nice! I really like the calmness of your shots. You dont let yourself get surprised by sudden movements of the subjects. I lioove your close ups!In editing however I have two suggestions. Use a voice over in stead of a text card. The text takes us out if the athmosphere. Try and find a friend uncle or whatever who has a pleasant voice and have him read it or her of course! that helps staying in the moment.. Try and avoid jump cuts as they interfere with the natural flow tou are trying to establish All in all great work!!,ShortFilm,crwmlj2,1,t5_2slee
