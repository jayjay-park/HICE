113736,0,t1_cer9z4o,Sry for the long wait lol. I fail. Um ok so idk the coords by heart but there is a big map in snowy valley when you enter from the portal. And the bottom right of it is my farm. Now to get there you follow the right hand side railroad youll see it. Then when you get to the end. Ull see something that says to rums farm. Follow that all the way. Then its easy. Just search some of the houses down stairs. Or u can wait for me to log on. Ill be on in the evening gtdirections?gtand I would be happy to add something if I find it,LiveCraftMine,cerdqj1,2,t5_2yhxx

4583554,0,t1_ct8cka8,Thanks! Ive actually had this happen to me before on a different server before. What I remember happening is when the server shuts down with a player still online it will actually create a new player file for them and ignores the previous one so its as if their entire player file is wiped clean.,LiveCraftMine,ct8cx38,1,t5_2yhxx
