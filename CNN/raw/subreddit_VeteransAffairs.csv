HR is just trying to find and excuse not to pay.  You should be entitled to that money because your an employee and thats part of you SALARY PACKAGE. They shouldnt care if your a veteran.   can be used for board meals and school supplies. ,VeteransAffairs,ctbsv0o,0,t5_2x1s6
6267518,0,t3_41fde1,Did you go to the VA office at the schools and fill out the necessary paperwork?  Did you do it every semester?  If so look in your school email for email from VAONCEvba.va.gov with the subject Confirmation  Enrollment Information Sent to VA.  Also if you have copies of the initial paperwork for each semester you can also go back to the school and ask why they failed to properly apply the financial aid from the GI Bill.Note that the email address may be different but I assume that there is some similarity among different regions.,VeteransAffairs,cz21pgn,1,t5_2x1s6
