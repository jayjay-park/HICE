2139015,0,t3_2jg6qb,Input delay is fine if it is really that noticable to you there is a difference in input delay as I do development on both iOS and Android devices but acting like you notice it in day to day use is simply hipsterish it is a difference of miliseconds. But fine if thats your reason for not liking a phone it is completely up to you I dont see the masses caring about that.The fingerprint sensor is worse on the note  it usually works on one try for me but sometimes a few its bad enough that I dont use it for unlocking and use my normal swipe pattern unlock I am used to. If the fingerprint sensor is a dealbreaker thats completely fine its just the same as how not being able to customize your home screens on iOS or use widgets is a deal breaker for me as a daily driver.However your build quality complaints are firstly opinionated but also bad opinions. I have used the Note  since Monday without a caseI just got a case today I would have a case with an iPhone or Note  because I drop my phone so often but the buttons are extremely clicky. First you said And its not just because more of the phone is made out of plastic the phone is made of metal and glass with a plastic back. The sides and  side buttons are metal. The home button isnt clicky when pressed from the top... I dont even know what this means. first its hard to even click it from the top versus another spot but its elliptical but I just pressed it from every spot and angle and heard and felt the same click... this seems completely made up. All the buttons have a click when I press them.But getting into build quality the iPhone  is actually in my opinion the worst build quality of any phone apple has produced and much worse than the Note . I have an i for development and I am using the Note  as my daily driver. The iPhone  feels absolutely terrible in the hand the wideness rounded corners and thinness make it just feel absolutely awkward. It feels very weird to hold the Note  feels much more comfortable to hold. Like I said if I was using it I would use a case either way but I dont see how anyone can feel like the  feels better to hold its actually one of the worst feeling phones to hold that I have ever felt and their decision to make it so thin and rounded versus the great feel of the s is strange to me. On top of build quality the device is extremely wide and EXTREMELY tall for no reason it has a smaller screen than the note  and just a ton of wasted space on the chin and forehead of the device there is no reason for it. I am shocked anyone that has used both could possibly think the i feels better in the hand. Also the protruding camera is ugly and awkward when laying it on a table. That being said I could actually care less about the build quality as long as its not completely horrible as I use a case I prefer a removable battery and i will use a case because of my butter fingers I just dont think you really used a Note  with the complaints you were talking about with build quality. I also dont see people noticing the sub  MS input delay as being noticable but if you really are that picky then fine. The finger print sensor sucks in comparison thats a fact. But your build quality issues are horrible.You glaze over the software being better. This is absolutely preference since I think iOS sucks for daily use you cant customize it its a pain to do normal computing tasks like downloading files the multitasking on the Note  is wildly superior with options to split view or create seperate windows. iOS  is buggy as hell in my experience on my iPad  and the  test devices I have for work for web development. It has crashes I get in weird app states and its been the most sluggish iOS to date though it runs well on the i and i but runs like garbage on my iPad .,galaxynote4,clbpskg,0,t5_2wxgg

Even though we all had appointments. Not a big deal but slightly annoying since I went on my lunch break.Picking up and activating the phone was super smooth. Traded in a Samsung Captivate that I had from years ago and with the gc combined with the gc from preordering I paid  today.They let me upgrade like normal just asked if I wanted to switch to NEXT but I said no thanks.

But whatever the case that colored my perception of the Note  and not for the better and that along with my other issues made me start leaning back towards iPhone.I am certainly not looking for other people to justify my decision to return the Note   I was simply offering my perspective and opinions as someone who owned one for a couple days.,galaxynote4,cldg1dt,1,t5_2wxgg

I also think black devices look more professional and expensive personally. I have a black Note  and couldnt be happier. The only downside of having a black device to me is that fingerprints are more visible as well as any scratches you may get. But since my phone is always in a case the scratch issue isnt really... an issue. This is just my opinion of course.

3180639,0,t3_2wk3ix,Rooting does in fact void your warranty.When you root the device you trip Knox which is the onboard encryptionsecurity. If you power your device off then back on while holding PowerVolDownHome itll take you to download mode. Youll see a line of text in the top left corner that says KNOX Warranty x this is the knox indicator. When the device has been rootedmodified this switches over to x. After that if you have any warranty issues and go to Samsung for assistance they wont be able to to anything. And once thats tripped its like that forever. Its an efuse and once a fuse is blown its blown for good. Also if you use your device for some corporate based activities tripping KNOX can now alert them that you have an unsecured device and have it removed from a corporate network.All that being said as udeathdealer said your mileage may vary as the carrier stores tend to be a little more lenient though I have seen instances where theyve started checking this as well. Ive seen a single case of a root user going to get a phone replaced through the carrier and wound up having to pay the deductible on their coverage. Sending the device to Samsung however would be a dead end.So the important thing to ask Why do you want to root? Its a risk vs gain scenario. The only reason Id rooted in the past was for performance gains over stock roms think back in the days of the S and adding back features my carrier removed such as mobile hotspot. Now however the devices are far more powerful and in my case my Note  has USB tethering enabled but not hotspot.. still confused by that TBH I havent felt the need to root. Though I wouldnt mind getting Download Booster. But in my case the risk outweighs the reward.Im also coming from the point of view of having used Lollipop on my S. Before the update my Note  ran laps around the S. Afterwards however the S is like a new device and smokes my Note. Samsung did a damn good job optimizing it and it shows. That only makes me more eager for Lollipop on my Note and worth the wait to make sure its done right instead of fast.For me I no longer have the desireneed to root. Thats just me however and every user is unique. I suggest weighing it out for yourself pros and cons and seeing how it would pan out for you. Best of luck!,galaxynote4,coro7hk,7,t5_2wxgg

While I dont use a glass screen protector I do use a regular one. The first day it was awful with the SPen using the black tip. Super sticky and even my finger didnt glide that well. I switched to the gray tip and it was super slippery. Almost TOO slippery. Anyways I used my phone for a few days and noticed my fingers were gliding like they used to so out of curiosity I put the black tip back on and it worked wonderfully. Im guessing the oils from your fingers sort of work in the screen. Its back to normal now with the black tip.

A lot of people dont plan their phone purchases like those that frequent this subreddit. When they decide to start looking they spend a little time and then choose the best phone based on their needs over a weekend. These include mostly people in their s.If a company can launch when no one else is then the commercialsreviews will be all about them. This means that the customer segment I mentioned above will be bombarded by the news about the newest and best phone.

5190131,0,t3_3m0ciu,Im currently using this official Samsung Qi back   and also the black coloured Samsung cover like the one in your link and wireless charging works flawlessly. I decided to go for the official Qi back as I still wanted to use NFC which I believe still works via the official back. Not sure if NFC works with third party Qi adaptors. One thing I will say is that even though my Qi back is official and roughly a couple of mm wider than the factory back cover it will fit inside the Samsung case but it doesnt quite fit correctly at the sides. This isnt really a problem for me as I love the look of the case all the buttons eg volume and power all work perfectly and there is still a nice raised edge so as to protect the screen if placed face down on a flat surface. As for Qi chargers it really is a buyers market. Got mine from Amazon its a Choetech charger and is just smaller in length than the note  and ultra thin although its led can be quite bright if sat around eye level eg beside cabinet.,galaxynote4,cvblotr,1,t5_2wxgg

Been streaming podcasts and music since I woke up. Played angry birds for about  minutes. Drove about an hour twice with the screen on the whole time using waze for turnbyturn. Casually used chrome twitter instagram amp baconreader throughout the day. With the exception of the navigation I was connected to wifi the entire time which helps. So not necessarily heavy use but  hours since the swap and Im at  remaining without plugging in once. Ill swap out again before bed tonight.Like others I believe that I killed my original battery by abusing rapid charge.

9602642,0,t1_d9wpome,For simplicity sake Ill just say it wipes user storage and reinstalls the current OS version with all updates up to that point. Thats one reason why the OS takes up an annoyingly large amount of space. There is the installed ready togo one in use but also a copy that can be used to do a fresh install.I personally prefer doing it via recovery but from my experience it doesnt actually make a difference which method you use. I suspect the button in settings is just a shortcut to that command in recovery. However I have no reference that proves or disproves that and I dont want to browse all the code to find out if that part is even Vanilla Android and open source,galaxynote4,d9wq05i,2,t5_2wxgg

9623507,0,t3_5ct2kg,Ive only had one issue GPS. Thing is I never had the issue until I moved to California a few months ago and have had the phone since it launched. Wife has a note  too identical issues that only started here in medical Silicon Valley. Google maps looses GPS lock over and over each trip this kind has draw backs when you have moved to a new state  and dont know your way around yet. Today we happened to drive past some Google offices not unexpectedly we lost GPS while passing a lovely Google GPS location pin sculpture on the office lawn. Used to work flawlessly. Guessing it has to do with the terrain here lots of hillsmountainsvalleys. Still appreciate this phone regardless.Need a new battery these days but thats easy to fix. ,galaxynote4,d9zanpo,1,t5_2wxgg

9718848,0,t1_daau1bc,Also  for future reference  you do not need to Root the phone to Carrier unlock your phone.  Most carrier locks are undone using Unlock Codes.  Now as to whether the codes are available from your carrier thats another story...One thing you can try is to use Odin  flash a Marshmallow rom for your exact Note  model.  Make sure you use the original one for your phone.If you dont have access to Odin  look for Kies  and there should be special recovery mode available  restorerecover Firmware or something like that?  I havent used it in a while.You will lose all your data if you use ODIN or Kies Recovery.Next time  backup your EFS partition.  Requires root.Rooting in general is safe  its when people start flashing custom ROMs that they run into trouble.,galaxynote4,dab24x8,3,t5_2wxgg
