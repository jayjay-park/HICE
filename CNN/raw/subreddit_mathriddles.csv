5258662,0,t3_3n0rqb,Heres one way of modeling it... Let the number of monkeys be xt.Number of monkeys produced every time a double happens is xt.Probability of a doubling happen is proportional to xt.So rate of new monkeys produced  dxdt  kxt.At t   there is one monkey. He produces one new monkey per  seconds. So k  .Solve the ODE to get xt  ckt. x   so c  . So to be more exact xt  t Since the number of keys typed per second is exactly xt we are looking for the point T at which the integral from  to T of xt  .lnT   lnT   T  exp T exp So T is extremely close to    seconds  . days.With all that said I dont think that this is actually the correct way of modeling this. The issue is that it is very sensitive to variance in the initial few doublings. This math seems to guarantee that any work can be completed in  seconds but in reality the first monkey is pretty likely to not even double once in that time. I do think that this is a good way of modeling the later stages. Clearly the monkeys will reach some asymptotic behavior eventually and it doesnt matter how long Hamlet actually is.,mathriddles,cvjuv01,2,t5_31j37
5294835,0,t1_cvof5tz,Correct!My thoughts for cyclic quadrilateralsOur method is going to be similar make our segment the longest side and keep everything on the same side of the segment. Now first well make a square of side length   this is the farthest above the segment that the center of the circle can get while it remains the longest side.. As we move the center down we keep taking only the parts of the circles that are above the segment as picturedsp Bad drawingThe union of all of this is just the circle we started with. Now note that everything will be contained in the square if the segment is at or above the center so we only consider cases where the segment is below. If both angles adjacent to the segment are greater than  the side opposite our segment would be longer. So we may eliminate one of the circular sections adjacent to the segment. We can also eliminate the top sector if a point on it was part of the quadrilateral it would be connected via a single segment to the initial segment. But the distance is more than  contradiction! So we cant have any points there either. Not sure what kind of region is generated for the fourth sector we have a nonempty but not complete subset of the points in it.sp,mathriddles,cvoh63o,2,t5_31j37
