Somewhere down the road Ill be using it with a mount a separate one  nothing to do with HTPC mount.I want to use my other computer as a HTPC because its just sitting there doing nothing. Plus its pretty powerful. I dont even have any media actually. I need help setting up right from start.

If I can do that then Ill be using the other  monitor to replace it. Ill use the ASUS for HTPC because its larger Yeah.. I wanna be able to watch and work at the same time. Plus it has to be that corner because thats perfect above it AND from my bed. I agree it might be too small from across the room. Thats why Im wondering if I should get a TV and mount it above the ASUS.As for the software I guess Ill use XBMC.

1044250,0,t3_25sr0x,gt I am a college student and have lately gotten into torrenting movies and tv shows. In case anybody is worried I am safe since I live in private housing and therefore connect via ethernet to the housings internet instead of the university. In other words its perfectly safe.First let me prefix this with torrents are bad not because theyre illegal they are regardless of how safe you think you are but because theyre easily monitored and generally slow. Usenet is a much better system but does cost a little money but it is well worth it. I live in Aus where we dont get shows or if we do we generally have to wait  months for it on a paid subscription If I had the option to watch shows when they actually aired legally I would go that route.gt came across the idea of having a HTPC with a server or NAS not sure the difference that through SickBeard CouchPotato and Headphones can download torrents. I found this super cool and immediately thought why not this would be awesome.The difference between a NAS network attached storage and a server is their role. Basically a nas only holds data nothing else but a server can do just about anything you want of it. I had a NAS but have changed it to a fully fledged server because of what it brings to the table.  I have my sabnzbd nzbdrone better than sickbeard imo headphones and couchpotato all installed on it. I have the file services role configured for data deduplication this allows it to scan the files and remove duplicate data on the bit level so an example would be it takes all the introcredits of a tv show out of the actual file size because it uses the one file for everything ive saved GB or  so far. the programs listed above will automatically download move and rename everything I want as soon as its available and update my xbmc ready for when i get home a.k.a. fully automated.gt One potential issue is that I live the majority of the year in a dorm room in college. I have a ethernet port in my room but would hookup my laptop to it for faster internet access. With my new Hackintosh build I would plug that in instead. Not sure if the NASserver could share a port with the hackintosh.what youre looking for is a switch. Not going into details on this but any gigabit switch will do I suggest netgear.gt As I see it there are two options Since Im building a Hackintosh I was thinking of just getting a huge hard drive to store my torrents natively. I would keep searching them on piratebay manually like Ive been doing and downloading them to uTorrent. The problem with this is that this takes time and requires me to be at my computer to download them. Plus I would have no organization of my torrents this way.gt I could build a server or NAS. As I said before I truly dont really understand the difference since often times the terms are used interchangeably. What I would want would be a TB box for now that I could expand to a little bit in the future. I want to setup Couchpotato Sickbeard and Headphones and have the ability for my to search and pull up tv shows and movies to download controlled by my Android phone I have the NZB  app. In addition I have no clue what software and operating system makes sense. I am leaning towards FreeNAS but still like how with UseNet you can just place drives in to expand very easily. I am also thinking of putting my photos and music on the serverNAS thing too but am unsure. Yes you could but you could also go and buy a TB external drive and do the same thing for about  less. I feel you are very confused about all of this. Let me define some terms for you. Usenet is a old bulletin board system that is now mainly used for posting files such as movies and tv shows for people to download. They are hosted on massive server farms and have crazy fast internet it will almost always max your connection. FreeNAS is a modified version of FreeBSD which is a form of Unix.I tried Freenas and using ZRAID but found it clunky and limited what else I could do. I dont think its what you want.Now that we have that out of the way may I suggest windows server  R as the OS for your server. It has the nice features I described above and is fairly easy to use as compared to other server products. They have a trial so please dont torrent it just buy it once you figure out if its what you want. Build a PC with atleast  sata ports on the motherboard for the required HDDODD etc. Install server on it  Configure a software RAID which version depends on how many drives but I suggest RAID parity. This will put all your drives into one massive drive and from there all you need to do is configure some shares and hey presto youre good to go. I have separate shares for things like Movies TV Software Documents Music etc. This works perfectly for my gf who has a   iMac. Configure your media centre e.g. XBMC to connect to the shares.  ??? ProfitHonestly this will do everything you will ever need it to do I suggest you invest in some decent hardware such as a newer i or even better i processor and the seagate nas drives theyre the best nas drivesIf you have more specific questions please dont hesitate to let me know and I will try to clear anything up.TLDR Torrents suck. Usenet is awesome. FreeNAS is limiting. Windows Server  R is the baws of its domain no pun intended well maybe a little. Switches make one ethernet port available to many. Ask me if youre confused. Youre confiused.,htpc,chmzi2g,2,t5_2rbfy
1051538,0,t3_264tqx,ok so I admittedly just have a paltry WHRGN and Centrino AdvancedN  chipset in my laptop and I have to say I much prefer wired. I say this not because I cant stream p content but I dont experience a lag during the initial buffering on XBMC.With wireless there was a considerable delay of  to  seconds whilst it started a movie and that gets quite noticeable when the curtains are drawn lights are down etc. When I finished wiring the house with GigE cabling the lag went down to about  seconds. Much more acceptable and the wife acceptance factor went up by a factor of ten.Another feature that suffered when using wireless was simultaneous use. Whilst watching TV and the likes I was pushing ISOs and OVAOVF files around the network and onto my laptop. Bandwidth was notably constrained and when HTPC data was offloaded onto cabling the difference was like night and day.tldr wireless sucks when you start to push the boundaries of it. Get cabling.,htpc,chntbzo,1,t5_2rbfy

1108007,0,t3_26sn2i, owner here. currently using MSI Z Atx board with a Gtx  however with a full atx the OD is not an option. I decided to reuse the board so i opted out of the BluRay drive. Fantastic case. I mean it is absolutely amazing. But you are right the OD is an issue especially for nonfrequent builders and even for frequent builders the brackets and pieces will give you fits but is very doable with patience. It is my HTPC  Steam box. The only issue i have which wont really be a help in a lot of HTPC cases is during gaming the  fans MSI TF can be heard but it is a non issue for me as its comparable to the  fan noise. but during regular HTPC use it is near silent and ive maxed out all fan slots.I was very tempted by the silverstone case options as well but I am very very happy with my purchase.You may swear while putting together the OD but in the end you will be happy with the end result.,htpc,chu8kuh,1,t5_2rbfy

1538015,0,t3_2bu0qj, Rip DVDBluray  You need the following  a PC with AnyDVD HD to kill the decryption on the discs and Handbrake to encode the disc content from the bulkyinconvenient disc format to .mkv or .mv files using x.h. format and native DTS or Dolby or more compact AACAC audio.  I am currently using an old PC with a wolfdale E processor  years old and it takes about hrs to encode a full Bluray.  Be aware that Handbrake is not capable of including subtitle tracks on .mv.mp files in any way other than burning in meaning you cant turn them off and also that when using Handbrake to encode .mv.mp remember to check the large file size box.  Use the  setting for the constant quality slider on the video for bluray and  or  for DVDs.  I always use mkv because it eliminates the problems mentions above with handbrake and mvmp files.  As for the Bluray drive I kind of recommend getting an external USB one so you can use it with any PC you want like the one upstairs that you dont have to listen to while youre trying to watch TV. record live TV  There are countless ways to do this and Im no expert since I dont personally do it.  Ill leave this for another person to fully answer but Ill say the Synology NAS devices are capable of providing this service when connected properly and youll probably want a Synology NAS anyway since they are the best NAS for home media streaming imho. stream netflix amazone prime hulu etc  You want a Roku  and wire your home network with gigabit ethernet cables its really not hard and if youre incapable get a geek friend to help you do it cleanly and pretty  wifi works but ethernet cable eliminates so much potential difficulty.  The Roku  has Netflix Hulu Amazon InstantPrime HBO Go with cable co subscription and a ton of free channels like Crackle bunch of older pop movies that are now modern classics TED you know TED Talks... watch them NPR Tiny Desk Concerts currently at  of them on there to watch in HD for free Youtube and finally DS Video from Synology that will beautifully make use of the Video Station app on a Synology NAS which makes your streaming files look like a neflix style approach with full information like actors producers year a movie poster etc etc.  It plays .mkv or .mpmv files encoded in h. and ACDDDTS surround just beautifully.  It even remembers where you left off if you exit the channel and come back later.  It lets you search by anything or browse by actorproducergenrenewlyaddedetc.  Get it.  Free.  The other cool thing is that it doesnt require a highpower pc to transcode files on the fly thats how Plex works in case somebody mentions that  and keep in mind transcoding a movie on the fly and trying to encode a bluray rip at the same time would require top of the line modern hardware.  Its just your storage device and your Roku player.  That lets you turn off a power hungry or noisy PC.  Also Video Station on Synology has sections for Movies TV Shows and your homerecorded media so it should facilitate your recording needs. play home media on TV  See above Synology NAS running Video Station  Roku  running DS Video Channel.  Best Ive found yet. download media and play on TV.  Theres no way to say this easily but short of streaming it from places like amazon or netflix this is not legal.  With that said its doable but takes a lot more effort.  DO NOT use torrent as that is a singlehanded way to attract attention from the authorities.  What you want is a newsgroup provider Giganews is one of the best and they have various plans of various download allowance as well as VPN to their servers so you cant be monitored a newsgroup downloader Newsbin is what I used when I was doing this and it worked great  would download all the  individual rar chunks of a given media and then autounrar them and put them where I specified.  You can also set download speed limits so it doesnt choke your connections ability to stream and a way to locate what youre  looking for.  This is done via things called NZB files which are basically like little index files that you can locate and those index files will tell your downloaders like Newsbin where to get each individual piece of the media youre trying to download.  As for where to get the NZB files this is in constant flux since the authorities are chasing down various sources one at a time but you can just google nzb search sites and find some to try.  The reason I say not to use torrent is because torrents are specifically being monitored by the mediacops since torrenting is generally arranged with quotas meaning you have to reshare the same shit youre trying to download and that is what gets you liable for charges  once youre sharing content without license youre providing stolen intellectual property and theres gonna be a record of it.  Also there are some mediacop type folks that will publish something popular and watch who is getting it just to trap those people.  Then the only thing protecting you is your ISP and whether theyll pass your name along to the mediacops.  With newsgroups youre simply downloading something.  Its a hell of a lot more difficultstickydifficult to charge something with merely possessing stolen IP as opposed to providing it to others.,htpc,cj92cqc,2,t5_2rbfy

It havent messed with XBMC for a year or two now besides some fusiontvaddonschannel setups I do for people so dont quote me on this to hard.If you arent using Plex because of addons I guess that is a fair assessment.  I dont really use addons but any of the ones I dodid use for Kodi are also for Plex so I cant really comment on the addon selection.If you have to use both auto library updates on both would easily keep libraries consistent and if you want to sync watch status and what not there are addons for both traktv comes to mind to do so.My original point was just using one or the other or both but not PleXBMC may offer a better solution to the OP or anyone else with these issues.  There are a couple of people that hangout in our IRC channel that have tried PleXMBC at one point or another and it always ends up getting ditched cause problems keep popping up and at this point Plex has come along so far that isnt much that it doesnt offer that Kodi does minus PVR stuff and some addons.I understand that there may be some solutions everyone has different setups tweaks likes and dislikes where PleXMBC may be the best choice but for OP it didnt seem to be working and I see that a ton when it comes to PleXMBC so I was just offering solutions that I see most people end up doing when PleXMBC becomes unreliable for them.,htpc,cnycgtx,1,t5_2rbfy

3484262,0,t1_cppe9wo,There are a couple reasons for using the PC in place of a dongle of some sort on the k tv. The main one is so I have a seamless experience thats easy for anyone to pickup and use without having to fumble through inputs. In my mancave you turn the tv on and you can watch movies tv shows or play games from that one screen.nd reason is for the EPG for live TV. I have a HD Homerun which works nicely with the Kodi EPG. I could probalby use the hd homerun with an android app but I would lose the recording capabilities.I tried to design it so that nontechnical people my fiancee can pickup the controller and get to where they need to go without having to fumble through inputs.While youre spot on that an always on pc is a power draw its a compromise Im willing to pay for.

3635729,0,t1_cq6mnmk,Well a traditional HTPC can do stuff such as act as a DVR and actually record content as well as stream live content a little better and a little more legitimately via the use of a TV Tuner etc.   Depending on what kind of HTPC you build you could also do full on PC gaming run Steam Big Picture Mode etc.   They will also allow you to browse the Internet play Flash videos and do just about anything a normal PC can actually do.As far as codec issues I havent run into any.   Again I stream all of my stuff and the non NetflixAmazonHulu stuff I stream from the Kodi addons are all encoded in formats that have no problems with the FireTV.   I cant speak to formats that people rip their media into manually but there are probably some that the FireTV has issues with.   Again I havent run into it.The one draw back to using an external drive is the Amazon Fire TV will only accept FAT USB Drives you cant store files larger than GB on a drive that the Fire Tv can read.  You can get around this by splitting the file into rars  but that takes time and it infeasible for people that have large libraries.I am not sure if hooking up the NAS directly to the FireTV is the best solution.

4054721,0,t1_crigle7,Let me try one sec. Alright Im actually pretty surprised with the result. As it stands now I keep my media on my regular desktop half on a  TB internal and half on a . TB external drive. I usually just run Plex and use the Plex client on whatever Im viewing media on. But I already have some network shares set up and they include my media so I decided to give it a try. The first problem I encounter if I try to do this is I cannot access my external drives share from a nonwindows client. Im not sure what Im doing wrong but its never worked. The only media I have on my Internal drive is my anime so I tried that. I accessed the share with an app called Solid Explorer and played the file itself with MX Player. I have to manually switch the decoder to Software because the file Im playing Episode  of anohana p encoded with H.  in an MKV container doesnt play audio with hardware decoding. This is a problem Ive had on my android devices so its not Shield specific. As for the streaming itself its surprisingly flawless. Loading up the initial video takes a few seconds but then after that seeking is nearly instantaneous and there is no evidence of any kind of lag. That said Im running on a  GHz network on a fairly beefy router thats hardwired over gigabit to my desktop and is in the same room as Im currently in. Im certain I could not replicate these results over a . GHz network. The Shield TV even has gigabit ethernet so you could probably stream a bluray remux just fine and the processor would likely be able to handle that. Hope this helped!

You can have an HTPC on your main TVprojector with all the bells and whistles and use a Roku or nvidia shield or whatever on the other TVs.Its a matter of how much work you want to do and how much money you want to spend in exchange for how fancy you want things to be.For your front end you probably want to look at Kodi themes and pluginsThemes    Addons      ,htpc,d8y5e4b,1,t5_2rbfy

Theres no particular reason to have the HTPC plugged directly into the TV if theyre comfortable using the Plex app on their TV.

11100060,0,t1_deq5zbo,gtis the Roku client streaming local media hosted by the Plex Server HTPC in this case?Yes. The Plex server provides the stream to the Roku. Its also smart enough to transcode audio and video as required on the media server so the Roku can play it back. So if you have a movie with DTSMA surround sound and youre streaming it to a TV or device that doesnt support DTSMA Plex is smart enough to take care of that for you.gtWould there be a benefit in using the HTPC as a Plex server if someone already had media in a NASThe advantage would be if the NAS does not have enough CPU power to handle your transcoding needs but thats pretty unlikely. If youve already got a NAS you can often install Plex Media Server directly on the NAS device and it becomes the media server. If you are needing a lot of transcoding because youre streaming large bluray rips over the internet or something youll need more CPU grunt than a NAS can provide.,htpc,deq6kh9,2,t5_2rbfy

11681632,0,t1_dgj8ft2,I ended up refunding it. I was having nothing but problems with it losing mapped keys. Some keys would work with Flirc others would need to be changed every single time I changed to a different input. The software also wouldnt let me add a delay and then reinitialise an input on my AVR which bitstreams. At the end of the day I was using a  remote to turn my Xbox One an amp on and change input on a TV. I couldnt justify it. It also wouldnt turn the ampXbone off and switch back to a different input on the TV. It was a lot of small things but the kicker came with it not remember Flirc commands. I figured I could achieve better results with a  eBay remote than this and the rest of the control was too reliant on the touch screen and just wasnt worth the asking price. Which is a shame as the remote itself and the software was absolutely amazing. I might try and pick up an Ultimate or lower on sale down the line. And Flirc performance was horrible. The Gen  works with zero lag with an ATV remote but the Harmony was just woeful. I knew this going in but I didnt expect it to be that bad. I read there was a fix but by this point with it dropping commands I just called it a day. ,htpc,dgk4ohy,1,t5_2rbfy
