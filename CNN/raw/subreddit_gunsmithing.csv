3564656,0,t1_cpyl5q8,Remember I am just a person on the Internet .YMMY. IF I was going to drill and tap a barrel I would use something with a small thread pitch so I could get as many threads into as shallow of a whole as possible. x is a pretty common scope base screw. You only really need three threads to secure a screw so you could probably get away with a x.  As far as making sure that the base is square and top dead center you need a mill and a mechanical edge finder. I know you said you want to avoid gunsmith fees but a professional really would need to do this  and it would probably be around  to do depending on where youre at. ,gunsmithing,cpylijl,6,t5_2s0st

7602438,0,t1_d3693m0,most home improvement stores do not carry any tools youd use to work on firearms short of things like the drills themselves or sanders or whatever. things like taps dies screwdrivers these all need to be gotten elsewhere unless you can find specific stuff. hollow ground screwdrivers for instance. this tap alt link at midway just about any tap handle will work for the most part so long as it goes down to a small size to grab the tap itself. tapping lube can be found at most hardware stores.  drill bits midway are also usually not found in regular stores. if you have a local machine supply shop they might have such and even the tap and what not but theyre probably not going to be cheap.,gunsmithing,d36cwil,2,t5_2s0st

I still dont have much knowledge of how a gun works so maybe a AR would be a good starting point. I did talk with my buddy about building other older rifles.

Put a cleaning rod down the barrel and gentle tapped it out. The case was not split in any way but was over expanded. So problem fixed. Thanks for all your help. ,gunsmithing,dd23w3z,1,t5_2s0st
