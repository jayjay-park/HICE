190785,0,t3_1w6068,It really depends on the crisis.  Some conferences like BMUN are more dependent on standing out in your cabinet and knowing your powers while properly utilizing them that said I didnt feel like sims at that conference gave me a ton of freereign and ignored my person slightly despite him having big significance in the cabinet.Other conferences like CIMUN kinda have a choose your own adventure type approach to the simulation.  Theyve been planning out that simulation for a year you definitely have a ton options for what direction the committee is going but they wont let you throw a wrench in the the entire crisis scenario because other committees depend on the outcome.Finally theres conference like CMUNCE which I found myself interacting more with simulations than other delegates.  That committee was la cosa nostra making it more fantastical than most but I found they wanted to see us be ruthless and not afraid to back stab our fellow delegates for our own gain.  Mind you that was the mafia committee.Overall just make sure you talk a ton its rough to adjust to the first time but rules are more relaxed talk as much as you can.  You need to stand out no matter what.,MUN,cf064z6,1,t5_2saa5

3617385,0,t3_31qoz2,I really like business based JCCs in which each side has the opportunity to compete and interact in almost every aspect and its not too difficult for people to learn the basic concepts.Im currently mostly finished with writing a Lockheed Martin v.s. Boeing JCC but Im considering turning it into a way and adding a U.S. military committee that would be fighting a crisis force probably an established ISIS or Russia of course. I think this would create an interesting dynamic because the two defense companies would largely be ruthlessly competing against each other to win the support of the military force which is more concerned with their crisis based conflict but will have to deal with the frustration caused by the competition of the two companies at the same time.I hope itll be fun for all sides and teach an important lesson about how ruthless business practices can hinder overall progress and hurt everyone involved in the long run. ,MUN,cq4lw5n,2,t5_2saa5

6903328,0,t3_4a9v4v,One thing that my club does at the beginning of the year is collect a list of random nouns put them on the board and then force each delegate to speak on that noun for a minute. It helps people get comfortable with procedure delegate speech and speech confidence while not worrying about researching in depth about what they are talking about. I dont know how common this practice is but it helped our group a bunch.,MUN,d0yt7s4,1,t5_2saa5
7984614,0,t3_4ol6y3,Alright so I have some experience setting up my schools MUN club we went from  members and  conferences to  members and  conferences in a year and a half.We didnt use any flyers we basically just abused a group email called allstudents which emails all the students in the school. Just keep sending out information emails telling people what is going on in your club if signups for a conference are happening etc. Also set up qampa sessions for what MUN is This helps people who might be considering it but have no idea what it is. Dont be afraid to have your email blocked Itll happen eventually. Instead of flyers try to set up posters in popular areas for the qampa sessions or for any other important meetings.Most importantly dont ignore anyone from being a potential member. Shy people can turn into powerful public speakers once given a country and a cause to defend and those athletic and popular kids can either turn out to be a great help in recruiting others. Be careful not to piss anyone off bad publicity sucks.Are you using an MUN committee system with coordinator support or are you purely studentled?,MUN,d4djo62,1,t5_2saa5

10521489,0,t3_5qn3dz,No never admit youre wrong.  Rather just give the normal dprk bs great socialist leader loves all citizens all citizens are happy bs  and actively stall any reso which tries to come out calling for increased Human Rights. You could also work with the opposing bloc to the main bloc or whichever bloc seems to try to push for a reso. Basically stick closely to stance remain delusional and spout dprk propaganda denying Human Rights violations and work together with opposers of the reso being submitted to torpedo it. Good luck and have fun! ,MUN,dd0q39a,4,t5_2saa5
