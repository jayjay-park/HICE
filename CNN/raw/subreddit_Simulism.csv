737352,0,t1_cgibjtf,I love the idea of infinite regress like a fractal with infinite complexity at every level of resolution. I skimmed over the article when I have time ill read it all in entirely but I also agree that infinite regress is a logical necessity the way I imagine how reality exists is having an infinite series of recursive loops within this infinite regress. Imagine our reality creating virtual reality V that reality creates V and so on because its infinite eventually down the road Vx becomes ontologically identical to our perceived real reality. This is just one loop there could be infinite of these loops of self creation. When you subscribe to this view the question of what was there originally that sparked all this existence now becomes irrelevant  because its a cycle without a beginning or an end.What is this mysterious medium that enables these realities to exist? is it some exotic supercomputing device? the information projected at the edge of a black hole? I answer this the same way you would ask what medium to you require for a mathematical equation to exist? a mind that conceptualizes it? a reality that exhibits the equation? a computer that calculates it? my answer is it needs none it exists on its own level of existence just the same way we exist at our level of existence. The equation can simultaneously exist by itself or the infinite other ways it can exist with conjunction with higher complexity systems.Now imagine us our reality your consciousness. It exists on its own while simultaneously existing in virtual environments created by exotic multiverses computed on turing machines futuristic playstations the edge of black holes inside conways game of life simulation inside a mathematical fractal inside the digits of PI because the series is infinite with every possible numeric combination existing that maps to your perceived reality and any other infinite number of ways information can be stored at information that is ontologically identical to your existence just like that mathematical formula and there is nothing you can do to figure out which system you exist on you are existing on an infinite possible ways that can create you including the empty one where its just you and your experience.It would not be relatively difficult to recreate your existence I would need to know the informational representation of your brain structure throughout your conscious existence and the informational sensory feed input that gets streamed into this brain structure and presto I created your existence in every way identically to you experience of this existence. You exist identically in this reality while at the same time also in my conjured artificial simulated reality of you.Ok Im done for now ,Simulism,cgo3a9i,2,t5_2t3w3
