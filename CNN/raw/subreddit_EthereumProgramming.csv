4729092,0,t1_ctqkae6,Hi Im the developer of Embark.First of all I would like to invite you to try both and use what you think feels best to your use case in other words use the tool you feel is best for the job you have in mind.In comparison to Embark Truffle uses TestRPC and Pudding. I have issue with some of the stuff in the readme in the sense that they imply differences with embark the things described in platform agnostic language agnostic configurable directory structure and tests Embark can also do. Unlike Truffle though Embark is quite advanced in how it deploys contracts and you can develop advanced dapps easily.Feel free to pm me or join the gitter channel if you want to know more. ,EthereumProgramming,ctqn5ma,1,t5_39d86

Just install this in your project directory first ,EthereumProgramming,curouh7,2,t5_39d86

However contract systems can of course also be locked down to be static and permanent once youre positive they will never again need upgrades  which probably wont be until after serenity and sharding Dapple is designed for testdriven development. The Dappsys standard library is a unixinspired library of singlepurpose specialized contracts and already has a lot of really useful stuff. Dapple and Dappsys are being used to develop MakerDAO which will be having a lot of money at stake so the code is being developed and tested with extreme care and focus on security. Lots of amazing stuff is still being developed for Dapple including chain forking to test the security of upgrades to live systems one of the things necessary for Maker as it will need to be upgraded after it is already running and potentially tracking millions of dollars in value Dapphub dapples IPFS based package manager as well as a dapp explorer service is going to be super awesome among other things it will be able to autogenerate a GUI for your dapp when youre developingtesting and it will also give you freeinstant source code uploading to the dapp explorer so users can easily verify the security of your dapp and maybe even code verification at some point in the future. Tons of other reasons! It is maintained by some of the best Ethereum developers in the community and receives support from Maker which is by far the most ambitious and complex dapp in terms of contract code. If your goal above all else is to make sure your dapp becomes as good and elegant as it can possibly be use Dapple.,EthereumProgramming,d2x56o7,3,t5_39d86
