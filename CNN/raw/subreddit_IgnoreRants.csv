8726009,0,t3_4zcahs,Sooo Jehovahs Witness pala yung may mga dalang streamer pa minsan sa mga palengke tapos nagbabasa ng bible verses nang pasigaw? I mean I commend their eagerness to do those things in front of many people but sometimes I hate the fact that they publicly ridicule some sect while reading verses. Naalala ko one time naglalakad ako sa palengke tapos pinapahagingan nila ng patama yung Iglesia ni Manalo and somehow somewhere may Kapatid na lumapit. He told him to stop and they started throwing verses to each other like mad men and I was just there standing contemplating about how one book made a lot of shitstorm in this world.,IgnoreRants,d6we68u,1,t5_3fo8a
