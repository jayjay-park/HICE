5991738,0,t1_cy4ys3o,I think this sadly is a sign that Walther is moving away from paddle style mag releases altogether. Any PPQc or P M will probably be a button release. ,Walther,cy51qby,4,t5_2xbuk

6747168,0,t1_d0h6ekf,My first gun was a glock . I absolutely love the crisp trigger break of the glock. My wife isnt a great shot but with the glock she is capable of shooting decent groups.Ive basically narrowed it down to either the g or PPS m as my next purchase. The three things Walther has going is higher capacity out of the box every walther Ive held the grips have felt very comfortable and its at least  cheaper than a g. On the other hand Ive never had an issue with any glock Ive shot I know exactly what Ill be getting from glock. Ive never shot any Walthers and havent seen them at either range in my area. Im not planning to rush out and get one so Ive got time to continue looking to rent both.I definitely vaule concealability  over capacity. Im a big weight lifter who is far outside of normal clothing sizes most jeans dont fit my legs. This leads me to wearing athletic clothing  of the time when Im not working. I need something light enough it hides under a tshirt and athletic shorts. If I ever need more capacity Ill grab the g.Thanks for all the info. Ive yet to get any negative feedback on the PPS. Seems like its a fantastic little gun.,Walther,d0h7pem,2,t5_2xbuk
7109483,0,t1_d1lxbuw,Incorrect. See my other post.,Walther,d1m8ngk,1,t5_2xbuk
7138725,0,t1_d1p4as3,I know that it is an issue and I am not downplaying that fact. But if it is not an issue of correcting the grip then she might just have to develop a callous.I have a Cz accutarget that would run my finger raw! It was the way that the trigger was curved it just wasnt right for me. I was fortunate enough to be able to get a flat trigger which solved the problem. I have heard that apex has a trigger kit for the pps maybe they have a different styled trigger as well like they do for the shield. ,Walther,d1plgbi,1,t5_2xbuk
7285413,0,t3_4f6nga,got any pictures? Id like to see what the extension looks like as I dont see it pictured on the page because they dont offer it I assume.,Walther,d26awno,2,t5_2xbuk

7859652,0,t3_4mtsad,I stopped keeping track but Ive got around k rounds thru my M and havent noticed any abnormal wear that needs replacing. The outside of my extractor did develop a bit of rust but some oil and a brush took care of that. I was shooting some nasty ammo at that time. ,Walther,d3zhuxy,1,t5_2xbuk

8092164,0,t3_4q0ncy,The texture is the same. The PPS has a very similar pattern with where the fingers should naturally fallline up. When you held the PPQ did you mash your fingers together?When my girlfriend fires my PPQ she has her support hand fill the spaces that are made by her right hand when holding the grip. I only bring her up cause she has small hands and has adjusted her purchase on the gun. Might be worth another try for you to hold the PPQ again. Best of luck either way,Walther,d4pms66,1,t5_2xbuk

9199401,0,t1_d8i33wn,Oh I know. I lock horns with them frequently. Glock is a friggin religion at this point not coincidentally especially among those who already seem predisposed to such faith  But more generally the amount of dogma that passes for actual objective truth in the firearms community is utterly insane. Ive only been studying ballistics firearms and mechanics now for a year and I already see a tremendous amount of bullshit out there in the firearms press and among socalled operators espousing their knowledge far and wide on YouTube. ,Walther,d8i3beu,1,t5_2xbuk
9362311,0,t1_d92pzxw,I carry the  inch AlienGear Cloak MOD dont have a holster for the . Owning both I dont see a real reason to increase draw time by carrying the longer barrel. There are some holsters for the  inch and you can also find some  inch ones with an open bottom allowing the extra inch to extend. You may want to search for ones that fit the Q Match. It has the exact same dimensions but the slide is already milled for a dot. The  inch PPQ will fit in any Q Match holster.,Walther,d92qnu5,3,t5_2xbuk
9674855,0,t1_da5ccbj,Sorry I meant that I installed them from right to left so were in agreement that they should come off from left to right.,Walther,da5mna1,2,t5_2xbuk
9737186,0,t1_dacmoni,This. Aside from the stock sights which are adequate the PPQ is the best damn striker fired gun on the market. Full stop. ,Walther,dadbk41,1,t5_2xbuk

10076852,0,t1_dbkwwr2,Honestly the light didnt change anything for me. Carries just as well as before I put the light on. I did have to do some trimming to the back of the light and to my trigger guard to make the inforce fit properly. Without trimming it wouldnt fit in the back rail slot and would put the buttons just forward for the trigger guard instead of hugging them like it does on glocks mps ect,Walther,dbl19s0,3,t5_2xbuk
10204221,0,t1_dc0kd46,the only people I have ever known who ankle carried were law enforcement and it was for their backup gun. seems like these days people would rather pocketcarry. Id ankle carry before pocket if I could not carry on my belt. ,Walther,dc0pewg,2,t5_2xbuk
10228229,0,t1_dc32hn6,I got the . MOA with the triangle. I like it a lot its quicker to pick up than my TRS red dot. ,Walther,dc3fdv3,2,t5_2xbuk
10314649,0,t1_dcaha64,I hear ya! I have large hands so I almost had to relearn because it is so much smaller then what i am use to. Its also the first pistol i have owned with a paddle on the trigger. If i dont concentrate i still pull up a bit when i am using the flush mag. After you get the hang of it expect tight groups with decent ammo. I can easily hold  inch groups at  yards and i am by no means a marksmen.,Walther,dcd7zv1,1,t5_2xbuk
10468082,0,t1_dctoc2b,Look into a Bersa Thunder CC the poor mans PPK. I have one and the little gun is a dream. Cheap to. ,Walther,dcunx0r,1,t5_2xbuk

11104051,0,t1_deqjuod,I went with a clinger holster. Pretty happy with it so far. Carry about  with a FBI cant. Pretty comfortable and easy to conceal. Especially with the  round mag. ,Walther,deqmuxv,2,t5_2xbuk

11711852,0,t1_dgnihv8,Ive shot through my   and rd once each and didnt have a problem. What was it doing when it wasnt chambering? I had one issue where I didnt rack it fully and the round came up enough to get stuck but not enough to get into the ramp. Had to push the round down into the mag from behind the barrel to get it unstuck.,Walther,dgnkgfv,1,t5_2xbuk
11753715,0,t1_dgsaxku,Trigger bar digging out the chamber facebarrel.Here is a thread I posted on the Walther forums. It has pictures of mine before and after sending it in along with a bunch of others that have the same problem.I sent it in at their request. They tried to grind down the high spots but missed and hit the chamber adding a bunch of scratching then sent it back telling me it is normal.,Walther,dgsba4y,1,t5_2xbuk
