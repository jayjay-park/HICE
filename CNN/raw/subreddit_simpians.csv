46364,0,t1_cejpfwf,Ok. Im sadly not an expert of servers and online engines but maybe it could be possible to put a condition so that everything has to be executed before the next step can happen.Maybe like this the whole thing will go down but with so fast servers is worse if things go on and of course you cannot be here monitoring things .,simpians,cejpjjf,2,t5_2y6lf
96530,0,t3_1v70pp,Thanks for the feedback because this game is so different and new I am learning what works and what dosent. Im planning of soon starting two worlds one running at same rate as the current and the other running much slower with a larger map size making the game more casual. I also plan to add a map feature that shows which tribes are aggressive so if you see an aggressive tribe heading towards your area it best to move away from them and if your intelligence is much higher then them you will see them way before they see you.I really want to create a really interesting gaming experience that combines the evolutionary aspect with simulation of huntergatherers making the game not trivial to play  I want players to learn and excel in the skill to survive  something which lacks in most modern online gaming experiences in my honest opinion.,simpians,cepf4bx,5,t5_2y6lf
