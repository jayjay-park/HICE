2397861,0,t3_2msa48,I think that the weekly discussion topics that Keith Burgun does over at rgamedesign are a nice idea. However I have found his theories about games to be rather reductionist and this seems to pervade the kinds of discussion prompts he chooses which has in turn attracted a community of likeminded individuals. If we could do something similar but utilize a more holistic perspective and address a broader range of topics including the various issues surrounding games in society I think that could be a good starting point. As it stands I have already seen most of the content in this subreddit posted elsewhere whether its rludology or rSRSGaming so I believe focusing on discussion is the way forward currently I lurk in the Extra Credits forums but that place can be very frustrating.,cahiersduludica,cm830j2,3,t5_2yebb
2464553,0,t1_cmg5h5k,I brought up the bootlegs because I had a vague sense that it would describe the value of art in some way.  I dont yet have the knowledge or direction to be able to describe just what it would be saying but bringing it up means as youve done someone can direct me where I need to go.  The fact that its topically related to video games also means more of that discussion pay off.  I appreciate the insight in that regard because I did not actually know a lot of what youve pointed out.  I just have hunches not specifics.  Im glad theres something to it that can be espoused upon because we really are talking about the value of this media perceived or literal.I saw similar strategies in China with scrolls.  Using specific types of paper a tour guide joked about how some folks would bury their art overnight to give it an aged look.In regards to Hibiki I know right?  Theres a lot to consider there.  Because it manifests in competitive play Hibiki is a really interesting visual metaphor just for her regard to her opponents.  Her desensitization to killing also reflects how being at the top of the mountain makes a person regard new or continuous competition.  It reflects her improved skill but it also reflects the growing ruthlessness it takes to stay at the top of a competitive game.  Thats the result for weaklings.  I think what shes saying at the end is close to that though Ill likely have to get around to the actual translation.  When I play arcade games at Magfest I often choose to step off the cabs to cycle in players but those without that regard often exhibit the kind of value toward their opponents that Hibiki does toward the people she kills on screen.Thats just talking competition.  In terms of a statement on violence you can then view player goals in the competitive environment.  Do they try to prevent Hibiki from becoming a killer which literally holds back her potential but maintains her regard for human life?  Why preserve that?  Having control over this outcome is saying a multitude of interesting things.That said...There is something I want to raise in response contributing to the topic here again is that I have a policy of not letting things be off limits.  If its old if someones done a video on it if theres a meme or joke behind the video game or system in question.I dont care if someone finds it funny or awful I want to earnestly know what someone was trying to communicate.  I want to do my best to respect that and let the results tell in how Im able to work with that evidence or piece of communication.I wrote a bunch of things about Rockman  and Rockman X which effectively means I also wrote about the Western counterparts Mega Man  and Mega Man X.  Those games are associated with poor quality within the gaming community and are recognized as the butt of jokes for being mediocre games.I dont really believe that those games are mediocre though they certainly have flaws.  The poor voice acting and translation does detract but I suppose I should say it does not make them uninteresting.  Those elements were reflective of a time in video games where localization was in its infancy.  If anything the idea that the voice acting is bad or the dialogue seems off that is what prompted me to pursue playing the Japanese versions.  Because I had to know what was emotionally being put on the screen for the original audience or at least my best idea of it.  Its okay to make jokes if you can be enlightening but most people opt to be reductive rather than insightful.While there certainly may be games out there unworthy of criticism I guess my goal is more to call it when I see it and just trust my general interests.  To that end Let the game determine its value not the internetmemes.  Which seems really basic but it has to be said.  Even the most seemingly prosaic knowledge are things I find many might just take for granted including myself.,cahiersduludica,cmgbi66,3,t5_2yebb
2471158,0,t3_2nl1rn,I always bring this up when people disregard comparisons to film or other mediums  Early film borrowed everything from theatre.  Film Criticism is derived from theatrical and fine art terms Mise en Scene.  Theatre now borrows language from film  from full on productions Lion King Once the Musical etc to using lights to emulate parallel action and cross cutting.  Video Games do the same.  Not only do they borrow cinematic language for cutscenes they build upon it.  The camera system in Shadow of the Colossus used AI to determine best angles to view the action the AI Director of Left  Dead attempts to pace out the action as one would a cinematic sequence.  That Gerry took the follow behind camera to emphasize patience in the viewer to create a form of connection and empathy as one does by playing a game really brings this to light.But I think films like Inception might be a better example  that it borrows levels as a concept and designs puzzles and mazes as a game designer would while also commenting on cinematic language when did we start sitting here? shows a kind of meeting of the mediums,cahiersduludica,cmh4udu,3,t5_2yebb

2771649,0,t1_cnj1rxz,Im sure it is a somewhat arbitrary standard but at the same time I think very few designers and developers think of themselves as artists making a work of art and often are employees who have to do their job really hard until they get fired when the game comes out. To me it comes down to is every single piece of visual media automatically considered art and if so is there even a point in having art if everything is it. Or are all visual media created use art mediums and the creators can choose what to make with the media. If say Call of Duty is to be considered fine art what message or what is it trying to communicate to me? I can evaluate it on those terms but I feel like itd be a needlessly brutal review without proper context to treat it the same as an artists installation or painting. Ultimately if everything is art then many many many works of art are essentially about making money which I suppose is a valid thing to communicate but hardly interesting or inspiring or worth my time from my perspective. I think there are very serious difference in philosophy between someone or people working together on something they consider to be a work of art and with a team of people doing what they have to do because Publisher X needs to make X million back on their investment. My attitude is not perfect and Im sure plenty of artistic developers with vision and whatnot get glossed over or buried in the industry and Im doing them a disservice by dismissing their team or them as pawns in a publishers game. Im open to discussion on the matter but I find it inoperable if art ends up encompassing every piece of shit a human makes. Hell I make paintings I dont consider to be art. It seems a slippery slop to me and I find it a really hard pill to swallow once Im told that fucking advertising  the single worst thing humanity has ever done or will be able to do  in my eyes is considered to be art. I find it more a subversion of art itself to directly and indirectly manipulate people into losing their humanity in exchange for consumerism but my views on the matter are quite extreme.,cahiersduludica,cnj4k8x,2,t5_2yebb
3050541,0,t1_coc2q0h,Thats a good point. It seems like certain movies have the feel of video games down right which is something that a lot of adaptations are missing. Shoot Em Up might fit that bill too. A lot of times we describe experiences and other media as cinematic maybe we need a term that describes when something is reminiscent of games. ,cahiersduludica,coe6qin,1,t5_2yebb
3070654,0,t3_2vbiz8,I think theres a lot of issues to be addressed in gaming before a proper wellreceived romantic comedy game comes out. The medium is one thats matured fast but it shouldnt be forgotten that its still maturing. Game writing is still by and large woefully inadequate with only a few narrative examples to really be proud of. Furthermore a large portion of the community just isnt ready for a game like this. That isnt to say that developers shouldnt make a romantic comedy game but the reality of the situation is that it will likely be widely mocked at best. Initial funding might be hard to come by and the possibility for a sequel or further games in the genre would be diminished.I would love to see video games push into genres like this but I cant imagine the reception would be anything we want to see.,cahiersduludica,cog9qge,3,t5_2yebb
3356890,0,t1_cpa6qii,Yeah thats what Ive noticed. GDC seems to be about The Industry now more than the actual development of games. I suppose I had a similar experience back in  the only time I went thanks EA!. There it was all FP monetization advice with very little about actual interesting noncasual game design. I saw a couple of talks one by Dan Cook and the guys at Spry Fox on creating Innovative Game Ideas and another one by a guy at CD Projekt RED who discussed the process of early stage design. They were good. The Machinations tool talk was brilliant although more for the amazing tool rather than any design discussion. The Warren Spector one about narrative wasnt exactly that educational but it was fun and inspiring.It feels a little like my local areas Game Networking events. It started with a dedicated bunch of people who just love games and want to talk about them. It got bigger then the business types got involved... and now its all industry and FP talk with nothing about the love and design of games.,cahiersduludica,cpawryv,3,t5_2yebb
3595804,0,t3_31huxf,Very nice! It would be cool to have a partial function of this subreddit to be a system of support and instruction to wouldbe published critics. I know theres been a couple members here that have shared their own work but Id love to see more including my own.,cahiersduludica,cq25cjn,2,t5_2yebb
4173466,0,t3_38cma8,Id like things of this nature.  I havent designed a game in my life am completely ignorant of coding... so I may have nothing much to contribute.  But I think this is a good idea.,cahiersduludica,crvzdbi,2,t5_2yebb
