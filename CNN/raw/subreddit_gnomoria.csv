155810,0,t1_cew56no,I tried it again last night and paid more attention to things.  Unfortunately I didnt pay a lot of attention to the time it took.  I get the two crude workbenches going because they take forever to make planks  and you need a lot of them before you finally get the sawmill up.  Also I wasnt ever able to deconstruct the first crude bench early since I need more planks.  I want to use the Crude benches as little as possible so thats why I build a carpenter first  he will be able to make the furniture for the stone cutter stone mason and sawmill.  On the other hand that means the crudes will have to spend even more time on planks.  The important thing is that the carpenters arent sitting around  they need to be banging out planks or chopping wood or whatever.  Once the Sawmill is set up I deconstruct the crude workbenches.  Any time the woodcutters have downtime I build five to ten wheelbarrows and start placing crates on stockpiles.I think right around the time the Gobs started showing up I hadCarpenter  Sawmill  Stonecutter  Stonemason  Furnace  Forge  Armorsmith  Distillery  Butcher  Bonecarver  Leatherworker  Market stallAnd was either complete or nearly complete with the  Loom  TailorUsually my miners are in the copper by the time the Forge is built so I turn one of them into a blacksmith at that point.  I queue up Forge jobs for Steel Bronze Bar from ore Bar from sliver and set those to repeat.  Set forge to priority  so armorsmith jobs priority  get done first when needed.  I also give bonecarving skill to the rancher and butcher the male yak as soon as the Bonecarver workshop is built.,gnomoria,cew6fdd,1,t5_2u9k6

808738,0,t3_23e0wr,Ok RoboBb. You are the best. Ive had the pleasure of grabbing Gnomoria a year and a half ago. Since then it is the ONLY game I have that has consistent updates every single week and recently biweekly. Your commitment and vision are great plus talking to the community and including a plan for long term development  is quite literally what I envision as a perfect game developer. I just want to reiterate how thankful I am that you have been so dedicated and interactive throughout the entire game cycle so far it has really made the whole experience one of if not the best experiences I have had with a game to date.The plan you have is great except magic but more on that later I especially like the mechanical and architectural changes and the idea for variety of item content will there still be beeshoneymead? Or am I confused with Starbound? Either way it would be awesome especially if it was something valuable to the mants. Also the rarelegendary events would be a simply unique player experience especially for those older kingdoms and the spiders being able to implant gnomes is just too perfect and terrifying at the same time. I dont really have much to add to your ideas except maybe a decoy bell to serve as a way to draw enemies to a trap. You have done such a great job so far that by all means just keep doing what you are doing.I do think you should add more support for modding as that can really increase the lifespan and quality of a game. It is something to consider. And as far as the magic though here is the thing. I bought the game for like ? It has been so long I dont quite remember. I easily have  hours on steam. I feel it was an incredibly good deal among one of the best purchases of a game period. and I would like Gnomoria to have a full lifespan. In order to do this I at least think a long term profit plan could be laid out and I would not mind you keeping magic as much as I want it out of the release and instead offering a sort of expansion later for a fee. If your quality so far has been anything to go off of then I think a sort of franchise is something to consider. I cant speak for anyone else but for me I absolutely would not mind paying for an expansion or additional content after release. Especially if the scope of the final game offers what you have listed so far. Yes I think Gnomoria is THAT good. Anyway its up to you but if you decide on that or on another project I will certainly supportpledge for it.P.S. Belated congratulations on your daughter! I wish you the best.EDIT Yeah the multi processorlong term support would be really nice. I have one kingdom  year  and due to my failed moat ideawater physics it is almost unplayable.,gnomoria,cgw7hy5,0,t5_2u9k6

1883218,0,t1_ckb4mwz,Not sure about the combat complexity of DF nor do I care to know.Gnomoria does distinguish between slashing good vs. soft targets blunt good vs. hard targets piercing ok but not great vs. everything and fire supposedly good vs. everything  but the only source of fire we currently have is torches which do not do very much damage at all. Ogres Wildlife count as soft targets all the way through their bones might be easier to crush but if you reach them it doesnt matter anymore.Skeletons and goblins wear hard armour. At least goblins turn to soft targets once their armour breaks.Mants and beetles have a rather hard about bronze shell and squishy innards  if the shell is broken through the body part is usually destroyed right after. Both aparently have lungs and hearts despite being insects.So swords have the advantage of being pretty good against ogres and animals they can slash and being mediocre vs. the rest. I also suspect swords to do less overall damage because they have these  damage types and a bonus to parry to boot. If they had not they would be outright overpowered.Claymores also cause slashing and blunt damage. But they do it at the same time and slashing comes first and then the blunt part. Would it be otherwise it would be the perfect weapon to kill goblins and they would be borderline overpowered as well. But they are not  and being handed they suffer from the random targetting bodyparts syndrome. They hit so hard the bodypart they hit is usually destroyed with a certain amount of skill and stats ofc  but the enemy isnt dead even if you slash all four limbs ok sliced off head is instant kill off and it takes a long time to do that with the claymore. So overall  not that good of a weapon ,gnomoria,ckg4c3a,1,t5_2u9k6

4900493,0,t3_3hzbpx,My build style is pretty simple really. I first clear out And level the exterior of the kingdom Near the map wall About  tiles in. On that third tile in ill dig ramps down all the way around to a bridge position then ill begin removing the ramps all except for  near the entrance. Then ill build a wall on the fourth tile away from the wall. Once thats all done and made out of dirt ill begin colonizing the surface Removing trees designating stuff Setting up what does where. ill take stone and replace the dirt to just give an outline of what building would be where. Regarding to actually building something I build all of the floors out of dirtstone then place scaffolding. Then i set up a stockpile with a couple crates and push blocksplanks into them Then replace the flooring with whatever i desire. Then i build the walls on it and then i put a thatch roof on at the end. Why i build it like this? Well early game i wont have  blocks on hand to blow on a structure So i find its easier to lay it out make adjustments replace it and go.

If he said these are the things I would like to implement before the game is released or even anything along those lines Id be  with you but I dont read anything in that list that says that. Just what you responded with and there no way to tell if his idea of a complete game is this whereas your idea of gnomoria being complete is vastly different. Which seems to be the case here RoboBob seems to view at least the games core mechanics as complete while other players look at the wish list and apply all of those things to their idea of a completed gnomoria. If he decided those other features would bog down the game too much or cause too many bugs to be justified or just looked back on his ideas and didnt like some of them than its his game and his idea and he can implement whatever is best for it at that moment in time. At this moment in time he needs to support his family and who knows maybe if gnomoria starts making him a little bit of decent cash whos to say he wont go back and promote it for more money? Update it so that more people join the community? Honestly not supporting a developer whos been this great with the community is a bad decision. He had completely uncontrollable outside actions take hold of his life an make it really real really quick.

If you like indirect strategy games its great. Just enough management to lead training in proper directions but not so much micromanagement you have to oversee each individual unit. The potential for lategame basebuilding is pretty significant and the combat style I find very nice.Its not a groundbreaking title its not redefining the genre but its a more than adequate game and is worth the money. These days people are wary of early access games and I feel like Gnomoria was on the back end of that  people were still hyped to get behind something early and watch it grow get in on the next Minecraft.
