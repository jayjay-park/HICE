2986232,0,t3_2ud6lr,Edit farther down ublacksheepcannibal had some excellent advice. Read his comment about the more specialized tools.Dont get a snapon box. Just dont. Not till youve been a mechanic for years and have bought all the tools you need. That  thing looks great but youll outgrow that box in a few years. Buy a harbor freight one and wear it out. Then take it home or sell it to a new guy and decide then if its time for a SnapOn.Also are you going to be doing sheet metal or not?That tool list is way overdone for a FNG. Not saying you wont want those things eventually but you definitely dont need all that on your first day. Heres what you need to walk into almost any shop and start working. Craftsman p  socket set deep and shallow with extensions and ratchet. A set of  universal sockets Snapons are best but any will do to start. Gear Wrench SAE ratchet wrench set  and a  if you can find it. Craftsman screwdriver set. Drill . Impact. Safety wire pliers . Knipex dikes. Knipex Cobras. Knipex slipjoint pliers smooth jaw channellocks with the button. Needle nose pliers brand doesnt matter SnapOns are the best. Multimeter from Walmart. Simple wire strippers from lowes that can do up to g. Hammer. Deadblowbrass hammer combo Northern tools. Steel and brass punches. Craftsman pick set. Tool bag. If you have a truck to transport it to your first job a tool chest.. Bright small flashlight. Inspection mirrorIts AM dont judge my grammar. I dont have a college degree like some of you uppity fuckers. Lol.,aviationmaintenance,co7iqkw,3,t5_31e80

You want to do GA bizjet commercial? Line maintenance or manufacturing? Do you live in a major city are there many FBOs around you and are you willing to move?All of these are pretty major questions that can very much so shape the answer to your question. Personally?

3957266,0,t3_35rdd5,Has anyone seen the book for X tail number? While holding the bookWhen people fall for floating rivets after a wash. Once had someone tell me the tail stinger on the Kiowa Bell civ was an antenna and had nothing to do with not scraping up the tail fin. Also we sent a FNG to look for Fallopian tubing. He came back to the office hours later and very disheartened we opened up wikipedias page for female anatomy.

4243376,0,t3_39jln5,I work on helicopters in the offshore oil industry. We have contracts with oil companies to take their employees to their platforms.Our most common scheduled inspection are  different eventsphaseschecks due  hours apart for a total rotation of  hours. Our company has a policy all maintenance is due as soon as it hits  hours left. Eight hours is the pilot limit helicopters can fly more but usually wont. There are other scheduled inspections from  hour intervals to  hour intervals to  month inspections. Then there are the unscheduled maintenance from us finding shit while working and the always pita pilot gripes.With that in mind our leads try to schedule things as to where there is only one aircraft grounded per night for scheduled inspections.Some aircraft fly  hour a day....so reaching  hours can take a long time. So to answer your questions we dont see too many grounded aircraft. Now when unscheduled maintenance happens obviously all that is thrown out the window...but still rare.,aviationmaintenance,cs3xox8,3,t5_31e80

8108169,0,t1_d4re6ky,From my experience fresh apprentices working on heavy checks will usually get put on removing and inspecting the interior of the airplane. Youll be working without direct supervision and theyll show you a task and youll be set loose. Im not sure what they expect you to know maintenance wise what BCIT teaches you and how it works in industry is a little different. Im guessing they want you to be competent with hand and power tools to ask questions and not to have to show you a task more than once.,aviationmaintenance,d4rfiy8,1,t5_31e80
