6368819,0,t3_41t1fj,I was a manic depressed NEET  and a happy NEET . As a kid I never was into the chananimeetc. thing so I enjoyed being able to learn new things. The guilt never goes away though.Ive won the respect of my family back and theyre going through a tough time so my NEET days are coming to an end. Do I regret anything? Not really no.

There are narcissistic hedonists out there that will never have the balls to call themselves stupid and hollow. You are a person that anyone can talk to without getting offended. You listen. Dont devalue yourself so easily.,NEET,d083xhj,5,t5_2rxjp

10186826,0,t3_5ls6wi,To be honest I dont know if college is worth it anymore. Universities often cut their programs and most degrees dont seem to get you a job anymore in fact youll be denied jobs because people will see you as being overqualified. If you must Id go to a vocational school or a community college and get a certificate in a field that is in high demand but not popular or a fad those will quickly become oversaturated.I have a Masters degree and I while I dont regret getting it I would never tell anyone to do what I did even if they were to pursue a PhD they arent worth it anymore. I lucked out too I only had a small amount of debt.,NEET,dbyqeb8,2,t5_2rxjp
