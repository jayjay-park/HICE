The difference is in the lock Day Dates use a President lock which contrary to the large and square lock on the Datejust has a more subtle and elegant small lock bearing the Rolex logo.EDIT Just for good measure a Jubilee bracelet with an Oyster lock. ,rolex,ct2b3y4,1,t5_2qy0y

10381021,0,t1_dckqsxs, Yeah it really is hard to go wrong. I had the no date sub at first and couldnt live without the date even though I like the cleanliness and symmetry of the dial. So a date is a must I traded in the ND for the SubC date and it had a foreign matter inside the sapphire crystal. The AD told me to bring it back for a brand new one and I asked if I could upgrade to the BLNR since the watch already had to be returned. He agreed but now I cant make up my mind if I want to keep the SubC date as an everyday watch and then add the BLNR later down the road or get the BLNR now and add the SubC later since Ive already had it. I have seen the BLNR in person I just didnt take pictures on that day I was awestruck by it lol I just forgot. It is a beautiful watch but I just dont know if its an every day kind of watch. I do love the polished center links and the two tone bezel.  I dont know its hard to decide I take it as a sign that the AD told me I could get the BLNR instead of the subC and that I flipped a coin and the BLNR won. Maybe I should listen to the Universe... Thanks for your response.,rolex,dckr49i,1,t5_2qy0y

11802055,0,t3_68e832,I would honestly just set up an roth IRA and invest that money. Your time value on the money is worth a bit more than the Rolex. Get one on your th birthday.,rolex,dgxsy5x,21,t5_2qy0y
11802290,0,t3_68e832,In the end if it makes you happy then go for it. I agree with the other comment. Financially youre better off putting it into a Roth. Wearing a Rolex as an  year old doesnt make you a spoiled brat your actions  decide that imo. ,rolex,dgxtwrx,7,t5_2qy0y
