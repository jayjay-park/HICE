4282361,0,t1_cs8c79x,Yeah my only issue with this is the resetting of the perk progress. With how long it takes to level up clans with higher level perks will not only have the advantage in wars but in recruitment as well. Why would you want to join a L clan when you can join a L clan? Unfortunately I think SuperCell really made it harder to form new clans with the change. We could also always move back into RA but if everyone is going to stay quiet and inactive were going to run into the same problems as we did before.,RedditAzurite,cs8cai0,1,t5_3355z

We werent too far away and if we can get enough to war everyday maybe we can make it happen.   We can look into different ways for recruiting.   Im thinking just leaving it open for anyone to join and kicking the scrubs.  ,RedditAzurite,csa7x5o,1,t5_3355z
