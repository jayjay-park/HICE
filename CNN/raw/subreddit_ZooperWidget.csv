3899963,0,t1_cr0ni4p,I just updated to lollipop. zooper with popup widget was laggy. zooper in general was bad on KitKat. after the update I noticed widgets rendered much faster on lollipop so I thought Id give zooper another try. zooper is much more responsive now. but Im using zooper for text and phone call notifications. texts always registrar  text even when there are none.seems with any update you take the good with the bad. hows lollipop been treating ur phone. Im on unrooted s.thanks for ur help.,ZooperWidget,cr0tvz6,1,t5_32yru
