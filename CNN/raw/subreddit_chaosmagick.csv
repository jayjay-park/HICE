Its a short lived and intense  minutes but you return to baseline within  minutes. The problems come from repeated dosing and long term use which can cause demyelination in the brain and vitamin B depletion which can effect the brain by promoting demyelination which strips neurons of their protective sheath. Now if I was taking it every day several times then of course its gonna be bad for my brain but used responsibly it has an important place in my Art when I use it as described.  Altered states do not always cause brain damage. ,chaosmagick,d9ru5wk,5,t5_2usek

Some things work much better some things merely push the odds of happening in the direction you intended. That practice you described sounds bogus but if she has enough belief shes probably enacting something. I do love discussing this stuff though. This is the path that leads to freedom for the souls here its a vital thing to talk about. ,chaosmagick,dbdx8e4,1,t5_2usek

Its no one wonder the dog is responding by barking. Try to use positive energy and help the dog ,chaosmagick,dfifrtb,5,t5_2usek

I drank the rest not all at once and imagined his voice until I felt like I could hear him talking to me.I did my own mini ritual mentally to free his spirit from the maw of baphomet so his spirit would be free to choose its own path.Then I cried more because I kept remembering that my best friend was gone forever. ,chaosmagick,dgmsmlw,4,t5_2usek
