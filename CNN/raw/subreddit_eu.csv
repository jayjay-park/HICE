7533044,0,t1_d2xg7h4,Well Im currently working in an area that we call Euregions. This are basically bodies of cooperation in border areas between states. Cooperation can pretty much be anything science economy on a larger scale but also stuff on a small scale cultural projects between bordertowns where they fund a theater and GermanDutch plays for example. They get a yearly budget with which they can supportfund regional initiatives aimed at better cooperation across the border. Especially between the Netherlands and Germany there are some very active and succesfull Euregionprojects. If the Netherlands would leave the EU my expertise would basically be worthless. As this job made me culturally more awarereflexive and also more flexible I speak  languages fluently now I cant imagine being restricted to the tiny Netherlands anymore. Also my ideals have gradually shifted to be more and more Cosmopolitan looking across borders nationality and culture. I dont want to give that all up because my fellow countrymen are scared of Brussels.So I guess Im kind of biased towards the EU .,eu,d2ygxgu,1,t5_247b
