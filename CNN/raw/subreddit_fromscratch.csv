Its at least in line with how moronically named this dish is Not a single fucking thing either looking like something viking or from viking cuisine.It would have been a far better name if it was named Tiny Conquistador Death as it actually has a fucking connection to the ingredients and look more like the overloaded Spanish galleons than a viking longboat. ,fromscratch,cfch87a,-3,t5_2u446
