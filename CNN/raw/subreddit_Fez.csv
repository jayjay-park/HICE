521378,0,t1_cfziabx,the tome reminds me of bible code or the torah. known from being the direct word of god communicated to man without space or punctuation.,Fez,cfzjac3,2,t5_2socv
530035,0,t1_cg064ky,I was also trying to rotate the tome to see what new versions of peabeaub i got nothing usefull at first glance though maybe you could try it with your ciphers. The tricky thing is that if it leade to anything it might only do so after also rotating the text in the tome and this would change all the letters... But yeah its one of the last things i could think of for those  big letters.,Fez,cg0isxv,1,t5_2socv

575729,0,t3_20muoe,Excuse me for not knowing much about the names of the stuff in the game but isnt it possible that the bit doors are the secret doors? If not I think it might be probably one of those things that were scraped from the game but have relics in the code. Skeleton key is DEFINITELY an intersting one though.,Fez,cg5pqym,1,t5_2socv

734892,0,t3_22k44z,Its a wonderful game that scratches the aesthetic moar fez itch but not on the puzzlesolving side of things. Still absolutely worth the bucks.,Fez,cgnt7k7,2,t5_2socv
764401,0,t1_cgr5tlq,I wasnt talking about the Fractal room at all I was talking about the area between it.Ancient Walls Wall Hole and Two Walls on this map ,Fez,cgr6276,1,t5_2socv
816057,0,t1_cgwwoxo,Just because time is in a loop doesnt mean theres not a pastpresentfuture.On wall paintings you can see the stargate being built from scratch and the last painting is that of a destroyed stargate with the blackholes.You can go back to Zu from planet W by using the stargate so i would say using it doesnt destroy it.Indeed i believe gomez and geezer to be one and the same person.Primitive people  neanderthalers they are still homo sapiens. Lifestyle and evolution are two seperate things.You visit wall village in a point in time when there are no Xuthats what the one eyed people are called people left. You visit Zu when there are still Zuish people left. Wether its a simulation a memory or we its still  set in the past.The reason you cant leave the village and dont have D vision The stargate leads to planet W where the mother cube is housed. That mother cube as i see it leads to the real world. Because Gomez enters that everything runs amuck. The whole simulation is reboot and Gomez wakes up in his room after seeing all kinds of weird shit cube reboot this is also one of the reasons why the time is in a loop when something goes terribly wrong Gomez almost leaving the simulation for example there is a reboot.  this last part is abit more random than usual but we p this is basically fan fiction by this point anyways another way to loom at it is that Gomez is simply a debuger for the simulation and the mother cube doesnt lead to the outside world but it simply allows Gomez to reboot and restore the simulation after restoring the hexahedron.Iirc in mysti never actually played riven the ages were written into books by some old dude... He created those worlds afaik. Or could he trap whole ages into books like his sons? Indont really remember played that game  years ago lol. In other news i read somewhere that cyan worlds is making a new game. It looks pretty cool.Speakijg about new games  days till Fract OST!,Fez,cgx1es3,1,t5_2socv

6279014,0,t3_41b3n1,Me and ukyozumo have solved the message. Its a poem from Space Funeral called Spleen or at least their version because it is a much older poem. Here are some variations. And here you can hear the exact version from Space Funeral. The mystery text is only a small part of it though.We used the mystery message and several images on the kickstarter page as tools to solve the text and symbols. Namely the images radio the universe gameplay music samples and ha. ha. haha. ha. hahaha. ha..edited Screenshot of the mystery message frameIt translates to this    When the low heavy sky weighs like a lid    on the spirit aching for the light  And when    embracing the horizon it pours on us a    black day which is sadder than any night  When    the earth is turned into a dripping dungeon in    which hope like a bat flutters blindly and    bruises its timid wing and tender head    against the walls and rotted ceilings  When the    rain stretching down its long streaks ofHere are the symbols and their meaningAs you can see it doesnt use letters like normally used in English. The symbols represent how they are pronounced phonetically.,Fez,cz3cqeb,3,t5_2socv
