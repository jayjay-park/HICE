11070849,0,t3_5y3gnb,Ive heard its a good idea to eat the hottest wing first then have immediate diarrhea ten times.,hotones,demvcgk,21,t5_3fqzn
11305479,0,t1_dfa9qjc,I loved Mickelthwait. As you said just as good as Franklins but without the wait. Someone above said go to Rudys meh. Its overrated. Saltlick is only worth it if you go to the real location out west of town. ,hotones,dfdgjda,2,t5_3fqzn
11528048,0,t1_dg2ov98,thanx for mansplaining how talk shows work but im not talking about that. im talking about the people I wanna see on the fun youtube chicken wing show I like to watch. I often have zero clue who most of the guests on Hot Ones are and Ive found some cool artists or comedians or whathaveyou thru the show. since you brought up wanting to see super popular prowrestlers on the show I wanted to chime in wmy suggestions of some people casual fans may never have heard of. sorry to ruffle your feathers for mentioning wrestlers who dont wrestle in the company you like.also I dont want any more indy wrestlers in the wwe that company is awful garbage and is already overflowing with outside talent they hardly utilizecompletely forget about. ,hotones,dg2pfjq,-2,t5_3fqzn
11562406,0,t1_dg67fjo,Just a heads up what you linked to is Blairs After Death Sauce which is significantly weaker  scoville than Mega Death Sauce  scoville.,hotones,dg6lqhc,4,t5_3fqzn
11566151,0,t3_61i8vj,Okay seriously the hot ones sauce is small but it tastes amazing. I would recommend ordering two bottles because Im pretty sure the shipping is a flat rate of  no matter how much you order. Its got a kind of pineapple citrus zing to it initially and then the heat kind of creeps. Its really awesome on meat. And everything. ,hotones,dg711c2,1,t5_3fqzn

11737876,0,t1_dgqc1fj,So the dude that recorded it took forever to send it to me.  I kind of put it on the backburner and forgot.  Just finished getting it edited really just cut off the beginning prep and the end shenanigans.  As soon as Youtube approves my account to upload videos longer than  minutes Ill start the upload!,hotones,dgqinw0,2,t5_3fqzn
