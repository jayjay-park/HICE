516068,0,t3_2000uj,Second hand servers are seriously cheap. You could get a few and cluster them in a beowulflike configuration with OpenMPI. It kinda depends on the amount of data youre processing though. If its not a large amount id do Centropomus plan. If were talking at least terabytes id actually use Windows Not something I usually say I must admit. because of C Accelerated Massive Parallelism AMP for the computations coupled with a SolarisBSD ZFS filehost. If youre frugal you can do this for under  bucks for the machines second hand and some more for the drives.,CentOS,cfyxi5h,2,t5_2s6fk
735939,0,t1_cgnxdxl,You dont understand how CentOS and RHEL direct derivatives work.Instead of introducing whole new versions introducing the chance of breaking one of their users applications security patches are applied to a base version that only gets updated in major revisions. In CentOS. openssl..e is the deployed version however Red Hat have applied several security fixes including the Heartbleed fix to the openssl..e base and those are mirrored in the CentOS recompile.The patch to fix this has been applied bringing the version up to openssl..e.el. which is the version you should have. Do a    yum info openssland it will tell you what you truely have rather than doing    openssl versionwhich is misleading.,CentOS,cgnxhqk,4,t5_2s6fk

3203420,0,t1_cotw2p0,Pretty much. In all cases RHEL is The Upstream Vendor.For a lot of years ie all but the last one CentOS had no Red Hat support at all but now they can claim a bit of Red Hat involvement.However Oracle Linux Scientific Linux ClearOS and a few other lesserknown distributions followed the same model its free and open source so they expanded where they wanted to. For example Oracle ships with a different kernel option.,CentOS,cou18ff,2,t5_2s6fk

Im not very experienced with such things but I would look at etcpasswd and see if it is being changed.

5599919,0,t3_3rslg0,Im also with ujerutley on this one. While I think the paid Google Apps is worth its money Zoho offers a free alternative for your own domain name. Also almost all web providers offer email services with the webspace. Some of them are very reasonably priced and still offer a great email experience. Some even go as far as offering a whole office suite. The OX App Suite is a white label product targeting hosting and internet service providers. GMail isnt the only game in town.OTOH if you really want to do it Kolab has a great groupware suite with excellent CentOS support for their FOSS offering. Setting up an email server can be a great learning experience.,CentOS,cwr81sm,1,t5_2s6fk

6771814,0,t1_d0juk1y,Snicker Reddit is so predictable I knew this would happen! When I was composing the message I was thinking to myself programmer and I thought whoops sysadmin. Then I thought to myself wow what a good way to weed out all the people like myself that get stuck on exact words I already have the job of head nit picker at clients. Note I gave the exact description of what I needed maintain and backup system those are sysadmin things so only a nit picker would even reference it. As I thought there were some nitpickers as well as a couple others that replied privately that just asked what I needed without having having an end user faux paux nit pick.Nor was I asking for help did not even think of a freebie this will be ongoing and paid. Maybe best if I waddle on over to Toronto jobs or somewhere like that did not wish to offend just wanted to qualify.,CentOS,d0jv7ro,-6,t5_2s6fk
