259081,0,t3_1x2w93,Your image and the description fit this song perfectly couldnt find the full track but this video will start playing at the point where the song begins Cdnalsi  The Queen Of Gotharde PreludeThe beginning is the desolation and desperation then it builds up with bravery and hope then you will know when you see this city ahead of you emerging and the music becomes triumphant and grand a perfect visualization for why I love this track the YT link doesnt have the full song but the relevant part for this image.,Fermata,cf7m2bk,8,t5_2w1u1
259752,0,t3_1x2om1,I cant link this because I cant seem to find it anywhere on YouTube but if you can find Darcy James Argues Brooklyn Babylon album it might be what youre looking for. It was the first thing that came to mind when I saw your post. All the different parts come together and eventually create one incredibly intricate and unique sound. I highly recommend checking it out its on SpotifyItunes etc.,Fermata,cf7okkl,2,t5_2w1u1
