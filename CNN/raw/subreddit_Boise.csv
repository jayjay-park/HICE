63047,0,t1_celgmt8,The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality DEQ measures the volume of certain air pollutants throughout the state. DEQ may issue a burn ban when concentrations of these air pollutants reach or exceed the healthbased standards or limits established by state law or regulation.There are plenty of burn bans in both winter and summer to try and cut down on inversion and smoke but Boise is in a basin where a lot of the muck just kind of hovers above the city until a big weather system rolls through and carries it out. Kind of disgusting and equally fascinating if you drive out toward Mountain Home and face back toward Boise you can see a big reddish brown cloud hovering above the basin during some winter months.Beyond that Im not sure what kind of pollution needs to be addressed but at least when speaking about inversions in the winter and the nasty wildfire skies in the summer Boises air quality is pretty decent  months out of the year. Ive been living in San Jose CA for the last few years and I find myself constantly going onoff with my sunglasses to see if its just my lenses that are foggy or if its this nasty dark grey muggy...air we have. ,Boise,cellvuj,1,t5_2qlk4

As the barman sends you both a shot of whiskey your friend begins fixing you with a serious look.Who was that man?I dont know who he is but Ive got a good guess who he works for...At his puzzled and curious expression you continue.My pa has a mining claim up north in the rough part of the mountains. Or he did... He was murdered two weeks ago. I just got word. The Sheriff of the territory doesnt seem to think theres anything suspicious about a man shootin himself in the back... Id wager the Sheriff and whoever that was out there are both in the pocket of Harrison.Your friends eyes go wide.Harrison? The silver magnate? Boy you are a dead man walking...Heh. Dont I know it...So Harrison wanted your fathers mining claim and your pa wouldnt sell  so Harrison had him murdered that about right?Yes sir that about sums it up. And thatd be the end of it too if a friend of the family hadnt told me that I get rights to the claim after his death. But they expire after a month and its already been two weeks. I got on this train to get up to the claim as fast as I could so I can protect my pas piece of earth from Harrison. Our family needs that silver... I got  little brothers and a widowed ma to think of...Hahahahahahahahahaha!Beg your pardon but whats so funny?Hahahaha! Ah youth! You just thought youd run up there and stand on the land and theyd have to respect your right to it? You said yourself Harrisons got the Sheriff in his pocket! Your old man couldnt protect himself from them and Im betting he had a bit more sense than you. How are you going to fight Harrison and his cronies? You feel heat creeping into your face but stubbornly shove the shame down to the pit of your stomach instead where it quickly combusts into determination.I dont know. And frankly I dont care. I gotta do it whatever it takes. My family is counting on me.Your mustachioed friends eyes rake over you. You dont cotton to such nonsense but youd swear it seems like hes trying to see your soul.

2572958,0,t3_2p8lxb,If youve verified that your wired connection to your PS works well with the Cable One connection then its one of two things Your wireless settings need modification. You might need to try channel   or  use only those channels. Those are the three main channels you should be using so see if a neighbor is on any of those and switch one theyre not. If theyre on all three pick the one that is the weakest. Your modemrouter needs replacement so replace the modemrouter andor buy a wireless router. You may have a shit router or the model they gave you has a shitty antenna. Your DNS shouldnt have anything to do with this because DNS is for resolving domain names to IP addresses which is at a different layer of networking. Your issues are a different networking layer closer to the physical than software because theyre issues relating to the performance of packets getting to and from your router.If you cant rewire things then invest in a good wireless router.,Boise,cmuf9ox,1,t5_2qlk4

So looking at a total package minus installation like this we can come up with the following details The efficiency of the inverter is  The output of the system is   .KWh The cost is . plus installationWe can then adjust the efficiency numbers by the solar efficiency ratings provided here which factor for how the panels will be mounted. For the typical fixed mount system you are going to get roughly  efficiency which is something like . efficiency when combined with the power transformer above.Plugging those numbers into my calculator I get this    Month    Current   wSolar  Use KWh  Slr KWh    Return      jan    .   .   .    .    .      feb    .   .   .    .    .      mar    .   .   .    .    .      apr    .   .   .    .    .      may    .   .   .    .    .      jun    .   .   .    .    .      jul    .   .   .    .    .      aug    .   .   .    .    .      sep    .   .   .    .    .      oct    .   .   .    .    .      nov    .    .   .    .    .      dec    .   .   .    .    .     year   .  .  .   .   .

4574327,0,t1_ct6vv9t,freedom doesnt mean shit.   Liberty is the playing field that grants freedom and liberty grants people the ability to be able to work without being screwed by their employer for no reason or barring that a stupid reason.If things worked the way you wanted people would be working for  cents a day because you dont realize that your brand of libertarianism is almost anything but what you think it is.  Here is your answer directly as to why businesses cant do that stuff those businesses use commerce that I pay forI pay for the roads they bring goods around on.I pay for the judges they need to maintain legal contracts. I pay for the internet backbone maintained by the government for them to do their ecommerce on.  The list goes on and on actually.If my taxes pay for those things  they are called the commons which I thought libertarians that love the constitution would understand before anything  if my taxes pay for them and you think you can use them while discriminating against me it is called unrepresented taxation.   Surely a real libertarian understands something about unrepresented taxation and the role it played in our society?Capitalism is not a government.  It is an economy and it exists in the playing field laid out by the system of government we chose.   Therefor if my taxes are paying for your business to operate which they are in every case you cant discriminate against me.edit  came back to add one thing  that you cant discriminate against me personally if I am a protected class.  That doesnt until recently include LGBT folks.  Once recognized you cant discriminate.

Overdoses are tracked by government agencies right alongside other forms of death though not always on an individual product level which makes sense we arent talking about any specific guncar in this instance.  The CDC is very concerned about addressing and monitoring access to prescriptions and if they hadnt been banned from studying gun death statistics we could have a more informed and empirical discussion on this matter. Gun advocates know guns are an excellent vehicle for dispensing death and denyingdefunding research into this field is par for the course.

If you like being outside this could include biologist ecologist archaeologist range con geologist ranger recreation  ect. Lack of a degree is not necessarily a huge draw back as you can work your way up through the system. You will hit a ceiling at some point though. The real trick with these jobs is getting in permanently which can be very difficult. You basically have to start out in seasonal positions that dont have benefits.  month terms. The benefit thing may have changed though at least for health insurance. I know if u work fire health insurance is offered. If you are a vet there is preferential hiring. If not it can be difficult to get on. You basically have to be willing to work in some of the less desirable duty locations to get time in grade experience.

9281622,0,t1_d8rjsr4,I was designing such a system before Uber started up. The programming is not difficult. It would have sent out a hail to all the cabs monitoring and then there were various ways it could handle who gets which ride. An auction is one possiblity where drivers would bid on the ride. The big barrier to putting such an open system into place is in the fact that there are a multitude of different jurisdictions all with different laws. That was what stalled me. I realized that there was a bushel of money in an open dispatch system and that the business and legal aspects would require a huge investment at the outset and in my naivity I thought that it would have to be compatible with existing laws. Oh silly me! Law? Scoff!Uber solved the legal issue by simply thumbing its nose at local laws with lawyers lobbyists and huge investors. Im just a lowly programmer with no knowledge of megabucks business startup. I guess I identify with the small business owners and bristle when some wellfunded bigshot outsiders come to town and overpower the law. Call me old fasioned but I still think that everybody should play a game by the same rules and not try and fool people into thinking theyre something they arent. But fool them they did. Uber the law. Money above the law. ,Boise,d8sigr0,1,t5_2qlk4

Honestly theyre also very common. In addition to the financial aspect Ive always felt like Im in the way or putting someone out when Ive sought medical help. Such instances have been blessedly infrequent knocking on wood now and there is absolutely no evidence to support my paranoia but I still cant help but feel like Im keeping someone more in need of assistance from being seen.PSA Again hospitals end up eating the cost of A LOT of care not exclusively because of but definitely due in large part to when people who are uninsured get sick or injured. This is absolutely not a reason not to go to the hospital if you need to by all means if you are having an emergency please go to the Emergency Room. It is however a fantastic reason to donate  be it time money or whatever you have to offer  if and when you are able to afford it.,Boise,d9zh1aq,2,t5_2qlk4
9643336,0,t3_5cz9j3,I used to sell craft beer in Boise did it for about  years so I have a few opinions on the subject  apologies for sorta going off on a rant it kinda comes together and relates to OPs post towards the end.If youve been drinking beer youll notice that the craft beer scene has changed so much in the last  years and even more so in just the last  years. It sometimes seems that there is a new brewery opening every couple of months in Boise and the surrounding valley thankfully that is starting to slow down from the last couple of years. We dont need more subpar breweries in the Valley we need more quality beer be it local beers or regional or national brands.Like it or not beer is a technical discipline a beautiful melange of science and art and no just because you can homebrew does not mean you can run a brewery which is at its most basic...a business not a hobby. There are a significant amount of new breweries in Boise where the owners are jumping on the craft beer is blowing up double digits bandwagon or homebrewers thinking that because their friends and family loved the free homebrew they gave them that they should open up a brewery. Im amazed by some of the entrants who have absolutely no experience whatsoever in the beer business be it commercial brewing distribution or retail all important knowledge bases for running a successful brewery.While there are certainly exceptions Ive drank a lot of local homebrew in my time lets just say there are plenty of homebrewers who put a lot of commercial brewers to shame. They believe in quality and consistency which are  extremely important aspects of brewing  sadly more so than people who are actually selling you beer at the grocery store or local pubs.As for drinkers if youre going to have an opinion on beer you need to LEARN about beer as I said earlier it is a technical discipline with guidelines established by trade organizations and people who know way more about beer than I do or you do  e.g. Beer Judge Certification Program and the Brewers Association. Yes you can LIKE a beer if it falls outside of guidelines maybe you have a thing for butter in your IPA that resonates with you but that doesnt mean it is actually good when judged against wellestablished style guidelines. Yes you may NOT LIKE Sierra Nevada Pale Ale but you cant say it isnt good as it is damn near the very definition of the American Pale Ale. LIKING beers vs. QUALITY beers are two entirely different equations. If I had a dollar every time someone equated breweries like New Belgium or Sierra Nevada to the likes of Miller or Bud Id be a very rich person. There is a reason why these breweries reached the scale that they have buy producing quality beers without defects consistently for the last  years.Size does not dictate quality just because a brewery is small doesnt mean they make quality beer and likewise just because a brewery is big doesnt mean that their beer isnt quality. There is a lot of good beer being produced in the Valley Barbarian is crushing it right now Woodland Empire has some misses but keeps things interesting and has quality and authenticity at its heart Sockeye to me is the stalwart in Boise theyve been making great beer for a long time they dont release something until it is right they are thoughtful with experimentation and care deeply about the product they release IMHO there isnt a more solid brewing team than the one at Sockeye. Id also toss out there County Line Boise Brewing Cloud  and from what Ive had so far Mad Swede. I get why people dont want to include  Barrel and The Ram as local beer but frankly Shawn Kelso at  Barrel has won more medals than any other single brewer in the world at last count that I heard and he is brewing beer in Downtown Boise we should be stoked by the product he brews who is one of the most respected brewers in the industry when it comes to IPAs right there with Mitch Steele who literally wrote the book on IPA and Tyler Brown of Barley Browns fame not who signs his paycheck. While yes The Ram is somewhat handicapped by the corporate recipes which are meant to appeal to a wide audience again this a business the beers that Jake gets to brew as seasonals and what have you are absolutely killer some of the best in the Valley. Reading Untappd sometimes makes me want to bang my head against the wall sometimes after trying a beer and seeing the reviews about it. If youre going to rate beers on Untappd BeerAdvocate or Ratebeer I would encourage you to know what you are rating and why...does this beer have infections a big problem for a lot of the recently opened breweries in Boise and does it fit the style guidelines? Id also encourage you to seek out beers that are quality examples of a style and comparing them next to a local beer. Try a Powderhaus Prusik Pils next to a Fremont Shine Pilsner or a Firestone Walker Pivo Hoppy Pils or Unita  Pils or Oskar Blues Mamas Little Yella Pils  then see what you think.In short yes there are definitely A LOT of quality beers and brewers in Boise but there is A LOT of really subpar beers brewed in Boise. If Boise wants to become the next Bend we really need to step our game up and that all starts with the consumer dont drink something just because its local drink beer that is good. Rewarding mediocrity will never take us to the next level itll never make us a destination  which of all locales Boise should become a beer destination with the amount of hops that are grown in the immediate area and the amount of malts grown in the eastern side of the state.TLDR Drink good beer educate yourself about beer and dont reward mediocrity demand quality whether it is local or not.,Boise,da1qnq0,9,t5_2qlk4

We dont usually get this much snow at once and it would be unreasonable for ACHD to invest in a huge fleet of snow plows and drivers for them. They keep plowing while the snow is still there they just have to prioritize.

10181988,0,t1_dbta88j,The cost for a line between Caldwell and Boise would be much cheaper than MM.  There is already rail set up between the two it would be basically building spurs and acquiring trains that would be the primary cost.  Stations could be as simple at most points as what they use for the light rail in Munich which was a canopy and a vending machine for tickets.  They use the same thing  for Caltrain and it seems to work just fine.  There was a light rail test about  years ago and at the time gas was cheap enough to derail the project and everything since then has been a rehash of the TIGER project which is a circulator for shoppers downtown.  There was a rail between Caldwell and downtown Boise just over  years ago and a second rail that ran between Nampa and Boise.  The NampaBoise line still exists from a rail perspective and is a lightly used freight rail now.  The CaldwellBoise line was torn up and has since become Highway  and State St.  ,Boise,dby6nsx,0,t5_2qlk4
