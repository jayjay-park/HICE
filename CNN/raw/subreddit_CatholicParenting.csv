7719785,0,t1_d3jde6o,I listened to it twice myself as the mother of two boys and wife. I feel so empowered now and able to steer my boys in the right direction and my husband. I have never come across this direct info on manhood in relation to pleasure vs suffering. I have way more respect for my father and my husband. And I can help filter role models for my boys. Thanks for your comment. I get so excited when I find something so truthful and life changing!  ,CatholicParenting,d3joqae,2,t5_344tc
