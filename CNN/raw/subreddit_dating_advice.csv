P  If you are unhappy being by yourself thats a problem and finding a woman isnt the answer.  You need to figure out how to make yourself happy while by yourself. Finding new hobbies or whatever possible to be happy first then add a woman into your life.  Women usually mature faster than guys so there is a chance for you to find some women your own age at your maturity level.  You shouldnt have to force yourself to talk to people your own age but dont dismiss them until you get to know them. They can appear to be immature around friends and be entirely different once alone. Peer pressure does have a pretty big effect on most people.,dating_advice,cem04r7,3,t5_2s4kl

120602,0,t1_ces4z1n,I certainly understand the sentiment behind what youre saying and Im an honest guy who knows communication is key. It sounds like the system you and your wife have going works for you guys and thats awesome! However I dont think your setup is common and wouldnt be feasible in most relationships. How many attractive women do you see when youre at the mall on a weekend? Id be telling my SO every  minutes if I was honest about every attractive woman I see and I dont believe most people would want to hear that. I certainly dont want to hear about every man she finds attractive and Im not insecure in the least. In my opinion in a healthy relationship there are certain things that are perfectly acceptable to remain unspoken. Its not being dishonest its just that it doesnt need to be said. I trust my partner fully and she should trust me fully to never overstep each others boundaries which I never have and to my knowledge none have cheated on me.Again each relationship is different and people should do what works.

196590,0,t3_1wcbg0,I can understand your situation. Im M and virgin but since a few months ago I now have my first girlfriend and hopefully my last I love her. Let me just say before Ive had a girlfriend I thought dating was tough and it was hard to approach girls but the reality is girls are just as afraid to approach you as you are to approach them. They want to hold hands kiss and date you just as much as you do. And its also true that as a male you have to be the initiator and the gogetter. You have to make your thoughts become reality. The life you want will not fall into your lap you have to go out and get it. The good news is that once you start to go out and start getting dates with girls the process becomes easier. Youll realize that there really was nothing to it and that your fears were just all in your head. Its all in the mind. Ask yourself what imightbebroke would do if he were confident and do it. It can be just as easy as Lets have lunch together. or How about go see that new movie. Your desired reality is right here. What you have to do is face your fears head on and when you do theyll dissolve right in front of you. The hardest part is getting started but it gets easier.,dating_advice,cf0u0il,6,t5_2s4kl

237620,0,t3_1wrz6a,I think sometimes in life we run into people who are bad for us.  Sometimes its because they have bad habits or negativedestructive attitudes etc.And sometimes its because we really really like them.  Something about them just clicks and they are the whole package  you know in your guts that youd be happy with them and only them for the rest of your life.  Those feelings are so strong that its painful when they arent reciprocated.  So you do what the human animal does and try to bend reality aroundread into things in such a way that youve got a shot....My dad told me once that Id probably be in love with a girl maybe  times in my life.  Boy he saidconsider yourself lucky if they love you back three of those times.  Dont fuck it up when you got that kind of coincidence working for you.That bit of Dad Truth has stuck with me over the years and as Ive watched my life and my friends lives play out Im ten or so years older than you I think my old man was on to something.The flip side the corollary to that might be to cut your losses when the coincidences are working against you. ,dating_advice,cf5do1e,2,t5_2s4kl

Trying to shortcut this by seeking out a relationship might treat some of the symptoms but ultimately its not going to make you a happier person.A little bit of exercise goes a long way in improving your day to day mood. It also sounds like you should meet some new people and try to branch out of your current friend group. You have to be happy with yourself before someone else is going to be happy being with you. I say this knowing that it is not an easy task but if you make the conscious choice that youre going to try to improve your own life before bringing someone else into it it will be so worth it in the long run.,dating_advice,cfei8zh,1,t5_2s4kl

535287,0,t1_cg0rqeb,Im glad you replied. You affirmed my own thoughts and the thoughts of most of my friends on his behavior. Lots of red flags. Despite that I still like him and would be willing to work it out if he could change in all honesty I dont think this behavior will change because he is either unaware of it himself or fully aware and unapologetic. Its very disappointing because this all started off wonderfully he was very romantic sensitive and responsible yet seemingly confident and smart and I felt like I could be myself around him.  To clarify weve had two moments of friction in the last two weeks. The st was when I had to change not cancel plans on him because he didnt respond before I went the bed the night before. He texted me the next afternoon and I was not responsive because I was at work he went off about how if I didnt like him I should end it already or if there was someone else because at this point he knew I was dating other guys I should let him know. I admitted I could have been less shortcallous in the original text and apologized if it came off a certain way I didnt intend. When I told him there was some sort of miscommunication and that we should talk about it later because I was busy at work he only got more upset. The nd time was when I brought up how I was sad after he tried to guilt trip me and how that the following day I felt bad because of the pressure he was putting on me for even more affection. He responded saying I treated him badly not appreciating the money he spent on me and only focusing on the bad. He then said he didnt want to talk for two days. I think I will be changing the locks thank you.  ,dating_advice,cg14adw,1,t5_2s4kl

The general public decides whom they datesleep and interact with.Never take anything they do or say past face value.

Its important that YOU decide the time and location. Most of the time if you ask a girl what do you want to do or what time do you want to meet up theyre going to say I dont care Im up for anything! Just suggest a location and a time and most likely they will say yes. Heres an exampleYou Hey  so I was thinking we could go to Olive Garden at . Does that sound good?Her Yeah that sounds great! See you then! of the time this happens if the girl is interested in you which it sounds like she is. If your proposal doesnt work for her for whatever reason adjust it accordingly and ask her again. ExampleYou So I was thinking we could go to Navy Pier at  does that sound good for you?Her Im actually busy till You OK how about ?Her Sounds great! See you then!When the date actually happens just relax and be yourself. You obviously like her and are thus curious about her so ask her questions.

730739,0,t3_22imxt,I started typing out a paragraph and realized that this issue hits on some very important things I think all guys can benefit from.How Rejection Can Work in Your FavorOkay first off Im going to ask you to do something very hard I want you to realize that this girl is a case of just not that into you.Yes she was flirty she was joking she laughed at your jokes and she was talkative. Guess what? Lots of girls who like guys but not sexually do that. In my experience we guys are pretty bad at picking up on what legitimate intense female attraction looks like. Thats another post for another time though.Okay so thats Step One Get Over Her. No matter what the vibe was. No matter how sure you were that she was into you. No matter how little other options you have for female companionship at this point get over it. If you cant get over her at least tell yourself youre comfortable acting like youve gotten over her.If you can do that youre ready for Step Two pat yourself on the back! You did the masculine thing here which is to initiate and display your interested. GUYS DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS if you approach a woman or ask her out she knows youre interested. Thats often all it takes. You dont have to make grand sweeping gestures and beat your hand on your breast to show youre interested. She now knows. You have taken on the male role in the relationship and that is inherently attractive if not  foolproof.And this is good thing. Yes I know she rejected youor at least said yes while getting weird which is basically the same thing. But get this while her treating you differently feels bad because you lost your flirtyfun relationship with her guess what? Shes doing that because she sees you now in a completely different light. She thinks to herself oh shit this guy is interested in me. I have to active a whole different set of neural pathways here. This is DIFFERENT now. My guess is that she said yes to your offer to hang out because shes friendly but that her difference in vibe is due to her feeling not so keen on the idea.And now the most critical step Step Three You must now act like this never happened. Like you actually forgot she had a bad reaction and forgot that you ever brought up dating.It doesnt make sense. After all you know it happened. She knows it happened. So whats the point?Subcommunication.Your behaviors will speak thousands and thousands of words about who you are.  Women wont respect a guy who brags about rescuing dogs but guess what? Theyll love guys who rescue dogs. Because the subcommunication when you rescue dogs but dont brag about it is not only do I not rescue dogs but I do it because Im an inherently awesome guy who doesnt need your approval or validation or even particularly care about it.Acting like you forgot  dont care that she rejected you says about a zillion good things about you including You might ask women out a lot. If youre comfortable getting rejected it means youve likely been there before and have a thick enough skin that it doesnt bug you. This makes you internallyvalidated which is inherently attractive. You have a healthy attitude about life because you didnt like one rejection topple you. Its a very masculine trait to not let the winds of life knock your sandcastle down. The man with a strong sandcastle of emotions is going to get a lot of women interested in him. Youre still cool with her which makes her once again cool with you. Your masculine role is to be the leader here and shell take her cues from you. If youre weird about it guess how shell be? If youre cool about itlike it never happenedguess what shell do?The endresult of all this great subcommunication is she is once again forced to rethink her opinion of you. She was unsure about you at first hence the weirdness after you asked her out. But now she sees you inherently handle her rejection well and guess what? She goes oh shit this guy has legit selfesteem. Once again that is inherently attractive.Dont keep asking her out as the other comments are asking you to do. Youve already taken that masculine leap. She knows it. And if you proceed as normal shell know that you know that she knows it too which means youre speaking the language of women. That suggests youre preselected by other women which isyou guessed itinherently attractive. Asking her out more might help but my guess is that it will only weaken your position keep her on the other neural pathways of this guy needs my approval I must withhold it to maintain its value.There was an article on another subreddit written by a guy who experienced this very phenomenon. He would ask women out get the I have a boyfriend line and then rather then simply sulk hed rather continue being flirty and cool as if it never happened and they warmed back up to him.Not only is this method of handling rejection the only way Im aware of enhancing the possibility however small that shell warm up to you again but is also a great way to train yourself all of the correct habits with women and with life in general. Got rejected? Keep calm and carry on.,dating_advice,cgnc7ng,2,t5_2s4kl
732745,0,t3_22jyx1,Whoa  chill out.  Thats the number one piece of advice that I give my friends and Ive painfully learned after a lifetime of first dates.  Most first dates fail  so dont go in there with high expectations.Secondly you havent mentioned your age or where you will be going for a first date but make sure its not a movie or a restaurant  those two really make it hard for two people to get to know each other.  There is a reason why coffee is the number one choice for first datesThirdly  the art of conversation is paramount  what you say and how you say it is key.  For example non verbal body movements have a huge impact on first date conversations.  Mirror his body movements  except when he does something negative like cross his arms adopt open gestures to see if he reactsDont sit there like a mute  ask open ended questionsDont ask about his salary house ownership type of car he drives and bank account statements too many women do thisAsk what his passion is  what does he like to do thats fun......Being that you met at an event that you were both working you can use that as a springboard but dont return to it.

Dance drink golf run cook whatever.It doesnt sound like you really have anything going on. Or as my favorite spots writer puts it it sounds like a relationship with you might fail the table test does it bring more to the table than it takes away. Besides sex and hanging out on the couch with you what can a guy do when hes in a relationship with you that he cant do otherwise? Because I promise you hes doing the math on the things he cant do when hes in that relationship.If any of that sounds at all like it might be an issue the solution is pretty simple. Bring something besides yourself to the table even if you are pretty good and you will be found more attractive. Organize events. Host a dinner. Get  people together for a bar crawl. Have an outdoor movie night. Get a group together for student season tickets. Doesnt much matter what it is  it shows that you have things to do and that people rally around you.

Yes I a woman in my early twenties do find it odd when a man in his late thirtiesearly forties hits on me without knowing anything about me. It tends to strike me as pathetic. As in why would you think you have more in common with me than with a  or yearold? I certainly dont think wed have much to say to each other just based on age. Its totally different to me if this older man is someone I know through social circles or work then its likely that we already have something in common and can get along. But honestly men who think younger women will bring back their youth or make them feel young are often SO obvious and its really uncomfortable to feel like you need to perform all the time.I say all this from the perspective of being in a happy relationship with a man who is now  we have a  year age difference and got together over  years ago.

1071794,0,t1_chq2wkg,Hey BelleIm not sure if you read the blog entry but happy to answer here too A couple of reasons. Its weird being seen as a kink in the same way that some of my Chinese friends dislike being pursued simply on the basis of race. I am pragmatic about who I date from a racial perspective but by that the same measure its important that she dates me for other reasons beyond having a thing for oriental chaps.. The girl in question was a fair bit taller than me so that was also a bit offputting... heightened the feeling that Id been reduced to a kink.. Its a reasonably wellknown thing for caucausian folk to have a thing for oriental ladies but rarer for it to be the other way round as mentioned in the blog entry this was a bit of a revelation for me!.Whilst youre happy to date oriental guys Id say youre the exception rather than the rule. There may be minor differences in cultural attitudes between N.America and Britain but Id say that over this side of the pond oriental guys generally come fairly low in the racial hierarchy of female preferences.Hope that all makes sense ,dating_advice,chq48gt,0,t5_2s4kl

1205141,0,t1_ci56cdy,No sex is a method of reproduction. Sex is an activity. Sex is a way for two people to emotionally connect. Sex is only a currency if you view it as currency but that is a personal attitude not a fact of life.  Of course you can sell sex and you can buy sex but those are all actions that one chooses to partake in. For two people in a healthy relationship sex is just sex. They have sex because they enjoy it or they want to reproduce or both not because they are buyingselling anything.edit AlsogtThats fine and well but Im going off with the OP actually said and trying not to put any spin on it in either direction.You put a pretty big spin on it. Again OP never even mentioned her own sexual practices yet you made the assumption that she is trading sex for commitment. For all you or I know OP enjoys casual sex from timetotime but is ultimately looking for an exclusive relationship. It is possible to do both. ,dating_advice,ci57300,2,t5_2s4kl

However if you brushed it off and continued to have conversation with her and she just suddenly changed she could have realized shes not into you or she could be playing it cool as to not seem too into you.

You know what you have to do yet youre still worried it might be too personal or offensive?  Are you sure its not due to just being nervous with escalating with the girl that youre dating perfectly understandable?  If you treat a girl like a friend guess what shes going to treat you like?It shouldnt be too hard to pick up a vibe from a girl in a  on  setting.  Does she laugh at your jokes even when theyre not that funny?  Does she playfully hit your arm and tease you?

1228184,0,t3_285ppx,First and foremost I think any guy whos gonna keep forcibly ramming his penis in your mouth is not someone you want to continue seeing unless youre into that kinda degrading sex which is fine but since you told him to stop Im assuming you arent. But even without that detail it seems to me that he just lost interest after the sex. I think that sex complicates things because it can bring all sorts of expectations and emotions into the situation if the terms arent clearly discussed beforehand. On top of that no real emotional connection or commitment has been made. He doesnt even know you that well as a friend and I mean genuine friend so its nothing to just decide he doesnt want to date you anymore and move on. When an actual friendshipconnection is formed simply walking away like that isnt so easy. I would just continue about my business if I were you. Keep dating and doing your thing.

1712898,0,t1_cjuv4ts,It isnt that she cant decide she does not want to date anyone. She likes you enough to keep trying to talk to you and go out but she has no plans to get into a relationship. Let me flip this so you might be able to see how her mindset might be...When I broke up with my ex I went on a streak of hook ups. I never planned on dating any of these girls even though I matched up well with them. A year later now I am starting to want to date again and am now revisiting one girl who I really liked when I wasnt over my ex. She and I have been communicating a lot more recently and I could see something evolving. I didnt want to be exclusive at the time and she accepted it and let me keep doing my thing without bugging me about it. Since we ended in a civil way it left the door open to revisit things. Be the guy who knows what you want but is willing to accept that she wants something else. Dont let it hurt you its not personal. Keep going on your way.,dating_advice,cjv2n1l,1,t5_2s4kl
1744232,0,t3_2eeyso,I think there are three general reasons you could be having this problem. Not putting yourself out there enough.  It doesnt seem that way from your post but it is possible youre overestimating your level of effort. Youre off putting to women in person.  This is something friends can sometimes have insight with. The people you are going for are for lack of a better word... way out of your league.  Now I dont strictly believe in leagues but like tends to go with like.  Sure it is totally possible for someone to date someone far more attractive than them but if youre constantly striking out it is worth considering who you go for.  Maybe youre only trying to date the most conventionally attractive women and overlooking girls who are more cute than traffic stopping.  Considering you only refer to your age as  maybe youre concentrating on  year olds when  year olds would give you a higher likelihood of a date.  Not going to lie being shorter than average does hurt your odds particularly in online dating where people are reduced to stats.  But it isnt anywhere near impossible.  As someone else suggested set ups might be a good avenue for you because you get the positive of being prevetted by a mutual friend.,dating_advice,cjz0ss3,9,t5_2s4kl

After school at home if your parents let you and weekends are the majority of together time you spend with your Significant Other. At UNI your time is more or less your own to schedule. Dont want to take an am class? Dont. Yes I know sometimes you have to. but this flexibility opens us a great deal of potential together time to spend with your SO. I have a friend who spent every hour of everyday with his GF and another who spent ONE hour per week with her GF. It become a matter of FINDING and setting aside time to spend with them.

And it still seems like she is interested but you need to relax and back off on the texting for a while.When a girl you are dating starts to make excuses for not hanging out or she replies late to your texts its time to stop contact and let her come to you.Taking time away from each other gives her the opportunity to miss you. If youre constantly texting her then theres no anticipation or mystery in the courtship.It was a mistake to tell her that you hope she didnt feel obligated that sort of talk communicates weakness and a low opinion of yourself.I think another mistake you might have made was not having sex. You guys had great chemistry and you were alone together at her place for several hours to me thats the perfect situation.From here Id suggest texting her one last time.

2045882,0,t3_2i8g5j,I am guessing this is in the East where things are more traditional? This may require the help of some relatives as your circle of friends is not large enough for you to find someone you like yet. So what will often happen is your parents or uncles and aunts will probably match you with someone maybe even blind dates. If you asked the people who are already in relationships they probably grew up together or were distant relatives or neighbors or their parents were friends  colleagues  classmates. They themselves probably didnt know that unless they asked. Its just that the boygirl just had always been around the family. So you need to expand your circle of friends  acquaintances and if you cannot find them on your own or social norms prevents that then its time to enlist some relatives help. This is probably best done by approach to your mother. Yes it can get embarassing.  Mom I dont really know any girls.... Do you know any good girls I should know?

Some guys try not to be too overbearing because it can alienate. Which is true it definitely can but maybe you should try to get a little bit of your personality into a conversation before you go for the jugular. What I mean by that is if you are interested in a girl at bar with two friends open the entire group. Laugh talk to all three equally not making moves on any. Then when you finally do make a move youre Andy the guy from Fresno with the butterfly tattoo not The Asian Guy from the bar.

2427245,0,t3_2n8pz4,Love is real. But chances are neither you or your boy friend know what love is.That is likely because your parents probably didnt really love each other. Its not their fault though because their parents probably didnt love each other either.In my experience most people equate love with what you have done for me lately. WYDFML.This is just a misunderstood application of the concept of love. When people love each other they actually do things for each other because of love so its natural for someone to look for those loving tokens and to recognize them when they happen.Another way to put it men and women equate attention with love. But in general sorry to generalize women equate mental and  or emotional attention with love where as men equate physical attention with love. Thats not always true but often. What kind of person are you? Have you looked at yourself?Looking for attention and equating it with love is very deeply ingrained in our culture perhaps even deeply ingrained in our genetics.I want to shake up this understanding that we humans have of love. Because its not very healthy.To narrow things down a bit I need to tell you  in my opinion  what love isnt. Love isnt selfish. Love doesnt have conditions. Love doesnt come with a price tag. Love has no expectation. Love is as written by many poets unconditional. We often put the word unconditional in front of the word love but by my definition if it isnt unconditional it isnt love its WYDFML.Its not possible to know for certain that the love we receive is real love and not WYDFML. We therefore can only control the love we give.The Men are From Mars Women are From Venus dude says that to get along we need to do for each other in balance and harmony but I dont like that. Its just a compromise of two selfish individuals agreeing to stroke each others egos to better get along. Thats not love thats mutual selfishness. You can spot those couples because they often pit themselves against the world in their mutual mind gossip about the dysfunction of other couples and in general look down on those poor misguided misanthropes surrounding them.That isnt love thats mutual madness in the guise of love.Dont get me wrong though. Thats a hell of a lot better than what most people have. Most people are so stuck on WYDFML that once one stops giving a war of withholding occurs and the relationship disintegrates.If I had known this when I was a young man my life would have been very different. If I had known that the only way to have any hope of true love was to become a true lover then I would have started working toward my goal much sooner. But alas as an old fart now I can only hope to teach my children and other pups such as yourself.True love is giving and accepting love with no expectation and condition. True love is selfless and seeks only the happiness of others. True love is never about me. If you think But what about me! then you arent loving you are selfing.This may seem obvious to many but in practice it is very difficult. People give and receive affection as they were taught in childhood by their families. We are programmed to give and receive in particular ways and it is very unlikely that we will find someone who gives and receives affection in ways that are  compatible with us. That means that to give affection we have to overcome our programming.Often when we overcome our programming heebee geebees we expect the other person to do that for us too. After all we found a way to express real affection in the way the other receives it! They damn well should too! But they wont because stepping outside ones habits is difficult and only a rare individual will be able to do it. And amazingly expecting the other person to step outside their boundaries to express affection for us in a way we can receive it makes what were doing selfish instead of being loving.In this post I only talk about loving affection. There are many kinds of love expressed in many kind of situations. The way a mother sacrifices herself for her children is love if she has no expectations of them thats a rare Mom but it doesnt really diminish the sacrifice just the quality of affection. The way a father protects his family is a form of love especially at a cost to himself.There are many examples among friends among acquaintances even among strangers.TLDR How peoples definition of love changes as they get olderLove starts out as a feeling a warm confusing pain.It transforms into raw magnetic attraction.It develops into a passionate fire of touch excitement.It flows into a calm knowing acceptance and embrace.It settles into a routine easily maintained set of trusting habits.At some magic point it becomes a choice. A reason to choose love over and over.Once a choice is made to love it becomes selfless and deepens.,dating_advice,cmbpqhq,3,t5_2s4kl

2525344,0,t3_2okm15,  Hi OP a person usually can be broken down into three categories.    Health    Wealth    Emotion  Each category has its own subsections. For example Emotion does not only encapsulate your romantic relationships but all relationships in general your relationship with yourself counts too!. Us from the internet cannot give you an object diagnosis of what is wrong with your approach because its impossible for you to write everything down. But what you could do is spend a few hours breaking everything in your life down to the above and examine objectively what are you doing wrong and once you known then you could start improving yourself.    For example Health hygiene acne? etc etc. Wealth are you paying your bills on time? Do you have money to go out? Do you have money to take care yourself? Emotion Do you have a great relationship with your parents? Do you have lots of friends that you can confide in and Vice Versa? etc etc    Hope this helps C  ,dating_advice,cmo76sf,2,t5_2s4kl

Because as you seem to say yourself you might lose contact with her. BUT I didnt quite catch how emotionally invested she was in the guy shes breaking up with not a native speaker but be careful around affection with a girl that recently broke up with someone as ive lost friends because of it a couple times. I think its important for you to read her vibes and see if she returns the feelings you have for her in any way and then work from there. If she isnt into you i think you should decide whether you want to keep contact over FB or the likes or if youre too emotionally invested in her to see her as a friend and then let it die out. Because hey you can always contact her again after youre over her Sorry it wasnt neccesarily much help but i feel like you deserved some form of answer for explaining your situation in a way i can relate.I also think that deep inside you probably know what you need to do ,dating_advice,cmtnqks,2,t5_2s4kl

I live in the US so I will do my best to interpret.If you want to make it a more intimate environment to show her you want to date. You will want to find a nice restaurant. Let me clarify nice restaurant Im not saying expensive but it has to have nice scenery and a low lighting with a candle lit dinner feel as well as a low noise level. Invite her to go out with you there. Flowers are strongly suggested so that you basically are implying HEY I LIKE YOU. Then she will get the hint nice dinner flowers etc. Do what you would do if you were taking any other girl on a date. If you dont know what that means then just ask.SIDE NOTEDont let this discourage you youre a brave soul trying to date a friend. The point of dating is getting to know someone you already know this person. She probably has spoken to you about her exs or guys she has dated which possibly has put you in the friend zone. As well as shopping with someone unless youre her boyfriend or holding hands in the mall youre friend zoning. Theres a way out you just need to push your way out of it. If this is coming from her friends saying you guys are great together or something like that you might be going down a path of friendship destruction. I did that at  with a girl I was friends with for a long time I asked her out got rejected and we never were the same after that.

2770770,0,t3_2rsrbg,So Id like to offer my perspective as a lesbian who has been in her position plenty of times. Especially around that age.First off I dont read as gay at all. Pretty much everyone assumes Im straight. I was also VERY naive about male attention and dating in my early twenties. I would hardly broadcast my sexuality. I dont really consider it a major part of my identity and have never been very involved in the vocalsocial activismy LGBT scene. Sometimes it just doesnt come up organically in conversation.So let me take you through my mindset in these sorts of scenarios when I was younger.Id meet guys through mutual friends wed hit it off and hang out they would never explicitly ask me lets go on a DATE and I would only read our interactions as platonic. I was never on the lookout for signs of interest from men and being inexperienced with dating at that age was completely oblivious to the traditional signs of attraction.I had a guy friend who asked if I wanted to grab dinner sometime and I absolutely did not pick up on the fact that thats a very obvious date. We hung out several times before he actually asked me if I was gay and I just offhandedly said oh yeah! I dont bring it up that often and kept chatting. Now I am much less naive about guys intentions. Even so its a tricky situation to handle. It feels kind of shitty and presumptuous to assume any attention a guy gives you is nonplatonic. I like having male friends. If a meet a cool guy at a party and he suggests we check out this sweet record store sometime it feels awkward to have to shoehorn my gayness into the conversation. I dont want to lead guys on but if I inorganically bring up my sexuality when we first meet we both know its because Im making the assumption that hes interested. I feel like she saw you as a guy she wanted to be friends with but doesnt like to call attention to her sexuality. She eventually realized that you were interested in more than friendship and had to put on the brakes by bringing up her girlfriend.,dating_advice,cnj0ymp,5,t5_2s4kl

Im not saying OP is desperate but if youre asking advice on how to not come off as desperate there are two possibilities. Youre desperate.. Youre not desperate but for whatever reason youre worried about appearing that way. This means youre aware of how others might view you and maybe youve even been called desperate in the past. Showing interest doesnt make you desperate. Showing interest after receiving social cues that the other person is not interested makes you if not actually desperate at the very least appear that way. Another way to appear desperate is to seemingly lack standards. Does she really pique your interest or are you trying to catch up out of the convenience that shes female and now friends with you on Facebook? Thats a question to ask yourself OP.

I personally think Americans are good people they have a good heart and I include women too but guys are a bit naive and foolish though and women take advantage of them.  Thats a whole different topic though.Ill try to be even more open see if that helps.  ,dating_advice,cq0lbiz,0,t5_2s4kl
3586162,0,t1_cq11l29,Yeah if she texts you thats fine to reply but if she goes on these huge long winded tangents you can text her back saying Id like to hear more about it on our next date. Its respectful and shows that youre thinking about meeting up again.Also this  day grace period is to give both parties time to reflect on what happened.  I like  days and women are always excited to hear from me assuming we had a great time the first date.  With the holiday coming up wait until after Easter.Second date MUST include dinner.  That cannot be compromised.  Your date should be gt hours but lt from my experience.  If shes more of a party gal then you can set up dinner and drinks and possibly get some action that night but I prefer dinner and a low key activity.  Movies are really cliche but not to sound ageist youre in an age group that may be excited to see them  especially if shes some huge cinephile.  Otherwise I like more active stuff like geocaching going for a long walk mini golf but it helps if you live in a city that has more scenic places.,dating_advice,cq11txr,1,t5_2s4kl
3590297,0,t3_31gdbl,Just call her up or text or whatever how you usually talk with this chick tell her you hope she has a great trip and that youre looking forward to seeing her and hearing about her Europe when she gets back.Maybe issue her a challenge to take a picture of something specific or do something specific and send you a picture.  Like tell her you want her doing something or at a specific landmark you know shes gonna see or something.  That last part is optional but I think you get the idea.  Or tell her to pick you up a souvenir.  Something to make sure that while shes there she does whatever this thing is with you in mind.  Put a little thought into it.I mean this stuff is sort of optional but you get the idea.  If you cant bring it up in a way thats fun and playful dont do it.  I guess demanding she do shit over text could be weird depending on the vibe of the talk so follow this advice at your own risk and tailor it to your situation.Maybe you could tell her to send you pictures of her with random French strangers.

3609898,0,t1_cq3n5cj,As a guy the fear of rejection can be a lot more intense than a girl. The emotional mind trumps the logical side. Personally I cant approach girls because of this but at the same time  I can ask them out very comfortably albeit pacing around the room screaming for a few minutes before dialing the number. Others can approach easily yet struggle in the phone call. You might have to lead if hes shy and inexperienced. One can also interpret that hes not that interested because he hasnt taking the initiative to ask you out. Depends if you want to pursue this relationship or not. If I were you Id ask him out. Then youll have an answer to your question. If he rejects try a few days later to make sure. Else Id move on.

3737197,0,t3_336iks,Hi! I want to give you my opinion but please know it is solely my own and I cant possibly know the full extent of what youre going through. Firstly if a guy ignores you.. then I dont think he feels like you are priority to respond to. Now I figure you guys are still sort of on an acquaintance level so its not like you should be a priority. But if he really truly wanted to get to know you and really truly liked you he would respond and also initiate. He would definitely want to meet up with you and not just ignore the question. It just sort of sounds like hes stringing you along as someone to text but not someone to see. Im like you. Im terrible at texting or knowing what to say or how to flirt over text but Ive noticed that the guys who do like me also make an effort to keep in touch and not just leave me to do all the initiating. The worst thing is I know you dont want to just give up. You might already have feelings or some kind of investment in him. YOU know that you are not a clingy person but sometimes you just dont know when to try harder and when to just give up. I hate the feeling of giving up btw.. but sometimes its necessary for your own peace of mind My suggestion is just to try one last time. But maybe directly? Just ask him with no other questions no other words straightforward. Hey do you want to meet up? If he ignores it says no but doesnt offer a specific day or time or just says yes but doesnt follow through. Then I think you gave it your best shot. I think at that point youre not giving up but youre just cutting your losses. I hope this helps!,dating_advice,cqi9jox,1,t5_2s4kl

3798044,0,t3_33wvdc,Yeah unless youve already spent some time together always keep it simple on the first date. I always used to do a drink a walk in the park a coffee a small lunch etc  anything thats quite small and short and if either part isnt interested they dont have to stay long. Advice on this bit deffo have where youre going planned  I was never impressed by guys winging it  I love exploring my city but if a guy hasnt bothered to prepare where to take meeven if it is just icecream or tea I love both! I always questioned him from the start  and none of them stuck.Then once weve gotten a feel for the chemistry and it was good of course Id plan something a bit longer either starting early evening like dinner  or if I really liked them then Id start it midafternoon so if the chemistry stayed good I could get the whole evening too. On second dates you can also commit to doing something where you can relax a bit more and let your guard down a bit more because you already have a feel for the person  like the zoo mini golf boating etc.Hope this helps  and good look ,dating_advice,cqp7gi7,2,t5_2s4kl

The result was always this awkward jumbled and  mumbled messa self fulfilling prophecy if youve never seen one.I dont know if it was this way because I was anxious or if I was anxious because I would continuously get bad results. It all changed once I found the right meds and dosage to control the nervousness. I say what I think is funny and try to deliver it like it sounds in my head. Once I broke through it was like I had the confidence and wit to be attractive all along. I practice every chance I get and havent had so much as a bad time doing it even if I fail.I believe the social skills that are crucial for dating can be learned almost anywhere talking to anybody.

4123377,0,t3_37vtqy,There is no direct Do A then B type guide because these kinds of interpersonal relationships are unique and therefore are unique when they are formed.  Basically what you need to do depends on what your problem is what kind of person you are and what kind of person you want to be with.My general advice is to put yourself in situations where you interact with women at a social level. If youre in school its easy join some clubs.  If youre out of school there are other options but they all basically boil down to joining some kind of activity group. When choosing what groups to join please think about demographics.  If you like programing dont join a programing group you wont meet many women there. However dont fake an interest in something that you dislike it will come back to bite you if you form an actual relationship. Once that is accomplished start to engage them in casual conversation.  If thats going OK you start to ramp it up a little and flirt.  Thats where what youve been reading about comes into play.

4154931,0,t3_386fig,I would get an edgier hairstyle. Dont go too over the top but maybe buzz the sides.Put yourself out there. Dance classes are NOT mostly couples. Even if they are its good to practice making friends socializing with women and all types of people meeting and hitting on the singles that are there and learning a new skill that gives you confidence and girls love.Try and find action pictures of yourself or full body shots taken by others. Even just with your arm around a friend at a bar works. Shows that you have a life friends and for whatever reason people hate selfies.My online dating advice to you is this Be prepared to send hundreds of messages and only get maybe  or  good leads at a time. Lot of women online who just want to waste your time they just want your electronic attention nothing more or women who simply dont respond. Dont let it affect your selfworth because online dating is nothing like talking to women in real life which leads me to my next point.Youd be better served learning to talk to women start by trying to get comfortable around them just being friends and making smalltalk dance classes are GREAT for this IN REAL LIFE. There is so much less competition all the guys who are too scared to approach in real life and just talk online because its as easy as pressing a button and take up her time and attention so that she just shuts  of guys out and you get thrown out with the bathwater and its easier and quicker to read a woman and tell if there is something there or not instead of wasting weeks trying to figure out if shes really interested and waiting for her to find the time to send one short message which you will summarily overanalyze the hell out of. Just meet women in real life for now and focus on getting comfortable around them and making female friends. Female friends lead to more female friends and girlfriends. Theyre your allies. You need them first.I would also start working out. Will give you a huge confidence boost and improve your appearance no matter how good you look already.And yes meetup.com is great. Awesome free practice for getting used to socializing more talking to girls and making friends.,dating_advice,crtvijh,1,t5_2s4kl

Matters of the heart are difficult especially when one person is more emotionally involved than the other. If you do break it off dont burn that bridge. You may find that in a year or  the time maybe right to be together exclusively. Also dont exclude dating other girls as well. She doesnt want to be exclusive right now with you. she may never want that with you. thats ok and on the plus side jealousy sex can be amazing just dont confuse it with love and dont let her control every situation.

4410753,0,t3_3bjylh,It depends on if there is a romantic element at all in my opinion. Im a woman dating a man. However two of the three people I consider to be my best friends are men. All three of us are in relationships and our friendships are completely platonic. Even if we werent with other people I would not want to be in a relationship with them and they feel the same about me. If there was attraction between me and one of them or between me and a female friend as Im bi that would be a line I wouldnt be comfortable with as I have a boyfriend.

4441661,0,t1_csqifyh,Sorry misread your question.SoMen need to know they are going to be needed in the relationship. From his perspective being needed gives value to a mans role in the relationship same with women! but women like to be needed in different ways. Value makes them feel wanted and that lets them know that they are in a safe space with this person. Another way to let men know its safe to open up is for you to open up and not expect a certain type of response. To have expectations about a persons reaction is a fools game unless otherwise explicitly promised and agreed upon between the two. Opening up to someone and not expecting anything in return is a beautiful gift that should give only when ready. Genuine honesty will let him know hes in company that will protect his vulnerability and never use it against him. Creating a safe connection between a two people allows for men to start to open up which is the key to starting on the journey of intimacy ,dating_advice,csqk0xj,1,t5_2s4kl

Period.I know the difference between a vegetarian and a vegan they were vegans. Vegans dont necessarily abstain from added fat sugar or salt.. Personally I believe salt has a lot less of an impact on actual weight loss than most people realize. You will be fat if you consume more calories than you burn this is typically harder on a vegan diet but far from impossible. Have your body burn more calories than you consume and weight comes off.

4633474,0,t3_3eg47d,It isnt easy to understand what youre saying because all of the sentances are written out like they are thoughts in your mind instead of telling someone else what is going on.  From what I gathered it sounds like you like this girl and shes dumped or led you on before and now shes saying she wants a long term serious relationship but she started backing off again. It sounds like you responded like any normal person would she starts backing off so you say I dont want a long distance relationship so do what you gotta do. Then after she pulls some more crap you remove her from facebook and she gets pissed.  My conclusion is that you think she was testing you. Based on what I got from what you wrote and if my assumptions are correct you did the right thing when she started getting iffy about the situation and started backing off. The  things Ill tell you that are the only real issues I saw in the post are  . When you make a decision dont go back on it when you know its the right thing for you to do. She says she got into another shcool so you tell her go if you want. She says she doesnt want to go with you then you basically say Im not dealing with your crap and remove her from facebook. Everything you did makes sense and is completely reasonable especially given your on and off history with her. From my opinion you didnt do anything wrong.  . Anytime a person behaves like this or tries to test you to see if your relationship will last regardless of if its a friend or a girlfriend they are not a good person to be around. It will be nothing but a relationship of mind games.  It sounds like youre probably    based on getting into a school away from home. All you need is more confidence in yourself when you make those decisions so you dont appologize when youve done nothing wrong and so youll stick to the decisions youve made and know that you did what is right for you. It also sounds like youre growing up mentally by knowing long distance relationships dont work out and also by not trying to convince someone to move closer to you if they say they dont want to any more. It sounds like youre a good person who is more mature and intelligent than this girl. If shes about the same age and shes still pulling this crap you dont want anything to do with her. Doesnt matter how much you like her theres always someone else out there that you can get with who will be better for you and wont pull these kinds of things. This girl is at a maybe  yr old mentality and if you stay with her it will only get worse.

4666263,0,t3_3euaea,Its clear that you cannot see it but already this guy is showing a lack of respect for you.  He is trying to tell you what you want to hear so that he can get the very thing you say you dont want to give but hes doing a bad job.  You can see that hes doing a bad job and are closing your eyes to it.  You are telling him that you want to be with someone who wants more from you than sex and he is telling you that he is one of those guys who wants to be with you for sex but you are not listening.  Why arent you listening?  Probably because on some level you are thinking that by telling him what you want he will treat you differently than the others.  Hes trying to do that by saying what he thinks you want to hear. But his sexual comments are telling you clearly that he is no different he wants the same thing and will treat you the same way as the others.  Making future plans with you is an old trick that works on girls generation after generation.  It makes you envision a future with him makes you more likely to have sex with him as a result of your own imagination into the future.  So whats the harm in having sex with him?  No physical harm assuming he is diseasefree.  But many women have no idea about the way sex affects them vs. men.  There is a biological reason that women often get attached to the wrong men or fall in love long before he does.  It sounds like youve had just about enough of playing around and you want a more serious relationship with some substance.  Just be patient.

If you are successful in getting a date with her you need to learn to escalate from the friendzone vibe to potential lover. This involves flirting through small touching and teasing and other methods. Alcohol may help with this if the setting is appropriate. I would first try practicing escalating slowly to gauge her reactions before I ask her out on a date though.

4997038,0,t3_3jdn3b,I dont think theres ever a NEED to talk about past relationships unless its something major abuse cheating etc..  It can be construed as a dealbreaker and awkward conversation so early in the dating process.  That said there is a time and place for everything.  Pasts can come up if the person has certain anxieties and needs to explain the why of it.  Sometimes you have a person that just genuinely wants to know and is curious amp understanding that everyone has their histories.I would never make the past relationships a topic of conversation unless its specifically brought up.  Theres really no need to relive it all unless its impeding something in your current relationship.For example my girlfriend and I decided wed spend an evening talking about skeletons in our closet and it was a quid pro quo of our stories.  We bonded grew closer and I let her know that if she was ever curious Id tell her more only if she cared to know.  And we both respected each others pasts that way.,dating_advice,cuobvk0,4,t5_2s4kl

Many men and boys feel this way because of the decayed and twisted dynamic between men and womens treatment of each other. Remember that you have value. And remember that she is a person that feels the same things as any other person. She may appear to have the luxury of choice but she like most girls are unable to take the lead and rely on man to make things happen.Back to the story When you were that close to each other...Both of you standing as opposed to sitting?

A girl who wants to just have a friend doesnt get into intimate space touching. I will tell you this the older you get the less age will matter and sound weird. Yes Age should not matter. But an  year old dating a  year old sounds weird compared to a  year old dating a  year old right?  Chase what you want. Be selfish. If you like this girl go for it. The worst that can happen is you find out she doesnt want to get romantic with you and you can not waste your time on it. Have another date make sure you called it a date. If she agrees you know she is interested in you because quite clearly its a date. Hold her hand give her a hug. If it goes well go for a kiss.

5387470,0,t1_cw09xiy,Ive always thought she was worth it. She is an amazing girl and we get along really well. Her and I think very much alike and she has a very unique sense of humor that I absolutely love. And I guess I just feel super comfortable with her. I really like her but at the same time I dont get nervous with her like I would with other crushes. I have no problem being myself with her and shes the same way with me.  In high school I was too much of a pussy to ask her out because I though she was out of my league. When I found out she did like me that gave me enough confidence to ask her out but I have very minimal experience in dealing with girls beyond a friendship so I just did what felt natural. But when things got a little shaky I panicked and thanks to my lack of experience I didnt really know how to handle the situation properly. What I should have done was when she started throwing mixed signals I should have called her out on it and addressed the issue head on. But instead I did nothing and things just fell apart from there. So I dont see this as the one that got away I see this more as a second chance that I really need to not screw up this time.,dating_advice,cw0b5wz,1,t5_2s4kl

Also if you ever feel like you arent sure what to do or say to a woman just ask questions about her. As women we can talk endlessly about ourselves.ask where shes from what she is into what her favorite vacation spots are how many siblings she has if shes ever played a sport what her favorite movie is and then riff off of that.. Some women wont offer up too Much info with out getting some in return so as she answers answer for yourself as well maybe it will spark a connection. Im sure you will be fine just make sure to remember her name and some of the info at least and most importantly smile and speak with confidence. Everyone gets rejected some more than others but the sooner you realize that rejection is not bad thing and that you had a fulfilling convo with a pretty woman youll get better and better at it and the tables will turn in your favor with the number of nos being outweighed by yes go get em tiger!,dating_advice,cx5i9dq,1,t5_2s4kl

Take it by the reigns and make it your bitch.  And no! You are not a creepy creep. ramblesI early s male started talking to a lady.  Shes !! Holy hell I was not expecting her to reply back. She happens to be  years older than my eldest sibling and...  Not much younger than my mother to provide a little context. Weve hit it off fantastically well.  We talk for hours a day and this morning we were up till am talking and bullshiting. Because why not? Weve discussed our age difference. On two occasions. The first time was after hearing she was married with two children. I asked why she would be interested in talking to someone so young and much more interested. We talked a bit about age and such but it came down to the two of us believing one thing... Age is arbitrary. A common thing I am told by older women  is that I am to inexperience in and young in life. Age does not determine what how how much life experience you have but increases the over all exposure you have to experiences...  Which is something people seem to not understand.  As far as I am concerned I will not limit who I talk to based on how many times they have roughly circled the sun on a ball of dirt that is so insignificant in the scheme of the universe that we could all disappear and it wouldnt matter in the fucking slightest. Im not going to argue with people especially strangers online about this save your time and dont reply.The second time was last night.  I asked her if she wanted to grab coffee around lunch and go for a walk around a park. There is only so much that you can figure out about someone via text based communication.  She turned me down because  She wants to get to know me better first.   she wants to make sure I am ok with out age difference if we go on a date.  shes never met anyone in person that shes talked to on OKC.I find these all to be fair reasons. So I will wait for a couple weeks to see if shes interested in meeting then.,dating_advice,cxd8ks8,3,t5_2s4kl

I do think the fact  that he didnt pay for you nor make any kind of physical moves on you is significant. And that could also explain his ambiguous answer when you asked him if it was a date probably because he was caught off guard by the question because he assumed you knew it was just as friends and didnt expect that you thought otherwise.

Is about level of comfort one can feel around friends. Some people are just... naturally flirty  friendly. Or as it used to be known... charming. The problem is we cant explain it to you how it feels to fall in love. Itd be like... you want to be next to that person NO MATTER what it takes that the world would be emptier if youre not there and all that. Sounds cliche but thats the way it is.

The ball is in your court I wouldnt expect him to make any moves to start dating. If you decide after some time that you want to be a thing then you need to clearly tell him that the status is changing and that youre interested in dating.    There are varying levels of dating. You dont have to be exclusive immediately. If you start to like him more you could tell him that you want to go on dates to test the romantic waters but not label it as boyfriend and girlfriend. You should also clarify that it leaves you both open to date other people if you choose to. But if you realize that you really like him and you want to move into an exclusive relationship then you should also be very clear on the terms of your expectations.

I guess I just have a habit of ignoring many positives signs and focusing on the negative. I mean I cant have fucked things up with one situation? To be honest its probably been forgotten since it seems like she had a pretty heavy night the following day. Would someone really be switched off that easily like that? I guess I shouldnt have.I understand it is a mans job to escalate physically but trust me I really did try. Whilst I havent been with a huge amount of women I have been with enough to understand or at least get a pretty good idea when the coast is clear. There just wasnt an opening and I really didnt want to ruin things by going one step too far. Seriously my hand was cupping her ass I had my hand resting on her lower stomach close to her underwear and I was feeling her up at one point. What was I gonna do  literally pull her face against mine and start making out? Thats what made me so confused. But then she initiated kissing me at the end of the date without me even trying...So Im pretty sure if she wanted to she wouldve given me a signal...I guess I need to really get some alone time with her next time I see her. Id like to really escalate things and just invite her over to mine for you know netflix and chill and Im just so surprised it didnt happen when she was already over.And I agree on about the emotions part because some neediness and insecurities did shine through. However I think thats the only point it has. I really dont overmessage nor do I make myself super available as Im busy.

5951569,0,t1_cxzi4m6,gtYeah I need to forget about it. Well I dont mean forget it completely. Im just saying dont overthink it. Relax. Shell either get back to you or she wont. gtIve had one girlfriend and I managed to get her by being smashed off my head with  cares given but that was  years ago so Ive no experience on how any relationshipdatingasking out goes really.All you need to remember is that actions speak louder than words. If someone is into you they will make a sincere effort to see you. So once you make your intentions known as youve done here you wait to see how they react. Dont chase any woman. gtChances are shes forgotten as I know she is quite busy with university  jobs and volunteer work which funnily enough Ill be doing start of next year at the same place shes at.I seriously doubt shes forgotten. IF she has then thats means she is definitely not as interested in you as you thought she was. And this is one of the reasons its probably better that you dont have her number right now because after a few days you may convince yourself that she just forgot and then youll think you need to call her and ask her again to remind her.  Which just risks making you look desperate.Like I said if shes into you youll find out soon enough. Either she will get back to you with a time that shes free or she will bring up the date to you letting you that shes still not sure when shes free. ,dating_advice,cxzs45n,1,t5_2s4kl

5966816,0,t1_cy0t6ku,gt If you read these statements carefully you will see Im not saying that anyone can or cant be religious but that we should not be so set in our beliefs that we do harm to humanity.I did. I cant find the exact terms for it right now but when one communicates there is what they expressly say what you quoted above and what is actually communicated. By making statements like blindly believe in religious teachings and Gods and citing religious indoctrination you are dismissing all religious experiences as being done without critical thought regardless of your stated intention elsewhere. And no that interpretation isnt people being too dumb to understand you I clearly understood what you intended to say the first time. But that is not what you communicated as people can read between the lines and see your disdain despite your carefully chosen words which I also noticed and is what I commented on.You were condescending in the above example and in the example I citedgt And then you responded with condescension towards Christiansagnostics who do not automatically agree with your train of thoughtgt I didnt think a agnostic would have seen any issue with my message though. A Christian yes.Its condescending because you come across as saying that a religious person would be dumb to take offense because they are letting their beliefs cloud their judgement. It has the added effect of communicating that any agnostic person who disagrees with you is dumb because they should show better judgment than a beliefclouded Christian and arent. You also imply that they should want to engage in debate with a complete stranger how else are we to make change in the world  not everyone enjoys debates and especially not with strangers who they have no prior emotional read on and who may blow up on them unexpectedly. Or become petulant as you did Anyway Id love to hear your opinions and thoughts on the topic but if not oh well.I should note that I believe that religious indoctrination does occur and worry about others believing blindly I dont necessarily disagree with you. But to open with sweeping statements like yours when the other person does not know you beyond your profile and message makes you appear judgmental. Also if thats all you had to work with from her profile a throwaway line about chivalry which you disagreed about that should have been a good sign that you would be incompatible.Side note you came across as very condescending towards me in your response e.g. If you read these statements carefully implying I did not and am too dumb to understand you. I read everything carefully before responding. You should work on rereading your own statements in order to better understand how they may be interpreted by others in the absence of prosodic and gestural cues and in general as your word choices are not as inoffensive as you think they are. I hope you read this as an attempt at objective analysis I do wish you the best  online communication is so incredibly difficult. ,dating_advice,cy1s4ie,1,t5_2s4kl

Call her up right now? and say Hey can I take you on a date?. Say those exact words. Shell say Yes because she she already said she likes you and youre saying date so nobody gets confused whats going on. Figure out if she likes steak or sushi or indian if shes a veg. Take her to either. Make sure its pretty good.  minute walk from a good bar is good.Ok this is a casual date. Youll be nervous but thats ok. Dress sharp. Dont wear a suit. Just a nice shirt. Wear nice shoes. Ask your guy friends Hey man Im going on a date tonight can you make sure I look sharp. Maybe khakis and sweateroverdressshirt look. Pick her up and take her and pay for dinner. Eat something small. Ask her open ended questions read not yesno questions. Its ok to mention once how nervous you are. Shell think its cute as long as you say it once. Tell her she looks good and shes smart because she does some thing. Ask her if she wants to go for a drink. Dont stay for drinks at the restaurant bar. Take her somewhere else. Ask her what she likes. Take her to somewhere cool. Order an Old Fashioned or Manhattan if youre at a moderate to fancy drink bar. Order some beer youve never heard of if youre at a dive both types of watering holes are acceptable. Make it seem like you know what youre doing.If you guys have a few drinks take an Uber back or walk if its close. Leave your car there if you have to. Figure out how shes getting back later. If she doesnt mention it then dont bother. Take her for a walk especially if its snowing. Itll be cute. Or ask her if she wants to come over and watch a movie read netflix and chill. You can have more drinks there. Dont drink too much but its ok for you to have a few. Start a movie or something or be on the walk. Whatever just make it intimate.Ok heres the part this is both comically easy and will be nerve wracking. Say Can I take your hand?. Shell say yes because she knows. She puts her hand in yours. Look her in the eyes and say Can I kiss you?. Shell say yes because she knows. You can say Ok Im really nervous. Its ok because she knows how nerve wracking it can be. Youll probably be shaking and might have a giant boner. Its ok. It happened to all of us too. Itll be great I promise. Dont think of this as a risk.

6057100,0,t3_3yhl4t,I feel the need to respond to this since during my senior year in high school I was  so close to you I started having feelings for my girl best friend. Ill spare you the details but we were close and I thought there was potential for something. Sadly for me though she was dating someone at the time so I just bottled up how I felt. After a while it started eating me up and I decided to tell her. I told her how I felt and she told me it wasnt mutual which hurt a LOT at the time. I wont lie to you for a couple days a week or two it was really awkward. We were assigned seats next to each other in classes and it hurt to see her in person but after a while things get better as long as youre as close as you say you are. What helped me the most was making myself busy with other friends and making space between us for a while until we both agreed I had moved on.Now I sort of went on a tangent but the main moral is dont bottle up your emotions. Itll drive you mad. You should tell her how you feel but make it clear you really dont expect anything back and that you just wanted to let her know whats on your mind. As her best friend you need to respect the fact that she said she doesnt want to date anyone right now. A best friend wouldnt exploit another best friends times of weakness to help their own agenda.Now I feel like Ive sort of painted a really negative picture for you here just bare with me. If things work out between you two and you end up dating fantastic! But dont go in expecting it.

I also think that texting too much at least from my experience leads to having less to talk about in person because you both already know EVERYTHING that has happened for the other person since you last saw each other.

Its fucking great to have one but the more you NEED a girlfriend the shorter it will last if you even manage to get one.As everyone else has said here strong independant man is the keyword. Grow up stop worrying about it about who said what about whom about her and your friend just live your life dude.

6140951,0,t1_cynmf60,I agree. As a girl I usually dont care to respond to the hi or hey whats up. I like the messages that shows that they took the time to read my profile rather than just message me because I was a pretty face or for whatever physical reason. Also even with FREE websites like OKC and POF theres this enigma about it being solely for hookup purposes so you definitely want to steer clear from any implications that its what you want. Dont be discouraged if you send out a thoughtful message though. Girls are just as shallow as guys and no matter what quirky thing you said physical attraction is usually the initial factor in whether youll receive a response or not.Good luck with your online dating adventures!,dating_advice,cynnu6y,1,t5_2s4kl

I promise you that it will mess you up its unhealthy for you and a potential relationship. Its never not messed stuff up. Why? Because you end up muting your true personality or worse yet try to be someone youre not. Even if youre able to get a girl by doing that itll fail long term because not being yourself is way too energy demanding.       Heres what you do go for a run engage in a hobby read a book message  other girls go hang with a friend or a family member do something work or school related make a positive change in your life. Do this until the girl is just another girl to you. When you can pick up your phone and authentically text her genuinely not worrying about the outcome you will most likely succeed. You might not but it wont matter much to you. Dont ask her out immediately. Build rapport. Then set the date. Pick a specific date and time. If she says she cant let her offer another time.

6197542,0,t3_40h4oq,First off I want to say thank for you doing this!Im mmn and have never had a real gf. Ive gone on dates in the past even though the were never officially referred to as dates but nothing has ever gone further than that first meet up. I should note this only happens once every few years or so. However I do have quite a bit going for me. Im college educated have a decent car a decent job getting my own place this spring in an upscale suburb and have a few circles of really good friends. I also play in an original rock band that actively records and plays out. I also dress very well macys nordstroms pac sun ect. Kinda of an adult skater look I guess. Nothing crazy for sure.What I seem to struggle most with is confidence which stems from a couple of things. Im only  but lbs starting to bald bad skin was picked on horribly at school growing up and have Aspergers Syndrome which complicates everything further. Ive been seeking professional help for years and have come miles from where I was but it still lingers. Im also not in a great spot to meet people. I work in tech which is largely male dominated my friends are either married or in committed relationships and Ive found that being heavily involved in music and bands isnt very appealing to the opposite gender dont ever seem to care. Ive tried to ask my friends in the past and was always told that someone is out there for me but Im almost  and Im afraid my lack of experience will scare off anyone even remotely interested. Its not that Ive done this by choice its just kinda how everything played out. Even in college I was unable to meet anyone that liked me back and I actually got teased for that too by my friends. I am told that confidence is key but how can I be confident in myself when Ive never had any success or have anything to make me feel like I have anything to be confident about. Why should I think Im attractive if no one else does? Ive tried online dating but that has been a horrible experience. I get no messages back even when I make a personalized message no matches on tinder and no views even on any dating site. Kinda concluded that I must be ugly lol. So not sure what to do at this point. Im sick of being lonely yet I know I have a lot going for me. I think my lack of experience at my age isnt helping either which probably plays into the confidence bit. I just dont know what to do anymore. I dont know how to flirt show romantic interest or really anything at all like that. Ive always been the third wheel. Im not one to just give up but Im not seeing much return on the investment. Im really hoping that you have something anything at all to guide me to the right path here.Thanks again for doing this.,dating_advice,cyu3eo2,3,t5_2s4kl

6223886,0,t3_40rsxw,OK no.  Hes not stringing you along but trying to prevent being too clingy too persistent with asking you out on dates and generally trying to play it cool.  He obviously likes you or else he wouldnt be texting you.  Heres the deal from a guys point of view because a woman has been doing this to me.  Long story short met a girl a few weeks ago online.  A lot of intense texting while she was on vacation before we met up.  Met up we connected had a fantastic time she pulled me in for a kiss.  Met up a few days later took her to see my friends band play.  Again awesome time we felt something real she took me home.  The morning after shes like Im going to be super busy with work for the next couple weeks she really is a workaholic.  I say No problem Im patient. A couple of days later I text her and say Hey I know youre busy.  But how about we grab a pizza and a beer at this cool place on Saturday. ish?  She replies Yes! Absolutely!  Ill text you in a bit when Im home.  I purposefully didnt text her at all since she really was busy at work work travel late night at the office..  I didnt hear from her for a couple of days.  She finally gets back to me.  We talk for a bit  shes leaving for business for the day the following day. I say Good luck!  Safe Travels! Hit me much when things cool down.So on Friday night last she texts me at like  PM and is like Ugh! I have to work this weekend!  I lost a week of my life! Blah blah blah.  She works a  to  office job and puts in all this extra work on purpose.   So I took that as a hint that she couldnt hang out the next day and we talk a bit more.  Then I just went radio silent.  She could have suggested an alternative day.  If someone cant make time for me then do I really want to be with that person?  I dont know.  Im not emotionally involved with her so in the end shes hurting her own personal life if she cant make time for it.On Sunday I text her saying I hope all is well with work!  Dont stress too much about things.  Id still love to take you out so when things cool down just let me know when you are free.Nothing.I really like this girl too and it sucks.  I wasnt going to keep up the banter because its kind of pointless when you really think about it.  So Im going to reach out one more time tonight or tomorrow to say whats up and see how things are going.  This is the last time.  After this Im done.  He might be feeling the same way as me.Heres my advice...  How about YOU suggest an alternative specific date and time?  He tried he reached out to you hes trying to make time for you but like me is wary about taking another ego hit of plans falling through.So turn the tables modern dating has changed.  Why does it always have to be the guy to set specific times and dates?  you ask him out. Not casually.  But with a specific date and time.  Say if that doesnt work Im free on these days nights.Or I was just side dick. ,dating_advice,cyx36rr,1,t5_2s4kl

That puts the ball in her court so youre left wondering as you are now if and when you should try asking her out again. If she wants to see you shell get back to you. If you dont hear back from her theres your answer. In this situation since you didnt do that and since she has at least reached out again I think you should go ahead and try asking her out again.

Probably not if you dont bring it up again but shes probably a little put off at the moment.

I know thats not what you want to hear but there isnt another way. Risking the friendship is part of asking out a friend. gtBut my plan was to just go get drunk or high with my cousin and grow the balls to do itDont use drugs to manage your emotions or give you some power you dont have. Thats how drugs control you. Do drugs because theyre fun not because you think smoking weed makes you cool or being drunk will give you confidence. Trust me it will not make you more suave itll just make you THINK you are. Theres a huge difference. gtIll be to stoned or drunk to care if she says she doesnt like meYoull still care youll just also be drunk or stoned. gtAnd lastly Im just scared Ive never been rejected simply because I never ask anyone outThats okay. Its okay to be scared. Its normal to be scared. Asking people out is hard but you can do it. Ask her out honestly directly  you dont need a lot of words or a flowery paragraph of love or gifts. Just say something like Hey Daywalker I think youre really cool. Want to go on a date Friday to see a movievisit the cool Planetarium showwalk through a free art exhibitsomething? Keep it simple. Theres less to be nervous about. If she says yes great. If she says no then say Thats cool no big deal. And then  this is important  DONT MAKE IT WEIRD. Just move on and pass it over. If you dont make it awkward she wont think its awkward either. Thats social magic right there. P.S. Forget about the friendzone. ,dating_advice,czkmp9j,1,t5_2s4kl

Probably not. But you can plant a seed. Ask him about his GF how long theyve been together how they met etc. If he changes the subject or doesnt say much about her then thats a sign. Or itll spark something in his brain. You can always leave it as shes really lucky. How can I find someone like you? But dont go beyond that. Be happy that you are friends.

A good strategy is to make conversation about what kinds of things they like to do then suggest doing one of those things together. Having a specific date in mind can actually help make it less awkward too. Instead of asking do you want to go out sometime? ask do you want to go to X with me this Friday?

You just basically said yourself you couldnt see yourself doing something so counterintuitive to someone else so why when it happens to you are you making a case to give her a pass? She fucking burned you man. She is a product of this empathydevoid culture we live in where the majority of the ways people interact now a days is through screens and social media and so it causes them to be ill prepared with how to actually deal with real people inperson. I stand by what I said. Make an example out of her or you are just condemning the next innocent guy to the same level of frustration and resentment you are feeling now. Her actions have now negatively affected your life. Ya maybe awkward isnt a full fledged  on the spectrum of negativity but it sure doesnt fall on the positive side. So why should she just be allowed to get away with that? I mean its your call man but I wouldnt let that type of injustice go unchecked.As I said before you can just tell her your feelings are hurt and then say that you hope she never has to encounter someone with such a lack of empathy towards other human beings that it negatively affects her life in the way she has negatively affected yours. Again its debatable how negative you think the consequences of her actions are but then again youre the one on the internet making posts about it. I doubt shes doing the same thing.

6607029,0,t3_465gt2,Based on the other response in here Ill be the devils advocate. Be the best you. Dress sharp be well groomed and show youve got yourself together. Engage in conversation that allows her to talk about herself more and keep things light hearted. Dont drag on about her relationship or be her pillow to cry on. You havent seen eachother or talked much to begin with so focus on exciting positive things that have happened since you were in school. Humor is a great tool. Combine humor with escalation of touch like playfully putting your hand on her arm when youre laughing or teasing her and see how she reacts. Play this all by reaction as you go. Depending on the situation between her and her ex you can be an example of what else is out there. Use this situation as a stepping stone to a date not trying to transform it to a date itself. That can be more elaborate than drinks should she respond positively to this. If shes on a break things are obviously rocky and that can be an ample opportunity. ,dating_advice,d02q0k4,1,t5_2s4kl

She is attracted to you sexually which is good but maybe she isnt ready to commit to a relationship or possibly doesnt see you as relationship material. I would definitely stop saying you love her if she told you flat out that she doesnt love you like that. You will push her away by trying to force the relationship. Keep seeing her and enjoy the time you are having. I would date other women in the meantime. She may see that and get jealous and realize she doesnt want to lose you. If she wants you to just be with here then she will have to decide if she wants to be more serious. I would just have fun with her and let the relationship grow. If you guys are a good match together then the relationship will grow naturally. When I met my wife I told her I didnt want a serious relationship.

No one gets access to my Facebook because a FB is a dead medium to me b dont use it for communication or catching up with friends and c I keep my FB on lockdown.Its truly insane how much people below mid s and below put online and dont realize the repercussions of it.

Whether or not you choose to put yourself out there is up to you.What I can judge by the tone of your post is that you sound a bit bitter after a string of failures OP  and thats ok. The problem is that women can sense that negativity on dates and it comes across as desperate. Remember youre on a date to get to know the woman in front of you for the person she is she is not a goal to fill the void in your single status.Take a break and go life your life the way you want to. Hobbies activities travel whatever it is that you do to make your life awesome.

But I wouldnt just assume people are being safe about the sex they are having. You dont really know if people are being safe unless you have some kind of conversation about the sex that you both have. This is coming from the perspective from someone who has admittedly had not safe sex with an ex not knowing his current situation So I think it would be perfectly reasonable to ask.  And if someone acted like it was not my business about whether or not they were sleeping with other people and the last time the got a full STI screening I think I would rather not have sex with them.But I dont think there is anything unreasonable about wanting to wait to have sex with someone until you are in an exclusive relationship and you can wait to both get STI tests first. Woo!.

7071404,0,t3_4cg7jj,gti need full proof evidence.WelcomeToTheDarkseid Listen to me There is no such thing as fool proof evidence. If you sit around reading a womans signs waiting until youre absolutely sure then youll never ask anyone out. The only way to know for sure is to ask her.So sometimes you need to just get over your fear of rejection and take the chance. Look everyone gets rejected sometimes. Everyone. It happens. And when it does its not the end of the world. So dont let that stop you. And the sooner you ask the sooner you can either move forward with her or move on without her but either way at least youll know which is better than the limbo youre in right now.Also while Im not a fan of the phrase friendzone let me tell you that the longer you wait the longer you stall and hold back and continue to spend time with her in a strictly platonic fashion the greater the chance youll be putting yourself in the socalled friendzone as by the time you finally make your move she may have come to enjoy your platonic friendship so much that she doesnt want to risk losing that. Not to mention the possibility that some other fellow whos not so shy might come along and snatch her up and youll have missed your shot if you ever had one. So you need to make your intentions known fairly early one while its more likely that she sees you as a potential mate.So thats my advice. Ask her out on date. And be clear that its a date so she doesnt think you just want to hang out as friends. And see what she says. Good luck!,dating_advice,d1hwnlq,2,t5_2s4kl

7106244,0,t3_4cvrib,OP I feel you.  Dating can be aggravating because there are so many strings and openended issues.  Take courage keep your head up and be on the lookout for someone deserving of your time attention and affection whether this girl or another.  Im not a dating expert but wish to offer some thoughts.With that said there are a lot of mixed signals here.  She was the one who initiated by inviting you to the group outing for SPD.  Although in a group setting the touching and flirting is a good sign and if you felt a connection did she feel one too though? that is also a positive.  The fact that you have been spending time together the fact that she stayed the night and the fact that there has been some kissing but peck on the cheek or intense makeout sessions?  these are all positives in my view.  If she is in fact Type A and is moreover a Group Coordinator then she probably is busy.  If she lacks credibility is flaky and frequently makes excuses then that is a sign that she may not be interested you but more importantly a sign to you that you should not waste your time with her.  Again you have to give her the benefit of the doubt for now but keep a mental log of times she has flaked equivocated or canceled lastminute.  The one red flag I detect is the fact that she appears to have been someone standoffish during your last rendezvous i.e. Trivia Night.  She may have been in a hurry she may not have wanted to show others who may be observing you two that she has reciprocal interest in you or she may simply not have been feeling it that night.  Its difficult to gauge but dont wrack your brain with speculation and theories.  As an aside you are both involved in these group outings and it sounds like you should both continue to participate.  If ultimately she rebuffs your advances or indicates she is not interested it is imperative that you remain cool calm and collected.  If you want to preserve the possibility of dating her dont create an awkward or uncomfortable situation.  Rather seek to gradually augment the romantic and sexual tension.  Make it fun.  Make it exciting.  Make her comfortable.  Also who knows?  You could meet someone just as great or better by continued participation in those outings contrast intentionally attempting to make her feel jealous by flirting with other girls  if this happens organically then fine but dont do this deliberately just to make her feel a certain way.  In the end she says she is busy and actually appears so.  Take her at her word for now.  Give her some time let her wonder about you contact her in about a week or so and ask her out.  When you ask her out I would do it over the phone or inperson not over text etc..  ,dating_advice,d1lv85p,1,t5_2s4kl

This is a common thought process of victims of sexual assault.Now maybe theyre close friends so she didnt feel uncomfortable and just laughed it off. But if she did feel uncomfortable and if she seriously told him to stop then he sexually assaulted her. If thats the case you both should cut contact with this person or at the very least discuss why what he did was wrong.Either way I would talk to your girlfriend about how she felt about the situation since shes the one who was potentially sexually assaulted by your friend.

7246571,0,t1_d21u0ol,The important thing to keep in mind about emotions is that it is all subjective.  There are very few absolutes in life.For example I have an atypical emotional response.  I have a really hard time caring about someone until I know them well.  That makes it really difficult for me to ask people on dates because I dont actually care about them or want to spend time with them and dont really want to date them and most people can see that and they think that Im not interested or that Im just after sex.   Then by the time I start to have feelings she is always in a relationship with someone else because she thought I wasnt interested or didnt like me enough to want to stick around.Its also why Im no fun at parties because I dont get amped up quickly and by the time I really get going most people are done so I spend most of the time at a party just thinking that all these screaming people look really dumb and are going to regret those tequila shots tomorrow morning.Different people are different but generally follow a trend.This stuff is also why women tend to win arguments with men.  The man gets really angry or excited early on and generally acts stupid and then the women starts to get angry or excited and the man is already tapering off and then by the time the womans emotions peak the man is either back to normal or is exhausted and wants a nap and then then womans emotions tend to stay heightened for a longer time.  Thats why men tend to be prone to making bad decisions or suddenly becoming violent and why women tend to be considered irrational and emotional and be more prone to stuff like stabbing their boyfriend  times or holding a grudge for a very long time.It doesnt always happen like that but it happens often enough to be significant.,dating_advice,d21vtfo,1,t5_2s4kl

If you want to live this way fine but for your own sake learn not to get attached to the guys you hook up with. If you want to find a committed boyfriend dont sleep with guys early on. Date them for a few weeks first. Most guys will view you as relationship material if you do this whereas if you sleep with them early on theyll think youre only good for sex.

Love encompasses a whole spectrum and dynamic of feelings actions and thoughts that have to have real experiences and maturity to bolster it.  The love you describe is highly sensationalized and idyllic that it ignores the other half of a relationship.  Can you honestly say youve had a huge fightdisagreementdisappointment and were able to walk away still completely in love with them all in a matter of two weeks?  Or seen each other on your very worst days when youre just pissed off at the world and still able to walk away with the other at your side?  You are only experiencing the high of a new relationship.gtCompletely in love with a woman  years older than myself and I am afraid to tell her so.Love is fearless.  The point where you just cant keep it in anymore and know you can trust your entirety in them no judgement no reservation thats a sure sign that not only do you love them but they love you back and are completely and emotionally safe and vested in one another.  Fear and trepidation are not signs of love.  Two people truly in love know it doesnt feel wrong intimidating or inappropriate to express it.Im not trying to discourage or turn away your feelings.

The problem comes in when she displays many signs of interest and then goes cold all of a sudden. Unfortunately sometimes it just boils down to a girl wanting the affirmation that shes still attractive and boys will still want her. My concern for you is that this is where youre heading the faithful standby the always available option.If shes amazing and you just want to know where things are or where they are going even though it sounds like you may not get a straight answer or that the answer is subject to change at a moments notice then ask her. Like I said Im coming out of a situation very similar and just asked her. It didnt work out great for me but I honestly feel better knowing rather than being strung along for over a year dont do that to yourself. It seems like you have the play it cool card available so depending on your personality you could force the issue while still being nonchalant Hey so no big deal but youve got me wondering whats going on here. Id back off a little which I think is part of your plan right now anyway and see if she comes around. Its not game playing if its you trying to protect yourself emotionally not wanted to get too deep with this girl only to have it blow back on at you. If she comes around great but youll probably still be wondering where you stand and would still need to have that conversation.If she doesnt reestablish communication then you definitely know where you stand and can move on easily.Sorry I was brief at the end there trying to get out of the office Ill get back to you at home.,dating_advice,d2q2jse,1,t5_2s4kl

Im in a casual thing with a guy currently and I always shower and shave right before dates even though I find the whole process tedious. Hes completely shaven there too which I never realized until thinking about it now. I think of it as a courtesy thing I guess. Like a guy keeping his mustache or beard trimmedgroomed so it doesnt sandpaper your face off when you kiss. If its something hes very adamant about but you Really dont want to do it maybe hes not the best partner for you and you not the best for him.

7846787,0,t1_d3wzmjo,Okso it sounds like this is all in your head. It sounds like she likes YOU and enjoyed interaction with YOU which means its not just about good looking musician guy with or without a car. Her intentions may not be superficial but you are assuming that they arewhich reveals a lot about the way you think TBH. Anyway wondering hypothetically about what she would or wouldnt like is just going to drive you nuts and is unproductivejust be honest about your situation and if she digs it shes even better than you think she is. Taking an Uber I know you said this was out of the question or coming up with other ways to mask your situation is silly IMO because you would only be putting off the inevitable answer to your question of is this girl down or not. Its a common mistake I think for people to worry about how to show their most desirable selves to another person to make the other person like them because what about what YOU like and what YOU need? Would you want someone in your life who thinks less of you because you dont have a car?And lookits really no judgement on her if you discover she really honestly wants a man with a car thats her prerogative. And if she is THE girl you want maybe thats motivation to figure your situation out and do whatever you have to do to secure some transportation even if it takes time. If she doesnt care greatif she does use it as motivation. Theres no serious downside to this either your crush likes you or she doesnt.

7902573,0,t1_d44a4h3,That kind of leads me to believe that he wasnt looking for anything serious even though his words said otherwise he was looking for sex. The thing that sucks about the dating game is that the same guys who say theyre looking for something serious will be the same ones who will sleep with you after two or three dates and then determine that youre not relationship materialall the while they enjoyed taking advantage of the situation by hooking up with you only to later discard you for whatever reason. I kind of wonder if this is the beginning of the slow fade for him. I have to believe that if this guy was looking for something serious and he was serious about you that he wouldnt have any problem remembering to text you. Judge him by his actions not his words. His words tell you that hes looking for something serious. His actions tell you that after Wednesday hes inconsistent with followthrough and sends short responsesneither of which indicate you hold any level of importance in his life andor that hes serious about dating you. Dont fall into the traptemptation of texting him something along the lines of You seem distant. Unfortunately texting is the perfect medium for backtracking and avoiding the truth. What someone would never lie about facetoface he would blithely type via text in a heartbeat.Women are guilty of this too lest you think Im being sexist. So in this situation he may deny hes being distant and claim hes busy. The truth is everybody is busy until they dont want to be. Furthermore its highly unlikely that every minute of every hour in the day is booked for him throughout the week. Id keep your guard up with this guy if he continues to want to date you and take this as a learning experience.,dating_advice,d44boeq,4,t5_2s4kl

8017714,0,t3_4p1amp,Long distance relationships are difficult even under ideal circumstances which these are not.From my observation the couples with the best odds of making it work are those who have already been dating for a significant amount of time and therefor have a solid foundation before they are separated for whatever reason. So they are maintaining their relationship. And it is still difficult. LDRs require absolute trust which is where the previous foundation comes in handy and an equal dedication to making it work. If one of you is even a little bit hesitant youre doomed from the start. You and he dont even that foundation. Youve just met I dont doubt how strong the connection feels right now but cmon its only been  dates. So youd be trying to begin a relationship while physically separated. I personally just would not recommend attempting this. ,dating_advice,d4h9kfo,2,t5_2s4kl
8024081,0,t3_4p48s7,Hey Im sorry about your breakup and the dating experience isnt going as well as you hoped. You may want to consider holding off meeting new girls since you were with your girlfriend for a long time and it may and probably will take longer than a month to move on. Moreover in general I dont advocate using dating as therapy since in my experience people tend to do better developing their own stuff after a breakup and dating can distract you from that. Of course I can be wrong here go with whatever works right.Before I answer your question advice on rules for texting and making phone calls remember  things. People appreciate you more when you treat them the way they want to be treated than when you treat them the way you want to be treated.. People appreciate you more when you exceed expectations.In my experience I think some guys make a mistake assuming if they meet the standard expectation such as paying the first date or text text text because all girls like to text the rest will unfold naturally.While that assumption isnt necessarily wrong it wont help you make a strong impression. The guys I pay attention to more find out what I like and try to appeal to it. They also try to exceed expectations in reasonable ways.One way you can do both is by stepping up contact. She is texting you on and off? Maybe she does not like texting I certainly dont. If thats the case you should try calling her and see how she responds or better yet ask her if she would prefer it. Maybe shes texting you on and off because you havent seen each other in person for a while. In that case you should ask her out.,dating_advice,d4hzcxs,1,t5_2s4kl

8248414,0,t3_4sdx39,Sorry youve had such bad luck lately. I think its possible its not about you and you just have to keep trying. Even the most successful people datingwise meet people they just dont click with. Based on what youve described its hard to say why exactly people werent interested. If you left things on good terms it might be worth asking them directly.However a few red flags that I notice from your description that could be under your control but may or may not be a factors sorry this isnt more of an exact science. meeting people on Tinder  not sure about Bumble but I would say that IMO Tinder is not a good place to find a longterm relationship. I know there are folks out there that have found great relationships and you said the people you saw said explicitly they were looking for something more serious but I just get the sense that folks dont really take Tinder or the people they meet that seriously. Also their standards are lower in general because its mainly for hookups and the ego boost of people swiping right for you so folks arent as carefulthoughtful about who they meet up with. I might suggest trying OkC and building up a profile that is pretty robust unique to your personality and is clear about what youre looking for. The plus is that youll get matches that are closer to what youre looking for with higher probability of compatibility but the minus is youll probably have fewer matches than if you just had a boringnondescriptive one.. getting me to talk was like pulling teeth  If thats the feedback youre getting I would definitely suggest some selfreflection about getting more comfortable in conversational and oneonone settings. This might take some practice and confidence building and more specifically trying to learnimprove on talking about and sharing yourself. . you identify as bad at making outsex  this also takes confidence and you being comfortable. if youre concerned about your physical technique it might be worth just googling it and practice through hookups or just trying to keep tips in mind while youre doing it? but if its more about getting comfortable with a person you might either move slower physically with people youre dating which I dont think would be a portal if you communicated effectively why andor figuring out what you need to feel comfortable with a person,dating_advice,d58lvre,2,t5_2s4kl
8252486,0,t3_4sf1cn,Firstly theres nothing more heartbreaking than getting together with an ex finding that it still doesnt work after a month and breaking up again. It will hurt for a bit now but itll hurt for much longer if the situation mentioned happens. Next thing that I would think about is the reason you broke up and the riskreward of the situation. Why did you break up? Will the reason you broke up come up again? Do you both get angry or emotional under pressure? Are you interested in the relationship because its what you know and its easy rather than going out and trying again with someone else? Do you want back in the relationship because of emotions or because its what you really want? Whats the plan if things go wrong again? Do you plan on working through your problems? Are you going to make an agreement with each other if you do get back together? Whats the worst situation that can happen and is it worth risking it? I would suggest you sit down with a pen and paper and write a paragraph on each of those questions and answer them rationally rather than emotionally. After that Id have a long and hard talk with her somewhere thats both public and easy to leave. I would bring a pen and paper and work it out personally but I am a physics student so maybe words will just do. Either way I hope it turns out well however you plan on tackling this.

She wanted me back an after turning her down twice i agreed the rd time.  That lasted about another    years before we broke up again.  It was a mistake to take her back.

8426006,0,t1_d5ukb9r,See its funny that you say that because I grew up in suburbs of Atlanta spent a lot of my time in  rural Georgia because thats where my family is from and I go to college at a university that while has a decent sized student body is in the middle of nowhere. And I hate to categorize people but since thats what your post is about you could say I have been around my fair share of city girls and country girls. People are people man realize that. You think its going to be like a movie or a country song. Yes country folk are just as materialistic. They may care less about nice cars fancy jewelry that sort of thing. But they are just as materialistic about stuff like boats big trucks yeti coolers. Yes believe it or not out in rural Georgia people still have iPhone s and yes they do use them. Just as frequently as anyone else. Yes they are just as worried about school. They might not be attending UCLA or Yale but they are grinding just as hard as anyone else at whatever college or technical school they are at. And if they arent you can bet your ass they are spending most of their day working somewhere instead of going to school. Heres what it sounds like to me. You dont want a country girl. You want a sweet hearted more introverted girl who probably would rather spend the day with you out in nature than going clubbing at night and gossiping with her friends someone who will enjoy your presence and just enjoy being with you not sitting on their phone. And when you think about what kind of person has those characteristics you think country girl. Well let me explain this to you. Those characteristics I just described above those are exactly what I want in a girl. To me that is my ideal partner. And yet I who am from the south dont put that to mean country girl. Because the reality of it is there are a handful of country girls that are exactly that. BUT. There is a handful of city girls that are EXACTLY the same way. You think Im wrong but I have experienced both. The reality of it is you have gone on dates with how many girls? A couple? And yet you assume that EVERYONE in your ENTIRE dating market is exactly the same? Thats foolish. You need to get out there and date more people. But what do I know? To you Im just a stranger on the Internet. But I can tell you this much. If you move out here just because you think the reason you havent been sucessful in finding a women is because there are no women around you who are your type you are going to be so disappointed. You are going to get out here realize that IndecisiveDog was right and wish you had never wasted your time. Do what you want man its your life. But Im telling you if you do you are not going to find what you are looking for. And just to end before anyone thinks Im shitting on city and country girls or women in general  I am not. I am merely saying that people are people we arent all that different. ,dating_advice,d5usj3h,1,t5_2s4kl

Then itll feel right to become something more than friends.I know you probably feel obligated to be in a relationship since your in Uni but your in the perfect environment to date and really find out what you want in someone.

You dont have to take my advice but if theres anything I can offer you basically have two things you can do from here. Just keeping moving to the next one until you find the right one.. Keep improving your dating skills.I actually recommend doing both  and seeing a combo effect really does wonders for your selfesteem. You might see an increase in the quality of suitors as well as their behavior towards you. Try waiting for them to text you after the date. Making little promises to yourself like that gives you more control and can increase your selfesteem and self respect that can actually increase a level of confidence that you will unconsciously communicate to your suitors without even knowing it. You should be able to feel that somethings changed.Best of luckEvan Magor  Honest Dating Coach  Anyone who wants an awesome dating life can schedule a FREE skype session with me calendly.comevanmagor,dating_advice,d65c5ux,2,t5_2s4kl

8540876,0,t3_4wqc5y,Basically. So texting is like a tennis match of energy. You really have to be paranoidlevel aware of how you play that game. You are setting up a communication pattern and you really need to consider a bunch of elements before just jumping in there. You need to really feel it out. You cant just dive in there just free flowing about anything and everything all the time. The texts need to be consistent concise and cohesive with a little variability. Its an art. You want her to pine just a little for the text sometimes. And dont waste time discussing stuff through text or eventually itll fall flat. The main objective should be setting up the next date. Discuss things when yall are together. You never want to be giving more than shes giving. Try to give about as much as she gives. Once you are clearly way more invested than she is it will totally shift the energy and shell want nothing to do with you anymore and she might ghost you because she doesnt want to reinforce your efforts. The relationship went from liberating and exciting to constrictive and obligating. You want it to feel like more of an adventure than a job.

Focus on what is happening and what you are enjoying instead of thinking about how comfortable you are or not.Your ex is an ex for a reason or for many reasons and not all of it was comfortable.

Poof without a trace.Some people just kind of stink. I know you probably know not to doubt yourself too much but dont doubt yourself too much. It may have been a great date and shes just very insincere or something else might of come up in her life that she doesnt want to be honest about. It could really be anything.I will saythe not texting would have been a red flag to me. Its either game playing or sincere lack of interest. Most people especially youngish people text daily if not throughout the day. After first date might be soon for that but a lot of people are more interested in talking that way and establishing that kind of comfortable repartee and making sure their interest is known. As a single girl I can pretty much guarantee you that if you werent texting daily some other guy probably was.

8828435,0,t3_512pje,Ill address your age first. Youre not too old. Im  female and single and I choose to use online dating and have done so my entire dating life. Most of my life since I was  has been spent in long term relationships though I have been unlucky hence being single again now. HOWEVER my point being that at  the age bracket of men I look to meet is  but I feel better about guys aged  and up. There are plenty of women my age and around my age who would find an early s male an ideal age.With regards to the actual dating thing some people really dont enjoy using dating appswebsites but as you get older its harder to find the single people as obviously and have the opportunity to develop some kind of rapport. I am stupidly shy talking to new people because I tend to lack confidence and never assume theyd be interested in me and therefore dont have the courage to flirt and test the waters. With dating apps I know theyre single looking to find someone and so I know where we both stand and have no problems being confident funny and flirty. However with the fact that you can meet a lot of people quite easily through dating apps comes the negative that people you are meeting are also meeting others and so for two of you to connect choose eachother and make it work is still a challenge.My recommendation if you take that path is to be upfront about what you want. Whether you just want to have some sex first and meet some new people say that. If you most definitely only want to find something more romantic and long lasting say that too. ,dating_advice,d791zjp,2,t5_2s4kl

8848943,0,t3_51eerw,This seems like a bad idea on a number of levels What if you catch feelings? You cant even start anything because a relationship based on a lie is going to end badly. Babies Rabies  a woman is in a rush. And from the rabies part of that I think its obvious that maybe theyre a little frantic. Do you really want to screw someone over by tricking them about the one thing theyre panicking about? Beyond the obvious shittiness of it do you want to piss someone like that off? That sounds like a terrible idea. Invest in a good cup and security cameras. Does it have to be that women were too picky? Maybe they as a human being just like you have a story? Maybe they wasted years with a man who lied to them about wanting kids? You left your story out aside from saying nobody wanted to date you before. I doubt it is that one dimensional. And it wont be for any woman you meet either. Pretty women are not immune from life struggles. Be careful making up for lost time. No many how many women you sleep with I suspect its all going to feel just as empty as it does now.  There are probably some women who are ok with just banging. If you sleep with someone on the first date fine. You will want to check your morals if you actively pursue someone who is waiting to have sex because it is obvious they are not looking for a fling.

8918179,0,t3_52f0gl,So sex like any part of a relationship can be improved upon so long as the communication is there. The physical attraction you feel.. isnt something you can work on either its there... or its not... or it develops because you like someone right? Generally if you grow to like someone youll grow to appreciate them physically and look past the imperfections rather than being annoyed with them because youre not fond of them.So in my opinion from the limited info youve given the REAL question here isnt should you dump him because the sex sucks but really should you dump him because youre not that into him.Do you dig him or is he just a fling? If you dont dig him the move on the work to improve someones sex game isnt going to be worth it. let him know that you had fun you enjoyed the time together but youre just not not feeling it.If hes any kind of reasonable human being hell be hurt and either internalize it or move on neither of which you can control. ,dating_advice,d7ju205,6,t5_2s4kl

9008265,0,t3_53iyzk,From personal experience me  she was . Dated for a year. Just right outside of the divide by   rule. Age difference never bothered me or her. Both in college similar parts of our lives in sense of finishing our BAme vet finishing school. Things were good for the most part had our ups and downs travelled a abit. Nothing too strange  really outside of the normal for a relationship except the age. Long story short ended abruptly because she suddenly got in her mind that she needed to live her s and didnt want to be tied down. Looking back I cant blame her too much I lived my s and had a great time. We just turned into two people at different parts of our lives wanting different things. I didnt want the marriage or kids things until we were ready if it got that far or force that idea on her. She just decided at this point she doesnt want it ever. Would she grow out it? Idk maybe but thats for her to decide. I know not every persons the same but proceed with caution. But dont let it stop you from having a great time. Despite how ended between me and my ex not bad just ended I dont regret it and look back and smile at the good times I had with her. ,dating_advice,d7unhvd,1,t5_2s4kl

9525643,0,t1_d9n6doy,gt Never feel the need to lie about your relationship status or past experience. You can always say youve been focused on your career or education and didnt have the time to date in the past. Its a perfectly acceptable answer. I know girls that didnt date until their late s because they were so career driven. Its only an issue or roadblock if you let it get into your head.I dont know the OPs situation but Im also a late starter to dating and giving I was focused on education as a reason would be a lie. Its also not going to even be a believable lie if your education didnt parlay into a decent career. While I was focused on school to a fault the main reason I did date in my youth until my early s was I was religious believed pursuing casual relationships strictly for sex was immoral and wasnt interested in jumping into long term marriage. I might only be able to claim the school excuse for a couple years beyond that at most. Through my whole life and especially later on I dealt with generalized anxiety disorder and for a few years I was largely out of commission with major depression not quite bad enough to require inpatient treatment but enough to where I coudlnt work for a period of time and to where I needed pretty intense medication to snap out of it. Im age  and finally have some momentum going in my social and professional life but Im in the positionpaygrade I should have been in at more like age .  The main reason I Was not in the dating field due to personal hangups and medical reasons and those arent issues I will willing talk about in person let alone to someone Im recently dating. That said I had to deal with the how do I explain lack of experience  what the hell Ive been doing issue to a lesser degree when I interviewed to get my first job in my field years after dropping out of school. Any time I tried to spin it in my resume or during interviews I ended up on the defensive and the interviews got derailed. I had the best success by simply leaving an  month gap on my resume including no present job and saying had to leave school unexpectedly for personal reasons ended up working in unrelated jobs with no further clarification. I was usually not asked follow up questions and those interviews generally went fine. gt When it comes to long term relationships you dont know if its going to be long term starting out. Go for that kiss. Go for that sex. Because your relationship has to start somewhere. Casual dating leads to long term relationships when you find the right one! By being so respectful youre actually putting pussy on a pedestal and youre not going to communicate well what youre really looking for. I recommend reading the book No More Mr Nice Guy that covers this really well. Its about getting your needs met in a nondouchey way.Being interseted in pursuing long term relationships doesnt mean you expect any relationship you enter to be long term either party is free to end dating or a relationship at any time nor does it mean youre putting a clock on when to escalate physically. It means youre not interested pursuing relationships that cannot possibly be anything other than short term. For example a one night stand or a fling with a defined end date while youre on travel. Of course to get experience it may be necessary pursue short term relationships but thats a bit of a different issue than what youre getting at here. ,dating_advice,d9n8jhx,3,t5_2s4kl
9537245,0,t1_d9onhvq,I had something similar happen to me recently with a girl I really liked so I understand. We dated  months and she was SUPER into me then suddenly not ready for a relationshipnot ready to date. She also had some similar excuses for not wanting to date anymore. Like I said probably not interested anymore but you can always make an attempt to see just to cover your bases. But yeah you may have been a bit too accommodating to her. I know I was in my similar situation. Youll pretty much know for sure if you ask about her trip and then pop the question of dating again. If she makes up an excuse its almost guaranteed she just isnt interested.

The point of these are to build your social web not necessarily to find men to date. Everybody these days looks at tinderPOF etc. as saviors to singeldom. Which is sad and represents the current state of society...instant gratification. gtHaving several relatives that have been single their entire life...Im deathly afraid of never finding love or getting married.This is probably a big sticking point for you. You go into mini panicmode when it enters your mind. This is something that really shouldnt affect you. Why? Because you would probably have no problem finding a great guy. Its just timing and luck. gtNow Im working fulltime and find it harder than everA lot of us work fulltime and manage to maintain relationships. I dont think work is the problem per se.I think you need to figure out what works for you. Some people dont do well online. Some people are much more natural in person. Dont just use tinder and other dating sites just because you can. Its not meant for everybody. Do you have any hobbies or interests that you can share with somebody? This would be a good place to start.gtWhat is your first reaction when hearing this?You dont sound like the most fun person in the world. I think you have some insecurities youre still dealing with yet youre trying to apply it to online dating. Online dating is not always the answer.

Buy them a six pack of beer or whatever. Dating sites are like job interviews. First impressions go a long long way. Ideally you want your main picture to be one of your full face smiling in natural light and far enough away that you can actually see your face and dont have that close up distortion that you get from a selfie. Preferably with a nice shirt on not a Tshirt.There should be at least one other picture preferably showing your full body. Obviously it would be great to dress smart for this.If you dont have pictures like this make it your mission to get them. You havent done everything you can regarding your profile. Youve done everything you can without actually making an effort. I think that would be a good first step. Of course we have no idea if you are struggling to match with people because of your physical appearance. It could have something to do with your profile as well.I know a lot of people feel like putting effort into taking dating site pictures is somehow disingenuous. I totally disagree though. Again anytime you want to make a good first impression on someone you should make an effort.I have a single female friend review what you have written in your profile. Or other people who have been successful dating.There are a lot of things you can do to improve this situation. Good luck!,dating_advice,da9gq0e,1,t5_2s4kl

9758100,0,t1_daex4id,Hello and thank you for such a thorough reply. Will definitely take those into consideration.  is almost a must bc it is something that is universally trusted and like one of the features that you dont like used to link mutual friends. Would blocking your facebook friends in settings be an optionsolution? And will hopefully have a couple of verifications that would solve  bc facebook info can be faked as well. Thinking either  party verification or in app photo verification. Understand your concerns with creep factor and first version will have tinder format so once you delete conversation will be no way for him to search or see your profile in future. Also will be able most likely to hide when you are online in settings but will leave a date stamp in your conversations that you were on within  hrs to allow users to have idea of active profiles. First version will be most viable product simplest version to test market so the video may not be possible as it is something I have been pushing for as well.

I was indifferent I would prefer a legit relationship but Im also  horny  year old. It then hit me that maybe my friend was into me maybe thats why she was trying to get me to break it off with my fling. I was excited at first I originally liked my friend A LOT but I thought I wouldnt have a chance with her so I gave up on her. The news felt too good to be true but stupid me broke it off with my GF of like  days. Now my friend is on and off with me she shows interest sometimes and is a total ass at other times.

9918641,0,t3_5hi9dt,Please dont ask for her number at the front desk. That isnt classy and can come off as really creepy. While having a wingman can be helpful if she really is the one then you shouldnt need someone elses assistance to set you up with her. Wingmen are best when trying to take a girl home from the bar or a party not much else.I would suggest you slow it down. You dont know this girl youre just severely attracted to her. Dont get caught up in that or you wont be able to act in your torpor.You need to get past the anxiety of talking to her and make the move yourself. Best way to do it is thinking of scenarios where you break the ice. Now the gym might seem a tough place to do it but here are some possible ways to go warm up to talking to her. Begin by practicing those scenarios in your mind. Establish different avenues for you to initiate a conversation. A simple hello might do it. Ask her how her work out is going. Ask her if she has any New Years resolutions planned for next year. Make a witty comment about the gym or a gym goer. The trick is to get past the anxiety of uttering a single word to her. A good way to get comfortable with that is start talking to other people during your workout. Some people go to the gym as a social activity actually so by making a habit of being friendly in that setting you might turn into a gregarious enough fellow to talk to her.Good luck.,dating_advice,db0fa18,2,t5_2s4kl
9926567,0,t3_5hnb39,I would suggest not being pushy or needy. Give her some space. You can stay in contact but dont come off desperate. If you feel it appropriate apologize for the last date.

Sorry to come off harsh but its the truth.As someone who once had the anxiety being single I will add that you should conquer that and become comfortable with being alone. Otherwise you may end up coming off as too needy and drive off romance. Best way to do that? Be more social! Go to more grad student oriented functions. Attend talkspanels and gatherings. Be invested in your field. If youre a drinker hit up some local bars. Focus on you basically. The girls will come on their own. If you find it useful some schools offer counselingsupport groups specifically for grad students.

9948805,0,t3_5i036y,Im a woman. And I told you last time thats whats most important is for you to figure out which one you like the most and ask her out. I understand why youre so focused on trying to figure out which one you think likes you the most as that would be the one you have the best shot with. And like I said you probably will only get one shot. Meaning if you ask one out and she says no if the other girls find out theyll probably be less likely to want to go out with you even if either of them did like you because then it will seem like youre just trying to date all the girls you work with and theyll think youre their nd choice. But the point is that theres really no way to be sure until you just ask. So again my face is to just pick the one you like the most and go for it.  Of course Ill admit that this was before I saw the edit you added about the girl who said I love you.

10071488,0,t3_5jz1jh,So as someone who also gets anxious about dating and is a big overthinker especially the need to know what youre doing ahead of time  I get it. Theres a fine line to walk here though. Its normal to want our partners to do things that express their affectioncare for us. BUT  wanting constant reassurance can become an unhealthy coping mechanism for anxiety. You dont want to put the person youre dating in the position of essentially enabling these bad habits because its not going to help you deal with the core issues of your anxiety.What you need to allow yourself to do is let go a bit. And this goes for dealing with anxiety across the board. Realize that at a point you need to have some trust in this guy. Realize that this guy could give you all the reassurances in the world and it still might not work out. Realize that some things are completely out of your control and doing everything you can to figure it out only goes so far.Dating will always put you in a position of vulnerability. We take risks when we date people  we risk the chance of getting hurt but we have to allow a bit of trust that theyll care. So instead of asking this guy to enable your coping mechanisms you need to manage these anxious moments yourself. And Im not saying you cant discuss these things with him or look to him for support  but you need to make sure hes not playing therapist. You should look into reading about practicing mindfulness and how to live in the present moment. Living in the present is an important thing for people like us that deal with anxiety because anxiety only exists in the future and the past. There is a concept in Buddhism called bodhichitta. Chitta  mindheartattitude Bodhi  awakecompletely open. It can be described as our ability to be open and vulnerable to suffering and tenderness. Love and uncertainty. Compassion and heartbreak.To strengthen bodhichitta we must allow ourselves to rest in the inbetween state  the anxiety of not knowing of having no solid truth to cling to the process of starting to move closer to what we fear while remaining open and vulnerable no matter the circumstances.We gradually discover that we are big enough to hold something that is neither lie nor truth neither pure nor impure neither bad nor good. But first we have to appreciate the richness of the groundless state and hang in there. Resting here completely  steadfastly experiencing the clarity of the present moment  is called enlightenment.,dating_advice,dbkc5mj,7,t5_2s4kl

10076586,0,t1_dbkuzhq,I have thought about calling him. Im just honestly apprehensive to the idea of it as my generation the guys Ive dated text everything. I dont like texting much either. I feel like youre never really coming across as you should or as is intended. So maybe we should try calling. Maybe its something he would prefer doing and would do more often than text. We dont have sex every time we see each other. We talk more than anything. Cuddle a lot. Goof around. The way things are when were together make me feel like things are headed in a good direction. That we want the same thing from one another. Its just the lack of communication in between visits that leaves me wondering. He does take time to text me. Sometimes for two or three consecutive days. Most of the time twice over the week and a half were apart. I initiate the rest. But its those days that I hear nothing that have me confused. Im the same way in that I know I like someone when I really want to talk to them when life keeps us apart. I think I do need to level with him about what Im feeling and ask him what he wants from our situation. He really is shy and I think he holds a lot back maybe because he thinks itll freak me out or something. But Ive watched him progressively get more comfortable with me and hes been expressing more lately. So maybe thats my cue that I need to express some things of my own.I really like him and I trust him which doesnt happen often but if Im being totally blind and he really is using me then I dont want to waste my time. The best way to find out for sure is to let him know what I want.Thank you for the solid advice. ,dating_advice,dbl00yh,1,t5_2s4kl

Did you dress up like this especially for me? You shouldnt have. This is said with a cheeky confident smirk.Start touching her immediately when you meet her. If you wait too long itll come across awkward. Touch her arm when making a point her lower back when crossing the street etc...predate something very light like eating an icecream or lunch. try to meet her a few minutes on foot from the barvenue youre going to. Walking together really helps getting rid of the awkwardness.Timed date gives you a way out amp cuts the bullshitask questions about her then shut up. Let her do the talking.Ask them to do something small that invokes trust. could you grab me a straw. could u watch my stuff for a minute If you do have a lot of information about the person be sure to mention what it was that intrigued you to meet this person and compliments certainly help to break the ice!Compliment something specific that she has control over. Like her walk or some aspect or part of her personal style like the choice of a scarf that makes her eyes pop or whatever.  Disagree with her else you end up being a yesmanno backbone.  Maintain eye contact longer than her. When breaking away do it sideways. Breathe deep  Push and pull Just when I thought you were cool I find out you cant xxx.nice meeting you back turn. Only make eye contact in a convo about  time  Initiate kino comment on her watch or bracelet. Observations her hairstyle reminds me of Halle Berrys look matching items hairshoes glasses ...

10134200,0,t3_5kzhbx,Here are my notes about a datetry to sit next to her!!when you meet her take both her hands look her in the eyes and say wow... you look nice. Did you dress up like this especially for me? You shouldnt have. This is said with a cheeky confident smirk.Start touching her immediately when you meet her. If you wait too long itll come across awkward. Touch her arm when making a point her lower back when crossing the street etc...predate something very light like eating an icecream or lunch. try to meet her a few minutes on foot from the barvenue youre going to. Walking together really helps getting rid of the awkwardness.Timed date gives you a way out amp cuts the bullshitask questions about her then shut up. Let her do the talking.Ask them to do something small that invokes trust. could you grab me a straw. could u watch my stuff for a minute If you do have a lot of information about the person be sure to mention what it was that intrigued you to meet this person and compliments certainly help to break the ice!Compliment something specific that she has control over. Like her walk or some aspect or part of her personal style like the choice of a scarf that makes her eyes pop or whatever.  Disagree with her else you end up being a yesmanno backbone.  Maintain eye contact longer than her. When breaking away do it sideways. Breathe deep  Push and pull Just when I thought you were cool I find out you cant xxx.nice meeting you back turn. Only make eye contact in a convo about  time  Initiate kino comment on her watch or bracelet. Observations her hairstyle reminds me of Halle Berrys look matching items hairshoes glasses ...

I will say this though Interest is fleeting. One of you can turn cold on the other at the drop of a hat for a number of reasons including suffocating each other and not giving one another the proper space. The daily contact is fun now but it may soon grow old. You recently had your first kiss the two of you should still be getting to know each other and maintaining separate boundaries to avoid becoming infatuated with one another. I recently watched  Days of Summer your post reminded me of this part from the movie Just because she likes the same bizzaro crap you do doesnt mean shes your soul mate.Im not quoting the movie in a judgmental sense but my advice and encouragement is to keep a level head and avoid becoming infatuated with her.

10195669,0,t3_5m02oj,I dont think that being more dominant and being kinder are necessarily mutually exclusive. It could mean that she wants you take on the role of dateplanner more often or initiate communication more frequently or if youve been dating for a while and you know her size buy her a dress and leave a note wear this for dinner tonight and make a reservation at a nice spot. To me dominance in a relationship is in many ways a logistical role moreso than an emotional one. You can be more dominant in the relationship while still being incredibly thoughtful and kind like if you notice she seems upset about something you can say you seem upset why dont you tell me whats bothering you and we can talk about it together and see if we can find a solution?. Youre taking charge by modeling direct and honest communication in a way that makes her feel supported and setting the standard for the relationship at the same time. ,dating_advice,dbzqh9l,1,t5_2s4kl

Even if she says height is an issue you have more to offer than your height right? Just go on the date and have a good time. Some people are superficial about that but if you guys have chemistry it doesnt matter. Worst thing is you go out and she says she not interested. At least you had a fun time. If you bring it up ahead of time there might not even be a date. Or she has a really good connection with you and looks past the height. ,dating_advice,dc02jfd,1,t5_2s4kl

Youre essentially asking her if youre good enough to date her which is a bad idea.  My advice  dont mention it and go out on that first date.  If your height bothers her that much then she wont agree to a second date.  Its true that many women prefer taller guys but its also true that women will overlook that if theres a connection.

I have no idea if you are male or female but it is a strong indicator that the man is not setting clear boundaries out of laziness cant communicate them properly or simply lets the woman make all of the decisions in the relationship women tend to be more passive aggressive. If any of these behaviors are present in a relationship once you two get back together again you will end up with the same problems. The man needs to deal with his accountability issues head on either through therapy or selfrealization in order for things to change. Otherwise things will always be as they have always been.

Now I think about it maybe its not about the approaches where we are hanging out what we are wearing how we talk to people etc. I think youve hit the nail on the head. Im probably giving the vibe that says please leave me alone. Sometimes when guys talk to me at bars I just ignore them and walk straight past or when they say youre cute I say I know. Then again most these men are creepy and I dont want talk to them. I dont have a trusting nature so when people talk to me I question their motives. But then again I get asked for directions on the streets a lot maybe I do look approachable enough. Family and friends set me up a lot. And I think Im very choosy. Also growing up being cute as a girl you get too much unwanted attention from boys. Maybe thats how i develop my resting bitch face and try to be left alone. You said you dont tend to keep relationships. Why? I have the same problem. I pull out. I call quits easily. I find long distance relationship too much work. Looking back Ive not dated a single jerk. They were all fine. Sometimes its compatibility. Sometimes its timing. But I must be doing something wrong. Like you said whats going on in my head shows on my face.

A relationship does not automatically make your life better and if thats what youre banking on its short sighted and reckless. We all want a companion we love and trust I completely understand that. But it shouldnt be driving you to suicide. You could easily alter your dating habits and see immediate change. If you take steps to put yourself in better social situations with people that you might be compatible with its just a matter of time. gtwhen I dont do anything no girls approaches me. Thats most of us. It takes mutual effort. So if you are the only one putting in effort its just means theres a lack of chemistry.

10379708,0,t1_dcki9ga,Gotchaaa. Well flirting cant be too bad. I mean if he is picking up what youre layin down and that just confuses him further than maybe not. Guys are oblivious as fuck anyway so good luck with that though haha.But seriously flirting is nice who doesnt like being complimented right? but maybe all he needs is a friend or someone close that he can pour his thoughts and feelings into. And that alone is going to help your case if you can fill those shoes. If i can be comfortable around a girl and she is someone i can trust that means the world to me. He will value that kind of friendship as well since he is going through some difficult things. Everyone needs to vent once in a while.Be there for him flirt show him you care about how he feels make him feel loved and important and if he actually likes girls then i think you have a really good shot with him. TLDR Flirting helps but gaining his trust means the world.,dating_advice,dcklr6s,1,t5_2s4kl

Youre used to being ignored or not being a priority. The men you date most likely are all also avoidant to different levels. As you age  the dating pool becomes dominated with more avoidant men than anyone else because they have more short term relationships. Secure men settle down earlier. I recommend the book Attached by Adam Levine. Secure guys often seem boring at first. As insane as it sounds that can be a good thing. It means your attachment system isnt getting activated which you think is butterfliesattraction etc. Theres free tests online to discover your own style. Oftentimes an avoidant man is paired with an anxious woman which creates a perpetual pursue the woman distance the man cycle. ,dating_advice,dcmr0ob,3,t5_2s4kl

That said everyone online is trying to improve their odds I certainly used my most flattering photos.

It will be hard to find anyone worth your time on tinder. gtIm tall but Im also pretty slim.Okay this is great then you need to get bigger.gtI do work out and Im in good shape but the way my body is Ive always been naturally skinny so even with lifting I dont get that much bigger. Because you dont diet properly. You probably have no idea about macronutrients andor the importance of being on a caloric surplus. I hear this all the time I eat and eat I dont get bigger ! My genes I guess. Ah no youre not an alien humans are relatively the same. A caloric surplus means you eat huge day in and day out and you track your food. My parents would tell me I never stopped eating ! This is true I was a skinny guy and would eat but I would eat small portion meals continuously. I figured out that the foods I was eating wasnt enough and were very low in fat. I educated myself about macronutrients meal plans the importance of fats and bam! Started adding muscle and putting on weight. gtI dont feel self conscious about that though.Thats great. Its also important to be the best of who you are. If you dont like the look as in a nice athletic body thats fine. Dont expect to be eyegrabbing though. A guy with a nice lean athletic body will grab the attention from women a lot easier than a slim and slender man. Im not saying the slim guy doesnt have a chance Im saying having a nice build only increases your chances greatly and will ultimately have women staring at you in various places. We look at what attracts  interests us and a nice athletic body is something that attracts women. You will also have a boost of confidence and your perception of yourself will increase.gtPersonality wise Im bad at being indifferent.This is something you really need to work on. You need to be indifferent you need to change your attitude with women and eventually be more about you. You dont need to be a selfish jerk who doesnt do anything unless for himself but you should never be a pushover nor someone who simply agrees with women. Its okay to disagree with people and put forth your own selfbeliefs.

When a man texts a lot and is always in your business it gets old and you lose interest. At least this way you have a man that isnt needy or desperate.Are you his first GF? Usually when guys want to get exclusive that fast it means theyre desperate. Maybe he thought asking you to be his GF was part of the early courtship process he wanted to be a gentleman?I dont think asking him what he thinks is a bad thing. If hes mature and emotionally healthy he shouldnt have a problem talking about whats on his mind. If he doesnt want to talk about it maybe he has something to say that you wont like. If he cant communicate openly at least once in a while its going to be a tough road ahead.Generally men arent as annoyed or turned off by neediness a woman has to be really needy for most guys to end a relationship over it.,dating_advice,dd4v1us,-1,t5_2s4kl

As people age their world grows significantly. That poem might mean less if youve studied literature or that cover of a song you sang to a band theyve seen in person might have less meaning. When your out of the phase of just dating for fun you are looking at the long game. Putting all of yourself into developing relationships probably spreads you thin from developing yourself.  What do you bring to the table of a long term relationship? Do you have a career hobbies interests if your own? In other words do you have your act together?I just got home from the gym and my wife is not the type of person that wants me to sing to her. I brought her tea the way I know she likes it. They screwed up the order and its totally not what she drinks. But she smiles says she loves me and asks me to finish it. The act of wanting and trying to take care of her is what makes her happy.

10708300,0,t1_ddk6afj,Im literally in the same situation as OP and have a few questions.What do you mean with reevaluate what you have to offer vs what you want? It sounds like your saying OP is dating Out of his league and should set lower standards so he can settle for someone who he likes for the wrong reasons. Thats terrible advice if you mean it in that way.You dont choose who you like and fall in love with in my experience. It just happens. And dating someone who you deeply dont feel anything for is unfair for both parties.Out of your league dating isnt a thing anyway. Hell there was a post today on this sub where someone asked why his beautiful girlfriend was dating his ugly face. probably because she was thinking the same but the other way around. So if we cant change who we like and should only date those people should we change ourselves? That sounds even worse. I want someone to like me for who I am not for someone who I am pretending to be. Yes I should try to become more funny and improve on social skills and on all that kind of stuff but that does not change my personality in the end.Also should OP and I change anything about ourselves? OP sounds like hes doing great and I would absolutely drink a beer with him. And as for my situation I have no issues getting into new social groups and become good friends with everybody. Now the next section is going to sound very... arrogant but I dont mean it in that way Im always nice and positive to people. I always get praised for who I am by the people around me. I work out to try and get the best physique I can. Yes Im far from perfect. I get way to enthusiastic and interested when dating new people which is fine when becoming friends but is overwhelming when your dating someone. I can try to act less interested and be more cool about things but that would involve putting up an act. Yes Im only  and nothing is going to change that.People always tell that you should love yourself first before you can love someone else. Well its sounds narcissistic but I do love myself and am aware of my shortcomings. I also dont want a relationship for the wrong reasons. I dont want a relationship because I want someone to take care of me or because I want to be loved. I dont want a relationship because I only want to take I want a relationship because if I love somebody I want to give them the world and the best partner they can possibly have.I always feel people are afraid to become close to me on an intimate level and I dont know why. I tried asking but never seem to get a honest answer.  So how can I change what is wrong when I dont know what is wrong in the first place?TLDR I can rant on your solution for quite a bit longer but what Im trying to say is that OP  and me too is already trying to be the best person he can be. He should not change that in any way. He also shouldnt lower his standards and settle for someone he doesnt like.EDIT Added some lines,dating_advice,ddkhbrj,1,t5_2s4kl

Start up a conversation discussing how you two are feeling about your relationship to establish that this is about you two feel about each other and its not an accusation.

You said you have classes with her but you cant sit next to her because of assigned seating. You said you sit near her at lunch but she prioritizes her friends over you. The amount of daily interactions whether over text or in person is a little overwhelming especially if youve not gone on a date with her.

10734952,0,t3_5tkn3r,gtNext day she says I was really nervous and tense and she didnt feel the chemistry we had on text in real life.The only red flag I sense is that she doesnt sound willing to give it another try. Usually a girl knows when the guy is nervous and its not THAT big of a deal. Having said that I think its worth being honest and saying you were nervous. But I dont think you need some herculean effort to show her you are indeed a cool guy. I think chemistry helps alleviate nerves...so if the chemistry is good you may not even notice that you guys are having a great conversation. This may be what shes concerned about.But this isnt your fault per se...you lack experience so of course this is how it will go sometimes. Thats why we fail...in order to succeed later.gtI failed on the biggest stage of my life.No need to make this dramatic. You didnt necessarily fail because thats what people go on dates for. Text chemistry doesnt always connect to reallife chemistry ask the people on Catfished...So basically its ok. It happens.All you can do is be honest with her and tell her its a work in progress with you. And the right girl will have no issues with that. If you mention it and the girl rolls her eyes...thats not who you want to be with. Its important to date smart but it takes reps and experience. Youll be fine.gtIs it worth asking her to meet again? Not as a date but just for coffee. So that we could talk about things one last time.Yeah why not. If she really didnt feel anything then she just wont meet up with you and make excuses. But if she meets maybe shes still got hope. Either way you just need to relax. If you go in nervous again youll get the same results. Be honest with her. Talk about not being experienced in dating. Shell find out eventually so might as well be open about it then make it a thing that you guys can share.

When you have experience with positive and loving relationships that pass the initial infatuation stage you approach future relationships in a different way than those who are new to relationships.

I hate when a dude asks me out then I have to research where we should go. If you dont know the area then use TripAdvisor for some ideas movies are a bad first date. Also the films you suggested are a bit meh. Is Lion playing near you? Thats an excellent film. But really a drink or dinner is better you cant talk during a movie. you did come over as a bit needy by sending so many textsI think you can save it though! If you text her on Thursday as others have said with something like Hey how has your week been? Do you want to grab dinner tomorrow night? Theres a place near you called somewhere rated highly on trip advisor that has good reviews and a menu with a range of stuff for different tastes that Id like to try would you care to join me?.

10806414,0,t1_ddqe9ye,Youre welcome. gtI honestly do see the similarities!! Its true. Ive read The Game by Neil Strauss its a book about the world of pickup artists PUA. I got it at the library of all places a few years ago. Reading this book by no means makes me an expert on the PUA community but Im at least aware of some of the tactics. I think pickup artistry is primarily about two thingsincreasing a mans confidence to approach a woman and seducing a woman. I think defenders of the PUA community are going to tell you its more about confidence than it is about seduction. I suppose its a personbyperson basis it totally depends on how a guy uses the information he learns. And for the record not every guy is into seductionpickup artistry. If a guy wants to increase his confidence to be more comfortable with approaching women I have no problem with that. But Im not ok with the deceptive approaches used to seduce someone. Thats why I think its important to be aware of all the approaches that can be used that will lead to a hookupone night stand all the while leaving a woman clueless into thinking the guy wanted something serious. Im not saying this guy you met off of Bumble was a pickup artist based on the situation that happened to you Id just be willing to bet this wasnt his first time doing this so it seemed so effortless on his part and didnt raise any red flags for you at first. gtAnd honestly youve given me so much inspiration to stick to my guns but alcohol really impairs judgment. So next time Ill just drink one beer max! I encourage you to make your own rules so if thats the onedrink max then cool. But maybe if you have more than one drink then you dont go back to his place. I dont know how badly one drink impairs your judgment. And just because you end up at his place doesnt mean you should feel obligated that something needs to happen. If you go over to his placewhether on the first date or after months of datingyou dont have to do anything you dont want to do. I feel thats worth pointing out or worth the clarification in case you think you have to sleep with a guy simply because you went over to his place and now hes expecting that as if its an unwritten rule because youre there. Just in general you shouldnt be concerned about sacrificingcompromising your comfort level or personal standards in order to align with a guys perceived expectations.,dating_advice,ddult6y,1,t5_2s4kl

We cant help you change his mind we cant help him magically decide to be a hard worker when he wasnt before.The game is nearly checkmate at this point the door out of grinding poverty is almost closed. But just in case you still want to be optimistic let me put it in perspective. You will be taking care of two children now instead of just one.  One an infant and one a manchild. Your boyfriend isnt going to change any time soon his immaturity is going to get worse in response to having a kid long before it gets any better. Eventually youll be forced to kick him out. He cant even handle something pedestrian like getting a GED. The stress of childcare will crush him and he will GTFO or you will. This is the harsh reality.  Be honest you are with him because he is childish and appealed to your motheringnurturing instincts. You felt a need to rescue him as if he was a stray kitten or something. Well that party is over and the cold hard facts are creeping in.You do have one option left to avoid checkmate  years of hell and a child that is fucked up emotionally due to an absent mother and emotionally absent father because youll be too busy working to avoid being homeless.Put the child up for adoption. You fucked up by not using birth control. You fucked up by not using condoms knowing that you werent on birth control and knowing that neither you nor your boyfriend were ready to support a child. You fucked up by deciding to keep the child knowing that neither you nor your boyfriend were in a position to support it.

Bringing a friend to approve sounds immature and a bit stuck up but the undertone behind her suggestion seems to be she wants to feel safe and has had bad past experiences.As a female I fully understand as I have had horrible experiences with people in the past and while I havent brought friends to the date Ive asked them to be in town or nearby at the time of the date. Its a sad reality but women increasingly feel the need to take a lot of steps to protect themselves. Be nice to her friend and include her but focus your attention on the girl you like. Chances are once her friend has her security that you are who you say you are your friend will give her the signal to leave.

It allows you to think about it and realize that theres no reason for whatever it is youre jealous about.  Once you start letting show and affecting your relationship thats harder to work on and fix.  I guess my advice is whenever you have these unreasonably jealous thoughts just stop for a second and tell yourself that you have no reason to be jealous and that your guy is with you because he wants to be with you.  ,dating_advice,dfb372t,2,t5_2s4kl

As for becoming more social my advice is dont worry about it. I was forced into a MySpace account my senior year of high school because people wanted to stay in touch but never used it I didnt keep in touch with any friends after high school and I was just a huge introverted wallflower throughout college.In the reverse of your situation I actually got sick and gained  pounds at  and was tipping the scales at  pounds Im only  so I can sympathize by your negative self talk of not seeing the point. I actually still have days when I think like that and Im  now and Ive lost all of the extra weight. Strangely it wasnt until I got settled into a job that I loved that I began to at least say hello to someone and not feel like I was having a panic attack. It helped that I was surrounded by many people even nerdier than I so I felt quite at home. These days I accept that Im severely awkward. I have many footinmouth moment and Im a total dork but people love me as I am even if theyre the same sex and just best friends. I think one of the biggest pieces to gaining acceptance of myself was actually through meeting my best friends. I met all three of them online  one of them I still havent met in person  and even though theyre all women as well knowing that I at least have people who are so much like me out there let me have some confidence that while everyone out there might not get me or my awkwardness some do and meeting them is AWESOME. Also I dont know how youre feeling on the dating front but know from someone who has been there the most important thing is really making sure youre the person you want to be before adding someone to that situation. When you meet someone who you really click with you want to make sure you click with them as a person you love and not as a person who you think is flawed. I didnt have a first kiss until I was  and my exs response? He was surprised and wanted to get to know me better because he never expected that.

I just like to keep it casual so that it doesnt seem like we are dating right off. However I do know guys that would think hanging out would mean booty call. Just depends on what kind of guy he is. ,dating_advice,dgqk36h,2,t5_2s4kl

11741850,0,t1_dgqy4ec,That was actually quite helpful.I like this girl a LOT. The problem is that it hurt me a lot when she would not respond to my texts or when she would be vague in her communications only to blow me off to be with her friends. So for me I didnt want to continue to invest more in a relationship in which she was hurting me. The problem is that I genuinely dont think she understands why and how it hurts me.If I were to send a text how do you think I should phrase it? I was thinking something along the lines of If that was your way of implying that you wanted to talk you could have just said that. If not we should continue to not communicate.,dating_advice,dgqyvo0,1,t5_2s4kl
11745401,0,t3_67jcsd,I think you should message her have coffee together if shell agree to it get the closure you need and move on.My story isnt exactly the same as yours but thats what helped me. I was in a long distance relationship and we broke up and in the back of my mind I kept her on a pedestal for a couple more years. When I was back in town one weekend I asked if we could meet up for coffee. I hadnt seen her in person since before we broke up.Things went fine but I think I hoped to see some flicker in her eyes indicating maybe things could be the way they used to. That didnt happen and I think I needed to see that for myself. We had a good conversation caught up on each others lives and parted ways amicably and Ive never seen her since and Im very very good with that.I do remember we left the coffee shop going different directions and being aware that I could turn around and see her one last time but deciding not to. My time for emotional lingering was over I had the closure I needed and it was time to look forward not backward.So I recommend you message her. Just do it for the sake of closure not getting back together.,dating_advice,dgrdd3n,2,t5_2s4kl
11750812,0,t1_dgrx5dd,I didnt put it on display. I think I told her that I hadnt been with a lot of women before but I didnt straight up tell her. The truth is being with one or two people isnt really going to suddenly make you some kind of dating or sex expert. The only thing holding most guys like me or OP back is their own shit. Its not girls not liking them or problems with their appearance. Its almost entirely an unwillingness to step out of their shell and just accept the potential rejection that honestly doesnt even sting unless youre further along in the relationship ,dating_advice,dgrzfno,3,t5_2s4kl

11768190,0,t3_67xe4u,Bumble. POF feels like a shitty s website and your advanced search settings are never saved. Everybody has an Okcupid and probably more than half the people on there dont take it seriously or only join for a confidence boost. On Bumble only the women did you just assume their gender? can message the men. Because of this I would think it would be more appealing to women.,dating_advice,dgtye4u,2,t5_2s4kl

11776105,0,t3_680hwb,Married couples need to be invited together. Usually engaged couples do as well. Many people will do a plus one for long term relationships but its not a requirement. Plus ones for everyone are not remotely required and arent offensive. Your boyfriend should go especially since its for his manager.If you dont trust him not to cheat then why are you with him? If you do trust him the people cheat at weddings thing is pretty ridiculous.,dating_advice,dguuw4j,6,t5_2s4kl
11780613,0,t3_68386q,I really hate texting for the record. But all in all it really depends on the situation. If it feels like a natural thing to do then go for it.

11780658,0,t3_681gx5,For me if theres not some obvious sexual interest after three dates it feels weird. Doesnt have to be sex itself but there should be some passionate kissing and touching cuddling etc. If theres not at that point I just feel like theres no spark,dating_advice,dgvdiv0,1,t5_2s4kl
11782306,0,t1_dgvixyf,Yes it does. Thats what we do. We take turns and I know he appreciates it. I think he just feels as a man he should pay the majority of the time. I think its his own personal preference.,dating_advice,dgvk9cx,1,t5_2s4kl
