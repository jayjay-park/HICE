7229772,0,t1_d1zxb4d,Im not a great Blitzcrank so take this with a grain of salt...but I think that if Blitzcrank is going to win this matchup he either needs to win it before level  or he needs to peel for his carry for the entire laning phase.Once Leona gets her full combo she can outcc you and the damage from her sunlight procs will make it difficult to beat her out. You also dont want to pull her as she can most likely depending on positioning Zenith Blade straight to your carry and CC them. If you can get a good pull on their ADC level  before she gets zenith blade then you can push them out of lane and start to snowball on your lead. If you get behind you need to freeze near your tower farm up and look for good grab opportunities. Youll have the tower to your advantage so even if Leona does engage it will make the fight in your favor of course Leona gets ultra tanky pretty quickly so this will only work for a short while.One item I rarely see built which could really help you in this matchup is Mikaels Crucible or getting your ADC to rush a Quicksilver Sash. If you can counter her CC she wont be able to do much to you in terms of damage.Late game Blitzcrank would need to focus on getting picks as Leona will have more teamfighting presence. However you want to make sure that if you do grab someone that youre not immediately in range of Leona unless you can burst them down immediately. If youre going against a good Leona and make that mistake they can immediately zenith blade gt Q gt Ult and start a teamfight.,ChampionMains,d1zyzbj,1,t5_39cw5
9639604,0,t3_5cywi5,To be honest your best bet is to sit around with the ban hammer ready for a few days until it dies down. You can also up the verification reqs through discord which will slow them down a ton and theres a few reddit mobile apps that give you mod capabilities so you can watch it while away from home. Outside of this theres not too much you can do.,ChampionMains,da1a2ql,1,t5_39cw5
