5090443,0,t1_cuyx4eh,For point  it is not an uncommon factor in RPGtype games for level difference to be a part of the damage formula but if you checked KyteMs data mining theres no evidence to support the idea that a servant takes more or less damage with higher level. In my personal playing of the game Ive had my LV Emiya take almost  damages from LV Lancer types due to weakness that seems a bit high. It is already proven that  is the minimum damages which meant that if there is a case where final dmg is less than or equal to  the damages become . DMG CUT buff property exists which is the closest buff to traditional subtractive defense. Of course its a buff and there are CE that have passive DEF buff property but again these are buffs and not intrinsic properties to a servant that Ive noticed. ,grandorder,cuzl9vw,1,t5_39d7x

Cooldowns are high. He offers defence but offers no healing. His NP arguably useless. He has stats going for him but his cost also that of  star. It a lot to sacrifice in your team setup only for  buffs and mediocre damage among  stars. This is why he ranks low in regards to  rarity.  I think ElMelloi is overestimated and hes one of the reasons i do not agree with other lists. He just has not enough to offer and requires a big investment.,grandorder,cwkg7cf,-2,t5_39d7x

I dont have the exact numbers in front of me but in terms of QP alone upgrading those will cost millions of QP after that point not to mention whatever ascension materials they require.

Heres some numbers ATK buff  turns.  Def  turn.Thats to herself only and thats just a Monstrous Strength B  turns.I also wrote about Jeanne in the Archer issue.

Emiya has . per hit totalling for . per hit placing him at the Archers usual average of ..Puchi gives .  of  is still .. Shes still behind. A maxed out  tookyoomi Edit Banquet not tooky. gives ..

If you have a point calm the fuck down and say it  No one is out to kill anyone on this subreddit. Perhaps you should actually understand what youre talking about before Dragging in an unrelated servant such as Jeanne Talking about numbers that are about  without accounting for overkill chain buff level of enemy to you as opposed to looking at base NP gain And finally look at static skills such as Vampirism and Withcraft EX that can do the same ON your turn as an atwill skill as opposed to spouting nonsense about using tristar because the enemy can easily use two movement steps to buff themselves up  NP and then shoot you again.Like seriously.

5633421,0,t1_cwvbflo,I guess you have missed the fact that all assassins in true term have special advantages even historically put since there are also konoichi or in other terms female ninjas. This is the simplification we have into the game. Stheno kills or charms male servants too bad not many or used less as opponents. Hassan gives you stars and can kill the useless nonservants. Carmila generates NP for damage with bonus against females and attack increase for  turns imagine if you use it again with the torture technique check servant list how many female gold are there and heals herself. Sanson is for against evil and human characters I think Flare made one not long ago about him . Mata Hari you can use his work for her again. Phantom of the opera Charms females and have AoE assassin NP. Jing Ke is build around crit stars have skill set like Lancelot only problem is her NP decreases her health with  HP since its HIM in history with failed attempt for assassination against the first Chinese emperor I think but still the NP generates stars and have chance to kill and damage of  for first level NP. Sasaki is nuff said.And cost will be always put since you cant practically make full  star team with Kaleidoscopes or whatever. And by the way   down can mean difference in thousands damage. And NP drain is last resort to save your ass for a turn from NPs not to increase your NP gauge. Even servants as Gilgamesh Arturia Alter Herc... have their special uses for straight hit into the face damage. As for Hassan everybody is free to play however they want anyway there are people who use also LeonidasSt. GeorgeHans and the rest. Does using St. George for tank makes Martha bad support rider since you compare two different assassins and what they focus on?,grandorder,cwvdnvm,1,t5_39d7x

5699442,0,t3_3t6ryj,Thats tons of Riders...    Since youre just starting just use any strongest servant you have now teambuilding is more when you have more servants and CEs to choose at.  However if you insist lets say you have all of them leveled to their current cap.  Then your strongest team including Medusa will be Tamamog  Medusa  Saber support to balances the card deck you have. For their CE slap Tamamo with Sakura  and stick Medusa with Divine Banquet or Hakuno.  Without Medusa you actually have quite a solid Arts team with Martha  Robin  Cu Caster. Having Martha is just really strong start afterall... pair her with Emiya  or Divine Banquet. Robin should stick with  Emiya for now.  Also some advice even though Extra Rin card is not that good I wouldnt advise to fusing CE except if you have  of them.   For  star CEs mostly you wouldnt even want to fuse the same name into one another because they are already powerful as is so except you have like  of them dont fuse them.,grandorder,cx3kkae,1,t5_39d7x

Oh and Im sorry I tried to appeal to your sense of goodness. Apparently you didnt have a shred of morality so I couldnt make you feel bad about mocking their translation and simply apologize.

That is not to mention his armor is alot stronger than Gils managed to block  of the thousand stakes that Vlad who got fame boosted  Command Seals throw at him.

In this case you just really want them to clear the wave with their NPand Lancelots NP does this just fine... even Kiyohime can do this. The total damage does not matter so if NP damage is irrelevant as long as they clear the wave what other aspect can we use to compare? Its their normal attacks. Lancelot outperforms both with his higher atk. Lancelot has no problems killing a gold handone of the most commonly farmed mob in  busters and a silver in  buster.

Now Im slowly starting to regret it.

6322916,0,t3_4281el,Jack is a lot more consistent than X. She is able to put out a lot more stars because of that extra Quick and while X does have an extra Arts card it is mostly useless since Jack can also charge her NP pretty fast with Quicks.Also Xs skills are terrible. The stun is nice though unreliable at early levels Instinct is useless on a servant that was supposed to create stars with their cards anyway and her last skill is so situacional it hurts.So yeah Jack is a better bet if you want consistent star generation. Maybe X can be better in a more arts focused team as a star engine but that is probably not better than simply Artchaining with guys like Waver and Vlad. She is not bad though as she is still one of the best star generators in the game but she is pretty much outclassed by Jack.,grandorder,cz8ch8k,4,t5_39d7x

6452070,0,t1_czmn63k,My thought is that its easier to work around Jeannes stun than it is to work around poor NP accumulation. Good timingRNG with your card selection makes Jeannes stun a nonissue until youre down to  or  Servants but its harder to plan around NP generation without taking CEs Master skillsSeals and overall team composition into account.Again Im not arguing that its a terrible choice for her and as you mentioned its pretty explicitly tailor made for her. Mostly Im saying that Id rather solve one issue completely and live with the other and of the two NP generation is the easiest to solve.Depending on what its maxascension bonuses are I could easily change my mind though maxascended stars are best left to theorycrafting and people with more luckcash than I.

Like to run a comparison Gudaguda left us with the excellent Nobu and the pretty damn good Gudao CE all wrapped together in a hilarious plot and a lot of smol Nobus.Christmas gave us Santa alter a pretty good Jeanne CE for servants like Jack and more hilarious plot powered by Excalibur jet sleigh and Gudakoreindeers.Saber Wars gave us Saber Lily who is cute but isnt really good nor new Bloom CE which... really doesnt do anything great outside of this event and a plot that while still fun isnt quite the level of hilariousness I expected from this.Despite all Ive said though I do enjoy the scales hearts and talons Ive acquired from all this and my smol seiba trophy.

Hans seems to live fairly well for me simply because I spam his np which gives a bunch of buffs including health per turn. Waver Medea Lily and Tam caster would be better versions of what Ive got going on if you wanted a similar set up. So Emiya shines better if on a pure arts team rather than on a critical team just due to the crit weight he has over the others. Could it work?

Play the game as its been intended to and deal with it dw doesnt present you all game content without playing. Feel free to cash if you dont play its a valid catalyst at best but not more than this.Blame yourself for missing what you have been missing not dw for the fact that you missed it by yourself and dw offers you a paid catalyst which you may or may not use to make up for the time you javent been effectively spending. You are at fault by yourself not dwBy the way your chances arent close to zero for a star at all get your probabilities doneDont like it? Well thats what mobages are all about you either effectively play the game as its been intended to or stop playing.

Personally Gils overall more useful but less teamworkey whereas the other two have more self support but are more helpful in other ways. Teslas better in a harderhitting team while Arjuna is better in arts comps.Best nonOkita saber is Mordred for me. I have an Arturia and even with her solid stats and skills sometimes she just falls a bit short. Really need to level that charisma. Mordred is also that little bit tankier with that one skill of hers.The lancers are harder to compare since they do different things I saw another thread comparing all the  star lancers and that had some very interesting opinions.

Id much rather exploit that with an Arts CE. and its not like she has trouble filling her NP to begin with that would require anything that would require an NP gain or starting NP CE. And i mean she has an Arts deck using tamamo support with the Thighs of Rin CE the s valentine one already does wonders and i can pretty easily gain NP especially in an arts team So i really dont understand what people are thinking for that.I think for jack because her atk is kind of weak to begin with a dmg supplement like IA that can also help with her primary card type is definitely a better choice. But Servants like Carmilla for example a NP stheno with that  instakill chance or maybe okita to get her np up quicker. ,grandorder,d030259,2,t5_39d7x

Of course the NPs of the Saber faces are still top but that is only after interludes except Alter who is OP as hell. As a note I followed all of Keripos own rules which is to put all skills at Level  and only their own buffs.

6769061,1,t3_48g3q9,Golden Rule is useless since his NP is useless. Charisma is great but very much a support thing. The thing is that the way the game works you want to stack multipliers on someone after saving up for  waves then blow it all on the boss. Gils NP is worthless so hes tragically complete shit at that whereas Orion can build up her much more useful NP faster. His star accumulation skill is still great and hes good at critting but one thing he lacks immensely and IMO is far more important to crit teams is a crit damage multiplier. With a good star generator and proper star weightage taken into consideration e.g. having only one high crit weight Servant so stars generally flow to their cards you can have crit teams without star accumulation skills at all. But crit damage is what really gives these teams that oomph and unless you also have Waver Gil will be hitting less hard with his crits than Orion will since she has her own crit damage buff.Charisma is basically thus good at buffing everyone else but him since hes not great relegating him to a support Servant with one support skill. Hes not that great at generating his own stars either. I have Gil and use him because hes my only  Archer but until Enuma Elish gets a huge NP upgrade hes going to be lacklustre outside of WaverGilgameshJack other Star generators like Okita and Drake do better shooting the stars on their own and dont need to give it to Gil which requires at least  specific  stars to run. Orion and the like on the other hand have a far cleaner package that suits this build NP for  waves unleash on third wave meta.Hes certainly not useless he can clear mobs well although the fact that his NP cant even clear a wave of th floor mooks in the current event is very telling since he has very good base stats. But any more than that I would definitely prefer Orion over him.Edit I just want to add that this has not changed since the start of the game till now. I got Gil when he first came out and was confused when everyone talked about how amazing he was before the crit change he was utter shit since crit stars were seldom distributed enough for you to get  on more than two cards. When Orion came out and I didnt get her I consoled myself because people were circlejerking about how bad she was. But since this unpopular opinion has gained legitimacy with this new poll I think a lot of us Gilgamesh owners and some who dont Im sure are coming out of the woodwork to show that this is an issue that really needs to be addressed. Arturia has her interlude and Prana Burst which has kept her relevant through the power creep. Gil is getting less and less relevant and DW really needs to Make Gil Great Again.Reedit Utter shit was an exaggeration he still had the best star gen at the time when everyone was considering Hassans star gen great it just never resulted in more than one or two s in general and rarely would you be able to get a full crit brave chain.,grandorder,d0jjxxo,3,t5_39d7x

Its completly opinion based if you want to roll or you dont. Ppl go all out whenever they see something they like. Be it for waifuhubando factor or power creep or balanced design.If we go full rational mode it will be simple. DW wants money. Throw in waifuhusbando and make him weakaverage Astolfo. Throw in power creeps Okita Jack Kintoki. Throw in a inbetween of earlier points Dantes Shiki. MONEY! MONEY! MONEY!DW the company running this game has to switch between those just to bait out money and creating a system which has tops and flops. Ofc being that rational is no use to us the playerbase.

7174420,0,t3_4dosrl,If my memory is correct Da Vinci lived also in France for some time during his life. Putting the fact he is also one of the most famous painters of all time if not the most. And I dont know if this event will have free event servant at least they were featured on banners of previous events. As others have suggested this might be event about counterfeit not alter but we will see in few days anyways.Now getting on subject of Jeanne Alter being in the gatcha or being free She is  star offensive ruler meaning her stats and class dont give much edge. Keep also in mind there are some people complaining about Amakusa Shirou who happens to be  star offensive ruler that his NP hits rather soft. However he can spam his NP unlike her. leading from  a servant with charisma E  attack buff for  turns at lvl  and dragon witch attack buff lvl  giving  damage for  turns meaning that the list of servants that can get the buff is short all Arthurias Mordred Elizabeth except Carmilla I think Siegfried and Kiyohime and she cant buff herself with it. The only thing that can be made is add her prana burst to self type of skill but she will need a high damage lvl NP her base is  and you get  copies during the servant event since she is ruler to compensate for her low damage NP meaning its more unlikely for her to be gatcha. Making her free servant also means DW will be able to show the middle finger much more easy when people ask for NP upgrade interlude since she is for free. Her attack animations are old of course new once can be made but still... for  star except if Jeanne none alter one gets them also unlike the newer servants. So again more likely to be free. Her attack pattern is QAABB with B type of NP while Jeanne is QAAAB with A type NP. You will more hardly get her to NP than Jeanne.So my opinion if Jalter Jeanne Alter one day is available is more likely for her to be free than gatcha but DW logic might be different on this than mine. ,grandorder,d1tnxvj,1,t5_39d7x

7259588,0,t3_4et68j,I have been using arts team for quite a while. Im also the uploader of the Nero and Vlad NP spam video. Link Nero Vlad I consider myself as a experienced art team player. I think that its worth for me to share some experience with the art team.. My understanding of Art Team To spam NP as much as fast as possible. I dont consider extreme sustainability as the most important criteria of an art team. Just most healers are accidentally have tons of art card doesnt mean art team must have low dps. Thus I would like to separate the general Art team into two different types healers team and NP team. Thus my Art team would most likely to fell into NP team criteria.. To spam NP there are really good NP gain servants. Although officially art card is the st NP gain Jack and Okita gains TONS of NP via their Quick card. Having Nero BrideJack or Okita can really make them spam NP multiple round. Also if you havent notice AQQ generates decent NP for those two thus you would want some Art card in your Quick Card team too!. These team are more likely considered Quick team but dispite the fact that there are only few servants assassins with  Quick card its also not worth it to build a pure Quick card team with like  quick card. Since the quick card damage is relatively low even if you crit you get just a little bit more than buster or less if no first red. Thus i think combining Quick and Art team is a good idea since crit does give double NP.. About ServantsI think this ranking is somehow reasonable I would like to make some minor comment. Vlad should be in same tier as Orion  Their NP has same NP gain Orion has a better Card set for an art team and can crit Vlad has Blood Drain. Helena should be at least A combining both her st and rd skill gives both one time and consistant NP gain for  turns.. Tamamo is A MUST. I would rank her S,grandorder,d23d403,5,t5_39d7x

I think that if she is playable she should only be support until the end where you can get her for free or something. I also want a free Doctor Roman servant but that wont happen.I also dont like selecting her cards.  I think the only thing that bothers me is the giggle.

7366210,0,t1_d2fgs8y,Like I said because theres no reason at all for me not to pick a counter servant if its a non caster boss because honestly without some kind of convoluted overbuffing and stalling they arent gonna be a better choice than a counter class. And while you might not have a counterclass for all classes the game provides you with supports and its not even hard to get enough variety in your supports. These servants arent being rated in a vacuum you know so you should take into account the support function which is completely free to use.They dont deserve to be higher than SAlter when their niche is of very low demandcaster bosses lol and can be covered by SAlter. SAlter can pretty much decimate all the caster bosses so far but tell me how do you plan on farming London books with Anne? You tell me that Anne can also do decent work on other bosses of other classes but a counterclass support would perform better without the need of some convoluted overbuffing and stalling. You think other AoE NP servants can  shot a wave of k books like SAlter can without doing some intense whaling or overbuffing?,grandorder,d2fhju5,1,t5_39d7x

True Archer from Strange Fake is also quite strong as he can casually swat away Gils NP spam with just his bow and actually manage to damage his armor without the need of a special attack or something unlike Saber when she was repeatedly hitting him.

7409279,0,t1_d2k31wg,I think you spent to long time with people online if you ended up thinking I was actually mad about anything. Text really doesnt show you the emotions of the sender so chances are the reader can either amplify or dampen the effect of whats being said.While I get that people can be very sensitive about things and often assume more often then not to understand the other party way better then they think they do I do that myself and its not easy to catch at times. You do have a point being that it might be a culture thing mostly since I would never consider someone I didnt know to be a horrible person for using a bit of humor at the expense of fiction to make days go by. After all this thread is currently at  points  upvoted so I think the majority understands that this is just for fun and the moral police can calm down. Or just make a filter like the no fan art filter to not show these types of posts. A quick look over at the news piece for the olympic games on worldnews the top comment is just saying he cant wait to see the just how much of a shitshow it will be. Eleven workers died during construction of Rio Olympic facilities. Things like humor even at some of the more darker reality makes it easier to cope with. In the end of the day I will continue crack jokes about fictional characters and play CaH with my friends because thats something I enjoy. Because we know that while a holocaust joke at a survior reunion is a bad idea but making a non serious joke at a friend gathering for the sake of just having a laugh or someone to smile is worth it to us. If that makes me horrible so be it I learned to stop caring  after it ruined my mental health.

Then again Scathach Shiki Assassin Arturia and Helena kinda make me feel comfortable with the decision I made of keep playing. Thankfully it seems that a miracle made my tablet get lost and now Im saving for another Tablet while I only log in in the game from my crappy Android phone that crashes whenever I enter into a battle. This is where Im wondering whether should I actually buy the Tablet for FGO or simply give up and instead buy a PS Vita a Nintendo DS os a PS mostly because the only reason I started playing FGO was because of  Tamamo... but it seems as though she doesnt love me at the very least she provee that during the Valentine Gacha...,grandorder,d3c6ebo,1,t5_39d7x

Ill try to address them point by point Passwords The website is written primarily in PHP so Im using the builtin password API which hashes and salts the stored passwords. You can look up the function passwordhash in PHP if youre curious as to what is being used. Ive also done my best to protect against attacks on the database as well SQL injection and whatnot Privacy Policy I havent written one yet I will most likely boilerplate a template and make the necessary changes but Ill make this a priority. Will make sure to be explicit on your points data storage  handling  use and will state a nosharing policy as well. Id like to run some stats on the My Team information outside of the site so Ill write a section on that too although I doubt anyone will have a problem with that. Javascript Im using it primarily to update images after form selection and to switch tabs on the home page. I agree on your point here especially regarding the login page. Removing the dependency on it is already on my todo list. As an aside I really dislike having to use JavaScript but its often a necessary evil to cut corners when you dont have a lot of time to spend on a project. Autocomplete On This was the default setting in the free template I used for the signup  login page and I left it this way to speedup my debugging process. Will be removed in the next push thanks for reminding me edit removed!Please let me know if you notice anything else that you think should be changed or is suspect!

7890250,0,t1_d42wvrg,Eh I suppose youre right.  I was only thinking in terms of surviving her NP.  I almost forgot her normal attacks are lethal. No more Cu clutch unless you can kill the hands. Which is hard. Even at NP with my team full of Kintoki CEs Frankenstein couldnt  shot the hands during yesterdays quest.  And they didnt have anywhere near k HP.  I suppose the only safe way to tank her would be the double Waver strategy.  Meanwhile surviving the Ruler hands wouldnt be hard  but youd finish the BP quest with only like  mil damage points. Unless you happened to have a good Dantes and could wipe the hands quickly which would be something of a challenge still. ,grandorder,d42xr2t,1,t5_39d7x

8056462,0,t3_4pjw5u,Welcome. Do check out the beginners guide to grasp the basics of the game if you havent already done so. The guide should answer most of the questions you might have about the game.For Servant selection the other comments here have given a lot of sound advice so you can take a look at their recommendations. Regardless of the Servants you end up choosing the general midterm goal for now is to have at least two wellleveled Servants for each class. You can check the beginners guide on how to level up your Servants.Players usually have a shortage of Servants at the beginning of the game so you should invest about  ten rolls  Saint Quartz to boost your Servant and Craft Essence repository. You should have about  quartz from the login bonuses for your first  days and the story quest rewards you have accumulated thus far. I would suggest spending this  then save up whatever you get after that. For Friend Points just go ahead and spend them.Finally once you get a hang of the game maybe about  weeks in you might want to ask yourself if you want to spend money on this game or youre fine with getting by with whatever you get for free in the game. If you intend to invest a lot of money into the game check out umingypulls advice on purchasing an new starter account.,grandorder,d4lmeug,0,t5_39d7x

8075153,0,t1_d4n9p22,Another one Id add personally is... Do not have the event revolve around the limited  star.What I mean is placing unnecessary importance on them for grinding purposessuch as here where grinding more Peaches or Pills is dependent on having specific golds and tailoring the shop entirely on what they need to ascend which while not a big deal limits what gems or piecesmonuments you get. It sort of rubs in that you didnt roll them though. Im not a big fan of making them the only thing worth getting from an event either such as in Rashoumon where miraculously rolling Shuten was probably the best case scenario walking out of it. Vary the rewards or at least allow us to max the event CEs you give usIm still salty about School of Chaldea because if the only thing worth getting in an event is based on the whims of RNG then it wont feel very rewarding to do.,grandorder,d4nq1gf,3,t5_39d7x
8076948,0,t3_4pu80s, Multilanguage support for the story literally just translation since they have the rest of the code written. They obviously have no intention of doing this though which is surprising since although they market to a Japanese audience theres a fair number of international players. This wouldnt take too long i.e. cost very much given that most of the dialogue is simple prose. Semirandomizedrandomized tiered challenge quests that are always available with the highest difficulty setting being somewhere around Ibaraki BP difficulty. Cant see it taking much work at all to implement since they already have similar code for randomizing daily quests. Add dailyweeklymonthly missions which occasionally give out quartztickets but mostly matsapplesQP. They have most of the code for this already too. Weekend cycling raid bosses with tiered rewards based on contribution like other mobages. Again they have the code for raid bosses now but this might cost a bit because they need to develop new assets i.e. designanimate the raid bosses. Hard mode for story quests with better drop rates which unlocks upon chapter completion. Would take some manpower to do. If they added some minor changes to the story line for hard mode that would be great too. Guaranteed  servant after X amount of rolls like many other mobages.Ideally Id really like CPUcontrolled PVP and a guild system with ingame chat but that would definitely cost them some paid salary to develop. Id be surprised if it wasnt profitable to develop though. The game is seriously lacking in social components for a mobile game. Its actually fairly interesting how many people are still very willing to whale for servants when DW makes it difficult for whales to show off to others.EDIT Actually the translation might be tricky to do if they didnt plan for it in their code.,grandorder,d4nxalr,15,t5_39d7x

Hed bring possible interactions with Cu Fergus and Medb at the very least but since Ulster Time in America is over he kinda missed his mark. Incidentally he could also reach memetastic levels with his crazy luck.Odysseus. He is one of the absolute most famous Greek Heroes in all existence and I dont think hes even been mentioned once in Type Moon stuff. Speaking of Ajaxs Noble Phantasm gets tossed out so often by EMIYA so why not Ajax?Roland Oliver or Charlemagne. The only one of the  Peers who became a Servant is the one who is explicitly weak and is a minor character in the Song of Roland? Weird.Noah. Ever since I saw the joke concept art in FateSchool Life I have very much wanted to see GATE OF ARKALON in action.Some more Sengoku figures like Tadakatsu Takeda Uesugi Masamune etc. Youd think that as a Japanese IP theyd be swimming in Japanese Heroic Spirits.Other than that there are plenty of Heroic Spirits Id love to see as Servants but not ones that I would see as something that Im surprised hasnt happened yet.,grandorder,d4y91oo,9,t5_39d7x

Otherwise unless you really want Scathach just save your quartz. Scathach is one of those limited servant that isnt tied to an event Also poster servant so she will almost definitely come back.

Ive seen lots of female artists on pixiv making Vlad fanart mainly by himself or with either gudako or Nero meanwhile Herc fanart is very limited and its often doodles or the occasional badass pic which sadly doesnt happen too often on pixiv. note i dont actually know if the artists are female its a guess based on their drawing style and that they mainly draw guys and guygirl couples,grandorder,d56srqb,1,t5_39d7x

A fan favorite since FSN novels and anime way back  and the undisputed budget servant for survivability. Mashu in the other hand got nd place and Robin Hood got rd place for his unintended broken NP. The question for him now is how he will be fare to other  Servants after his NP bug is fixed? Medea got th place while the youthful and budget version of the King of Heroes got th place. David got th place for his good utility in supporting the party. I cant believe that the majority of the Servants appeared here are mostly welfare Servants and Saber Alter variants. While the loli oni Berserker got th place despite her event Rashoumon raid got flaks by the playerbase. No question for Waver to got first place. He really is versatile on any party. Sakura Saber got nd place for her sheer horsepower while everyones favorite Alter and the Master of Crits Jeanne Alter got rd place. The undisputed little queen of critical star generation Jack the Stripper Ripper got th everyones favorite sensei Scathach got th and Francis Drake for her powerful arsenal got th place.Be sure to stay tuned for series of results to be posted starting August .I would like to thank everyone who participated in the survey. I know your concerns on the length of the survey but since this game will be celebrating its  year of service it is unavoidable to assess everything what they done to this game.

No. With how much people complain about the gacha and have complained about the gacha since literally Day  yeah I do think that changing SOMETHING about it finally does constitute a modest reward. It has probably literally been the  hated thing about this game even by the JP playerbase for the year the game has been out and they finally decide to respond to it on the anniversary.Just because the change is good And its not possible to view it as not a good change doesnt make it go beyond being modest the rates are still the same you just get more arrows to hit your target so to speak.,grandorder,d5vxrf8,0,t5_39d7x

8444612,0,t1_d5x3tyo,All knights from Camelot chapter you see are completely different characters.The evidence here is that this is What if Arturia is still alive and it was Bediveres fault for not complete his final task.Notables Camelot!Mordred did not recognize Mashu and thinks Mashu bluffing about shes actually good guy but turns out Camelot!Mordred is not same person we know London!Mordred.

As others have said all that would do is piss off a lot of players and add absolutely nothing to the experience.That being said theres nothing wrong with saving your Grails.

8591649,0,t1_d6fg7sh,Tested and found the stun can be removed immediately so Nightingale can work better than assumed. I was mistaken in my assumption.However I am more inclined to use David for other reasons In longer battles I avoid berserkers because they are simply too volatile. Yes she can heal Tamamo a ton but a few misplaced attacks and Nightingale becomes a liability. I just hate the berserker class in this game.Also Davids active skill matches up in timing with Tamamos where as Nightingale needs  NP charge which may be more difficult some times than others. In addition to on ok heal if needed Davids dodge has no turn limit. This just makes a very sturdy combination.And Tamamo has naturally low ATK anyway I wouldnt build a team looking for her to crit. Her crits wouldnt be that impressive. Her job seems to be use her NP against males preferably Archers. Its madness to compare to Jeanne alter who has the highest ATK in the game with a servant with a pretty low ATK stat for s. And an issue with NightengaleWaverTama is that to get Tamas Crit up and star up takes the same skill. You cant use the skill to get stars the turn before you use the skill for the crit damage up. At that point you are praying for her quick cards to come up together at a good time because Waver and Nightengale wont make the stars. Seems more logical to just drop the Crit dream with that setup. You can get around that with s I guess but Then you can just ignore the stun turn thereby not needing to cleanse it and go Double WaverTama. That would be way more productive and hard to wipe.,grandorder,d6fjofv,2,t5_39d7x

No question asked I roll for Mordred Saber with stock of around  tickets and around  quartz....But.... I suddenly GET MORDRED at my th ticket. I slap my face for real few times to ensure whether this is a dream or it is really Mordred..... YEAH ITS HER!My friends were also really shocked that Im capable of pulling a star yeah after that big of a failure in London rate up they always think that my luck is a hopeless E rank Luck.I proceed to max fou and level Mordred up to lv  during the same day i got her then max level her Prana Burst and Secret of Pedigree skills. I cannot max instinct due to lack of dragon fangs so I slayed countless wyverns in America all day. At the next day the last of st year of anniversary thats when I level her bond up to  max her instinct level and max grail ascend her to lv . It was the st time I feel so fired up about grinding mats qp and exp..... Man I was really crazy back then.... and because of that I still have quite a stock for swimsuit gacha event which is really an EX luck for me.EDIT Dont give up yet comrade!

At the final battle try to kill Tesla as quickly as you can or at least get him to half his hp. If your front row dies your back up will come in and finish the job.

However its recommended that you first focus on getting exp cards for your servants first and THEN go into the event. Itll make life easier for you. Nope. Its a timelimited event hence once the periods over. You cant replay it anymore because the company wouldve removed it for space for the next event.  KuroChole von Einzbern is the free servant youll miss out if you do not complete tre main story of the event. Her Np upgrades Ascension materials likewise. Illya von Einzbern is the limited gatcha servant which you can have a chance to get now and only now unless they rerelease her in a later date  highly unlikely For now yes. At least until you feel that you can stand your ground against midhigh level servants  without relying too much on supports.

8885400,1,t3_51yanm,Theres pretty limited information on Illya but from what Ive experienced shes a bit underwhelming. Shes a seemingly more selfish and damage focused Caster so youre already getting into sketchy territory. She has the lowest effective attack of any star falling below even Mebds ridiculously low attack stat due to innate Caster multiplier. Her NP is probably alright. I think it applies the debuffs afterward and has a Busterup probably subject to Overcharge. It may also have higher multiplier than normal in response to its demerit ala Arash but theres no way to know until the numbers come out. Her card loadout is the standard Caster loadout with  Arts cards but she has a Buster NP. She cant Buster Brave chain for this reason. Her NP damage chain also becomes suboptimal unless her seemingly RNG based the highest level third skill on Illya I have on my list is only  debuff resist lands. Depending on the degree of debuff her NP applies on her attack stat it might be better to go BANP instead of the normal NPAB for damage. Even when youre minimizing that debuff her extra still gets affected which is a little disappointing.If youre trying to cycle multiple Illya NPs in a row her debuff resist only affects the demerits of the first one so shes doesnt seem really suited to spamming NP. Her NP gain also seems a bit lower than average for Casters. Her invul does give NP gain but its a little awkward to use an invul just to get off an NP gain buff. Its why I generally dislike offensive and defensive effects on the same skill.  Her third skill is very weird but it does have synergy with any other Servants that debuff or disable themselves in some way so its a nice utility sort of thing. Guts is always nice too.Overall I dont really see a reason from a pure gameplay standpoint to use Illya over current top performing stars. Those are just my first impressions  In the end its about the numbers and theres no datamine up yet. Since you asked though I thought I may as well give my opinion.For Kuro she seems to just be better EMIYA. So a solid Servant.,grandorder,d7fweb6,0,t5_39d7x

8928157,0,t1_d7kzo1b,gtActually no the line is in his ingame matrix lol. He used it on the Moon Cell and it only stopped the RM for abit he was like wow this thing is impressive!. Meanwhile  tails Tamamo kicked the Moon Cells eight dimensional barrier once and it shattered to bits she then proceeded to destroy its core RIP Moon Cell. And  tails is around Solomon level if you read her interlude. If he cant outdo that kick he cant outdo Solomon.  Its more like Tamamo used her Polyamory Castration Kick on the Moon Cell core and told it to let Hakuno live or shell continue bitchslapping it. At least thats how I interpreted it. And like I said at the very least do the same thing as AAS. I never said outdo. Ea being equal to AAS at best. Not outperform or what have you.  gtSo explain to me how Suiten Nikkou is EX ranked AntiWorld at full power yet what it does is revive the dead. Or Nurserys Queen Glass Game is AntiWorld according to Extra material and all it does is reset battle turns.  They bent the fabric of reality. That means it went against the world just in different ways. Reviving the dead goes against the nature of the world the dead do not come back to life. Resetting battle turns can be interpreted as rewinding time or make something never happen. Again it goes against the nature of the world time can only go forward not back. Miracles that defies the world. So if you see a giant beam of destruction thats classified as AntiWorld the first thing you should think of is Holy shit he can destroy the world!!!!. Not It can only destroy Reality Marbles that are only a persons inner world. Besides Ea is the sword Drill that separated the Earth and Heavens. It should have some kind of mad destructive power at least.  gtAnd in that very same line it said the output is about Excalibur level. You shouldnt read into things too literal. Authors hype things by describing it with flavorful words  And at the same time it states that Excalibur cannot stop it when fired... Which is contradicting... Sometimes I wonder if Nasu knows his own lore.,grandorder,d7l172h,1,t5_39d7x

I wonder what two Artorias would think about each other? Would they know who EMIYA is? I honestly dont know if theyre gonna fight each other or not.Anyway assuming that this would follow something similar to FSN heres how I think things will goSince EMIYAs the only guy I think Stheno will try to take him out early on. If Stheno can charm EMIYA successfully she could win but if EMIYAs master is as competent as Rin I think she wont let Stheno get the drop on him. If thats the case I think EMIYA would win especially if it devolves into an all out fight.Martha being the only truly Good servant in this HGW will probably stay neutral unless provoked. Its also entirely likely that Martha will ally with Nursery Rhymes since shes another one who likes to do her own thing.Tamamo Cat is also another wildcard shell probably stay neutral until provoked. Thats when shell probably proceed to take on as many servants as she could.In the end I think Saber Alter and Lancer Alter will be the ones left standing considering theyre fire power are miles above the rest.

I kept changing Supports bc there was barely any fitting ones but I got lucky and killed both Scathach and Cu at the same time with a Gawain support that has Kaleidoscope tyvm that one friend as well as Atlas Mystic CodeHad Lily Deon and Arturia run main then Nightingale Mashu and Gawain at the back. Damage boost on both Lily and Deon New Years fish scoop CE on Arturia and I think Kaleidoscope on Nightingale and finally a pierce CE on Mashu just for some damage cushion. Had the three Sabers gain NP charge from the first two waves and finally when vs Sca and Cu I cleansed NP seal from Deon using their skill and also mystic code to cleanse NP seal from Lily. Released them at the same time to help Lily release equal damage on both of them before they get to dodge. Then focused on tanking two NPs with Deon since their Taunt lasts for three turns. Used Invincible from the Mystic Code so that they last for a while The rest is history just used NPs whenever possible afterwards and kept pushing them orz. ,grandorder,d887ure,1,t5_39d7x

Its meant to tank single shots rather than be something to be a primary defense.However I could see the team working. Youll be fighting Sabers with the team no doubt and Sabers charge their NP every  turns. That means that with  Harp of Healing which has the cooldown of  youll be able to block every single NP by putting them on rotation barring if the Saber autocharges NP and not accounting for what happens if one of your harpists dies. If you want to try it on Heracles it might be practical with a lower cooldown but only if you have a way to survive his nonNP turns. Harp of Healing is best for dodging one turn of AoE its kind of impractical to use it as your central survival tactic since even with  of them at max level therell be a lot of turns where youre in danger.,grandorder,d88cujk,2,t5_39d7x

9262481,0,t1_d8q1j9q,You completely missed the point. No one is saying that welfare shouldnt be good. Of course they should be but they shouldnt also make you feel like shit for rolling a gold servant from the gacha because welfares are better than servants you paid for...With the exception of lilyand even then shes still better than Siegfried... RIP my NP Siegfried who spookd me hardcore during Okita gacha pretty much every welfare servant is already in a good spot so why are people asking for buffs for these welfares?I dont even hate welfares. I have all of them max ascended NPd and max foudexcept kuro and nobu havent max foud them yet because Im loaded with gold archers. Santa Alter is one of my most used servants before I had Raikou and Drake Lily used to be my best saber Liz Caster is still my most used casterI have NR Helena summer Marie Assassin Shiki is still my best assassin and shes the one I use for rider heavy stages. I simply do not agree that welfares should be getting any more buffs because they are already good to begin with and even if the case that they are slightly weaker than a gacha alternative it should be fine because it makes sense that a paid servant should be better than a welfare. If anyone needs SQs and interlewds it should be gacha servants that have been powercreeped or weak to begin with.,grandorder,d8q33qj,0,t5_39d7x

Ever since weve moved from the Hassan part weve never had a clear cut guideline for the class honestly. At least with Archer class were still focusing on the projectile part as much as we love to make fun of every archer who throws a sword or isnt firing an arrow basically. But with the Assassin class it seems anyone who can get a kill in whether using someone or themselves. Again... if you think about it though for example if you used someone to get someone assassinated the credit should still go to you logically even if the other person directly caused it since youre the person who move the events towards that result by some extent.

And then after Rome we got Okeanos which was pretty damned awesome and gave more revelations on the nature of Solomon and the grails.Rome basically was lets pander to Nero the chapter and didnt really achieve much else.,grandorder,d9srdkz,10,t5_39d7x

Youll need to broaden your roster a bit.However if theres any servants you absolutely want you should save up quartz.  When an event comes up that has a rate up for the servant you like roll for them then.  This is your best shot for overcoming the terrible gacha odds.  See here for a full list of servants.  If a servant you want is a story servant youll have to complete a certain chapter before they become available.  If theyre limited then that means theyre impossible to summon unless a special gacha is going on.  So save your quartz for those gachas.,grandorder,d9umnxp,1,t5_39d7x

9749092,0,t1_daeqxfu,I agree that the game is heavily fanservice oriented but i also feel that there is an abnormal focus on her outfit when she isnt even in some sexy pose as far as we can see granted yes she is in a bikini but you could kind of say the same about Altera and by extension extella spoilers altera lily. but we dont criticize to the best of my knowledge the latter for being in that outfit even though they are wearing the exact same revealing outfit.I also agree that intentions are important. but it feels like a restriction to creativity when we cant do something because other people might take it the wrong way. of course if their original intention was erroneous then thats another issue and again i think that the fiction and the real should be distinct and unless fictional collides with reality then we have a genuine issue. at least until we have full dive VR lol then that just turns into a mess I find cases like the one you mention to be weird and kind of makes age arbitrary. opinions are definitely divided in this regards. but in cases like this legally its okay. and the problem with that is the fact that if JDASL is jeanne alter but magically turned to look young and therefore is still however old she is then does it suddenly make it okay? what if it were the otherway around? if a young person where to get the body of maybe what we consider an average ish y.o. body. is it okay to sexualize that?in the real world the simplified answer is she of age? if yes then its fine if no then it isnt.but in fiction that doesnt really cut it precisely because you can mess around with character design.,grandorder,daese2c,1,t5_39d7x

9924641,0,t1_db14gmt,True the Iliad is quite literally the period of time from when Achilles stopped fighting to Hectors funerals. However that doesnt mean Hector is painted as a villain. Like most of the main character in the Iliad theyre all presented with faults as all Greek heroes are. What youre currently arguing however is no longer your original point. gtIn legends he was huge asshole who wanted to take over Sparta using his brother an curse of love put on Helena he stole armor from Patroclus and wanted to humiliate his body so king of Sparta fought with Hector to retain Patroclus body. And yeah he lost to Patroclus Apollo killed Patroclus. But in nasuverse Hector is not an asshole. And story needed villains so almost every trojan was an asshole.Your original comment pointed to him as the reason war began and as the master villain behind the entirety of the Trojan war which is completely untrue no matter how you look at it. As for taking care of Patroclus body the Trojans never managed to take it back inside the city since Achilles came back to take it. Nor is he supposed to take care of itgive it funeral rites since its the enemys corpse which theyll arrange a trade for after the days battle ends. Also exactly. Why the fuck would Hector want to duel Achilles if he just saw him cut through the Trojan army and a river god? It paints him as human rather than a huge asshole. All the qualities that theyve given him hubris cowardice it all serves to make him more relatable since he is a human fighting against a demigod. I mean sure he can be an asshole at times but that doesnt detract from his feat of heroics or his overall noble nature. Not to mention seeking glory and fame during this time period was quite literally the goal of every male warrior and Hector does embody the society he was born into. Sure you can say that the Trojans are portrayed poorly and yes they probably are since it follows Homers narrative just like how you can say the Greeks are portrayed poorly in the Aeneid since that follows a TrojanRoman narrative. Its certainly very biased. However the Iliad never paints Hector as a villain. There are instances in the poem where he is celebrated as a hero and there are certainly instances where hes shown to be an asshole but his overall characterization places him somewhere in between these two extremes. Hes probably one of the more human characters in the story and his character arc sees him evolve from someone forced to defend his city to someone reveling in victory to ultimately a tragic unwinnable duel that ends in his death and the desecration of his body. Though condensed in the epic he goes through the standard characteristics of a Greek hero story. ,grandorder,db17eqd,2,t5_39d7x

Jeanne got to  Bond level with k BP left til  currently.  My hat goes off to those of you with the time patience and dedication to raise a servant to bond .  Seriously I dont know how you keep yourself sane doing that. Noticed Saber Lancelots third skill cooldown happened to coincide with Jeannes Revelation.  I thought to myself hey maybe I should level that to  see how this works out...  JESUS CHRIST WHY DID I NOT DO THIS SOONER?  He has  turns to go on an absolute rampage.  Its amazing.  ...So thats my story of how I got his skills to  if that counts for anything.  Planning to get at least his first one to  as well when I have the resources.As an added bonus heres my screencaps from the end of the third TiamatGorgon fightOh is that an Avenger?  I GUESS I BETTER BRING JEANNE ALONG THEN!  Admittedly it was a pretty good tactic since Tiamats high hitcounts meant she could fire off her NP every other turn.

But I also considered the possibility that they were still working out the mechanics for Beast Class since its supposed to go Beast gt Avenger gt Ruler gt Beast.  Its a third grouping and DW is likely still trying to work out what resistances or special passives Beast servants can have to make them unique to the game and therefore make players want to get them.I ran vanilla Jeanne in the fights with Tiamat and didnt see those mechanics implemented so its entirely possible that they either have plans to incorporate Tiamat later into the story pool and werent ready to do so yet or they didnt bother because theyre going to put her as a limited and theres no rush to incorporate special mechanics for Beast class as of yet.  The latter is more likely but we dont know for certain how things are progressing with this development.,grandorder,dbgj7mx,1,t5_39d7x

10092866,0,t1_dbmzp6i,Implies said players actually have power creep servants. While I didnt whine the battles were definitely challenging but the account more or less started around the Halloween Rerun which means I had a small amount of time. Not only that  thanks to Shit Luck TM my only good Servants are Welfares and some Bronzes that I GAd. Overall this was a bit unbalanced since Mashu becomes more of a mainstay as you approach Babylon due to her skills unlocking. Then she gets locked away. Fine plot and whatever but it really can cripple the teams you have planned out.But honestly the boss is fine. Tolerable even. But the fact you lose AP to try and experimentand learn boss patterns is quite crippling. If they refund AP this wouldnt be a problem at all because we can experiment as we please.

10216186,0,t1_dc0q5vd,Totally agree on that I feel like Ishtar got shafted pretty bad since Nasu had to basically write  character that are practically the same yet had to give them different attributes or something dont really know how to describe it and since Ereshkigal had a buildup through the order instead of Ishtar that is presented at face value and thus seems better written.I ended up liking Ishtar better since she was really trying to save the farmers or whatever on the earlier chapters and it really felt that since she was a higher existence the misunderstanding of the animals being tribute made sense that also kind of explains the randomness of her actions on my view. But on the case of Erishkigal it felt really tacked on the part that she was taking the souls to protect humanity in that sense Ishtar really seems like the more mature and down to earth one while Erishkigal is made to look to me at least like an spoiled child that has never left her room and is just playing around.Just my two cents although my opinion is just faced on this summaries so Im more than probably loosing at the subtleties of the dialogue and descriptions.,grandorder,dc2295s,4,t5_39d7x

Oops didnt realize I wrote Kiyohime twice technically I did have two of her but I already have her at NP. I tried this strategy with LZO and the  Buster up but I feel berserkers just took too much damage even with their defensive skills and all busters mean I dont have charge their NP fast enough. Maybe Ill try again later when I levelled them up some more and build up more HP.And yeah I also read that Billy does a lot of crit damage and I have Bazzett or Room Guarder for star weight. Actually despite not having  luck only going to CE instead of servants having  might just be worth with how good it is when I got a friend with another  or Jack the crits are just insane.,grandorder,dc2jvut,1,t5_39d7x

The reason for this is that he probably be very jealous and pissed off that it was not him that fully circumnavigate the globe but instead was a hedonistic pirate.

10276597,0,t1_dc88e9f,DWs Scathach favoritism isnt necessarily gameplay its that for no reason she gets one of the biggest power level wanks that TypeMoon has ever seen in lore and thats really saying something.Like I get wanking Indian heroes since thats something that happens in their own mythology all the time what with their adoration of ridiculous hyperbole like how just about every warriorweaponarmorchariotcup of coffee is unrivaled and invincible. I get wanking Greek heroes because they are the most famous. I get wanking Gilgamesh as he is the oldest hero. Do I like it? Not really but I at least get it.But they had to pull so much out of their ass to make Scathach look good to the detriment of a lot of other figures in lore. Just off the top of my head immortal queen undead ruler inventor of Gae Bulg can use the THROWN Gae Bulg solos gods toptier magic user. All of those have no basis in lore and in many cases directly contradict the mythology to the point where they ripped out skills that she could have that actually would make sense Clairvoyance. And the only reason for the Scathach wank is because shes a waifu.

But If we think ahead you can use her to cleanse the demerit and TamaLancer would be still being on action after invincibility.Then you have a Star Generator and also a psuedo healer like Jack around the board to cleanse the Buffs of the enemy.On paper it doesnt sounds great but it is actually balanced and TamaLancer still have a decent NP gain on her ownsame for Jack.,grandorder,dccfppf,1,t5_39d7x
10310748,0,t3_5nl05a,Since I saw no one else post this I feel like there is a good need to do it for the BEST RIDER Forgive the outburstMarie Antoinette Class  Rider Rarity  stars Role Tank Noble Phantasm Guillotine Breaker Glory to the Crown of Lillies Quick AoE Attack  Hits with Party Debuff Removal Includes Stun Death Rate and whatnot and HP Recovery Increases with overcharge from  gt  HP Description and Analysis First Rule you dont pick Marie for the Damage. Second Rule you dont pick Marie for Critting or generating Stars. She is bad at both due to her skillset and NP Gain her best and primarly role is to Tank. Tank a lot with sparkles and cakes! I will offer more abstract and experimental tries with Marie so no worries about that. Here we go!Being one of the few launch Servants Marie has a hard time comparing towards her other Rider competitors. Anne Bonny amp Mary Read outdamage her easily with their ridiculously strong NP and Crit Damage St. Martha wins the Debuff Battle since her kit just offers much more utility and proper use making Maries single Debuff game which is arguably one of the worst debuffs known to mankind look better in comparison.Her Command Cards I have to frankly admit are utmost terrible when compared to that of Martha. Coming with QQAAB DelightWorks didnt really know whether they wanted to make Marie generating stars or gain NP faster. Both of which she sadly fails to achieve as good as her other  Riding friends. There is however one nice merit with having two Quicks and two Arts to which I will indulge later on.So why should I even bother with her in the first place? I might hear you think right now. The best answer I could give to those seeking souls is that Marie with the right CE and Party constellation can nearly live forever!take that Sanson!Taking notes from Cus Protection from Arrows B Marie takes his idea of dodging Attacks one step further and makes it a three Turn Invincibility buff with her own Princess of Loveliness A. Whereas Cu has his Def Buff along with it Marie makes use of one ridiculously great HP RegenTurn. With  Heal after  Turns at max she recovers  of her overall HP and is ready to pop that Skill right after one turn again.But thats not everything. Grace of God B comes to the rescue and also gives our cakeeating Queen another quick injection of Brioche flavoured HP capping out at  with a  Turn CD which is one of the better Heals out there. It has some utility but a Def Boost would have clearly been better to further reinforce her tankiness!Now to her NP which is all sparkly and not threatening. Slightly BELOW Amakusas NP you can imagine that Maries Damage is frankly said laughable. However her NP is one of the few and nice NPs that is able not only to recover with such a low NP that Merlin farted while laughing but to remove ALL debuffs which are not locked on your servant instantly. This might seem laughable or even disappointing to some people but imagine the Vanilla days of rolling a Marie Jeanne and Tamamo Cat. Continuing your Attacks with both former Servants after they bombed their NP? Marie and only Marie made that possible in the early Vanilla years of FGO.Her NP despite hitting weaker than Emiyas UBW before everyone bothered to ascend him above  is that it DOES generate a fair amount of Stars thanks to her Rinding A. The only problem of that is that Marie likes kira kira so much her ridiculous Star Attraction of whopping  will leave your Casters and Assassins bone dry. Once again Maries initial kit offers a good amount of heal and tankiness but if you are looking for a Damage oriented Rider Martha or Kintoki Rider would easily be a better recommendation. What CE should I put on her?Now this is where things can go even more interesting with our cake eating queen. For brevities and categorization purposes I will seperate her CE choice on three different aspects The I want to heal so much I will never see my Queen fall kit.What you need? Maid in Halloween. Seriously this thing is MADE for her. Coming with an HP only boost which if you decide to go all tanky is always a good choice its effect is where the real fun lies  Healing Received with one copy and if you LBd it you get a  Healing Received Boost. Doing some basic maths Princess of Loveliness A will give you now  HP  HP after  turns per turn instead of  and Grace of God B will jump from  HP Recovery to  HP! This nearly reaches  total HP Base HP of Servant with no Fous returned to her in five turns only! And if you fancy of using her Guillotine Breaker you will get  HP back as well. Adding that with other heals that you will get along the way there are few that can get so much HP back in five turns with that CE combination. If you have the CE at  along with Marie at  with max Fou She has  HP and you will be able to return her HP amount back to more than  in five turns and about  per turn with PoL being active. Add that with the Hit Invincibility you can see the aim of picking Marie as a tank. Other solid recommendations for this direction are Wizard amp Priest which also boosts the NP a little or Street ChocoMaid which helps out her overall Damage more as well! The I just want her to hit hard and be able to use her NP often kitFor this setup the initial thought is going more to Damage and NP Spamming rather than tankiness. Mind that with NP Spamming I am going for the longterm direction since a Kaleido does its job for one single NP and thats it. But there is one good CE which helps both her NP Damage albeit slightly and her NP Gain her biggest detriment. For that CE Young Maiden Ignorant of Love is a perfect fit for Marie. With  NP per turn and a  Quick Boost it is a great solution for Marie being able to spam her NP slightly faster. If you LB that one you will get  more NP and  more Quick Performance which really cries for a buff. That said this CE boosts both HP and ATK for a little and is a great lowbudget solution for Maries horrible NP Gain and NP Damage. If you dont care about the Damage you can also just use a Prisma Cosmos if you have one of those in your collection! The Just give me Brioche Stars and more Crit Damage and watch the enemies fall like flies! kit.One of the rather more abstract and crazy ideas is to ignore HP Boosts Invincibility and let the cake loose with Crits crits and more crits! For that setup you can use CEs like Praise Me! Holy Night Sign Dangerous Beast and Holy Night Dinner. Each of these cards either contribute to more Quick Damage NP Damage but most importantly Crit Damage. Since Marie eats Stars like they are made out of brioche she will most likely get all the Stars and do some decent Damage to an enemy servant while providing tankiness with her second and third skill. Crazy and abstract but also fun! What Teammates should I put with her  How it WorksSince Marie is if you are going with either of the upper CE directions still a tank that either heals a lot or is able to support the team output with more frequent NPs and slightly more Damage than a Herc Buster Card.Team  MarieEMIYA AssassinHans Arts Centric AllAround effifciency with accessible servantsThis setup is both lowbudget provided you roll EMIYA and useful in two ways For one Hans will make sure that your Emiya will do decent Damage with Human Observation A your team will get a decent amount of Stars with Innocent Monster D and increase all Stats and give Marie even more Healing with HP turns. Overall Hans works wonders with a Stargen CE like  and others alike giving him tankiness and providing a steady Star Pool which will be of use during those Art chains. Emiya will be able to gain more stars do nice damage AND give you  turn of peace if you use his Scapegoat C on Marie with her PoL being active. Marie of course will be able to gain NP by those Arts chains or can do decent damage to an enemy with a brave chain.Team  MarieNobunaga or Gilgamesh OR Emiya Archer if you have himMerlin Pricey Setup centred around a very buff Archer!The AListing of the team comps this team builds similarly on the first team only providing Marie with even greater Support while maintaining the Middle Mans prime role of dishing out Damage. For this setup you can go either Stargen CE or Heal CE for Marie since she will make sure that that your team either generates enough Stars or makes with Merlin sure that Marie will even be harder to kill. You generate Stars and use Merlins Hero Creation EX to make your Archer hit like a LOCOMOTIVE!Team  MarieTamamo or Hans OR IRIMerlin Abandon All Hope of killing the CakeThis team is solely created for fun purposes but if you want insanity AND laughable damage look no further. Give Marie that Kitty CE and your both Casters either Arts Performance Up or NP Gen CEs spam NP Rinse and repeat. Your team will be able to tank NPs bathe in that heal and make Marie the happiest Queen of the world. Dont believe me? Check out this amount of heal right here!And thats my summary of how nice it can be to use someone as underrated as Marie. Feel free to ask questions laugh or make more Cake jokes.

The practical side of it doesnt matter because of how different we play the game. Not everyone has a high level LB GS to outclass a  DB.

10395668,0,t3_5ou65v,The ones that come to mind immediately are Berserker Ruler and Avenger.For Berserker... Some Berserkers are easier to control than others. Asterios for example is rather docile while Sparticus will rebel the instant you start acting too much like a Master. I want to say that Kiyohime would be the hardest to control as she can take away a command seal if you lie to her. On the other hand if embrace being her husbando you might be able to... not so much order her as much as sort of guide her towards what you want done.Amakusa would be the most difficult Ruler as he has a wish hes dead set on having granted and will kill you if you try to get in the way of it.For Avenger Gorgon. She is a monster that will fucking eat you and anyone else she runs across. Youd have to use a command seal almost instantly after summoning to save yourself and perhaps another later to make her behave.,grandorder,dcmeyr7,1,t5_39d7x

10645837,0,t1_dd9sxq6,Merlin is the obvious Buster support servant with his buster buff. He can also generate stars with his NP. But youll obviously get less Buster chains with him and his AAA deck hanging around.Anyway from your list of Buster servants youre kinda not understanding what a Buster servant is. Buster NPs do not make a Buster servant. Martha Rider and Elizabeth Caster have a triple Arts deck.The core concept of a Buster team is to forgo most things for the raw damage of Buster chains. It nets you consistent and high damage. Wanting to build into crits makes it less consistent for higher potential output. A Quick servant thrown in will dilute your card pool reducing the probability of Buster chains. Having to spend turns to generate stars will reduce overall damage output for  a chance to hit harder.Not strictly a Buster team but a potentially silly combo would be to have Mozart and his crit skill in the backline somewhere. Have a pair of Buster servants with Merlin. The moment the stars align and one of your Buster servants get a Buster Brave Chain  drop Merlins Buster buff on him and swap Mozart in and drop  stars for definite crits. BBB   critical damage   buster buff. Aye lmao damage.,grandorder,dde1bi5,1,t5_39d7x

As of the post Im at Rome ch . Q Is it bad to use two of the same class in the starting positionsmy ex being two Berserkers? Also is it important to decks that counter the classes? or can I just use something from a different ?Q Should I be leveling everyone up? Or should I pour all the cards into one or two servants?Q right now i have   star All class HP Fou cards  star All Class HP Fou  star all class exp  and  all class attack fou cards.   WHO DO I SPEND THESE ON? Do I reserve these for Mashu? Herk? Or what? I am about to gacha with  quartz so should I see if i get any good cards?

Also I skipped a few lines I cant figure out so feel free to correct me or add anything interesting I missedYou are walking in Chaldea when you encounter the UFO waifu asking for your help saying that she has overdone something so there has been unexpected result. Just then Helena points above your head and you find a tiny flying saucer hovering around unnaturally. Its Helenachans special edition flying saucer with extra blessing from Mahatma! apparently wrapping it in tin foil creates high magic resistance? are tin foil hats legit now? She goes on to explain that she cannot dispel its attachment to you and she doesnt have nifty stuff like Mystic Eyes so to regain control of this rogue UFO shes gonna have to give it a good shock. While youre scared shitless she continues that the spells she knows are all overkill and will take you with it if she uses them so only you  a novice with pitiful firepower can shoot it down without making a mess. You shoot a runofthemill Gandr and save the day.Helena thanks you for your help. After a bit tinkering Helena makes sure the thing wont fly off on its own anymore though it has been scratched a lil from the shot which you can see on the CE. But the content is still fine so she finally gives it to you as her Val gift. Behold Helena Blavatsky special UFO chocolate maximum kmh flight speed meticulously made from cacao with authentic flavor! She also gifts the same thing to the geniuses ? and Karna but yours has got the top speed. This is her present for someone lively and honest like you says as she blushes. While you wonder why chocolate would even need to fly at breakneck speed she figures someone who runs around a lot all the time like you would need this and its filled with mana too! She also wants your comment on her chocolate preferably in Chaldea report form so that the result of the experiment can be analyzed by Davinci and Paracelsus later. As you raise your eyebrows over suspicious information like experiment Helenachan quickly assures you its a joke. But she really does want to know your opinion so dont forget to praise your UFO waifu after you get her choco!,grandorder,ddqltmt,7,t5_39d7x

Mom EMIYA and Dad Cu still have tensions. Especially when they found out that I would take Dad Alter against Mommy Alter in Shinjuku this week. Further complicated when Dadcelots found out that I imitated what Dad tried to do to kouhai in First Order and that I actually went a bit too far and got caught red handed literally red from Foukun biting my hand. Thus mommy is disappointed in me and has to use a shield whose name sounds like raw ass to constantly protect me from two angry dads. Kid Gil still refuses to give me any more money to try and summon my waifu. I suspect that Kiyohime and Kouhai are responsible for me being unable to summon waifu since it is through kouhais shield where we summon our Servants so she calls the shots on who is allowed or not.

Just going to keep suggesting shit you dont have otherwise.But its not the end of the world if you cant utilize the Arts buff of Foxs Wedding  its still a targeted heal. It can save a life if your heal NPs arent ready. It can be used on herself or Merlin to boost their Arts damage and NP gain. Tamamo offers much more in addition to that but the main draw is the heals and skill CD reduction. You can keep buffs on a lot if you keep repeating her NP.Or the Buster buff of Hero Creation  which is a Critical Damage buff and a heal. Well not strictly a heal but it increases max HP and along with it your current HP. Ive used both abilities as spot heals since keeping my servants alive is more important than doing somewhat more damage the next turn. If Im alive Ill keep on doing damage. Everybody at least has a single Buster or Arts cards so when used in conjunction with critical damage  both buffs can still have value outside of a NP that shares a type. Hero Creation alone can result in a powerful buster crit added with Fox Wedding will result in a powerful Arts crit.TamaMerlin might seem like a bit of a contradiction due to the conflict of their BusterArts buff. Maximizing on one means the other goes somewhat to waste. But together they have potent heal star generation party NP generation and skill CD reduction. Normally that wont be enough to keep your party alive through boss NPs but Merlin has a party invuln skill. On an  turn cooldown but Tamamo can shorten that easily so you can use it repeatedly to block the NPs of nonArcherAssassin bosses. Its a team thats immortal against most matchups. Doesnt really matter who the third servant is but if you want your fights to not take stupidly long  then obviously go with someone with some semblance of synergy.,grandorder,ded0zqt,1,t5_39d7x

Not to mention the Story Gacha which is just another unnecessary layer of segregation to basically trick whales or people who dont understand how the gacha works to roll for stuff like Nero or Saber Alter in the story gacha when every normally available SRSSR is still in that pool for some stupid reason.You also get to see the actual rateup  whereas FGO hides it from you  which regardless of how significant is just unnecessarily hides information from the customer. So arguing that FGO is better due to a smaller pool resulting in a bigger rateup is sortve speculatory because we dont actually get to see how big the rateup is compared to the rest of the available pool.I think people would rather have say Scathach or Gilgamesh available  and live with that landmine possibility while going for something they want on rateup than have to deal with the Miss it once and now you have to wait for an indefinite amount of time situation we have now.Not to mention limiteds in general are basically a cheap tactic to incite a need for people to spend money. Its one of the clearest predatory tactics in the mobage arsenal. ,grandorder,deiwmic,8,t5_39d7x

Honestly the only one you seem to have is welfare Jeanne Lily and while she is good she isnt enough to defeat some of the later Archer bosses despite the class advantage. Well she is AoE so I dont really expect her to do so anyway.I am not telling you to go and roll for some new SRSSR Lancer as that is close to impossible honestly rolling a Servant you actually want is a miracle but you should take time to raise guys like Cu Chulainn. Or Proto Cu Chulainn. Or... actually those two are enough.  They are Lancers with good single target NPs and high survivability due to PfA. They also arent really all that rare as I steel keep getting them in the FP gacha from time to time.

11307277,0,t3_61csq7,Theyre pretty good really. No powercreep. Some servants are broken but its not like newer releases are trying to one up one another. Rarity  usefulness. There are so many games where you just dump any charas that arent top rarity bc theyre not good enough in high lvl stages but if you level up skills and have good synergies in FGO then even the lowest rank servants can beat bosses. Many of those good servants are for free in FP gacha too so youre not require to spend freemium currency to clear game No PvP so I feels like its less stress for you to force to level up xx servants even if you dont like themVery generous with AP refill sources...some people here got like  apples or something ....gacha rate is shit but at least they accommodate it with lower quartz amount so thats something....developers actually play the game to test out what can be improve Great story and characterization. Personally alot of games I dont really care about charas in the gacha beside visual and stat but in FGO I wanted to roll many charas bc I like how theyre written. Many of them have a role to play in the story too tho idk whats Eric role in...anything...but he is the most forgotten so.... Even tho events can take a while to release I appreciate how theyre not too generic? Like they try not to recycle concepts and it comes with some fun stories so each ones feels pretty unique like Gudaguda Oni island Santa event. ,grandorder,dfdnves,5,t5_39d7x

11540127,0,t1_dg41d9t,Im cutting out most of this because its not relevant. I dont give a flying fig about the minutia of Gilgameshs skills because its not important. Youve even halfadmitted to what Ive said already but stuck in caveats.You originally stated that in a vacuum Gilgamesh would just win by default in any battle. Now you keep adding more things like If Gilgamesh uses all of his abilities to the fullest and If its in an arena death match when no one reasonable would ask that especially about servants who would reasonably be using their personalities and abilities not just bludgeoning each other mindlessly.But so much effort was put into this I want to at least respond to some of it.gt Uhhhhhhhhhhhh they die super super super hardI feel like youre the kind of person who goes into these kinds of debates and just massively underestimates intellect. For instancegt  and the Doctor would get cleaved in half about  seconds into running away.I laugh at this heartily and assume youve only seen  or  bumble around like an idiot and never seen the Doctor actually stuck in a battle to the death with some being impossibly more dangerous and deadly than him. Trust me The Doctor vs Gilgamesh would end in either the Doctors victory or a draw where he defuses the situation and escapes or turns Gil against the ones making them fight. Because cleverness gt strength when you get to a sufficient level. gt Well first off that was blatant poetic hyperboleNot really blatant this is hotly debated.gt Destroying the World is theoretically possible and would trigger the intervention of the counter force. Destroying the planet is it has been established functionally impossible.Now youre just quibbling.gt They are superficially similar but UBW is far far inferior.Irrelevant. UBW is not far far inferior in practice. Yes GoB has way more NPs probably but since Gil doesnt use most of them and certainly doesnt specially target most of them the difference usually isnt apparent except that Emiya is less likely to have the hard counter to a given servant in his projection database. Thus Emiyas rain is only a rank or two lower than Gils rain. Its gonna do a lot of damage regardless and he doesnt jump to it as a goto. Why? Because one wellaimed Caladbolg is more dangerous than a hundred randomly fired swords even though his are superior in function to Gils because he innately knows how to use their abilities while Gil cannot.gt He could have killed Shirou no problem with swordrain but instead chose to fight him in melee. Incorrect here. He could have killed Shirou no problem. At any moment he could have killed Shirou basically. He wanted to teach Shirou. He also wanted him dead. It was either change your mind and see the truth of my words or die and slowly became about him realizing the truth. When he wants someone dead he unloads on them see Hercules and Medea. With Cu he lacks his memories the first time and doesnt really want to kill him the second time.gt And that much was the best he could do if Gilgamesh had chosen to continue spamming swords in slightly higher numbers Shirou would have been boned.No not really. Once Shirou got Gilgamesh in his UBW it was over unless Gil successfully used Ea. UBW is his perfect counter. It would have taken everything out of Shirou to do it but Gil couldnt win without using Ea. But thats not important because my point was that someone who is neither very powerful nor very smart still ended up with a counter.gt For what it is worth Heracles might as well have a skill called Plot Armor Manliness EX. He didnt break that chain because of his high strength he broke it because he was motherfucking HERACLES and he was SICK of Gils SHIT.Youre right that it was partly because Hercules is mfing Hercules but the point is even with the chains at full power its capable of being broken. Thus when its at lesser power or none  though honestly I doubt Gil would use it at all then it can also be broken without needing to be the SON OF ZEUS! to do itgt one time by overwhelming him before he could get serious.He only needed to do it once. Dont think Zhuge wouldnt find other ways to do it if he had to repeat the process and knew Gil wouldnt fall for it that time. Thats my point here we have a record of servants and even a non servant! either beating him or making it difficult for Gil to win so the automatic assumption he will win is basically the same kind of reasoning that makes it literally impossible for Shirou to ever lose to Gil. Oh yes Gil could beat Shirou but he never ever will because he can never bear to take the actions required to do sogt Zhuge Liang and Shirous victories were not in a vacuum Zhuge had help but assuming he couldnt have found a way if he lacked those is uncharitable when the only reason he chose that path was because it was the best one for his long term plans on top of defeating Gilgamesh the only way to safely retrieve the grail was to create an alliance with all of the stable servants anyway. Shirous literally is in a vacuum though. If he has help his chances of victory significantly diminish because he might be swept up and killed incidentally while Gilgamesh treats his ally more seriously. That and he also requires no outside influence at all. Shirou can unarguably beat Gil in a vacuum. EMIYA as well obviously.gt Ok woah slow down there what? Did I miss a crucial line of AZO or are you just wanking Zhuge?Uh. You agreed that with prep Zhuge was the one likely to win.gt  But there is literally no chance of there ever being a situation in which Gilgamesh will lose  of the time against him.Of course there is. Zhuge only needs to sic Shirou or Emiya on him and it will  guarantee a loss on Gilgameshs part every time. Gil cannot possibly beat them because his pride obstructs his only paths to victory. This is established canon. gt He would likely take one look at her and judge she was very skilled and not to be merely trifled with.Putting aside his documented sexism and assuming Scathach doesnt somehow provoke him there are degrees of effort. He doesnt need to treat her like Shirou to underestimate the strength required to defeat her instantly and thus provide her with the opportunity to kill him. Gilgameshs skill set is primarily offensive. He does have defensive NPs but hes never employed them before so killing him is less of a problem than surviving him.gt  Nasus exact words on the subject are Anything can be found in there.Anything can be found there but its still nonsense to say he has a toy in there that turns the sun purple. Draining intellect is kind of nonsensical.gt Gil does as Gil pleases. This is not me talking out of my ass but an actual statement from CMIII. Because he has absolute selfconfidence he is able to calmly show himself before his opponents. However depending on mood he is also fine with scoring kills by raining Noble Phantasms behind the enemies back. The will of the king cannot be simply gauged by the concept of tactic.None of that answers my question. Gil does as Gil pleases so what would motivate him to be pleased by turning an entertaining or interesting battle into staring at a drooling dullard? Hed almost certainly be far more interested in dealing with an intelligent man though obviously hed know that such intelligence would still never be a true threat. Nothing in that quote suggests he uses NPs to directly turn off his enemies powers just that hell indiscriminately sneak attack you if hes feeling pissy.gt No it assumes that either he did not plan for it did not enact a plan for it did not have the opportunity to enact a plan for it or failed to enact a plan for it.Which is very uncharitable and not the correct way to discuss a vs subject. Gil should not be assumed to use his clairvoyance and appropriate NPs if you dont also assume that Zhuge uses his strengths. Like you yourself said Zhuge is literally the strategist of the Fate universe. Hes absolutely not in that arena without a really awesome plan.gt The man has a magical spaceship and literal nuclear weapons it isnt exactly the most difficult thing in the world for him to do.In what world does he lead with those?gt But this only applies if one assumes that Gilgamesh would allow her room to summon CuI just dont get why youre constantly giving Gilgamesh all the credit and you dont give it to others who face him. Gilgamesh will know not to let her summon Cu but the Doctor will die in three seconds. Gil will immediately realize how dangerous Scathach is to him due to her regal bearing but Zhuge wont have a plan to deal with a mouthy tyrant. This is why you think he wins in a vacuum youre basically playing chess against yourself but only making serious moves when its whites turn.I think Ive cut that down pretty well. Youve already agreed to my original point that the answer is not always Gilgamesh though. The answer is always that Gilgamesh is a mean af opponent you dont want to run into if your name isnt Emiya Shirou but not that he will always win. He wont. Hes just the raid boss with a better than average chance of killing most servants not specifically equipped to take advantage of his weaknesses.,grandorder,dg42q1t,1,t5_39d7x

11647027,0,t3_6671p3,gtIts no lie that grand order has a lore breaking and confusing summoning history. With divine spirits being summoned and complete disasters like Edison.Uh just for FYI FGO has not broken any summoning rules. It really annoys me to keep having to repeat this.Divine Spirits are generally too strong to be summoned so must be summoned as PseudoServants Ishtar. Stheno and Euryale get a pass because theyre incredibly weak Divine Spirits so can be summoned anyway and get a power boost as Servants.Im not sure why you singled out Edison as a disaster because he is indeed Heroic Spirit worthy with his achievements and he does have an explanation as to why hes not incredibly weak because of his US President Mystic Code suit.Anyway for your topic the only Servants who get weakened in FGO are those who should have multiple NPs but cant use them because of Chaldeas FATE system or those with NPs who are just generally too OP. Herk is the only one I can think of in those parameters. Star placement compared to lore is a different matter entirely. For example Blackbeard is a  star but his lore states he is actually quite strong with a really good NP Queen Annes Revenge gets stronger with each Heroic Spirit boarding it and the ship can fucking fly and in Okeanos he showed that he was a match for Drake.,grandorder,dgg7d9t,20,t5_39d7x

She is not a Servant. She was not summoned. She does not have a Master. She does not participate in the War. She does not belong to the Monster  class. Monster is not a Servant class to begin with.There is literally nothing in the encounter her with her that suggests she is a Servant and she very clearly says otherwise.,grandorder,dgr8gbt,-1,t5_39d7x

As such I stand by the position that you should know the basics of every series not necessarily before playing the game but before going on a community dedicated to discussing it.People who only watch the anime are barbarians and need to either change that to become informed members of the fandom or leave before they become cancerous.
