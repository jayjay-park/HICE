1374395,0,t3_29u1nf,HeyI am a novice coder I think it would attract a lot more attention if you could create a short tutorial on how to set it up. I love what you did because you do not have to boot a different OS onto the EV. I could definitely use this in some classes. I wish you the best of luck!EDITIf you tell me how to connect I will make a tutorial for you. I want to use this badly,mindstorms,ciokg0t,2,t5_2rinq

Of course you can switch back at any time by using the classic program builder to reinstall the NXTG firmware.,mindstorms,cuwal46,1,t5_2rinq

8851682,0,t3_51e1xw,Theres a number of ways you could achieve this the simplest of which I think would beKinect hooked up to a computer program is able to detect human movements etc.EV is connected to the computers network via wifi.The computer program can send network messages to the EV to direct its movement.  The EV program could also send sensor readings to the computer if you wanted.If I was to do this Id be using linux on the computer and evdev on the EV.  You can get set up with evdev just by setting up a microsd card and plugging it into the EV robot.  You may or may not have a linux computer Windows would work just fine as well.  Youd need to know basic network coding.There may be a simpler way to do this using the tools provided out of the box by LEGO but I am not familiar with the EV pc software as I found it too limited for my needs SLAM robotics.,mindstorms,d7buhvn,3,t5_2rinq

10295953,0,t1_dcabbzy,I set the seconds to  and the remoteIR Sensor is still responding irregularly. Here is the link to my layout This is what happens...I run the program click on a button it beeps. I do this  more times  each second  and on the fifth time I get no sound. I click again still no sound. There is no sound until  to  seconds and then I get a sound when pressing the button.My theoryAt this point Im thinking that either the RemoteIR Sensor or the brick has a problem. Im assuming that it is not the remote because the green light on it turns ON immediately every time I press a button. Im also going to assume that it is not the IR Sensor because there shouldnt be any processing being done in it. Im going to open the brick up and see the signal come into channel  on my scope but I need to find the Schematic first.,mindstorms,dcb3ouc,1,t5_2rinq
