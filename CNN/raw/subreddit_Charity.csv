Yes there is a small possibility that this might have already been posted to this subreddit but I got off from work at  at night ran for an hour and it is now AM.  Forgive my laziness for not checking to see if this was already posted.  I dont know whether or not my coworker is a redditor herself but I do know shes one of the nicest girls that works at our grocery store.  Her smile lights up the front end of the store and Ive never heard a single bad thing about another person escape her lips.  Suffice to say shes a real sweetheart.  Shes also young Im not sure how old she is but she graduated high school in  so shes probably not even  yet.  If I lost my father at that age Id know where Id be right now alcoholic and homeless.Worst of all and what gave me the idea to come here there is a procedure that could save him now instead of wasting what precious time he has left waiting for a donor but his insurance company is refusing to cover it.

I also noticed they needed to raise  by January th and another  by the th.  Yeah thats a steep bill thanks again health care.  Guess where theyre at?  .  Yeah its a long shot.  A long fucking shot.  Itll take more than prayers for this one.  It will take nothing short of an act of God through the hearts of Man.,Charity,cehruok,1,t5_2qhi2

10566387,0,t3_5r8lw5,Plus you still with your parents. They could force you to get rid of the cat because they make the rules. Seems like you should probably just wait until you live by your own means. Cats arent usually very expensive but the adoption costs are minimal compared to the cost of care over the cats lifetime. You dont have any way of paying for it  means you cant take care of it. ,Charity,dd5tidw,2,t5_2qhi2
