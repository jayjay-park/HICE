6341161,0,t3_42g5xz,Also remember that because this is a points championship during the endurance race if any participant is disconnected from the race a caution will be called and the participant will be given time to rejoin the race at the back of the field. The race will then be restarted with the remaining time at which the caution was called. In order for a caution to be called the participant that was dropped must send SlowMotionFire or MDERNWEAPN a message indicating their intent to rejoin the race after the participant has restarted their xbox router etc. This isnt a perfect system but we do the best we can to be fair. ,FM4,czaf40h,2,t5_301dj
