463020,0,t3_1zdogj,Nothing other than the port being open for that particular machine.  Home routers use NAT so your media server is not going to be exposed other than the port being forward which is required for outside connections. SSH on the other hand might get brute forced if youre forwarding to it from the outside and its on the standard port .  Id run sshd on some nonstandard port just so bots have to scan your entire port range on your own IP rather than doing the much faster and efficient port  scan on an entire ip set.  You could also mitigate alot of potential issues with SSH if you disable the ability for root to login most bots just try brute forcing root because it always exists so its an easy to guess account.,computers,cfswa5x,2,t5_2qhm5

Doesnt take much and you dont want oil flying around the inside of your case so really make sure its only a drop.  Then cover the hole back up with the sticker or a small piece of electrical tape.  Ill usually plug them in but keep it outside the case and let it spin a few minutes just in case theres any extra oil it might spin off before installing it all the way  although to my eyes Ive never had even a drop come off either during that test spin or after install.Ive had that quiet down quite a few fans actually.

529078,0,t3_2074bm,It depends on your hard drive but in general deleting x will only help a little bit when readingwriting data.  This is due to the way hard drives work.  They have spinning disks with data on them and a drive head that moves to read different parts of the disks.  As with any spinning disk the outer edge moves faster than the inner parts of the disk.  So data stored close to the edge of the disk moves faster therefore it can be read and written faster.  The less data there is on a disk more of the data should be stored close to the edges.However hard drives are also much slower than SSDs due to access time the time it takes for the head to move to a new position to readwrite data.  When a drive has mostly free space most of the data is stored towards the outer edges of the disks so the drive head shouldnt have to move much.  However it still doesnt come close to the near  access time of SSDs.So creating more free space and defragmenting will help but probably not enough to get excited about.,computers,cg0evqk,4,t5_2qhm5

Your computer shouldnt need more wattage than that. But a power supply that hasnt been professionally reviewed concerns me.  I couldnt find a professional review on your exact model but I did find this and its probably close to what you already have If this is close to what you already have then it just wont do.  Hardware Secrets concluded that the power supply was really a  Watt unit and that just wont do.Id much rather have the EVGA instead but you may change your mind after following that link.I always edit for grammar and clarity.,computers,cjf3skt,2,t5_2qhm5

1927572,0,t3_2gownb,Well the system is booting into windows the HDD is being accessed normally and when you pressed windows key  P the screen went dark then back to backlight which means windows APIs are running. My first thought is that the GPU is having problems  connect it to an external monitor to test the GPU. If you get a display great that means the LCD is defectiveor the cable is loosebad. If no display and only backlight then most likely GPU but could also be something related to a software hang regarding your youtube hack tutorial. To test this when you turn it completely offhold power for  seconds then turn it back on and press f or f repeatedly to access the uefi menu. If the menu displays then its software. If it doesnt then its probably the gpu  best to get a new pc. Hope you figure it out.,computers,cklgidq,1,t5_2qhm5

First of all its getting to the point of where its outdated and falling apart. Also the mac in general is overpriced as balls. You could get a much faster efficient machine for the same or smaller price. if you only use it for browsing the internet just get a different laptop with and intel i in it.  This will give you really good Internet performance and youll be able to run some great games on it as well like unturned or what not. With windows ten coming out youll be able to get a machine running windows which has mixed reviews but Im happy with it but youll get a free upgrade to Windows  when that comes outwhich is supposed to address all the issues reported with windows . If you have a certain price range message me back and Ill be glad to help you pick out a new laptop and give you a range to choose from.Happy hunting!Also just to add for the price of a MacBook pro you could get an integrated graphics card which is a really good thing to have if you do any gameing.,computers,cpogwtp,5,t5_2qhm5

4073636,0,t1_crkctfn,. Usually when people talk about fast ram vs slow ram theyre talking about  vs . OP is talking about .    Im not saying he should get MHz because he shouldnt. But upgrading from MHz to  is a nobrainer.. RAM speed doesnt have a significant increase on average framerate but it does have a significant benefit for worsecase framerate. Often when a game stutters its because some large texture needs to get moved from system memory to video memory. The MBs transfer speed of MHz does not saturate the GBs PCIe . x bus but the MBs transfer speed of  gets close enough. If you need to move a MB texture you just saved . milliseconds by having faster RAM which is a lot.    A  upgrade or whatever to move a bottleneck from one part of your system to another part of your system is almost always worth it. Memory is cheap CPUs and video cards are expensive. If your minimumframerate bottleneck is your memory instead of your CPU video card or PCIe bus because you wanted to save the cost of a mocha hazelnut vanilla latte you dunn goofed.,computers,crkmdf8,1,t5_2qhm5

4808317,0,t1_cu0eb5o,I had to look around for an answer to this one and its hard to google the question without find sata to usb adaptors. initially i thought it may be the SATA emulation mode in your bios but i found an article that says windows detects the sata as a removable drive because sata hotplugging is a thing. you can just remove the drive while the pc is on not recommended lol in your BIOS do you have an option to disable sata hotplugginghotswapping? try that. if that doesnt work you could try changing the sata emulation type but i cant recall if that will mess with the drive until the setting is changed back.EDIT changing the emulation mode wont damage the drive it may make the drive unreadable in the current mode changing it back to the original mode will allow it to be read again.,computers,cu0mm8l,1,t5_2qhm5

The issue is that the is a controller card that charges your battery and it learns the battery through charge and discharge cycles. If it never gets discharged it causes issues with the controller card. It is ideal to completely discharge a laptop at least once every month weekly would be better. Run the battery dead then completely charge the laptop to do a full charge cycle. This will keep your battery and its controller happiest for as long as possible.,computers,cu7wgyl,1,t5_2qhm5

This will remove everything so you can just install what you need and no unnecessary bloatware will be left. This takes some work but would give you the best results Run rtronscript. This script does a variety of things from virus scans to removing bloatware automatically. Not as good as a reinstall but much easier. If even possible replace the hard drive with an SSD.

Youll almost always need to have a serial numberCD keyactivation code.If you want to buy it for cheap check out rMicrosoftsoftwareswap  with this youll have an activation code but youll still need to download the Windows  ISO file from a torrent site.You can download it for free from piracy torrent sites. If you do this you can use a Windows  activator. I wont get into the details here but you can ask over on rpiracy of thats what you want to do.

7097921,0,t3_4crlip,Well.. some cpus are embedded into the laptop motherboard therefore it would be a major pain just to remove the cpu and install a new one. laptops in general are a huge pain to do cpugpu upgrades to. And by the way if your laptop has intel HD  graphics theres no dedicated video card its all from the cpu. And to find a gpu youd have to find a laptop gpuheatsink for your exact laptop. sometimes gpu heatsinks are connected to your cpu heatsink. And it sounds like you wont even be able to install or upgrade your gpu simply because there isnt a separate gpu. its all together in the cpu so theres no room on the board to install a gpu Most likely.

The keys feel a lot nicer as they have higher travel distances and tactile feedback not the case for all switches but for many of them. They are also less fatiguing to type on and are less prone to failure.Adding to all this is the enthusiast factor. They offer extensive customization and nice features.As for ducky specifically they are known for extremely good build quality metal cases and cherry switches which many other companies also use.,computers,d37lov3,0,t5_2qhm5

7718421,0,t3_4l1b1r,As the other poster linked the do exist in some forms but generally they are nonexistent now because they just have no real advantages over solidstate memory for any application that you might want them for. Solidstate is cheap enough thin and has no moving parts  all very attractive features for anything mobile like phones cameras etc. Solidstate is also generally faster in most cases especially compared to lowend HDDs and generally uses less power.Practically speaking while Im sure there may be others the only real advantage is that HDDs tend to hold data for longer periods of time then solidstate. But really this would be largely defeated by the mechanical nature  It may technically hold the data longer but if that HDD fails because you dropped your phone while standing When the solidstate memory wouldnt have failed then it doesnt really matter how long it was supposed to hold the data for. And really as long as the solidstate memorys lifespan is not shorter then the intended lifespan of the phone And the lifespan of other components then it may not even matter.,computers,d3jj541,3,t5_2qhm5

7935312,0,t3_4nx2u5,Oh man. This is a super broad question. Many different philosophies and schools of thought governing different methodologies for securing computers. Personally I subscribe to both the Security in layers and assume breech mentality. First things first lock down your browser. Stop using Internet Explorer. Get an ad blocker. Get something like noscript. Stop going to sketchy sites. Yes that includes watching donkey porn. Youll have to stop doing that. The browser is your primary infection vector. Once that is locked down and your browsing habits are improved youre infinitely more secure. Next antivirus software. They dont work. Dont rely on them. Personally I dont run one. If you decide to run one dont buy one. Get Windows Defender use that for your active scanning. Get Malwarebytes run it a couple times a month to catch things that have slipped through. Finally download yourself a copy of something like the Bitdefender rescue CD. Burn it to a physical CD. Run that once a month or so to clean up everything your other defenses missed. Do these and youll be reasonably secure. However if you want to take it further there are more options. You can really take it as far as you want. I run a couple separate dedicated firewalls IDSIPS and custom security software on my network. If you do take the time to set up any of that make sure you properly configure it. Which includes egress filtering on your firewalls. It becomes a great hobby and can also become a great career. ,computers,d4805eu,1,t5_2qhm5

If a drive is designed to stand vertically its safer to set it horizontal so it wont fall over.  Avoid refurbished drives because theres no standard definition of refurbished and such drives range from brand new to used for well over  hours.

Using VLANs.With the desktops youd need to acquire server hardware of some kind. Maybe something like a HP DL to start of with. Install your Hypervisor on that and then all customers desktops are host on that server. Depending on needs of the customer you might get  desktops on one server. You can even have auto load balancing if there are multiple servers. Its also important to think about if someone wants to upgrade but that server is at capacity youll have to migrate them to a new server or expand the current one. Contingencies for down time of your server how quickly can you rebuild a new server or repair a damaged one. Youll want backups of your server and customer data if something happens. HP servers have a cool tool called iLO which is basically remote BIOS which can come in handy if you have to reboot and the data centre is closed.Microsoft has a free version of Server  called HyperV core its a pain in the arse to setup but basically you use a desktop Windows . professional machine to configure the HyperV manager on the server. Personally I would just pay for  R standard and it gives you a GUI and you dont have to mess around with another computer to configure it.,computers,d5ip3mk,1,t5_2qhm5
8389248,0,t1_d5q31av,Using a mac will be a little better for video editing. If it was EXCLUSIVELY for editing i think anyone who knew what they were talking about would recommend a mac. If you have a very large budget it might be beneficial to get a MacBook Pro Retina for your editing a custom built PCTrust me its easier than it sounds for your gaming and an external capture card to record the footage to your mac. You would also probably benefit from buying an external hard drive thats around TB so you can movebackup your footage from your mac. Like spanky said a budget would be useful information and some more specific needs are necessary. Is this something you do professionally? Or is it a hobby? How long would you want the computer to last? Is the video editing so that you can edit and record the games you play or something separate?

They continually push out changes that are against popular opinion and have done things like including adware in their OS.If you want to go Linux try Debian. Its the OS Ubuntu was based from and they have a much more serious and strict set of guidelines they operate under.As others said you will lose the ability to play some major games and use some popular software. No MS Office no Adobe anything. There are alternatives you can use but serious users will tell you they are inferior.Linux is great for everyday computing though. A lot of ways its better than Windows in other ways its not. I see it as a personal preference thing much like Mac vs Windows. Windows  is going to work just fine for another  years or so. Dont worry if you want to keep using it. Also if you do want to try a Linux distribution you can run them without making any changes to your computer. Download the ISO for Ubuntu Debian Mint or others and burn it to a DVD or USB. You can boot and run from that and try it for yourself before you install. ,computers,d6omy48,2,t5_2qhm5

The only application most people see it for is video games as thats where they are gonna make their money. There are some people using research and other things but the widespread use will always be video games in my opinion.I think AR is where tech is going to go once it becomes more readily available HoloLens are what like k? whereas VR is gtk. The applications for AR and VR are endless but most people see VR as a tool rather than a game in my experience.

Have you thought about a Chromebook for notes in class and a desktop as a primary machine? I know it would be a bit out of your price range right now you could get both for around . Having the choice to upgrade when you get into more demanding courses would be a big plus. But this requires more space file sharing etc...

9900872,0,t3_5h7usp,Take the stand off to ensure nothing is securing. Next you will use a pry tool such as a screwdriver or butterknife to gently pry the case somewhere in the middle. It has plastic clips all around the edges. You are going to be carefully prying your way around the case until it finally opens. Once you get it apart you can clean residual off any PCB component using  rubbing alcohol and a cotton swab. If you break the clips hopefully most will still hold it. Double check youve solved the issue and if so use hot glue to re secure it.Probably wouldnt hurt to put a bead of calking along the edges of the monitor so that way next time you laugh this cant happen ,computers,day3uiu,2,t5_2qhm5

9982151,0,t1_db4gzhv,Depends on your specific abilites and needs.Personally I also need my games to work properly and since all other devices also use WiFi phones laptops etc when you have other clients connected you can get spikes also. This is where QoS services step in. Personally I have two TPLink TLns connected in a wireless bridge and also as access points.If you are more technically inclined I am more than happy to give you more information on my specific setup. I am personally using custom firmware DDWRT on my setup.These two router cost  each in EU.However if you are not so much a technical person then I think you can still run a WDS setup even with the stock firmware. This is pretty much the same thing Im running except you will not get QoS or in other words prioritizing of programs. So if you run torrents when gaming then your ping will be high. So google WDS and the routers I gave and perhaps you will also get yourself a solution.I have to say I tried many many different adapters and was almost giving up on wireless gaming everyone told me its not possible. Until I tried this  router wireless bridge and I have to say it is very very stable and nice.Also keep in mind that you wont be getting very high internet speeds through these routers. This depends on the population of wifi channels near your area if you live in an apartment vs private building. These routers are capable of Mbps which is cut into half by the WDS and just to be safe cut that in half also. I assume you would get a stable Mbps through this setup but I have a slower Internet service myself so I cant test this.,computers,db8paxb,2,t5_2qhm5

10220069,0,t1_dc1krzy,If you heat it up be sure to vent the area extremely well because who knows what kind of nasty chemicals will be released. I wouldnt even use an oven that you plan on using again for food because some chemicals might adhere to the oven surfaces and slowly get released later at normal cooking temperatures. I dont want you to possibly get cancer  years down the road. A heat gun might work if it has a very small attachment for directing the heat onto a small area and lots of options for heat levels. But again vent the area extremely well. Id just do it outside.Im not good at sanding or heat guns. Ive only done some minor stuff on computers. One time I reheated a PGA graphics chip that had bad soldering joints because resoldering it required tools and skill I didnt have. Another time I sanded the surface of an AMD Athlon  in order to improve heat transfer to the heatsink. Thats the extent of my experience. So Im unsure of many things such as whether such a heat gun exists and which level of grit you should use for sandpaper. You can start with a heavier grits and move to a lighter grits. These are all just best guesses and I want to make sure you dont assume I know more than you about everything or even anything. I just think this is a cool idea and it is something Ive thought to do before. I wish I could join you.My assumption is that the metal part jutting above the surface of the green CPU packaging is just a heat spreader. IIRC flip chip allowed them to have the surface of the die attached directly to a heat spreader on top of the CPU packaging in order to allow faster heat dissipation.Maybe try methanol as the solvent. Nasty stuff. Read the directions very carefully. Approach it as if youre doing some Breaking Bad level of stuff. Who knows how chemicals are going to react and what gaseous or liquid byproducts are going to be created. Dont be a Jesse! And like ESD just because you dont feel or see anything that doesnt mean there isnt some bad shit going on. But dont worry about that until you get it sanded down to that point. And even then it might not work... Now that I think about it maybe just forget the solvent and just go with the finest sandpaper grit you can find. Or some kind of polishing tool. Maybe the adhesive is transparent in color and you can just leave some adhesive over the die and just polish it to the smoothness of glass.Maybe develop a plan and make another post detailing those plans. More people might be able to respond about what to watch out for safety wise.,computers,dc2i3dy,2,t5_2qhm5

10491152,0,t1_dcx4b6s,Well those temperatures are definitely ok.  The idle seems rather high on the CPU and only going up C on load isnt what Id normally expect but C is perfectly fine for a high temperature no doubt.  GPU fine as well for sure.At this point Id have to say the next likely culprit does seem to be the power supply.  Do you know what wattage it is?What it sounds like to me is that it is not being able to put out enough power to keep the system going.  I would try taking the power supply to a local repair shop or Geek Squad Best Buy if you are in the US.  They can test and see how much power the PSU is putting out and see if it is functioning correctly or not.  We had one of our power supplies go out about a month ago on one of our office computers.  At first I thought it was an issue with the GPU as it was really old.  The computer was freezing and turning off randomly when we did anything even remotely stressful on it.  Turns out the PSUs fan was barely spinning and was not able to keep it cool enough and would overheat when power draw on it was anything over a minimal amount.  Just one of those things I didnt think of until I actually saw it happen.,computers,dcxa6e2,1,t5_2qhm5

If the processors match then the OS should boot up and work although you might have display resolution issues or missing drivers. If you can get online then you can let Windows Update try to fix what it can or go to your device manufacturer website and download the drivers. Windows might also ask to be activated again. It does this because you have changed up to  critical hardware devices.

11246246,0,t3_60dkog,You probably dont need any more than gb if youre just a casual usergamer.   Really unless youre doing audio or video editing or running the very latest games at the highest quality you really dont need it.   Contrary to popular opinion adding RAM will not make your computer any faster  as far as loading times startup times web browsing navigation file transfers etc.  It will make literally no difference whatsoever.  All of that stuff will take the same amount of time whether youve got gb or gb.   more RAM is only  useful for doing more stuff at once  like say audiovideo editing where you would need multiple large files loaded up at the same time.  in the same spirit some games require a lot of things to be loaded into RAM all at once in order to run.  Mostly games with a large world and lots of variables.  but even then  gb is usually enough and gb is more than enough.  If gaming is your aim what you need is a graphics card not RAM. graphics cards have their own memory thats dedicated purely to videographics rendering . Besides that unless you have a very recent gamingstyle motherboard with DDR RAM   you probably only have  slots.  So if you have  x gb sticks right now youll have no where to put  more sticks.   If you just want your computer to be faster in general in terms of navigation startup load times web browsing etc.   what you want is an SSD.  Having your operating system programs and games installed on an SSD instead of a traditional hard drive makes a huge noticeable difference in the speed of all that.   a significant CPU upgrade will give you similar performance increases but its much more expensive and more difficult to do and you need to make sure youre getting the right kind a compatible one that fits in the physical socket. and  youll need an appropriate cooler to go with it faster CPU means more heat to dissipate. hope that helps with your upgrade fever! ,computers,df6qu4x,2,t5_2qhm5
