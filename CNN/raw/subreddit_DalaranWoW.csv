3426077,0,t3_2zgl4z,Its pretty easy actually.On Curse you search the addon you want then go to Other Downloads.  It lists previous versions of the addon and it also shows which game version each was released on.Its a bit more tricky on Wow Interface as it doesnt list what game version the mods were released on.  You have to go by date.  Like Curse you search for the addon and then go Other Downloads.  .. was released on June nd  so youre looking for dates around there.  Cata content didnt start rolling out in preparation for release until October so you might find some versions released in July or August that might be good for wrath.  DBMs final .. release for example was released on on August th .Edit  I find Curses library to be somewhat larger though it prunes some abandoned andor outofdate projects.  WoW Interface appears to keep every single file ever uploaded though it has a somewhat smaller library to choose from.  You should be able to find all the big important addons on either site though there will be some exceptions.  DBM for example switched out projects on Curse sometime after Wrath and you wont find any versions older than late MoP.  Wow Interface on the other hand has it all the way back to ...Good luck hope this helps.,DalaranWoW,cpisqpg,3,t5_315hu

4965775,0,t1_cukgyot,Very rare?  Maybe if youre looking over the last year.  But over the last week the realm has been down virtually every day sometimes for  mins sometimes for  mins and sometimes for  hours.  No communication at all from the people in charge either so you just have to guess when youll be able to play again.  A large turn off.,DalaranWoW,cukh3b1,2,t5_315hu

6367890,0,t3_42v8v6,I would recommend sending an email to Dalaran.communityGMail.com The GMs in game dont deal with any donation issues and you will wait days just for them to tell you that. I had issues with donation points too spent mine for a cold weather flying and heirlooms and got everything EXCEPT the levels on my character for some reason. I have emailed them aswell but havent heard back. ,DalaranWoW,czdgjnk,1,t5_315hu
6636410,0,t3_46g1sw,They should definitily look into it. I send them a mail  days ago telling them about it if they didnt know already. Its a great opportunity to say the least and should be considered.,DalaranWoW,d05rfda,2,t5_315hu
6657930,0,t3_46sr0s,As Tarpor said basically. If youve come from Lordaeron then expect a difference in player base.If youve come from Ragnaros or the other realm then expect a smoother game experience.AV and Ioc only pop up when we organise it at the moment. The other BGs pop quite often. Its common to see  people in Wintergrasp between the two factions though. Which is one of the main reasons I left warmane myself.,DalaranWoW,d07zk8t,2,t5_315hu

9738925,0,t1_dadf2b0,So the last person in the chain of referals determines what level the others can be through RAF. The question can also be rewritten to is a character eligible to grant level to the referer if said character has been granted levels as well.Thanks for the answer kalvindeane. It helped a lot ,DalaranWoW,dadj9x2,1,t5_315hu
