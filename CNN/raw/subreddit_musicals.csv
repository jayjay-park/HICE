There are some great visual gags. The set pieces and dances are pretty minimalistic. I loved the blocking they did with Justin and Naomi moving back and forth from the narrator to the main set. The chorus of Justins friends are very entertaining for what theyre given to do as well. The actress who plays Naomi who I believe played Elphaba in the recent run of Wicked plays her role very sympathetically.

2659484,0,t1_cn5lsy4,Im not surprised. I only found out about it from his book Look I Made A Hat. It was pretty much a flop in all its incarnations and frankly does have a lot of problems. But thats because it never gained enough traction to be fixed.It was originally workshopped as Gold! but then it became Wise Guys with Nathan Lane and Victor Garber. It then became Bounce and finally Road ShowIts about brothers Addison and Wilson Mizner and while the two brothers were real people and a lot of the events in the show are based on true events the actual story is largely fictionalized. Addison and Wilson go to Alaska during a gold rush at their mothers urging to become rich. Wilson starts gambling and the two brothers split up. From then Addison tries to take a dignified path to success investing joining partnerships and after all that fails takes up architecture he needs a house to store all his souvenirs. Wilson meanwhile leads a fun filled life traveling from place to place having a grand old time and getting rich. When Addison and Wilson reconnect theres some understandable tension and then hijinks ensue.While it does have its problems the music is bouncy and its a lot of fun. Its a pretty clear cut comedy though it does have its serious moments. Originally it was presented as a vaudeville show with the brothers as two performers telling the stories of their lives to the audience but this device was dropped with Bounce. I highly recommend you give it a listen.,musicals,cn5q163,2,t5_2rntx

All the humor in the stage version seems a bit forced and the dialogue seems dumbed down to explain what is going on instead of just showing the story through the action. Also I miss Robert Duvalls take on Pulitzer and really dont like Pulitzers song in the stage version.,musicals,ddxcy3b,3,t5_2rntx
10862396,0,t3_5v65iy,Interesting concept although it seems like it has some cumbersome parts and if you arent a RENT fan or even if you are having  shoved in your face the whole game is a but offputting. I bet you could streamline it a bit add some components and have a hit on your hands.,musicals,de0do6c,2,t5_2rntx
11025658,0,t3_5x3yjg,Not to be that guy but why did you shorten An American in Paris to just American in Paris but keep How to Success in Business without Really Trying?I guess I am the only one who voted for Allegro lolAlso really triggers me seeing HMS Pinafore there its an Operetta. Same with The Pirates of Penzance.,musicals,dehqa1m,1,t5_2rntx

And I listened to Anything Goes again London studio recording thanks to the Listening Club thread.,musicals,dentohv,2,t5_2rntx

11356633,0,t3_622aak,I listened to Parade again for the first time in a while. I forgot how absolutely thrilling that musical is. I do wonder why its not more popular. I suppose the subject matter.And I listened to Falstaff earlier today which is not a musical but an opera by Verdi. His last opera and easily one of his best. Its based on Shakespeares The Merry Wives Of Windsor and may be one of the few operatic adaptations of plays that manages to be shorter than the play its adapting. Falstaff clocks in at under two hours and one musicologist called it something along the lines of an experiment in miniaturization. I could go on about it but I wont since this is a musicals sub.And the production of The Pirates Of Penzance that Im in goes up in a couple weeks so that music has been dominating my life lately.,musicals,dfj94v9,4,t5_2rntx
11387366,0,t1_dfmmtxh,Im not sure what else you wanted to see there. The plot point was over when Evan admitted what he had done. The Murphys didnt go public with that information because they saw the good in what happened out of it. Ok we couldve had that scene but it isnt their story and its pretty obvious to me. And that scene a  year later wasnt a happy ending. It was more melancholy for me. ,musicals,dfmqluc,2,t5_2rntx
