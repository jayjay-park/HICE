5668297,0,t3_3sr3qd,I couldnt figure out how to submit this post with the following text up top so Im posting it here in the commentsIve made a poll regarding the theme of the regiment based on the thread that was posted earlier. The options are Rome and Scifispace which were the ones suggested in the original thread. I omitted the suggested Byzantine theme because of the fact that the Byzantine Empire was just a later branch of the Roman Empire and out of the two the Rome comment had the most upvotes in the original thread.In interest of full disclosure I was the one who originally proposed the Rome theme.The poll will stay up throughout the weekend and the final tally on Monday will be the theme that we go with for the Regiment.Happy voting!MrInquisitor ,TheVioletRegiment,cwzphni,3,t5_3aqzv
