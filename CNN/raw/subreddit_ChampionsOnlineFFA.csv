7768997,0,t3_4loyfa,Its been a while since Ive played but Ive never seen that happen.  Are you sure you started the first quest?  Check your Journal maybe you had an inprogress quest.  IIRC the tutorial pretty much opens up one thing at a time so if you didnt finish the first quest the subsequent quests wont show up.,ChampionsOnlineFFA,d3p9tya,1,t5_2ssxi
