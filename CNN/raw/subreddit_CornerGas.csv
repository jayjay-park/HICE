848929,0,t1_ch07r1v,I think you missed the point Community is saying six seasons and a movie because they want six seasons of Community followed by a Community movie. Just any ol movie made by or starring people associated with Community just wont cut it. The same way that No Clue doesnt cut it for Six Seasons and a Movie for Corner Gas even if Brent Butt has made six seasons and a successful movie. ,CornerGas,ch0rzuv,1,t5_2sfij
