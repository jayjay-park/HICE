RES has only been tested and confirmed to work with those browsers that were considered stable at the time of the last RES release. Please be aware that most browsers silently update in the background so you could be using a later browser version than you realize.We offer support for the following browsers and versions. If you are experiencing issues and you are not using one of the following browser versions we recommend you downgrade your browser until an updated version of RES is releasedDesktop Browser Name | Browser Version|||||||||||Firefox | Chrome | Opera |  Safari |  . yAlthough using an unsupported browser version is not always the cause of problems it often is. Especially in the case of beta dev or nightly channel builds.

10536242,0,t3_51mxbk,Did someone have plans to resolve this ?It says problem is not in indexedDB since it is not db error.It can be long path length. For example this is path where db should be storedCUserszninjaAppDataRoamingMozillaFirefoxProfilesosatzic.defaultstoragedefaultmozextensionebffaeafabbbbdbddcaddonIdbbebafaedfbtemporaryaddonidbIt has  length it is ok to create all directories.When FF tries to create file for db or indexedDB lib tries whatever.Length will be too long for MAXPATH i think.Also I noticed that offline files and extensions do not have permissions in information page tab. Maybe that can cause the problem too.,RESissues,dd2ee3x,1,t5_2st3d

11789933,0,t1_dgw869b,You can try this Using Firefox profiles  In the second part it tells you how to launch a specific profile from a shortcut so you can have for example Firefox to launch by default with profile A while you can set Nightly by changing the target of the shortcut to launch with profile B. I hope I was clear enough.,RESissues,dgwfft5,1,t5_2st3d
