8228322,0,t1_d55xo9v,gtYou cannot get rid of it. Even babies are shown to be racist which means that it is not entirely learned. It will never be fixed.The more we purport this idea the more racism will continue and the more people will die. gtThe goal should be to figure how to limit racism so that it does lead to crime.Im assuming you mean so that it doesnt lead to crime. gtOtherwise there is a whole gamut of racism that is not a crime nor evil that should be left alone for example dating is very racist but that racism is not evil.What the hell are you talking about all racism is evil. We attempt to fix it all or it will grow back in full force.,BlackLivesMatter,d563hhb,6,t5_331mu

But if the differences between the two candidates arent vast enough then I would rather introduce a third candidate to build a movement. Because every four years we say The third party cant win. So we never invest in the third party. We never grow the third party. If they get  of the vote they can be in the debates. And if theyre in the debates now we can change the conversation.The most sensible thing in my opinion. If Clintons voter base starts to get scared of BLM make no mistake well be the next superpredators. Donald and Hillary are the same person in my book. They dont care about justice just about whats politically convenient.,BlackLivesMatter,d9cazah,5,t5_331mu
