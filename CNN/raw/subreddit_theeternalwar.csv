5472714,0,t3_356r6t,This looks very interesting and I should give a try ! The too powerful bribing technique wouldnt work any more as you can never bribe a capital so no more city bribing and you have to turn back to more conventional approaches tons of howies and engineers.As I remember splitting may only happens when a weaker civ takes the capital of a stronger one this makes it interesting as it results in a severe penalty for the supreme civ and tends to keep every one under eternal war. It is almost impossible to make sure nobody will take you any cities mainly because of possible spies nukes. So my first priority would be controlling the seas. I would also probably destroy all non coastal size  cities not much benefit compared to the cost to defend.I would probably stay under communism for a while until I have built enough spies no bribing but destroying walls barracks airports and port facilities should still be worth  shields and of course nuke plants.There is juste one issue with you hack. If you take someones else city there will be no palace there so I might still use bribing as a trap capture ones city let it empty wait the enemy has put many units there buy it let it empty again etc.. I wonder if that would work.But the best would probably building  spies nuke plants and  paratroopers and attack and conquer all cities in one turn. And then clean the now so polluted world.,theeternalwar,cwb6vl9,2,t5_2ua25
7218117,0,t3_4e84rs,Ive had that issue as well with other applications. It seems to be caused by an update to Apples application signatures. Old apps will still work but not by default. In order to allow apps with older signatures you will have to change some System Preferences.Try going to System Preferences gt Security amp Privacy. From there click the lock in the bottomleft corner. You will have to enter in an admin password to continue. The window is divided into two sections. In the bottom section Allow apps downloaded from  click the Anywhere option. This will allow apps with older signatures to open because your Mac will no longer verify the apps developer. Technically this makes your Mac less secure because apps with bad signatures can be opened in addition to apps with expired signatures.,theeternalwar,d1yn79i,3,t5_2ua25
8262604,0,t1_d56m13p,Dude love it. I agree about outclassing but always thought that Civ should have had a mechanism outside of winnertakeall tank on tank battles where units would not entirely destroy each other each turn but weaken,theeternalwar,d5adt3s,1,t5_2ua25
