10543226,0,t3_5qv6oc,I feel the same way about the guy getting punched just sort of yeah Im cool with that. As for how to debate people of his ilk I treat them like I do any college campus bible thumper completely ignoring them until they get in my face. Im fine with never having interaction with neonazis and bible thumpers but if they get up close I am more than willing to give them an earful. This gives me all the power in the argument as they came to me and Im under no obligation to give them my time. But thats not a perfect solution either as that just gives them more fuel to be louder or give them the false impression that well take their rhetoric sitting down. Whatever the solution is it probably doesnt involve masked assailants running around with closed fists.,the1janitor,dd36xmt,1,t5_2wkbg
