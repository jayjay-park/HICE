4075802,0,t3_379keb,StartTransmissionaudioFirstly I suggest going to rthworldpirates. We speak plain English over there which I think would help you get the gist of this multisubreddit universe quicker. Should you want to enter this game as I and most others did subscribe to the relevant subreddits rthebeach rthedesert rthworldpirates rthesilentforest et. al. and lurk for a while each subreddit has a culture and way of speaking that is very important. Here its the language of the Machines and the Medicine. Im fluent now but it took me a while to learn. My point is this follow the subs formatting style thats what makes this whole thing interesting.Immerse yourself and explore. The other Domains can help you understand this one particularly to a newcomer. Oh yeah one more thing once you try the Medicine that might be it for you its the single most addictive substance in the universe. Think very carefully before trying it. Good luck out there. I hope to see you working with us of the GPK and th but I certainly cant choose for you.EndTrans,seventhworldproblems,crkv8yl,6,t5_2smkr
