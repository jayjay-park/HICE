4041440,0,t1_crgfscm,I get what youre saying and I agree to an extent. This should be about the human lives being lost. That said I think its more likely that this campaign can impact sponsors and indirectly FIFA than the practices which as I understand it are pretty firmly entrenched in Qatar. And while I get that its not as lofty or awesome a goal as ending the slave labor in Qatar I dont think sending the message that a nation that treats immigrants that way cant host the biggest event in the world would be anything but good.,BoycottQatarWorldCup,crgydzo,2,t5_38ae8
