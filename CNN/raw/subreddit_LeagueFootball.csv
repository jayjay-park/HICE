We are founding members of the premiership and in our first season there finished th .Everyone around at the time can name most of the s faeuro cup teams of the top of their heads. We are the black sheep of the championship. Last season we got to th place with a team that cost about . This season our team cost us about the same and we are pegged for play offs again. Most of our transfers are free or from nonleague and we have a fantastic academy which has produced some of our best players so far. We are the only professional football team in Suffolk so we have a large following facilitated by our stadium which seats well over k people. We dont have a local Derby so to speak but our fiercest rivals are Norwich. Some say that the rivalry between the two clubs is the strongest of all. Man U fans go to school and work with Man City fans all the time. Liverpool and Everton fans could be living next door to each other. But because of the distance Ipswich and Norwich fans only meet x a year when Norwich isnt batting above their weight in the prem. Our owner Marcus Evans is British lives just down the road in London and stays out of the limelight. He lets the MD and the manager run the show most of the time and doesnt embarrass us on TV or frustrate us by being thousands of miles away. Its clear his agenda involves his passion for football as much as his business acumen. Plus we have a fantastic and loyal away following. Some of the most passionate loudest and loyal fans in the world. Almost every away game is a trek for a tractor boy and yet we regularly sell out the away stand at most clubs. You wont regret following Ipswich. ,LeagueFootball,cx0xs6i,1,t5_37962
