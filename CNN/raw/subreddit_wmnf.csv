10744975,0,t3_5tljnx,Looks amazing!  The view of Lonesome Lake from High Cannon is cool. Ive only seen that from below. Cannon was my first winter K too almost exactly a year ago. Just finished them all this year and winter is still my favorite time to hike. The smooth highways of packed snow free of rocks and roots are so much better to travel on and you often have the trail to yourself.  Great photos!,wmnf,ddo9gpp,2,t5_2t04q
