Ive been trying to access The Cover Project today and yesterday but its been giving me the same message as the one you posted. Thankfully I already downloaded the covers for the GCN games I need and I have some of the DS ones downloaded but I still need to access The Cover Project to get some GBA covers and some other DS covers.

7148003,0,t3_4dbz5n,This is my favorite game ever. There isnt a single game that Ive put in more hours of play. Not only was it completely ground breaking at the time but the game play was fun and the level design top notch. No other D Mario game has come close to delivering the complete package the way Mario  has.My favorite part of this game was the open feel the levels gave you. There were no time limits so you could explore every corner of every map and since the game didnt explicitly tell you where each star was exploration was usually the best way to find them. Each D Mario game since has progressively moved further and further from this concept. While the camera may be frustrating at time its easy to forgive it as a growing pain of moving Mario into the D realm. I hope one day Nintendo will return Mario to the formula that made Mario  such a success. For now Ill just keep replaying Mario . ,n64,d1qnkhc,7,t5_2s34r
7153326,0,t1_d1r36di,You sell games for coins. You ship the item to the buyer and once the buyer confirms the item arrived you get the coins. If they do not confirm and you provided tracking you get the coins after a week tracking shows it arrived. Then you buy other games with those coins. It use to be  coin  . Now  coin equals less than . and gamers took down forums so now it is a somewhat dead site. Not a lot of people sell or post games anymore and there are some users who are trying to sell their account with like  coins because they do not have anything to buy. Coins are worthless and everything now is in inflation. Example are games go for around  coins because there are too many coins in the system. Ive seen games go for  or  coins when its worth around  IRL. But back in the day N games were selling for like around  coins. I bought Ocarina of time for  coins DK  at  and others for less than  coins. I took advantage of the dying system basically after they allowed anything to be sold on the site the coins started to die. So i listed non game materials at an inflation price. Some sellers did not know about the inflation so they kept their coins at the low value thinking coins still had value. So I bought many games when they were still cheap. Now it is hard to find a cart at less than  coins. ,n64,d1r9fxq,1,t5_2s34r

7479217,0,t1_d2rjzfb,If you are doing a quick release and press you are missing out on so much of the boost capability! I struggled with finishing DKR for a very long time but once I finetuned the boost timing it made the game so much easier.The best way to think about the timing release just before the boost and dont press A again until right after you see the smoke rainbow or grey start coming out of the exhaust.Even if you mistime it and release too late giving you a purple boost instead of multicoloured you will gain a much bigger boost by releasing until the smoke comes out than if you did a quick release and press.I also use the blue balloons as soon as I get them as I find it too hard to control the kart with stacked boost but it comes down to personal preference I guess.Happy racing!,n64,d2scehc,5,t5_2s34r

But Im just saying there is always the potential in these kinds of adapters.I also later bought two Retrolink N USB controllers and both of them simply stopped working. I guess the boards in them got fried or something. They were light and felt cheaply made. Also the analog stick deadzone was not accurate but you can maybe change that in the emulator options. But anyway dont go with these both of mine died less than one year later. PCs started saying they were unrecognizable USB devices.EDIT check this review ,n64,d90urlf,1,t5_2s34r

9760866,0,t3_5abrit,I grew up with Goldeneye starting in the s and enjoyed it for so many years but I regret not playing Perfect Dark in the early s. I finally bought the game in  and was amazed by how fantastic the multiplayer is. I still think Perfect Dark is the best local multiplayer game of all time. I recommend unlocking all the guns and features of the multiplayer in order to take full advantage of it. Also learn the unique functions of each gun.It helps to use the glitch to easily unlock the multiplayer features. I still prefer PD  over the  version but it is a bit disappointing that you cant play with the Goldeneye weapons in PD version of multiplayer. In my opinion Perfect Dark has better weapons overall though.To this day Perfect Dark remains one of my favorite games of all time. It is probably top  for me.Also if you like drama and having fun then I highly recommend Mario Party . It is a great time of local multiplayer fun. If you play with friends or family members then fights may ensue but drama in my opinion is what Mario Party is all about. I have gotten several friends and family members pissed off at me over the years while playing this game. The randomness of the board events keep me coming back after all these years. By the way it is also fun playing against the computer players.In my opinion the N Mario Party games are far better than any of the other versions.I recommend playing with the bonus stars so you can try and test your performance overall.,n64,dag8tdh,2,t5_2s34r

10035614,0,t1_dbfmuhn,Nice! Clean them pins up and be sure they are completely dry before putting it back in the n. Its also possible that your cartridge slot in the console is a bit dirty too. Theres an easy way to clean that. Take a lintfree cloth and put some alcohol on it then wrap it around an old credit card. Insert it and take it back out a few times. Straight up and down so as to not bend the pins. Be sure to let this dry before powering everything back up as well!,n64,dbfo0uu,1,t5_2s34r

11204610,0,t3_5zwepd,Lukie Games is pretty good.They are basically liquidators. They dont buy their games one at a time from mom off the street. They have relationships with recycling facilities libraries etc.Disc based games are usually already in great condition or theyve been resurfaced. Their old resurfacing process wasnt perfect you can slightly make out it had been resurfaced but its great today. Their descriptions are pretty good. Ive gotten a few disc based games that were actually brand new factory sealed. Ive also had some stuff that wasnt perfect but not exactly trashed either. Ive used them hundreds of times and had maybe a hand full of issues. I think they sent me the wrong disc once inside the correct case. They gave me a refund no questions asked. ,n64,df2111x,1,t5_2s34r
11253490,0,t3_60k0an,You can mod either the console itself or the accessories controllers. Some options you have but are not limited to are Painting the controllers Console. Making the cartridge slot Universal for both JAPNA Carts if you dont have an Everdrive that is... Making the controllers Wireless have to forfeit the Rumble pak though so id only use it with any extra controllers you have Replacing the thumbstick with a Steel Stick once they become more readily available as well as replacing the start buttons same guy who makes Steel Sticks if you play Smash a lot. Changing the LED or putting more LEDs into the controllers. Miniing the console. Retro RGBing or HDMI Output for your console on your tv. ,n64,df7ke95,2,t5_2s34r
