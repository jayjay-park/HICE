149692,0,t3_1vsrpd,Dreamville tickets are usually first to go.  Like the Dreamville and Madness Pass day pass went probably the first few minutes probably faster since I couldnt get through for about  min and by then Dreamville was gone.Dreamville for the Global Journey went first also.In other words get your shit together before tickets go on sale on Feb  for Global Journey.,TomorrowWorld,cevhbgh,1,t5_2we8h

From the FAQs pageOnly people who have purchased a DreamVille Pass option will be able to reenter throughout the whole day.  Please note that entrance gates close at pm on Friday Saturday and Sunday.So once you enter the stage area you cant leave and come back unless you have a dreamville pass?Also when did the lineup come out last year?,TomorrowWorld,cf11yct,1,t5_2we8h

1253591,0,t1_ciaccaw,Believe it or not I agree with you. I dont want the same headliners as last year and Im happy with the headliners they have and will be spending a lot of time at the smaller stages. I also agree that its quality over quantity. BUT I bought my ticket in February expecting the festival and line up to be of similar size if not bigger than last year considering the price went up and it has gained popularity. The lineup as it stands now is not worth  IMO. This is a  festival. Its not that Im disappointed with the artists they have and I wont be selling my ticket. But if this is the full line up I will feel slightly cheated as this does NOT compare to last year and I doubt you could successfully argue that it does. ,TomorrowWorld,cian78g,7,t5_2we8h
1255409,0,t1_ciau4cp,Its not a matter of enjoying the line up as is. Its the principle of the matter. They set an expectation last year and furthered that expectation by increasing ticket prices. This line up does not meet said expectations which is why Im upset. The festival as it stands will be an amazing experience but isnt worth the price of admission if you ask me. Edit It isnt worth the price of admission that I paid back in February expecting something on the same scale of last year. Ill still be going this year and I will have a blast I promise you that. But if this really is it next year I wont be passing up on E Forest or EDCLV for TW like I did this year. ,TomorrowWorld,ciauk42,8,t5_2we8h

3020890,0,t1_cob2hyt,There were soooo many problems with theft last year but it was not only restricted to Dreamville and the parking area  Ive heard from dozens of people on here and the TomorrowWorld facebook group about a groupgroups of individuals who would surround people who were solo at stages dance around them for a few minutes then disappear a few minutes later when the individual would check their pocketpockets wallets and phones would be gone. My general rule of thumb for all festivals is if you cant leave it at your tent clothing food lawn chairs etc. or have it on your person wallet phone camera etc. you dont need to bring it. You dont need your iPad or a lap top or your fancy speaker. DO NOT LOCK YOUR TENT  a locked tent is like saying to the world I have valuables in here! Please leave them alone! Ruffians and vandals will be looking for those sorts of things and it will result in your tent being destroyed and you having no place to sleep. If you do have to keep something in your car put it in the trunk  most reports of theft with vehicles from last year that Ive personally seen someone left something in a seat which gave said ruffians and vandals a reason to break in. You should have no problem locking tour vehicle as long as you dont give someone a reason to break your window. The best advice I can give you is to get to know the neighbors around you that is the best defense you can have for your stuff. We met the people camping all the way around us complete  and it not only gives you a level of protection because the chances of someone being near at all times and calling out a suspicious stranger is higher but you also end up with awesome people to party with. If you are worried about valuables purchase a locker  Ive done it before and I felt like it was a waste of money because I used it so infrequently but some people love it. Invest in a solid backpack or fanny pack to keep with you at all times  NEVER PUT YOUR VALUABLES IN THE FRONT POCKET OF A BACKPACK! I actually caught a guy opening a girls backpack last year and he almost got her wallet  I get that its the easiest way to access your cash or phone but its just as easy for the thieves. If you are wearing shorts make sure you can snap them shut or zip them up pick pockets were notorious last year and any level of protection you can add the better  I personally think youre better off with a pack of some sort but to each their own. Hope this helps!,TomorrowWorld,cob42f6,1,t5_2we8h
3023888,0,t1_coakpsv,Thank you for your reply! I should have said I am new to JUST Tomorrowworld  not festivals in general. So I have the general jist or what to bring etc but I guess Im just curious what I need to know what would be different from other festivals.Thankfully I have always had a wagon and never had to deal with carrying all of my stuff when you cant camp by your car! You got there at am? I was wondering about that because some festivals give a time they let people in and some stick to that time and others dont.I generally last pretty well for long festies but I have never supplemented with vitamins etc. That is something I will have to look into.I was going through past posts about it and very disappointed to see so many negative comments about dreamville so that makes me nervous. I have VIP so that will be nice for charging my phone as well. I have heard a lot about theft and I always lock my tent and put locks on my camelbak but the vast amount of complaints about that subject is very sad. This trip is actually for my honeymoon because we did not want to do something traditional.,TomorrowWorld,cobf8ns,1,t5_2we8h

4536002,0,t1_ct1qb89,Im almost certain people staying in Dreamville arent allowed to enter the other camping areas but Id imagine they would let you visit the less expensive camping areas if you were staying in an EZ tent or lodge. Plus Im sure youd still be able to find people to party with in the other areas too thered just be fewer and youd have more room between you and them.  Edit Of course people in the other campsites can enter Dreamville The Gathering extra show on Thursday night only available to campers happens in Dreamville.,TomorrowWorld,ct2e871,1,t5_2we8h

It gets everything in one go I even unfolded the sides and used it as a camp table inside.

Uber partnered with TomorrowWorld last year and Uber received a ton of information about the event and they had extra drivers ready to go.We landed at the airport took a regular taxi to a nearby Walmart because Uber is not allowed to pick up at the airport and shopped for essentials like water bottlesgallons some snacks etc. We then ordered two Ubers for our group which picked us up at the Walmart parking lot. There was no surge pricing so we only paid the regular fare. We actually made good friends with each driver. One of my friends forgot his wallet in the Uber car and the Uber driver gave us his number and told us that shed go by and pick us up on the way back to the airport. Just so you know the Uber driver will drop you off at the Kiss and Ride location which is where youll hop into a charter bus thatll take you to the festival. ,TomorrowWorld,cutiywy,3,t5_2we8h
