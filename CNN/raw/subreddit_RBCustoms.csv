11170871,0,t1_dexeqhq,Its certainly possible for upgrading certain aspects of a song namely midi and .dta fixes. But that shouldnt be necessary because any changes that you make to a songs midi dta or album art can simply be dragged and dropped into the existing CON. The only things that require recompiling are when you change the lip sync or swap out single track audio for stems. Everything else that I said in my previous comment can just be baked into the CON directly.,RBCustoms,dey7fpr,1,t5_3jhud
