2229519,0,t3_2kojit,Oakland Tribune editorial California soda tax concept falls flatCalifornians obesity is costing the state an estimated  billion a year in health care and other expenses. But Carmel Sen. Bill Monnings proposed solution a soda tax has two big fat problems.Calories consumed from soft drinks account for less than half of the states obesity epidemic. Its an easy target but what about the makers of candy ice cream chips and other fattening foods? Why hit soda with a sin tax while others get off scotfree?Thats one reason Monnings bill SB fails the goodgovernment test. But theres a more subtle and arguably more serious flaw. The law might not discourage people from buying soft drinks at all.Monnings pennyanounce tax would be levied on soda distributors not on consumers at the cash register. The theory is that store owners who buy drinks from distributors would pass the extra cost directly to consumers but they wouldnt have to. They could just treat it as another cost of doing business and raise prices on everything in the store.The bill last week was placed on suspense file by the Senate Appropriations Committee effectively tabling it until next year. We hope by then better ideas for tackling the obesity challenge surface.Monning had the wrong solution but hes right about the problem. His legislation highlights some alarming facts about the overconsumption of soft drinks. It would generate . billion for nutritional education and healthy recreation programs.A  study by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research revealed that the average California teenager consumes  pounds of sugar a year just from soda consumption.Fortyone percent of California children drink one soda a day an amount that increases a childs chance of obesity by  percent. An astounding  percent consume three or more soft drinks a day.A  report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation predicted that obesityrelated health costs in California will increase by more than  percent by  if obesity rates continue on their current trajectories.The state has to rein in those costs and investing in nutrition education would help. But the problem is federal too. The government still subsidizes unhealthy food products such as corn syrup.Fighting obesity is more complex than the fight against smoking. Smoking even in moderation kills and increases health care costs and tobacco taxes directly affect only people using the product. Taxes on soda fast food or other fatty products  fettuccine Alfredo anyone? Some creamy bleu cheese dressing on that spinach bacon salad?  wont be as direct.We know high taxes on cigarettes reduce smoking. If California wants to tax soda fast food or other contributors to the obesity epidemic the Legislature needs to show that it will be both effective and fair. Monnings bill falls short of that standard.,BerkeleysNide,cln83vc,2,t5_2yrcp

However the law is specific to vehicles modified for human habitationsuch as the case with an RV or Class B vanI would argue that even this is only TECHNICALLY illegal and is almost never enforced.Michael Birdland Parayno had two RVs with people living in them parked out in front of his apartment building for several months last year with extension cords running across the sidewalk providing them power. They were clearly violating both the no habitation in house cars AND the  hour parking laws on a route that BPD regularly drives and they were never forced to move.,BerkeleysNide,cojlvw5,3,t5_2yrcp

And clearly some people post over and over again. In your quote the commenter could have used any number of civil expressions that would have said the same thing. Im still trying to get T.L.s term sstain out of my brain BTW.

10909883,0,t3_5vvrvl, Nearly a dozen officers were injured one officer hit with a bag of gravel sustained a dislocated shoulder. The next day local leaders sharply criticized the police for what activists termed a police riot. So on the second night of anarchy the department refrained from any crowdcontrol tactics such as skirmish lines that allegedly rile up protesters. The violence against civilians worsened including multiple assaults a robbery at gunpoint in the name of No Justice No Peace and shots fired at a homeowner trying to prevent damage to his backyard. Nevertheless the second night of riots was deemed a relative success from the police perspective because officers had not had to use force to protect themselves.,BerkeleysNide,de59zlr,1,t5_2yrcp
