6402805,0,t3_438v2o,IMO pretty much everything is poorly worded but thats to be expected from Comus...if i hadnt been playing games for so long id be pretty confused....on the topic of critical accuracy though im wondering if anyone else has noticed the following when it comes to special abilities....I have a hero with  crit and he crits about  of the time.  i have a different hero with  crit and he crits  of the time.  NEITHER HERO has any  crit traits active and none of the special abilities say anything about bonus crit .  Maybe my observation is just off but whats shown on the character info screen really doesnt seem to line up with my observations.,WonderTacticsRPG,czhfmyn,1,t5_3bzxs

6512210,0,t1_czsmtht,for some reason I cant really do much past B in the dungeons nor can I clear hard mode. Is this likely more a gear problem?,WonderTacticsRPG,czswvra,1,t5_3bzxs
6533225,0,t1_czutsrd,Even the rich players. How many legs are there? . So you get a  in  chance to pull the one you need. If ya can do the tower monthly and you get a  time shot a month  a year off the bat you only have about  chance of pulling what you need. Now really random will make it possible to land  of the same legs in a row and such so even longer.What they should do is offer to combine two crown angels to get a material to transcend legs imo. Without that how is one ever supposed to transcend them unless they get crazy lucky or spend uber cash? I have  legs my self so of course i would love to see something happen to make it seem possible to transcend them because right now i am not even planning on it the numbers just dont jive for me. ,WonderTacticsRPG,czv35ww,1,t5_3bzxs
6693897,0,t3_477xvb,I am in a similar position to you and have just progressed to B with around  win rate. You need ental for the dots. I use Ental fermata and a  strong nene. blue and black dragons at  for dps. My ental is not strong and always dies on wave  as does the  so its a dps race against the boss self heal at the end. Your mons look stronger than mine so you should do well. Experiment with your placement and see what works,WonderTacticsRPG,d0bph23,1,t5_3bzxs
6772027,0,t3_48gs95,I have a level  GS with last two traits unlocked nonawakened. If for nothing else he allows me to place in top  for nest. I placed  last week. I use a team of support while he is my main attacker. I use him at all of the bosses even Snow.  ,WonderTacticsRPG,d0jw36z,1,t5_3bzxs

7054839,0,t3_4c3nn6,Today was a good farming day i got Ramia my nd  Mate Oliver Strong Pepe Ice Giant Miho and other repeated heroes.I know Miho is a keeper what about the others?I was looking into Frost Wolf and i saw his awakening skill is he a keeper too? Thanks,WonderTacticsRPG,d1g0wxw,1,t5_3bzxs
7067091,0,t1_d1heo0x,Chasuu gave you great advice here! b mobs have the miho style trait that limits damage they receive. I first started on b with entalmiho and  dps but it took forever. Now i just use the same  dps as psuedo tanks and falcon awakenedfermata to do the actual damage. Only takes a minute or two now. Might be something you could work towards with feions bleed? ,WonderTacticsRPG,d1hf15v,1,t5_3bzxs
7164275,0,t1_d1shm58,Its a slow and steady team. I havent really timed it. So basically damage is from Miho burns Fenzy freeze buff Metal Giants trait that has a chance to make them bleed when they attack him and also some CRIT DMG after Falcon gets his sleep off.I can start a timer on my next run. I would guess maybe  mins.,WonderTacticsRPG,d1sicsh,1,t5_3bzxs

7473004,0,t3_4hmgx8,Try that lineupTraited Delo against SableMiho under him.Wingfred with  trait against Cresen.And probably Cheery  Fermata behind Miho.So your Goal will be killing a JeanneGrace with dots wait Dragon to revive and then start killing also you have to silence Grace by Wingfred nd skill so she cant heal. If your Delo cant survive Sable you have to silence both Grace and Sable by Wingfred which needs more luck and Cresen will be silenced on auto hit.I used almost that tactic to clear my first ToT so its working but youll need to make few tries and a bit of luck. ,WonderTacticsRPG,d2rmwtr,1,t5_3bzxs

7758789,0,t3_4ldr5c,Do you not have any Light or Dark units? Are you able to manual B?Running Ental Snowy and Cheon might be your best option.If youre able to complete Advanced Secret Dungeons you should work on summoning a Strong BebeNene or Judith. You could also use Tart for her revive and AoE.You also can just use some equips that dont match your heros traits until you get something that can if thats what youre worried about.,WonderTacticsRPG,d3o4575,1,t5_3bzxs

9073594,0,t1_d80bzkh,the only problem switching cheery and dag positions is their elements... Forest Dragon will receive more dmg from Fire dragon.Remember that Gingamous havent completed ToT yet. i dont think he has lvl  gems  for the Drag trait.,WonderTacticsRPG,d82hyyl,1,t5_3bzxs
9076255,0,t1_d7xmwt2,After some testing Ive found that Snowy actually lasts pretty long in Ancient Fortress B as the main tank. The group Im using is Jelos Dr Falcon SnowyLiena JeanneAbout a  success rate. Going to see if Jeane can tank after I unlock her accessories trait.,WonderTacticsRPG,d82thb8,1,t5_3bzxs
9153430,0,t3_54pxii,One thing Im seeing that I wanted to toss in here  if youre using Dina in B you do NOT want Falcon recovering the stun. Doing so will heal Dina potentially past the  threshold. If that happens he can be critted and killed.My personal B team is Falcon  Liena  Dinamis. No Light Or blue thing theyre not needed. Liena alone can rock the everloving shit out of B. If I can find a good way to do it I might try to work Sable in but would need a solid light tank to sit in front of her. And I dont think it would speed me up Autos between  and  depending on how stupid Liena gets.But yeah. If you have Dinamis Liena and Falcon you shouldnt run anything else. You want Liena to have as much of a chance to spam her attacks as possible.,WonderTacticsRPG,d8c9hp5,1,t5_3bzxs
