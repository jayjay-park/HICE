Ideally and were working on this and I know EFF and others are too we figure out ways people DO want to help out and be informed about whats happening like with either a mobile app or other notifications and to get your specific feedback about what you dont want to hear about and what you do want to hear about. As were trying to win on some of the biggest issues of the day that must be won and fought on we have to build a system and movement together so we hope youll help us do that by giving us ways that you do want to be in touch and pitch in with contacts to decisionmakers. ,ConciseIAmA,dfc973u,1,t5_3jana

11360372,0,t1_dfjoe34,TripleconWomen have historically been exempt  in fact the Finnish law on equality of the sexes specifically states that women being exempt from military service is not discrimination. The idea that women and men should be treated the same militarywise has only recently become even somewhat mainstream politics. Public opinion on the matter is mixed but I cant find a recent survey about it a conscriptionbased military is fairly popular though.This comment chain also had questions about JWs and land. Jehovahs Witnesses are exempt due to a dated law that grants any person who can prove that they are a Jehovahs Witness complete exemption even though JWs allow civilian service nowadays. As for land the islands form an autonomous demilitarized zone where native residents have special rights one of them being exemption from service unless a special law is enacted to enable service in certain civilian environments. Such a law has never been enacted so the people of land remain fully exempt though some choose to volunteer in the military.,ConciseIAmA,dfjoe3w,1,t5_3jana

Were also a little different from most organizations because our dogs live in homes with their handlers.
