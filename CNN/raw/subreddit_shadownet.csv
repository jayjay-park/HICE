Luin uses his polearm axehead to scrape off a bit of melted suit that was glowing green whether it was ectoplasm or a bit of radioactive spiritstuff he was thankful he had radiation shielding fitted into the suit. Was going to have to go in plainclothes to Wongs after soaking the suit in some radaway cleaner whatever corp makes the stuff makes a nice chunk of change in the barrens and whatever city folk come in to slum it. But at least the people on the farther outskirts of Glow City werent going to have any more issues with a low force radiation spirit assuming there wasnt a few more toxic mages somewhere in there again.

Gonna just lay it all out. A grain o truth out o the mess makes it worth it. We were out in Peru or somethin doing somethin for not nearly enough nuyen. Our guide botched it n we got pulled in. There was this weird station n some chummer. Chromedome got in his face but the old man had a hell of a voice. Gave us tickets n led us to this train. Showed us the yak offin some poor sods and then him offing himself. Somethin about not having a ticket.Took a while for us to get anywhere but eventually that sod from earlier told us to get out. Thats when we saw us. They were all messed up burnt as dreg n looking like they were comin out of hell. Took a bit for em to even say a word tellin us we didnt have any idea what was comin. Then we were in this jungle fraggin hot with this thing houndin us. Bullets did nothin but the yak did some finger wagglin n it ran off.After that we were in some warehouse. Hand of Five dregheads outside setting the place on fire. We dropped em n got a few out but then Lonestar showed up. Bit after that that whole business with the weirdoteam happened.

9843640,0,t3_5g9l4g,Puffin Strolled through the snow swept streets of Bellevue square. He was getting an early start on his Christmas shopping for his secret santa buddy as well as far more importantly his father. Dad loved fishing but it was always too cold for that this time of the year. He could get him some cold weather fishing gear or maybe a limited edition trid. Ah Mr. McCarthy good ta see ya again! hollered the female ork owner of the fishing shop. It was a shame Orks were moving out of Bellevue every day unable to get work or being unable to afford the luxury housing here. Fortunately for Hannah here there were always niches that the rich and powerful couldnt go without Connors father included and thus those involved would be spared poverty. Hey Hannah yknow how my dad loves fishing right? Anything I could get him so he can fight the cold? I think Ive got just the thing those old timers cant be told otherwise right? Might as well profit off it! She responds big toothy grin on her face. As she left for the back Connor thought more about what he liked and disliked about Bellevue. Sure he loved the rich lifestyle and the perks that came with it but after working in the Shadows for so long he was starting to see the inherent racism in how this part of town worked. He had his dream house sure but some people didnt get that just because of how they were born. Maybe hed volunteer at the shelter this year do some good old Mob charity work for the Finnigans. As Hannah rang him up Connor looked over the determined survivor that was Hannah now that he was though he noticed she was kinda cute...Puffin just pulled into his garage when his Caliban pinged. First job of the month and it was another charity job. Any other runner might have passed over the pittence of a payday being offered but like he said before the Mob loved doing charity work not to mention Puffin usually pulled off the job more smoothly when it was charity for some reason.

I could talk about people crying getting tears stuck to their face.But its just fucking cold.Turkish is standing in the street and he is fucking cold. He has adept magic to deal with this shit.And yet he remains fucking cold. He really should make his jogs short enough that maintain warmth doesnt wear off before hes done.Hes wearing a scarf now the first time this winter but he has a problem. His shades are fogging. Hes tried wiping them they fogged right up again. He tried to see through the fog but it made something thats already bad unbearable. He even tried taking the scarf off but it was just way too cold.The terrible truth is dawning on him.He needs to take off his shades.With trembling hands he reaches for his most prized possession. The first time he reaches for them he cant bring himself to do it but with an incredibly show of willpower he pulls them off and pockets them. He is immediately blinded by the sunlight but the worst part is the knowledge that he isnt wearing his shades.He moves quickly through the snow to get out of the cold and back to somewhere he can put his shades back on.Turkish quickening mage interning at the Metahuman Fund Money for PeopleStandard disclaimer Turkish is a quickening mage and quickening is in a word bullshit.

His team had been tasked with extracting a scientist from Renraku and they met with heavy resistance. The scientist herself managed to escape when a Red Samurai gunship fired upon the extraction vehicle.Although his team managed to evade the Samurai unfortunately the scientist managed to also escaped into the Barrens. Then she got captured by Haloweeners. This began a sided game of catandmouse and dog?. The Samurai were quite formidable in combat but their overall lack of social skills made them a bad fit for this type of rescue mission.In the end VanWinkles team was able to semisuccessfully recover the scientist or at least her head with all its augmentations.

Mr. Matsu Tsuruchi was shot tonight as he was waiting to enter. It seems that the incident was a misunderstanding and he was not the intended target of the attack. Eyewitness accounts suggest a Mercury Comet was seen fleeing the site of the shooting with a pair of men inside.Currently Knight Errant is keeping things under control and quiet until more information can be released out to the public. Things at Dantes dont seem to be letting up as the management has not said anything about closing down for a few hours after the incident instead making more area for their Matrix guests.ubdthrall,shadownet,df6zoeu,1,t5_2tkxj

He cant lose focus like that he cant search the world like he once did because hes getting to be an old man and hes got people to protect. Always people to protect but now he doesnt try to help anyone. Its futile and it does more harm than good. Jet. Exile. Angel. Mustang. Armo. That new face Booker who reminds him of who he might have been if he had found allies and the idealistic but dark Gilgamesh. He is thankful for them all in a way but theyre also liabilities. Burdens. Burdens he shoulders gratefully as he always has because he only has purpose when he is watching out for someone else when he is improving the karma of the world and trying to generate positive karma for himself for his next rebirth to do it all over again but hopefully better that time. Family though... Family isnt in the picture and hasnt been since very very long ago when he came out of the jungle to avenge his fathers death at the tender age of . Facing a fullgrown man should be a death sentence at that age but theres some truth to the fearturnedprejudice about orks and trolls. They are strong fast and develop a lot quicker than other metas so a child who was raised in the Amazon jungle and taught to wield a toolarge sword is a threat to any normal man. Of course Minuano nearly died that night and carries a massive disembowlment scar to show for it but the deed was done and that was the last thing related to family that ever occurred in his life. Just a series of people taking advantage of him and his abilities in different ways some horrible some as benign as asking him for a favor but always wanting his skills.So its time to have fun with them!

And then his comm comes up since he didnt set himself to Do Not Disturb or Mission Mode obstructing some of his orangetinted HUD a different telltale beeping signaling a mission is waiting.Well moren one way to test out a big gun...
