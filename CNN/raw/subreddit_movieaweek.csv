I have a hard time watching war movies but the psychological impact of these situations beforehand during and the aftermath fascinates me.I really liked the Josh HartnettEwan McGregor combination and it was cool seeing some actors in roles before they got their big break like Orlando Bloom Jeremy Piven and Tom Hardy. Also the soundtrack really stood out.,movieaweek,chthue9,1,t5_2t0r2
