9345595,0,t1_d90khda,Neat ship.  And if youve put together a whole thought process behind it even cooler.  When Ive doodled or built similar skyships in Minecraft I always try to work out specific reasons to make them look more shippy rather than a regression to the cigar shape that actually makes the most sense for an aerial vehicle.  Can you comment on that?,ImaginaryAirships,d90mdhx,4,t5_2ykk4
