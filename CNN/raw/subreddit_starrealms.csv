1762377,0,t1_ck1au4i,Sorry I didnt see where you were coming from i think needle is appealing enough for me and not because of how to combos with the higher cost cards its a really good card just not an insta pick,starrealms,ck1ayrj,1,t5_2zi8r
1815756,0,t1_ck6bc45,SolForge has this where you choose to play against randoms timed  minute timer or untimed and it works pretty well. Especially since you rarely want to play untimed against strangers anyway.,starrealms,ck7zc1b,1,t5_2zi8r
1946688,0,t1_cknrusn,I introduced it to one of the guys I supervise at work and now we daily play a match at lunchtime sometimes sneak an extra one  somewhere in the day. I have to resist the urge to challenge him to additional ones because were both supposed to be working.,starrealms,ckns0ws,1,t5_2zi8r
2971875,0,t3_2t75dc,By chance this came up in the live stream today. Dev answer its a design decision to automate draws in the app since otherwise the game is even more of a clickfest.,starrealms,co5x1fp,3,t5_2zi8r
3307557,0,t3_2y05zz,Just downloaded the mobile version. Has a place where you can punch in a code if you purchase off the web or you can just purchase it through Google play.Challenge me Elimelek,starrealms,cp5aeik,2,t5_2zi8r

5821617,0,t3_3uy03p,I would go for the Recycling Station. Id be more inclined to get the Space Station if there was a  or  cost card in the Trade Row that I want or want to deny from my opponent.,starrealms,cxiqm5d,4,t5_2zi8r

7149715,0,t1_d1qh6th,gt  If you make the other person discard you are almost always going to ruin their plan for the turn. Well its a matter of degree.  Discarding a viper or a scout rarely hurts that badly.  I find that even  discards dont consistently hurt a lot.,starrealms,d1qulyg,3,t5_2zi8r
7864350,0,t3_4mzecx,Everyone who plays Star Realms has a  win percentage. The game is highly HIGHLY luckbased. Just play them and win,starrealms,d400wnm,-2,t5_2zi8r
8134440,0,t1_d4u9eie,Just pledge at the highest tier now. You can always raise your pledge later. I hear that the spreadsheet of backers that Kickstarter sends out is ordered by pledge date so the sooner you pledge the sooner you get your cards.,starrealms,d4uduvn,1,t5_2zi8r
8666838,0,t3_4yl74q,I never let my opponent get Embassy Yacht if I can avoid it,starrealms,d6oz345,3,t5_2zi8r
10164147,0,t3_5lhe32,Nope. One each and as long as youve got at least one bigbox base or CW everything else is completely optional... its actually quite liberating being used to the LCG model as well. For all the money you save moving from a CCG to an LCG when you can buy allin to a card game for about  you feel like you MUST be missing something. p,starrealms,dbw5upe,4,t5_2zi8r
