7834679,0,t1_d3wbqzf,Its ok you can ask me questions  From what i hear it is very common to feel the side effects in the first few weeks of treatment and they should subside later.I quit cold turkey because i ran out of pills for a few days and since id wanted to quit for a while this felt like a good opportunity. In hindsight it was probablty not the best method. I didnt feel horrible like so many report but i had a very unstable few weeks and only felt back to normal  months later! But im depression free now despite thinking about the problems of life way more and feeling a bit anxious again. But nothing unmanageable.,zoloft,d3wop1p,1,t5_2x77y
