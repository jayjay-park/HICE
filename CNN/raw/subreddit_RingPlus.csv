5956582,0,t1_cxixulx,another option is to buy a sim card from ebay or amazon marketplace and ask the buyer to email you the ICCD number before they ship it.  Then you can sign up with ring with just your phone and wait for the sim card to arrive.,RingPlus,cy0fsvc,2,t5_30wyj

7251766,0,t3_4epirf, actually.  And yes each phone gets them separately.  They are not shared.  Check your IMEIs through  and make sure each phones will work.  Then do the port ins.As for SIM cards I suggest you get them before the flash promo begins.  I hear if you go to an apple store they will give you them for free.  I cant confirm that since Im an Android user but iPhone users have posted and said they were able to do that.  If not go to a Sprint store or Best Buy but youll have to buy them.  Remember R uses sprint towers so get Sprint sims.,RingPlus,d22h2iy,2,t5_30wyj

7739645,0,t3_4lbl5r,Looks like it wont based on the description...why wony an unlocked phone work? Does Ring Plus  Sprint require the phone to be locked to Sprints network?,RingPlus,d3lxwma,1,t5_30wyj
7958331,0,t1_d49c5nf,I am more worried about the laggy phone calls the terrible customer service and the fiascos involving the store. See the fathers day phone card order cancelled thread.I know people who could use your service but there is no way I can recommend you not after the idiocy Ive seen from RP.My biggest issue is the competing ephemeral plans that just sow upset among your users.One of the plans I had was SOLD with a  per month tethering add on. It took a month of complaining before the add on actually appeared and then it disappeared a month later. BUT I can show you the promo that nowhere says and I mean nowhere that the  per month tethering would go away.So now you have about  plans that offer pretty much the same service except for tethering. Some plans have no tethering for some its  per month some its  per month some its . a year and some its free.And no upgrades possible.How on earth as a customer of yours is this supposed to make me happy?And if you say its not its designed to make me subscribe to RP then ask yourself how on earth can I in good conscious recommend this to a friend so they can be jerked around by your policies.....And that doesnt even go into the fathers day sale phone fiasco. Do you have that working yet?,RingPlus,d4alay2,0,t5_30wyj

8547802,0,t1_d6a19qw,Coincidence  my wife has a Moto G rd gen and now she has no data at all after upgrading to Curie.By design none of these devices were made to work with Ring Plus. Yeah its Sprint but theres a whole lot of extra provisioning that Ring Plus does to route it through them first.Please open a support ticket maybe theyll realize it could be widespread.,RingPlus,d6a1pdf,1,t5_30wyj
8581592,0,t1_d6e1985,Mine about a year ago was  brand new for a  GB but Im sure you could get your hands on one a lot cheaper now. ,RingPlus,d6ea93i,1,t5_30wyj

9564238,0,t1_d9qztun,There is no current native app. All calls are dialed though the stock dialer that came with the phone. Go to social.ringplus.net and read the all the posts on latency problems. The crooked R executives are requiring users to use their new dialer app so they can collect data from R users phones and sell it to the highest bidder.,RingPlus,d9rzl5m,2,t5_30wyj

10617279,0,t3_5ry80u,Prepaid credits are typically nonrefundable but given that the service is shutting down its possible you could get it back on those grounds by filing a credit dispute. ,RingPlus,ddb3bob,7,t5_30wyj
10617937,0,t1_ddb5eud,Yea I was checking their stuff out and honestly think thats what I will switch since everything else that I have looked up are either prepaid or I have to buy a new phoneor Sim card altogether.,RingPlus,ddb5rnc,1,t5_30wyj
10618031,0,t1_ddb5tj6,I dont have service with Tello but it is my understanding from reading at RingPlus Social and on Reddit that you can mix plans and pay as you go as described. Someone please correct me if this is incorrect. ,RingPlus,ddb6482,1,t5_30wyj

10733873,0,t1_ddmk3kc,Oh please. I dont have time to spam. Im here to talk about what interests me and to feed my ego with upvotes. I think month prepaid is hardly that bad. Its as benign as prepaid contracts get. Also R subscribers preferences are irrelevant if the only business model they support is one thats unsustainable and unprofitable. If R subs are willing to shell out for topups and M subs I think theres significant overlap for their willingness to drop a Benjamin or two for a year of service. ,RingPlus,ddn4a1u,1,t5_30wyj
10733933,0,t3_5tk0b7,Attorneys dont work for free.  For class actions they only sue deep pockets.  No one is going to sue R for free since they arent a deep pocket.,RingPlus,ddn4i23,9,t5_30wyj
10786236,0,t1_ddsgibk,Thanks.GBminstext is the combined usage of all  of the phones.  lines a very low usage and two use about a GB each.Right now with Ting I think at the end I will be at about  dollars for  lines.  So about . per line or  so not too bad. If I can unlock maybe TPO Mint SIM and Tello sound pretty good.,RingPlus,ddsisxu,1,t5_30wyj
