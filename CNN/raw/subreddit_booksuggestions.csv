192856,0,t3_1wagko,They are written about a period of time in the s s? but Ray Bradburys Dandelion Wine and Something Wicked this Way Comes is what this request immediately made me think of. Both are suffused with this great warm nostalgia and are just excellent books.And more tangentially I think a lot of his and other American writers of the s and s scifi books are actually writing in support of parts of the midcentury U.S. culture and way of life while not shying away from its problems theres a spirit of thinking about progress rather than rejection of the culture.Another possibility is Saul Bellow. Although Mr. Sammlers Planet is the book most explicitly about defending traditional values it is an overwrought onthenose book that is frequently so obviously prejudiced that its annoying to read and I never finished it. But other books of his including Adventures of Augie March and Henderson the Rain King  which are not set up in opposition to the counterculture and which obviously acknowledge the faults of midcentury America are fantastic books that I highly recommend. Since Henderson takes place in Africa it might not be quite what you want but its a great book nonetheless.,booksuggestions,cf0en74,1,t5_2ryqe

The Barsetshire series take place in the country but he also wrote the Pallisers series about London.  One of his more well known standalone books is The Way We Live Now which is about a financial scandal in London.

449983,0,t3_1z6jl3,Depending on how adverse they are to the fantasy elements youre probably going to be looking in the urban fantasy and speculative fiction genres.   The difference is mostly this  urban fantasy mostly focuses on paranormal elements and plot lines with radical differences between reality and the books mythology. I.e alternate histories. They also are found more commonly in popular fiction than literary fiction. This doesnt mean theyre bad! The best ones are already listed below. Speculative fiction tends to be classified within literary fiction and the paranormal plot elements are more subtle or less dominating. Less alternate timelines and universes more character driven with mysterious happenings. Examples would be  A Discovery of Witches and A Map of Time or lots of things by Jose Saramago.   Magic realism as mentioned by several below would fall in here I think. ,booksuggestions,cfret6r,1,t5_2ryqe

952321,0,t3_250j25,You could always go the standard route  Enders Game Hunger Games Ready Player One  all of which are worthwhile reads.  But if you are an adventurous teen guy try some Vonnegut.  His books are short and probably available at your closest library.  Maybe start with Cats Cradle or Breakfast of Champions.  Or if you are an older or more mature teen grab one of Chuck Pahlaniuks books.  Or if you might like something Western grab Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry.  Or if you are a more patient reader anything by Cormac McCarthy.  If you like to laugh and appreciate indescribably delicious language usage pick up Catch by Joseph Heller or A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole.If you might like dark mysteries check out the Ripley series by Patricia Highsmith.

971174,0,t3_258djz,Since you say youre a mathscience guy I think I can help you out.  There are some great scifi novels that arent too difficult and stay fairly realistic considering the times in which they were written.Check out The Forever War by Joe Haldeman for a military space opera that deals in things like powered armor time dilation the psychological and sociological effects of war etc.  Its not very long and reads quick.If you like that I also recommend Robert Heinleins Starship Troopers.  Very similar to The Forever War which Haldeman wrote in response to Troopers.  Starship Troopers may be a little more dry by comparison but you might appreciate the more technical aspects of it.Also Dune.  For more reasons than I can mention here without a wall of text happening.  Rest assured if you can get into it it may be an acquired taste for some it will give you a LOT for your moneys worth.  And depending on how fast or often you read will get you through much of the summer.  Be very weary of the sequels though...Some others that come to mind  The ManKzin Wars a series of short stories set in the same universe by various science fiction authors.  Since there are so many writers it can seem a little unfocusedscattered but I think they are still worth a look.  The Kzinti is a fun fictional race to read about and the setting is very hard scifi and convincing.And if the setting doesnt alienate you it depends very heavily on readers having played the game in my experience you might look into the Battletech  Mechwarrior books just be prepared to look a lot of things up they reference from the tabletop games.  Same goes for the Warhammer  novels although those may be a little too out there for you.There are probably other books Im forgetting atm but hopefully I got things started.,booksuggestions,cheok7g,1,t5_2ryqe

Its a collection of short stories that mostly involve Yunior who is a Dominican that is high on machismo and ego and short on empathy for his various girls. The short story format allows for an exploration of the character at different points in his romantic life and like other Diaz works is filled with excellent lines such as reflecting upon a relationship with a woman who both affected him and his brother We never spoke again. A couple of years later I went away to college and I dont know where the fuck she went.

1426030,0,t3_2agvis,The Outlander series is my absolute favorite series and I recommend it all the time probably too much.  One of the key reasons this series is great is because it doesnt conform to any single genre.  The books are incredibly wellresearched historical fiction especially the later books that cover post WWII ss s Scotland and France then the revolutionary war.  There is a ton of historical medical information which is really interesting. Many people try to group them in the romance category but once you get past the beginningmiddle of the first book you realize how wonderful and real the relationships are. There is timetravel involved but its done in an interesting and kind of believable way. There is really something for almost everyone.   There are currently  books in the series and each book is very long.  There are many novellas and companion books that fit in with the main series and a spin off series about a character named Lord John.  In August Starz will be releasing a T.V. show based off of the series and it looks like it will be very well done.  There is a ton of material to get lost in for awhile.  I also highly recommend the audiobooks.  Davina Porter does a marvelous job with the narration.You might want to visit routlander.

A proud American and a pioneer of investigating a NWO agenda.  Its all documented in his book.

3709051,0,t1_cqez9vr,WW The Sleepwalkers How Europe Went to War in  by Christopher Clark  This book is about how the countries of Europe finally decided to finally go to war causing the First World War. It takes you minutebyminute through a narrative of the crisis at the Archdukes death the events preluding the war and assassination and eventually argues that the militancy and chronic problems of Europe at the time were major problems and factors that pushed Europe to war. It describes decades of European History prior to the first World War to show how Europes war mentality across all of the combatants not just Germany and AustriaHungary created the perfect climate for an eventual world war. Arguably one of the best reads out there for an understanding of European Politics behind the beginning and nature of World War  and one of my favorites on the subject. The Price of Glory Verdun  by Alistair Horne  The Battle of Verdun described in gruesome and touching detail. One of the most devastating and longest battles in history explained indepth with sympathy emotion and facts in mind. With Frenchmen on one side and Germans on the other the brutality and death of Trench Warfare reaches a climax in this battle. Verdun being the epitome of Trench Warfare is argued to key to understanding the First World War. A fantastic read. The Eastern Front  by Norman Stone  The Forgotten Front this book describes the entirety of the Eastern Front in intricate and intriguing detail the merciless war between Russia on one side and German AustriaHungary and even the Ottomans on the other. It argues that Russias loss is attributed to inefficiency rather than economic shortage. Seeing as how WW is commonly taught with the trench warfare Western Front in mind this front which was far from being Trench Warfare is incredibly fascinating and captivating and crucial to ones understanding of WW.WW To Lose a Battle France  by Alistair Horne  One of my favorite nonfiction books in true honesty. This book lays down the political and economic situations of both France and Germany before the second world war and then gives you literally a day by day narrative of the entirety of the Battle of France. The tragedy the despair the humility of Frances defeat explained and narrated fantastically. You will walk away from this amazing book with a new outlook on the Battle of France and realize that neither combatant France or Germany were perfect and how France was far from the pushover and the I Surrender! cliche of France will disappear when the problems of France are revealed. Blitzkrieg by Len Deighton  This book covers much of what To Lose a Battle covers chiefly the Battle of France. But while To Lose a Battle is a largely a narrative with Economic and Political point of views included Blitzkrieg is largely a military narrative of the battle. It focuses on the tactic of Blitzkrieg its implementations its use its definition its flaws its advantages how the Germans liked it and used it everything about it. It touches up on the Invasion of Poland and discusses the weapons of Germany and France interesting if youre into WW technology. A very good book imo. The Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer  Yeah yeah yeah no  nonfiction as it is a memoir. Yeah yeah yeah some people will tell you this book isnt  accurate. I would differ. This book is king among the countless of other memoir around when it comes to the Eastern Front of WW. Told from the perspective of a German Soldier from the GrossDeutschland an elite panzergrenadier division in the German Army you will learn the Eastern Front from the perspective of a normal orignal soldier. Its hard to understand the brutality of the Eastern Front without reading of a book of someone that spent almost  years there. The disintegration of the Wehrmact occurs before your eyes and the effects are seen in the narrative. An absolutely fantastic book highly reccommended. The Liberation Trilogy by Rick Atkinson  If there was ever a bible on the history of the Western contribution to the war effort in WW this is it. Told across three books the Liberation Trilogy discusses the war from the perspective of the Americans along with a view and input of the French and British. It begins with the Allied war in North Africa allied landings in Morocco and Algeria and the expulsion of the Axis powers from the continent. The second book deals with Sicily and Italy and the Allies bloody struggle to defeat the Germans there. The third books deals with DDay and the rest of the war up to the defeat of Germany in May . Highly reccommended as it is probably one of the best narrative of the entirety of the American and British contributions to the European Front of WW from  onwards.Those are just the books I personally own and have read. Other books that I personally have on my own wishlist and books that id reccomend based off of their reviews credibility and based on the good willed reccomendations from my friends and peers areWW Ring of Steel Germany and AustriaHungary in World War I by Alexander Watson The White War Life and Death on the Italian Front  by Mark Thompson The Great War in Africa  to  by Byron Farwell The Fall of the Ottomans The Great War in the Middle East by Eugene Rogan A Peoples Tragedy The Russian Revolution  by Orlando FigesWW Stalingrad The Fateful Siege  by Antony Beevor The Fall of Berlin  by Antony Beevor The Battle for Spain The Spanish Civil War  by Antony Beevor A Frozen Hell The RussoFinnish Winter War of  by William Trotter The Rising Sun The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire by John Toland The Coming of the Third Reich The Third Reich in Power and The Third Reich at War by Richard J. Evans  Special mention to these three as they are basically one of the definitive histories of the Germany as a whole throughout WW. If you want books focused on Germany and to give you an unfiltered new look on Germany and Nazis before during and after WW these are for you. The Liberator by Alex Kershaw With the Old Breed At Peleliu and Okinawa by E.B Sledge No Greater Ally The Untold History of Polands Forces by Kenneth K. Koskodan The Eagle Unbowed Poland and the Poles in WW by Halik Kochanski Tigers in the Mud by Otto CariusSpecial mention to Homage to Catalonia by George Orwell another memoir. If you want to know the tragic and turbulent knowledge of the crucial Spanish Civil War from the perspective of a volunteer the brilliance that is George Orwell will definately do the trick for you.,booksuggestions,cqf22jx,1,t5_2ryqe

Im always pleased to see younger generations wanting to learn about what came before them.The Normal Heart by Larry Kramer might interest you.  It was originally first published in the s and is a play.  There was an excellent film adaptation done last year by HBO as well.  Its about the AIDS crisis in New York during the s.Angels in America  another play but a great story.  Also has a great TV mini series adaptation as well from HBO.And the Band Played On by Randy Shilts  again about the early days of the AIDS crisis and the politics of what was happening at the time.  Also about the race to crack the genetic code of the virus by scientists.The Mayor of Castro Street The Life and Times of Harvey Milk by Randy Shilts  Harvey Milk played an important part in the LGBT rights movement in the late s in San Francisco.  Hes important to learn about.  There was a film from  called Milk starring Sean Penn that won  Oscars.  Also worth checking out.  There is a documentary from the s called The Life and Times of Harvey Milk.  May be tricky to get a hold of now so Milk would work it covers a lot of the same information.In terms of fiction one of my favorite gaythemed novels is Something Like Summer by Jay Bell  Its part of an ongoing series.  There are  now.  The first four are kind of the same story but told from different characters points of view kind of a unique way to approach.  The th and th are the same world but different characters with apparently some appearances from familiar faces from what Ive seen I havent read them yet.  This is technically a love story but its far from cheesy.  It starts with the two boys in high school and then spans  years as their relationship and their lives go up and down and in all sorts of directions.  I say this to everyone I recommend this book to that even though it was only  years I felt like I lived a lifetime with these characters.  So many emotions happiness heartbreak sadness and ups and downs.  Really great book. A Single Man by Christopher Isherwood  published originally in the s at a time when being homosexual was essentially a death sentence before the Stonewall Riots and the modern gay rights movement.  It was controversial because of its honest depiction of homosexuality.  The book didnt portray him as someone who is mentally ill or a deviant or a victim which was virtually unheard of.  Isherwood is a bit of gay pioneer and its worth looking into more of his books.  A Single Man was turned into an excellent film a few years ago directed by fashion designer Tom Ford.  Colin Firths performance earned him an Oscar nomination.You may also want to look up the poetry of Allen Ginsberg.  I know this is book suggestions but I would also recommend you maybe check out the documentary We Were Here if that looks like something that would interest you.  I think it might be on Netflix but Im not certain on that.  Its an incredibly powerful film youll cry your eyes out.If you want more actual novels let me know and Ill see if I can come up with something you wont find too cheesy.

5877703,0,t3_3vrhkp,Check out Rod Duncans trilogy The Fall of the GasLit Empire. Its an alternate history private eye story with a twist set in a reality where the Industrial Revolution never happened and scientific progress was heavily limited harshly punishing those dealing in such unseemly science. The protagonist has dual identities a skill taught to her by her ringmaster father all her life before he died in a debtors prison after helping her flee imminent enslavement.              What I like most about the writing is how precise it is detailing actions unlike anything Ive read before. Duncan doesnt take shortcuts in his plots for easy solutions. The protagonist was raised in a circus the daughter of a bulletcatcher and grew skilled at misdirection disguise and creating illusions that help her do the seemingly impossible throughout the books. Duncan describes her actions as she sets up her tricksillusionsmisdirections in such detail that you know the solutions she devises arent some deus ex machine bullshit that would never work in real life but carefully considered shockingly possible feats that this character could actually perform given her skill set.           How do you escape from the back of a wagon youve been locked into by a man taking you to be killed? How do you escape a cabin of prisoners when you are chained to the others with a metal ankle shackle? Its shocking how her feats are not impossible just improbable to even think of. Duncan breaks down Elizabeths actions during desperate liveordie situations in a way that takes you through the genesis and execution of her unique solutions until you recognize the appearance of magic. She is a bulletcatchers daughter and a character who is simultaneously strong as hell spirited clever and uniquely alone.          Great books if you like detective novels clever plots welldeveloped characters and tend to root for the underdog.,booksuggestions,cxq3kej,3,t5_2ryqe

No crazy dystopian fascistcommunist government.  A caste system that actually treats people according to their needs and doesnt alienate anyone involved.  The systems of power account for those who dont fit in and create communes for them to pursue their perfect world themselves.  Its all perfect...except absolutely horrifying from the outside looking in.  Thats what makes it in my mind the greatest dystopian novel ever written.  Its almost impossible to put into words what is wrong with this society but everything about it just oozes unease and wrongness.   Theres some obvious parts like when growing new people they condition their genetics to enjoy outdoor activities and sports so they can keep the economy running with consumer sports equipment but even then everyone is still happy.To anyone who believes there is an objective truth to the universe whether God causality or even just random chance the utopia presented in this book feels sleazy above all else.

Like the others have said Brandon Sandersons Mistborn series is excellent and has an amazing nottoocliche magic system. The Stormlight Archive is also great but only start the series if you want to bring untold years of pain and sorrow upon yourself in between the publishing of his books. Both series contain characters who actively seek new ways to use the magic system and they often become fixated on that goal.The other fantasy magic giant is Robert Jordan from whom Sanderson gets significant amounts of inspiration. I dont think there is a more welldeveloped complete thoughtout and simply interesting magic system out there. Characters in Jordans universe the Wheel of Time are constantly testing the supposed limits of their power.

I understand that Warbreaker will eventually have a sequel titled Nightblood which may explain how the particular item in question managed to find its way to Roshar in the hands of such a meaningful lore character no less. Im also intensely interested in the magic systems to the point where I envision hypothetical matchups between Mistborn and full Feruchemists against various orders of the Knights Radiant. Ive also determined that in a matchup where both sides have full access to their powers a generic Lord Ruler would curb stomp a God King. Compounding is some scary shit. I almost wish I hadnt discovered Sandersons works now. Ideally I would wait ten or twenty years so hed be in the last stages of the grand battle against Rayse which I believe should be pronounced as raze. Only pointing that out because a fellow cosmere nerd ik irl pronounces it Raysee. Ive also read Secret History and Im very interested in what ultimately happens to Kelsier.

9869194,0,t1_datt4i9,The Foundation Series was one of the first series I tackled when I started getting more into scifi. Before that Id only read Dune and some Ray Bradbury which I would hesitate to call scifi for a lot of his stuff. Foundation really doesnt fall into the hard science fiction category as much as many other novels would. The novel explores what the author calls psychohistory which comprises of history sociology and psychology. He doesnt delve too much into the specifics of this so dont worry about getting confused. The overall premise is fairly straight forward and it reads more like an action novel at some points. The part I struggled with the most is a lack of character development. Just one novel can span lifetimes and sometimes you are fast forwarded many many years into the future. That isnt to say there arent some very good and memorable characters in the novels because there are. It is more about how consequences in the present can affect the future and whether an individual can really have any impact on the future of events or not. If you are looking to follow a character closely through a novel or novels then this probably isnt a great choice. However the concepts and themes are great and this is definitely a must read in the science fiction genre in my opinion. ,booksuggestions,datz8x2,2,t5_2ryqe

He writes great monster books his Kaiju series might be something you like though if you are at all into military types taking on previously thought to be mythological creatures the first book is about the Hydra then youll like the Chess Team series as well.  Jeffrey Kafer does most of Robinsons audiobooks and I find him really enjoyable to listen to.  R.C. Bray does some as well and hes amazing.  If you havent listened to The Martian by Andy Weir I HIGHLY recommend it.  Bray also does the Black series by Russell Blake which is about a PI that you might enjoy since you liked the Dirk Gently.If you like overthetop non stop action then Matthew Reilly is the way to go.  Id start with Great Zoo of China Jurassic Park with Dragons or the Scarecrow series.  His stuff is WAY crazy action but I love all of it.  Sean Mangan does most of his audiobooks and hes another narrator I enjoy. Im a RPO fan and I havent found many books that are like in in the sense of Virtual Reality which was my favorite part about it.  Some good ones were Solarversia by Toby Downton and the This Game is Life series by Terry Schott.  I dunno about the audio for Solarversia but the Schotts were done by Luke Daniels who is enjoyable.Since you liked Penumbra I recommend The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon.  The audiobook is SUPER long so you may wanna try it by reading it first its not for everyone but is a fantastic book about books book.    Narrator wise Im a huge fan all the ones listed plus Jim Dale Harry Potter Night Circus amp more and Gildart Jackson.  If you like Urban Fantasy at all Gildart reads for the Alex Verus series by Benedict Jacka and those are enjoyable they are like the Dresden Files only better IMO but Im only on the nd Dresden and have read all the Verus.  Nick Podehl does a great job as well Ive listened to him on several romantic suspense books and he also brings the great The Name of the Wind to life.Hope something here stirs your interest.

One of the most influential writers in my life the man who essentially taught me to write was named Charles Nelson and he wrote a pioneering book about the Vietnam War called the Boys Who Pick Up the Bullets. He had long since fallen into poverty and poor health and was working a menial summer job alongside a bunch of college students many of whom were aspiring writers. Every day at lunch wed sit with him for  minutes having wolfed down our brown bag lunches in five minutes so we could get out to listen to him. He did not eat but subsisted on cigarettes and blood pressure medication. That summer he taught us how to write. He used Lonesome Dove as his textbook. And Charles was a very avant garde writer you wouldnt think hed choose a wildly popular American Western as his text. It was explained thusly There is not a word out of place in this book.And that was enough we believed.,booksuggestions,dfl9ir9,2,t5_2ryqe

11493146,0,t3_64127u,Does it have to be young adult fantasy? The Hollows by Kim Harrison arent a protagonist getting wisked away to a magical land but it is alternate reality. A witch a living vampire and a pixy living in a church. Its like the sookie stackhouse series where humans know about supernaturals but not near the romance. At All. Urban fantasy like Dresden.I love The Iron Druid Chronicles by Kevin Hearne. Millennia old druid looks  and runs an herbteaoccult shop in the Southwest. Has an Irish wolfhound Oberon whom he can communicate mind to mind with. This series changes formats somewhere around the  book. I enjoyed the change others did not.Neither of these are great literature but none of the books you listed would I call great literature so I think these are great! Unless you only wanted YA.

11715561,0,t3_674w26,Do you mean books without explicit sex scenes or books that have plots but also have sex scenes?  I have a few of the first type but I can also recommend some books with erotic scenes let me know.. A fun historical mystery series Cambridge Fellows by Charlie Cochrane.  No explicit sex there are always just metaphors sometimes theyre pretty funny.  Very British.  She has written some other very good historicals mostly set around WWI and a contemporary mystery series also.. I really like Tamara Allens books especially The Only Gold a historical romance set in the late s in NYC. Downtime is also excellent a timetravel romance.  Her books have sex scenes without a lot of details very strong character development and always an exciting mystery plot.  . Elliot Cooper is a newer author I really like.  His books are mostly scififantasy with a focus on the characters and theyre short but have fully developed plots all based on great concepts.  Junk Mage and The Clockwork Menagerie are both great and Hearts Alight is my fave so far.  Prince amp Pirate does have a sex scene.. Ginn Hales latest book MazeBorn Trouble is a clever scifi noirstyle mystery.  The romance is secondary to the plot and there is no explicit sex.,booksuggestions,dgnzkt9,5,t5_2ryqe
