163989,0,t3_1vwwph,well its a team game but their major problem is theyre extremely slow in transition. the defense doesnt know how to move the puck up the ice. the opponent has all the time they want to get back into position defensively. forward wise its tough as well. giroux voracek and read are the only ones who are any good at carrying the puck vs chip and chase although the chip and chase is doing well for the schenn line.conclusion we NEED a number  defenseman.,Flyers,cex3zxd,4,t5_2ribt

208917,0,t1_cf281e0,Guys can always shoot more. A ton of people were begging for Giroux to shoot more and he has over the last two seasons.

210949,0,t1_cf23lqm,Id really rather he play in the AHL to start at least. If he tears it up there then fair enough hes NHL ready but I want him to get some time in at the minors before jumping from the OHL to the NHL. ,Flyers,cf2gzpg,3,t5_2ribt
213908,0,t1_cf2shxk,gtI understand this idea...and there may be something to it but are we really saying theres no place for a physical defensive D man anymore? I dont think Im ready to accept that.I think it means that onedimensonal players are simply less valuable than allaround guys. Imagine the opposite situation a guy who is all offense but his defensive positioning is so poor that he constantly gets beaten and gives up shots. If hes giving up more chances against then he generates for then hes not worth it. Or with defensive dman if he cant suppress enough chances to make up for the lack of offense then hes not worth it.Its about being a netpositive contributor to shots and scoring chances. Because ultimately thats how you win games. There are different types of players that can be net positives on the ice. i.e. the Suter and Carle example different play styles but both manage to benefit their team.Obviously the ideal defender is good in all  zones and the elite guys like ProngerDoughtySubbanLidstrom fit that bill. Timonen would be one of those guys as well even though hes lost a stepThink back to when Pronger and Carle would run breakouts for the Flyers. How smooth the transition was between zones and how quickly we could counter attack. This team is missing that effective transition element in my opinion.gtIts not a teamwide issue? What are the stats for the other Flyers without Grossmann..are the Flyers adept at zone exits without him compared to other teams? Im going to guess its still an issue for them. I dont know if we have zone exit data for that. But we do have puck possession metrics. The Flyers are . better at controlling possession and shots with Grossmann off the ice. ,Flyers,cf2t4l0,1,t5_2ribt
216160,0,t3_1whqbv,Man. I love me some Nik Grossmann but these numbers are pretty damning. Im a big fan of his physical play and his net presence and felt like he was in fact our best defenseman up until January.

431899,0,t3_1z07e5,. I was at game  of the Stanley Cup Finals in . In overtime I can still hear those three shots we had go off the post before Patrick Kane put in a softie to end the game. Watching Chicago raise that cup made me almost cry. . Literally everything that happened in Lindross last season with us. I was only  but that year I got the best birthday present ever from my uncle who used to work at the FUC a signed Lindros jersey and was ecstatic as fuck. It was like a punch in the gut watching what happened to him what the Flyers organization did to him and the Flyers as a whole in the ECFs that year. . This isnt so much as a bad memory as a HUGE missed opportunity. I was at the Winter Classic in Philly and had just gotten a picture with Lindros who was sitting in the section over from us. I was wearing my Hextall jersey and as I sat down the guy behind me says hey you know Hexy is sitting further up in our section right? My jaw dropped and I turned around to look for him and saw him at the top of the stairs about to leavego down to the locker room I guess. I literally sprinted to catch up with him and did. Well as I get up to him and get his attention I say Im sorry to disturb you Mr. Hextall but Im a huge fan and just wanted the chance to meet you. He looked down at me in my  Jersey and the first thing he did was smile and say Hah nice jersey. At this point I was in such shock I completely forgot I was wearing it and barely managed out Woul...Would you sign it please? He said sure and asked if I had a pen......FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!! No pen . He said he was sorry shook my hand and said he had to be on his way. So yeah while this last one isnt bad its one of my worst because GOD DAMNIT! SO CLOSE!TLDR SON OF A BITCH!

623310,0,t3_21aa3n,Ok so I have a pretty big beef with a ton of the comments saying that we need to play like that the whole game why cant we have that pressure in the first period ect. ect.Do you understand how hockey works? The Kings did an outstanding job on the backforecheck.  They won battles on the boards and really pressured whoever had the puck.  That took away passing lanes that resulted in turnovers that disrupted our ToP.  This wasnt due to the Flyers playing poorly but rather the Kings strategy working because they were matching up better.LA hunkered down in the final  mins and played a very defensive game this allowed the Flyers to get a flurry of shots in the final minutes and after we  had an empty net with an extra shooter that allowed us to look crazy taking shots.  We could never have done that the whole game and anyone who thinks we could have doesnt understand hockey.Sorry but give credit where it is due Kings played an awesome game and we should be worried playing more physical teams in the playoffs like the kings bruins or rangers.side note I dont have much faith in emery anymore yes he faced a ton of shots but he didnt look great positionally. Also pretty sick of people who just downvote what they disagree with instead of adding to discussion. It seems in the past couple weeks more people have come on here and are only here to upvote pictures and funny comments I would appreciate an intelligent and hashed out conversation on the game.Edit deleted a character,Flyers,cgb4d03,36,t5_2ribt
623407,0,t1_cgb4d03,Losing faith in a goalie for one game is kinda silly. He played well and gave up one goal due to bad position. Hes not an allstar but hes a solid backup and does what we need him to do. Youre right that Kings hunkered down in the end but I think you underestimate the effect of desperation. They played those last  with nothing held back and nothing to lose. You cant expect any team in the league to play with that much energy like that for a whole game. It just isnt humanly possible. ,Flyers,cgb4rb3,4,t5_2ribt

679826,0,t1_cghjjjd,but these numbers dont exactly tell a few things. many times especially in a close game chief will put both giroux and hall out there for a defensive zone draw. they are our top  in faceoff  so if one fails to win the faceoff the other can step in. even if it was an offensive zone draw it hurts girouxs advanced stats playing on the th line for short bouts each game.he also kills penalties which doesnt come into play for corsi but once the team is back at even strength it does. many times after a penalty the team who was on the powerplay still has puck possession which again hurts your advanced stats.basically when giroux is not out there with voracek hes in a more defensive role. not taking anything away from voracek as hes my second favorite player on the team but these small things have an impact.,Flyers,cghjp0y,2,t5_2ribt

The difference is that Umberger can play multiple roles while Hartnell plays one role.Umberger had multiple  point seasons playing with nobody consistent and carried a bad team when they asked him to.  He had a down year last year after an injury had them shuffling him all over the place in a system that was being tooled on the fly while they tried to get Johansen a consistent partner.  His st half was great until he got hurt.  You can have Hartnell all day long but youre going to see his production lapse in Columbus and RJs go up here in Philly.

1523732,0,t3_2bmzc4,If you look at season by season comparison of Hartnell and Umbergers Corsi relative you can see Hartnell has consistently been a better possession player. I put the last two season in bold.Player | Corsi Rel | Season||Hartnell  |  .  |  Hartnell  |  .  |  Hartnell  |  .  |  Hartnell  |  .  |  Umberger  |  .  |  Hartnell  |  .  |  Hartnell  |  .  |  Umberger  |  .  |  Hartnell  |  .  |  Umberger  |  .  |  Umberger  |  .  |  Umberger  |  .  |  Umberger  |  .  |  Umberger  |  .  |  That major upturn probably has something to do with Giroux but as BillyInFourC pointed out in the WOWY charts Giroux actually has better possession numbers with Hartnell than without him. Its more than just Giroux. In the last  seasons Hartnells four most consistent linemates each year all had higher Corsi with Hartnell than without him.Player | Corsi with Hartnell | Corsi wo Hartnel||Giroux | . | .Voracek | . | .Schenn | . | .Simmonds | . | .Player | Corsi with Hartnell | Corsi wo Hartnel||Giroux | . | .Voracek | . | .Schenn | . | .Simmonds | . | .Player | Corsi with Hartnell | Corsi wo Hartnel||Giroux | . | .Jagr | . | .Read | . | .Voracek | . | .Conversely Umberger only has one teammate of his four most consistent linemates that he has made better over the last  seasons that was Ryan Johansen whom he only made better in  and  Johansen did take a slight step back when on the ice with Umberger this season.Some people may not want Hartnell or his contract but replacing him with a significantly inferior player over insignificant cap space seriously the Flyers only gain . more cap space having Umberger instead of Hartnell. Yeah the Flyers get him off the books faster but is it worth having worse player on your roster for three seasons for some extra cap space in ?

I just assumed Extra Skater was there forever but now us analytically oriented fans are in crisis mode.As for the stats themselves this doesnt seem too surprising outside of Voracek who had a much better possession season last year. Based on Couturiers style I think its reasonable to expect his Corsi to improve from last year CorsiRel .. What stands out is that the top line has been a possession disaster with all  forwards who have played on that line around . Tough for Giroux to do much when theyre hemmed in their own zone as they have been for much of their ice time so far. To get these possession numbers up to respectability the Flyers need some Dmen who can make an outlet pass and relieve pressure and MUCH less importantly they need to add a more fundamentally sound LW.,Flyers,cl7oyqi,3,t5_2ribt

2937579,0,t1_co1zmkl,Its something to do with the new CBA and cap recapture. Capgeek use to explain it all but now without capgeek I dont have a way to explain it since I dont know how it works myself.This is what I got from the rhockey wiki they still link to the capgeek site.gtIn order to punish teams for signing backdiving contracts under the terms of the  CBA the NHL implemented a cap advantage recapture rule in the  CBA. Backdiving contracts under the  CBA typically had extra years with low salaries tagged on at the end with the purpose of bringing down the contracts annual average salarycap hit. The theory was players would retire and never play those lowsalary years meaning the player would have received more salary than the team was actually charged against the salary cap. The cap advantage recapture rule effectively forces teams to pay back any cap advantage they received from these contracts should the player retire or defect from the NHL before his contract expires. If the player fulfills his contract in full there are no cap advantage recapture penalties. The  CBA states that any longterm contract  defined as seven years or more  entered into on or before Sept.   is eligible for cap advantage recapture if a team received a cap advantage from it at the time the player retires or defects from the NHL.,Flyers,co20kmy,1,t5_2ribt

2942201,0,t3_2tuq2t,Several random thoughtsI think were sellers at this point.  I mean should someone crazy fall into our laps we should go for it but Id think wed be interested in gaining cap space and draft picks over finding that LW for the top line or that D to secure our DLine.Might want to see if what it would cost to snag the Islanders st round pick from the Sabers.  Its their rd st rounder and it might be moveable if the price is right.While unpopular it might be worth checking interest on Streit.  Hes could be a pretty incredible rental to the right team and might pull a great return.Are the Avalanche participating?  If not thats sad.  Ryan OReilly possession numbers could mean hes the LW of our dreams if the price is right.  Id love to see him with ReadCoots as a second line.  Wed need the cap space for him.Might want to look at teams in cap hell.  Snagging Milan Lucics M for one year might be worth their st rounder.

5555725,0,t3_3r5zc7,The organization has made it pretty clear that he is going to be spending most if not the rest of his career in the press box. His only options and why they dont work. He could be traded. Its clear that nobody wants this guys contract. Homer signed him to a ridiculous deal that has made it impossible to move him. If his cap hit wasnt . million then maybe a team would grab him for depth but thats not the case. Only way he could be traded is if the Flyers eat a huge chunk of his contract. If he gets moved expect that to happen.. He could try and resolve his contract to sign somewhere that he could play. The sad truth hes not good. If he were to get another team to sign him as a UFA he wont be making as much money. He is getting paid . million cash in base salary this year.  mil when hes  years old. If he signed somewhere else they arent going to pay him much and they are going to want a flexible contract. Hes then at risk of being sent to the AHL to die. Personally I would be relaxing in the press box and cashing my paychecks on the regular just like him.. He could retire. This one would be the best for the organization. With the extra cap space Hextall could really speed up this mini rebuild. The problem once again goes back to Vinny not getting any money. He would be more likely to dissolve the contract then just retire. He gets nothing out of it. . His contract can be bought out. I dont know about this one. Homer has single handedly crippled this team by signing Vinny and AMac to these horrible contracts. Both are almost impossible to trade and both guys are going to stick around to collect money. From a numbers stand point buying them out is also a bad thing. Hextall has his hands full with this one. Im really happy we promoted Holmgren. He really helped this organizations future.Buyout BreakdownLecavalier would be owed  of his remaining salary . This means  with a base salary of  per the next  yearsMacDonald would be owed  of remaining salary . This means  with a base salary of  per the next  years!At least AMac can be hidden in the AHL. Plus the Flyers have money so its more of a cap issue then the unwillingness to pay them the money. . He can be a healthy scratch for the rest of his contract. This is self explanatory and what we are likely to see. Sorry for this being so long but in the end it comes down to money. I know that if I was making over  million dollars just to show up to practice and watch Flyers games I wouldnt be going anywhere. Only reason would be to get playing time somewhere else but thats not going to happen. ,Flyers,cwlqls0,6,t5_2ribt

5916179,0,t3_3wc5sy,Mike Richards and Jeff Carter were cornerstones to the Flyers and helped us reach the  Cup Finals. Both of whom were drafted by us in the first round in  Most stacked draft in history of the league  MIGHT turn out to be just as good. They were traded away after the  season due to a culture change as they were heavy on the partying as well as to get cap space to sign Mr. Universe himself Ilya Bryzgalov. These trades were made on the exact same day. Richards traded to LA for Simmonds and Schenn both unproven midline player projection and Carter was traded to Columbus for a st round pick   Couturier rd round pick  Cousins and Voracek. This changed the whole Flyers core of forward talent and was one of the most interesting offseasons I have seen.Another interesting and sad fact  Entry draft Flyers were the worst in the league by a wide margin which means have the best chance at  overall. That  was won by the Blackhawks due to the draft lottery system that player Patrick Kane....our  overall pick behind Kane was James Van Reimsdyk. Who was traded in the  offseason for Luke Schenn. The running joke is we got Luke Schenn instead of Patty Kane. Kane scored the stanley cup winning goal in OT against us in ...prompting me to cry uncontrollably.Random FactsOur D has always been crappyMason was underachieving on Columbus and we got him for nothingProspects in our system have never been this strong mainly D but Stolarz has been a great Goalie Season should be our first good run at the cup since By  Flyers SHOULD be a force in the league,Flyers,cxv55c8,9,t5_2ribt

6192614,0,t1_cytip9m,The CrosbyMalkin model in Pittsburgh isnt a really good one in my opinion. They are so top heavy. They have two real forward lines and like  defensemen a top end goalie and then a bunch of scrubs. Thats pinning a lot on having at least one of the two superstar centers not be injured or in a major slump. Sure its great when both are scoring and playing like two of the top five players on the league but when Crosby was sucking early this year the Penguins have been struggling.Signing Stamkos would probably give the Flyers another  goal scorer at least but it would cost them million and  years easily. I would rather they spend that kind of money on two free agent players who will score  each.

Manning would have to clear waivers so theyre better off keeping him as a healthy scratch or trading him off. AMac cant play in Hakstols system. Hes just so slow. We already have one slow anchor in Schultz so no need for a nd.

Player | TOI|Giroux  | Voracek | Simmonds | Crosby | Malkin | Kessel | I dont know what to say other than you are off base in your assessment of the lines. Girouxs line played a ton and every single player on our top line played more than any single member of the penguins forwards. If anything we were rolling lines LESS than the penguins.As far as Umberger he played  which accounted for the ABSOLUTE LEAST OF ANY PLAYER ON EITHER TEAM in any position besides back up goalies. ,Flyers,cz8aeck,4,t5_2ribt
6337090,0,t3_425p6y,The Flyers are going through the Igoudala era of the ers right now.  Good enough to compete on any given night.  Not bad enough to get a top  pick.  Not good enough to do any damage in the playoffs if they sneak in.Even with all the defensive prospects and the best case scenario is that theyre all legitimately playing well by  highly unlikely they have one forward prospects in the system.Cousins Fazleev etc can all pitch in but Konecny is the only bonafide potential star and Im not quite sure where he slides in with Simmonds and Voracek but being real RWs.  I know Jake has been playing the left recently.Not to mention Couturier is an important player but if his offense doesnt remain consistent Im not sure hes not your third line center and you need to find someone to fill in the C that can create and finish more.  Its going to be an interesting  months for this team and while everyone doesnt want the Flyers to spend any  theyre going to have to and were going to have to understand that all of those defensive prospects are unlikely to play together forever and definitely will not be all signed forever to play here.Have to eventually give something to get something.,Flyers,cz9ygp7,1,t5_2ribt

6353426,0,t3_42o5mp,Simmonds Giroux and Voracek are a great first line. Couturier Schenn and Raffl have been decent as a nd. Weal Laughton and Gagner would be a solid rd line. That leaves VV PEB and White as our th. Just keep Umberger out of the lineup. Who cares if he brings structure he isnt scoring hes slow as fuck and in todays NHL you need to have scoring potential with speed on all  lines to be a successful team. That and the fact our only good offensive defenseman right now is Ghost Streit and MDZ havent been offensively successful this year yet. Maybe when one of Provorov Sanheim and Ghost could be on the ice at all times thatll change. But for now its not working.Edit I forgot about Read.

TSN and Sportsnet Canada put a lot of their sports radio shows in podcast form the FULL shows not just  minute truncated versions.  While they talk about other sports too much of their content is about hockey.  I know TSN brings in Mckenzie and Dreger a few times a week to talk about the latest rumblings in the hockey world.  Hell just listening to Canadian sports radio jockeys talk sports in general is more enjoyable than Philly sports radio.

Before he would disappear for a few games or weeks at a time.I think it has to do with having a consistent position on the wing and only occasionally filling in at center.

The beat of the music you use will dictate everything in a piece like that. Make cuts on the beat and time action with the beat when possible. Like if simmer was landing punches on the beat it would be sick. Theres moments in the music like that quick stutter in the beat around  seconds. You can time those quick black flashes with that.

That being said I dont think Konecny will make the team this year and Im still not sold that Provorov will pass Hexys tests either.

9100310,0,t1_d85ktmi,Well theres a huge pedigree difference. Myers went undrafted and was a camp invite signing. He had one good year. Yes it was very good and at this point is rank him behind only Provorov. Not saying its a fluke and hes going to regress  I think he will continue to build on it. But to throw him in the NHL this year will probably be premature and Id be absolutely shocked if hexy didnt send him back. Provorov on the other hand has been very good for a long time and over the course of last year was better. He absolutely dominated a Many said he was NHL ready after last years draft. Yes Myers has looked good in camp but I certainly wouldnt say hes been much better than Provorov. And it comes down to space. I dont think theres any way Myers makes the team and Provorov doesnt. And frankly theres no way both of them make the team. ,Flyers,d85plmg,5,t5_2ribt

Imo Id rather take a chance on Morin and see his upside than roll out two pathetic players that ..according to their metrics..do not belong in the NHL. Sam is  years old. There are plenty if  year olds in the league. Its not THAT young. Hes  so clearly he can hang physically he just needs some fine tuning that he can do up here in the NHL. Personally I dont see too much of a risk in playing Morin over Nick Shultz Manning or Amac. Either way you see it..the fact is that those  guys are in the worst th percentile when it comes to defensemen in the NHL. They hurt the players around them. Talk about being gassed? Imagine how gassed ghost Gudas or streit will be from having to make up for their lackluster play. If you have players that bad..its time to bring in the youth and sit them the fuck down. Nick Shultz has better numbers than .  of NHL dmen. He needs to go. ,Flyers,d8id1oc,0,t5_2ribt

9291571,0,t3_57nuap,I UPDATED IT GUYS!!!Hello and Welcome to rflyers!On our Wiki page we have links to the history of the team as well as the histories of the players who have had their numbers retired.Bobby ClarkeBernie ParentBill BarberBarry AshbeeMark HoweForward ProspectsWe have a good number of Forward Prospects Travis Konecny is currently at the top of the list. He just made the team after a very strong training camp. He put up  points last year in the OHL and is expected to be on the second line with Voracek and Couturier. German Rubtsov was drafted this past year and his a way center over in the MHL the Russian version of the Canadian Juniors. He has been moved up to the KHL and while not receiving many minutes he has been starting to impress.  Oskar Lindblom is a goal scoring winger that also plays a decent way game. I personally do not know much about his because he is currently over in Sweden. He should be on the Phantoms next year I believe though.  Nicolas AubeKubel is in the same mold as Lindblom. A strong scorer with a viable way game. He is currently on the Phantoms this year in his first year of pros. He is expected to help lead the Phantoms to their first playoffs in many years. Pascal Laberge was drafted this past year. He is extremely quick and has hands to go with it. His is more of a playmaker then his is a scorer. Wade Allison is probably the best goal scorer in our prospect pool. The kid can shoot the puck. He put up  G  A in  games. He also has size being  and over lbs.Defensemen ProspectsOn Defense we have the following prospects Ivan Provorov just made the Flyers and is projected to be the future number  defensemen of the team. He has the best all around skills of all the defensive prospects we have. Last year he won Best Defensemen in all of Canadian Juniors. Travis Sanheim is behind Provorov but not by much. He in his own right could be a number  defensemen. He has more of an offensive game then Provorov has but isnt as great defensively. When it comes to coaching them. Sanheim is being placed on his off hand side which to me shows they plan to have a Sanheim and Provorov pairing as our top pairing in the future. Philippe Myers  came to the Flyers  Camp as an undrafted free agent and was almost instantly signed to an entry level contract. He rocketed up out prospect depth after the past year he had. Its amazing he went undraft after the point and the play he had this past year. Samual Morin is your typical defensive defensemen. Hes big I mean like HUGE the kid is  lbs and he doesnt skate like it at all. Hes a great skater for a guy his size and it a pretty good passer on top of that. Hes still raw but his work in the AHL has been great last year and is projected to be even better this year. He could even be a callup towards the end of the year. Robert Hgg is a player that has fallen down the depth chart year after year. He is your typical way defensemen and doesnt truly excel at any one area. Hes been struggling to find his play in the AHL but can still become a dependable th guy on the flyers if he finds his game. Mark Alt  is currently one of our shutdown defensemen on the Phantoms. Typically he is paired with Morin. His time with the organization is seemingly coming to an end after he was traded here during the lockout shortened season. He is like Robert Hagg in a way he is very sound in all aspects of the game. Doesnt truly excel or stand out in any one area. Goaltending ProspectsFor Goaltending we have  prospects in the systemAnthony Stolie Stolarz is currently our best goalie prospect. He stole the starting job from Jason Labarbra last year and ran with it. Butting up great numbers and was invited to be in the AHL AllStar game. He is project to be a backup next year to whoever wins a contract between Mason and Neuvirth. Alex Lyon is currently with Stolie in the AHL and they are projected to fight each other for the starting spot. He was signed out of Yale to a  year Entry Level Contract just for the first year to be burned off because he was signed before the start of the next contract season. That is how much the Flyers wanted him. In  games last year e went  with a GAA of . and a SV of .. Carter Hart was drafted this past draft and was the first goalie selected. He won  CHL Goaltender of the Year and had a  record.His GAA was . and his SV was .. I dont know much about the rest of the goalie prospects. But I know Felix Sandstrom has been talked about a lot in the blog circles as a future star.  Merrick MadsenMatej Tomek Ivan FedotovFor current players we haveClaude Giroux is our captain and our best player. He centers our top line and runs the st power play unit. Basically Giroux is the person our team runs though. If he isnt playing well the team is doing great. He is considered one of the best players in the world and has lead the team in scoring almost every year hes been on the Flyers. Hes won the Flyers MVP award  times in  years. He is also a great defensive player. He is one of the best faceoff men in the league. Jakub Voracek is basically seen as Girouxs partner in crime. He is the second best forward we have on this team and is probably the second best player on the team also. He has a slump last year after signing a massive contract but will most likely bounce back to form. Wayne Simmonds is our leading goal scorer finally being able to crack  goals this past year. Simmonds is probably the best net front presence in the league. He is also tough as nails. The Wayne Train loves standing in front of the net blocking the view of goalies and deflecting goals as they get shot in. He can also shoot the puck decent enough to score goals that way too. But he seems to prefer dirty goals. Sean Couturier is  years old and is seen as one of the best Defensive forwards in the game. He has future Selke trophy winner written all over him. He kills penalties on our top PK unit hes on our second Power Play unit and is our second line center. He goes up against the best players on the other team and usually gets the better of them. Brayden Schenn is a talented power forward and is finally starting to come into his own. He was once considered the best prospect not in the NHL. He broke out last year and started to become more consistent in putting up point. Hopefully he continues this year and makes that top line even better. Shayne Gostisbehere also known as Ghost was the talk of the NHL last year. He was called up to the Flyers after Mark Streit broke his penis and he set the NHL ablaze. He put together a  game point streak which broke Flyer and NHL records for rookie defensemen. He was robbed of the Calder Trophy last year for best rookie. Michael Del Zotto is considered our number  defensemen. After being bounced around early in his career before being traded from the Rangers to Nashville. After Nashville is contract wasnt kept by them and he was a UFA. The Flyers picked him up after Kimmo Timonen went down with Blood Clots and he has impressed since. He put up great scoring numbers while also reinventing his defensive game to become an all around defensemen. Our number  goalie is Steve Mason He use to be considered the worst goalie in the league when he played for the Blue Jackets but has found his form when he was traded to us and is considered one of the best goalies in the league. He has the second best numbers in the NHL only being Carey Price. Since coming to the Flyers he often drags the team kicking and screaming into the playoff race. In  he was the sole reason the Flyers went to game  against the Rangers. He kept us in theplayoff hunt the next year. And last year he again dragged the team into the wildcard spot playing every game in the last month and a half while Neuvirth was down with an injury. We also have Michal Neuvirth who some people say is our number . He had a strong season last year also. And we able to drag the Flyers to game  in the series against he caps. ,Flyers,d8trugg,4,t5_2ribt

9416125,0,t1_d99j5fa,Barely touching is still touching which by definition means it is not a jump.And are you arguing that its Kulikovs fault that Voracek isnt looking at him? There is no penalty for hitting an unsuspecting player like there is in football. Atleast not yet. It is ok as long as its within a reasonable amount of time after the playing of the puck and is lead with the appropriate body part contacting the appropriate body part of the opponent. It was within a second so the lateness isnt an issue. If you can get me a screen shot of his shoulder making initial contact with his head it would be greatly appreciated.  Because from the clearest angle his shoulder makes initial contact right where Voraceks right clavicle meets the breastbone. If a charge from that distance hit him directly to the head Voracek is suffering a concussion no question. ,Flyers,d99k5b2,1,t5_2ribt

A wrist shot from the blue line that is essentially a dump in since  times it is stopped counts against a player and states that it was bad play on their part.  MacDonald has been pinching players at the blue line of late and they fling weak shots on net.  If mac let the player enter and they cycled for  minutes waiting for the perfect shot but never end up shooting that would be better corsi wise than the weak dump in on goal.

Stop conflating.  If Mason came out and misplayed it sure you have a point.          Plus its not just that because I did say this    gt sums up Mason in a nutshell.          Its stuff like this     Drinking water instead of paying attention to play in front of the net could have been worse            Ive said in another commentgt Sometimes he looks dominant like RoyHasek other times he looks pedestrian  and I cant stand his mental lapses with easy goals from poor positioning sloppy glove play or lack of feel for the puck.,Flyers,dccta2d,0,t5_2ribt

Most shots barely made it through to the net because our D was constantly under pressure. I think this newfound defense first mentality is straining our defense because we rely so much on them for offensive chances. Its important to cycle back to the point when needed obviously but I dont think we should be using it as a crutch to sustain offensive zone pressure. I want to see more chances being generated around the slot area and the net.

10902008,0,t1_de4fc3g,I didnt downvote you. Im not saying changes dont need to be made but this team simply isnt talented enough to do the old dump the coach act just yet. Ive been very critical of the team this year but I just dont think this exclusively falls on Hak. This team hasnt regressed from last year because they should have never made the playoffs last year. They went on a tear toward the end of the season and snuck in and then were promptly taken out as expected. The team needs time to integrate the young players and as much as we love those guys its going to take time for this team to find rapport. Also theyre projected to finish around  points this year the same as last year. I find the lack of patience from fans extremely frustrating because I feel like I get into debates like this with increasing frequency. The  game win streak we had this year was a fluke. It was terrible too because it made people set unrealistic expectations for the rest of the season.We need a consistent goaltender. I dont care who it is but we need one. The MasonNeuvirth dance ends after this season and Im looking forward to that. We also need better defense. AMac Del Zotto Schultz and even Streit at this point they are rd pairing defenders at best. We have bad defense and our forwards have been pretty bad at backchecking this year something we also didnt do well last year.This is getting long so I think Ill stop there. Happy to continue discussing though because I think there are so many moving parts at this point that simply tossing Hak aside when he inherited such a mess is just too soon. ,Flyers,de4gqjx,1,t5_2ribt

The draft is how you get a top contender these days Toews and Kane as an example id rather watch the team lose the last  games than watch them win more and miss the playoffs and miss out on  or more cups like Chicago period ,Flyers,df15bvb,1,t5_2ribt

Both Mason and Neuvy have played  this year and no other coach in this league manages their goalies like that. He doesnt get it. Hes stuck in his college mindset of team management but the schedule is so much more strenuous than hes used to. Am I blowing Mason? No. I said nothing about his play. Am I shitting on Hak? Yes. Is it justified? To me yes because he has been borderline incompetent with his goalieand in some cases skater deployment throughout his entire tenure. ,Flyers,df1d4vd,1,t5_2ribt

11427824,0,t1_dfr51qo,i disagree. this season wouldve been so much different if we had a healthy GGhost had Flipy amp Weal all year. Also as of now we have  good defenders and one Solid one ghost provy Gudas. But now next year we will be adding more. Within ish years our Defense will be stacked. All our dman would be a top pairing Dman on any other team. I can see us making the playoffs next year and i cant wait. For everyone thats gunna say oh what if theyre busts well its possible but you gotta trust them. We can still trade some and lets recap. We called up  prospects so far Ghost Provy TK and were they busts? nope. they will only get better. Weal could be a  goal scorer and Coots doesnt have all the pressure. Not to mention everyone gets a fresh start and can make up for them selves everyone has an off year every once in a while. Not to mention that when the time is right well make some big trades and make a run and that time will be sooner then anyone expects. were lowkey about it let the pens caps  rags enjoy their glory of beating us now and let them laugh and say we dont have a prospect pool but little do those hardheaded fuckers know. the flyers are going to come out of nowhere and tear it up. and not to mention all the teams in the east are getting old Caps Pens Rags so this is perfect timing. Just think this team played hard until the last week of the season with a mediocre team so imagine what theyll do next year with a much better team. Overall yes well be contenders but i think well be in the playoffs next year and ive never been this confident about this team in my life.

It has everything to do with the fact that this season is over TK is a young skill player rounding out his first NHL season and needs to be playing with skill players. You really think putting him on the th line or reducing his time is going to help his development? After the last few weeks hes had as well? Seriously? I just cannot comprehend how people still defend Hak on crap like this.The only case you could maybe make for putting TK on the th line or reducing his ice time would be if we were fighting for a playoff spot and had been giving up a lot of goals. Hes obviously not great defensively so while Id disagree with Hakstol if he did this in this specific situation Id at least somewhat understand it.There is nothing I understand about benching him or reducing his ice time in a meaningless game. And please dont hit me with the well we dont know what is going on behind the scenes and maybe Hak is trying to teach him a lesson etc etc I am full white girl mode at this point I just cant even anymore.,Flyers,dfufi5r,10,t5_2ribt

11465053,0,t3_63gf9a,Im happy to see the flyers organizationally turned the corner and focusing on growing talent within the organization as much if not more than acquiring it. The prospects are spread out across all positions and were not just using them as trade bait.At the same time none of those prospects are a sure thing and we cant expect them all to be superstars. Its also naive to think other teams in our division are sitting complacent and dont have their own prospects they are high on.We have a lot of question marks around our core which are concerning. Our top two players are signed to monster contracts which neither has played up to. Secondary scoring has been very spotty and we lack a pure snipergoal scorer. Our coach has made some questionable personnel decisions all season and its TBD if he can actually develop young players at the NHL level. Our goaltending situation is very much up in the air and we may end up with a tandem comprised of a goalie who has shown flashes of brilliance but never able to stay healthy and a somewhat unproven rookie. Overall I think the organization is on the right track and we need to continue what were doing. If our core doesnt pick things up offensively were likely going to have to make some drastic personnel decisions to free up caproster space. ,Flyers,dfvk276,1,t5_2ribt
