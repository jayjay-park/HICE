7213487,0,t1_d1y2f5o,Thanks. I think this will turn out well. My point of view is that Buddhism doesnt need thought police to make people have faith in it. And unlike other religions honest investigation no matter how cynical ultimately reinforces the core teachings. And suppressing debate erodes Buddhism and allows idiots and conmen to control our communities.. ,buddhism1,d1y48jc,1,t5_3e5bg

7922077,0,t1_d3vgnp4,yea he threw a fit when a new set of mods took over and closed down his conversion threadover  pages long. then he went and created Vajracakra.after awhile they gained a majority again in the Moderation and reopened their conversion thread and left the Vajracakra forum.recently a well known Zen monk was on that forum and was banned for the crime of people not agreeing with him.the place is nothing but a sectarian cesspool where is you dont tow the party line of a certain sect you disappear for good.I had a friend named Jhoti on there she was a female from Taiwan and a teaching assistant to her monk...... yep banned for teaching authentic Chinese Buddhism....she might of used the word True Self a little to much as well as the word Chinese a little to much as well. but this is something you probably already know your head banner says it all.,buddhism1,d46ilkz,1,t5_3e5bg

10888444,0,t1_de2j7bl,I think youd better let me moderate your atheist forums for you so you godless bastards dont screw it up.An actual longtime practitioner with some actual training might do well though or even better a few from different backgrounds to balance each other out. Not that itd be easy to find such willing to moderate on reddit!,buddhism1,de32da4,1,t5_3e5bg
11026700,0,t3_5xbmkg,When you use the word emotions are you refering to afflictive emotions or are you including neutral things like contentment sleepiness etc.?Nirvana is a word for when the causes for rebirth cease it isnt defined by omniscience or truth though one way to nirvana is through wisdom about the insatisfactoriness of identity and experiences. Believing you have reached nirvana doesnt cease rebirth. Some people get really confused by tantric instructions on divine pride and think that if you just hypnotize yourself into thinking youre a Buddha that you are one and thats simply not how it works. Believing you are a Buddha alone doesnt give you the qualities of a Buddha especially when your concept of a Buddhas body speech and mind are wrong or incomplete. So the classical tantric teaching on this is that there was a monk that was meditating and believed he could fly completely and then jumped off a cliff breaking his legs. Divine pride is an instructionary tool to remind you how you should conduct your body speech and mind during life a meditation object and in the bardo it is something you use to leverage your karmas to ripen in a body that is conducive to reaching enlightenment or performing the activities of a Buddha. Its not a way to hypnotize yourself.,buddhism1,dehunzm,2,t5_3e5bg
11324092,0,t1_dfejvfw,You are quite welcome. Also be aware The comment below about  Kelsang Gyatso is true. They are agents of the Chinese govt. That is not to say that the people who frequent the center are bad. The foundation of his order sows descent between Buddhists and seeks to reframe the china Tibet debate. They are not lineage holders. While they might have good things to say their path is incomplete and cannot lead you towards Buddhahood. I welcome any further questions.,buddhism1,dffkfea,2,t5_3e5bg
