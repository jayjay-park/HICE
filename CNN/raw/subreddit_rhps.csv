2693141,0,t3_2qimjr,Hello! Just taking a minute to read the responses here and I agree with everything thats been said.Get to know your local cast  find out what their requirements are to join. Let them get to know you and see whether or not theyre the kind of people you want to be involved with. The cast may hold auditions or ask you to prepare a costume for whatever role you might want to perform in. Newbies are typically asked to start with lighting costume tech props merch etc. Do you have a skill or talent you could offer the cast? If theres a particular role youre going out for keep in mind how many people they have available for that role. If a cast has five regular Janets it might be hard to get in as a new Janet  but remember success is where preparation and opportunity meet. Our cast does a lot of conventions and roadshows so not everyone can always make every show due to schedules or travellingActing in Rocky Horror is absolutely a possible dream. You dont necessarily have to have to be professional to join a cast. Our cast has a mixture of stage actors screen actors and people with zero training. As long as you work hard enough at it Im sure its something that is entirely possible. It also helps to have some stage presence as well. Sometimes starting out doing a preshow or Trixie can help too if thats something you need to work on.Hope this can help! Definitely keep us posted on your progress! ,rhps,cna42p9,2,t5_2sa96

8546744,0,t1_d69nrke,I still think its a bad idea but Ill concede that new renditions of the song are a positive. Plus it might bring some new people to the original which is always good.,rhps,d69wxh0,7,t5_2sa96

9309474,0,t1_d8w199w,If Laverne wasnt a transgender individual I would have a far bigger problem with it. But knowing that Laverne is a member of the LGBT community the community that ROB himself made the show for makes it a nonissue. If a biological woman who identified as genderqueer was cast Id have no issue. People are active like Laverne is just some random woman like on the Glee episode and its so much deeper than that. ,rhps,d8w1l5y,2,t5_2sa96
9310705,0,t3_57ysp5,Because apparently Frank can create a man but cant give himself tits. ,rhps,d8w77vw,1,t5_2sa96
9311100,0,t3_57ysp5,There is no reason that Laverne shouldnt have been cast as Frankenfurter.  At the time the show was originally written Sweet T was a play on words a head fake.  In the context of the plot Transvestite is what you call a being from the planet Transexual.  If Frank was from Earth and went to the planet of Transexual the song would be Im a Sweet Earthling from Earth Milky Way. The characters of Frank Mags and Riff could be female or male or something we havent even thought of yet it doesnt really matter theyre aliens.  Does the song lose some cleverness?  Yes but after  years I think everyones in on the joke.,rhps,d8w90u4,2,t5_2sa96
