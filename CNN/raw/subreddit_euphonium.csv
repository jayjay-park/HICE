327929,0,t3_1xu7td,Euph solo lit will go down there all the time just because the compensating horn can. Plus they are usually larger in other dimensions. If youre going to be a serious euphoniumist well... as serious as you can be playing euphonium haha then a compensating horn is the norm. ,euphonium,cfere6p,11,t5_2sdqn

2066279,0,t3_2iie0z,I did the Philip Sparke concerto with a student brass band! I wanted to perform the piece on a recital but didnt like the way it sounded with piano accompaniment  it seemed to lack a lot of the excitement. It was a great experience putting it together even though the final performance was a bit rough. Thats a fun piece but very challenging for everyone involved  the soloist conductor and every brass player and percussionist on stage have some tricky stuff.,euphonium,cl2gxa0,2,t5_2sdqn

4500946,0,t3_3cq7yj,DCI alum here.  Ive seen plenty of woodwind players successfully make the transition to baritoneeuphonium.Getting your braces off in September should give you enough time to adjust before audition camps start up in November.  Depending on where youre looking to audition if you show up prepared and with the right mentality your initial playing ability isnt as important as you may think... Being able to hold the horn up will help!Ive never had braces so I cant tell you exactly what to expect but youll definitely have to relearn some muscle memory.  Dont allow yourself to be frustrated when the time comes.  Also developing a good sound on a brass instrument is more of a long drawnout marathon than a mad dash to the finish.  Overpracticing will only lead to you being burnt out.  Practice smart a little bit every day and think constantly about the sound youre producing.  Air flow air flow air flow.  Good luck!,euphonium,csxzxg3,1,t5_2sdqn

5711321,0,t3_3t8c8o,I have one and it suites my needs as a nonperforming hobbyist musician. The tuning is pretty good in the low register and the horn is freeblowing as far as I can tell however my high range isnt strong enough to say if the shakiness is me or the horn.FAb above the staff are pretty solid but after that the problems are definitely behind the mouthpiece.,euphonium,cx51mql,1,t5_2sdqn

8885312,0,t3_51tj13,Large or small shank? Its non compensating so Im going to assume its small shank though correct me if Im wrong. I imagine small shank euphoniums arent really designed to use anything larger than a D... Reminds me of using a  on a small shank trombone Pushed the tuning slide in all the way still very flat on everything. I think Ive had the same issue with using that  on some marching baritones and I think I actually had a friend who used a E and was never ever in tune. Go back to the D but look to get something bigger once you start using a large shank euphonium.Ive used a Schilke  on a Yamaha  and a Meinl Weston  and tuning wasnt an issue on either so try to upgrade to a large shank model as soon as you can. Small shank euphs arent really going to get a good dark tone anyway.,euphonium,d7fw0me,1,t5_2sdqn
