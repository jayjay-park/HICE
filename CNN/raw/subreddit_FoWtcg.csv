Youre presenting the option of choice except the choice is so obviously the wrong one that they shouldnt even consider it. Thats called false choice and inhibits depth of a scenario. The correct scenario would be you have a Gilles out and  will open. You declare attack step. They dont tap with branch you attack with Gilles they block.

Have not played MTG in some time though but hard to forget the rules.  gt Have another question though i have seen it said that First Strike ONLY apply s on the attack IE def summon with First strike does not get it.  That is correct there is always a first strike damage step but only the attackers get to use first strike.  gt And what about Peirce? It says when battle damage is calculated does that mean if i def with a summon with it any extra will go to my opponent? I know in MTG it was only on the attack but the wording here kinda makes it seem like both.    Same as magic Pierce only works when attacking.  gt And last one for now lol Can i declare a defender if my opponent picks a rested summon to attack to block it? Or only when im targeted?    Anytime an attack is declared the other player can choose to defend with resonator. gt Just trying to get as much straight as i can few locals are looking into starting to play regularly but being newer game still has a lot floating around in the rule regard.

DoJ is added to the chase.. Dreams of Juliet resolves blinking Mephistophles out and into play.. Nyarlathotep the Faceless God trigger resolves and you banish a resonator.Using DoJ to try to cancel something someone does is only useful when the thing youre trying to cancel specifically targets your resonator. You can use DoJ to remove that resonator from the field and conveniently replace it with another resonator just like it which just happens to not be the one they were going for. The guy they tried to Thunder isnt there anymore so nothing happens.Fun fact If they target Mephistophles with a removal spell like Stoning to Death Mephs  damage trigger is added to the chase.

5231632,0,t3_3mntog,So while I can go through and break down each question I think the easiest way to solve a lot of them is to start off by saying that any ability that triggers will go onto the chase before resolving.Continuous abilities are generally what the WTCX are. So they will trigger and go onto the chase once their condition is fulfilled. So if Abdul blanks them before the abilities would trigger they dont. But he cannot stop an ability already on the chase. So you have to use it preemptively. So yes Rezzard can be thundered before his ability resolves. Because the ability goes onto the chase.To our knowledge currently Stealth can be triggered the turn they are set this is not the same as standbys. So if they are set and the trigger is valid they you can activate them.That is correct so once they trigger they enter the chase as summon spells just from the standby zone. So if you are silenced you cannot trigger them. And they can be countered by Xeex.If it resolves then anything below  def is killed immediately by rules process they cannot do anything with them at that point. And his abilities effect everything on board yours and theirs.Yes you can its on the chase and both players have a chance to respond. So you can just unload your hand before it resolves. And in your scenario the other player does have a chance to also cast things before the Law would resolve but that is a valid line of play.If you have any other questions feel free to ask.,FoWtcg,cvglphv,1,t5_30zdk

For example lets say I wanna Jactivate Alice Valkirie but I chase for her ruler effect that lets me search for deep blue I pay what ever it asks me to.

5742616,0,t1_cx8tbpa,Gretel isnt useful if youre not running  Wind Stones which in most cases you wouldnt be with sylvia.Elvish is a possibility but Im more a fan of using the one slots for card advantage for a Red focused deck So Guinevere Rukh Egg and Familiar of Holy Wind are all solid options.Cthugha is for hyper aggro decks which if were playing with green were usually not going to go for that.In regards to your other question about running excalibur instead of laevateinn with Sylvia. I would probably ignore regalia altogether. In my Crimson Girl deck its nice as it adds the potential for me to quick flip crimson girl. In a Sylvia deck usually when you flip sylvia its because your trying to close out the game right there Laevateinn might still be the prefered regalia if you choose one just since it lets you sacrifice your board to add potentially an additional k reach onto your Jruler.But in Sylvia you dont need the Refarths or Laevateinns you could swap them out for other options like Fiethsings more ArtemisRapid Growth Maybe AmenoHabakiri.

5971388,0,t1_cy2bkqw,Heres the thing rulers are also breaking completely new ground. Even if theres history to learn from FoW has been doing a pretty good job of learning from it. Rulers are a completely new concept so of course there will be a lot of unexpected results with them.But theyre doing pretty good so far. The broken and stupid deck is very consistent sure. By this time in magics history around Urza block the best deck was generating  mana on turn  with Tolarian Academy. The power gap between the top decks and other decks is very insignificant compared to the massive power level of the cards seen in the best decks in early Magic.Even Jace the Mind Sculptor was printed just  years ago when planeswalkers were still a relatively new thing.

Same with RR you should have some wind in her costs somewhere there is no reason a wind ruler should play fire aggro better than a fire ruler. Its stupid.,FoWtcg,cykk2oc,6,t5_30zdk

I feel like the game is just too fast right now with so many on red deck win strats fairies and Val. I tried mono black vlad with shadows and if you dont get the perfect hand on the play theres almost no way to win.Now Im on Dark Alice with blazer in the board. My best results have been with main board bows scythes heras and most importantly flames of the outer world. Even if you cant get rid of imperishable I can usually crack back with the same or more damage from my Jruler.

When you get a Galahad with Protection of the Seraph and a couple of Glorias Castle Towns in there it does serious work. The weakness of the deck is that it has no tempo swings when you dont draw those cards. Your deck doesnt seem to have that problem because of Lilith and Lucifer though.

7015767,0,t3_4bq9ha,The problem here is that Memory of Flame isnt an instant card it is a Standby. To play a standby it has to meet the trigger conditions and is added to the chase when automatic abilities are added which is essentially immediately. The trigger for Memory of Flames is when you play and SpellChant or yadda yadda. You have to cast memory of Flame before doing any actions or passing priority after you play the spell you wish to target. It is only triggered when you play the spell. After that with priority passed the trigger is no longer met. If you wait to see if they cancel it you are out of luck. If it had read Trigger when you have a spell on the chase or something closer to that effect then it would work. ,FoWtcg,d1bl2yj,2,t5_30zdk
7045936,0,t3_4c45n6,. Heard about it online looked into it casually and decided to give it a try with the starters decks.  Had fun between me and a friend.  That happened about six months ago.. Stone system and mulligan system lead to very consistent games.  Along with the general design of the cards I found that every time I lost it could be easily traced back to a variety of mistakes in choices unlike similar card games where what you draw can just ruin you.. Probably Sacred Princess of Guidance or Falltgold the Dragoon  Rulers are pretty much the single most defining cards off the game and If ind these two to be very distinct and representative of the game and how it defines itself.. Cheaper if youre into anime art then the visuals are great and it allows for a directed yet creative approach to deck building between its rulers yet wide variety of cards and strategies.  Downsides?  Probably that its hard and there isnt a large community going yet so playing casually can be quite difficult.  You dont really luck out very often in this game.And yeah always glad to hear about this game being brought to a wider audience.,FoWtcg,d1f0jml,2,t5_30zdk

7227429,0,t1_d1z1xcz,gt Some people have indicated that FoW needs to try to increase the rarity of cards they know will be staples to drive prices up because higher prices are a sign of a more healthy card gameI think those people are being stupid. The relative cheapness of the game is a big selling point. Dont want to deal with the high prices of Magic? Then play Force of Will! Deliberately trying to change that is getting rid of what from what I can tell is a big reason the game is gaining popularity.I actually really like the fact that good cards are reasonably distributed among the various rarities compared to Magic where theyve just been bumping everything playable up towards Rare and Mythic Rare. Which ironically makes booster packs less appealing to me because while it may result in some individual cards being worth more it means youre less likely to open anything worthwhile in them.,FoWtcg,d1zpdng,1,t5_30zdk

Common and Uncommon can be Nonfoil or Foil Rare and Super Rare can be Nonfoil Foil and Stamped Full Art Rulers being able to be Foil Stamped or Uberin detail later. A God Pack contains either half of the Rares in the set or all of the Super Rares of the set or recently all of the JRulers and Regalia from the set which are Rares in foil. In the Twilight Wanderer one could obtain an Uber RulerJRuler which was monochrome and had a distinct color scheme. This was very hard to get and can sell for quite a bit similar to an MtG Expedition. Some have noticed a Secret Rare Ruler that is Full Art but contain art from a cosplay instead of the usual animeish art which I have no idea how rare it is but seems quite rare to come by almost like an alternate Uber. In the newest set coming out Super Rares can be Uber too were not sure what theyre called I think the King of Will called them Signed. Its an oddly colored card like an Uber but a lot more color and has the Artist signature stamped on as far as I understand.

9092048,0,t3_54s54t,Depends how you use them. I plan to play a Cthulhu deck at my state tournament this weekend and through testing Ive been able to beat both Turbo Fiethsing and Zero two decks I expect I will see a lot of with it. I feel like the biggest disadvantage they have is the rulers Nyarlathoteps ruler side effect is great but her JRuler side is awful since with a lousy  DEF shes pretty much guaranteed to killed almost as soon as she flips to the point where its really not even worth ever flipping her. Meanwhile YogSothoths JRuler side is amazing but he has no ruler side ability at all so if hes killed all he can do for the rest of the game is call stones. I dont think Limit is that much of an issue Yogs penalty for running out of counters is only  life and flipping back to ruler side which can actually be helpful in certain situations while Hastur and Niggurath in most cases will probably get destroyed before running out of counters anyway especially Niggurath with her ability to get goats and banish them for more counters. With Azathoth the game should definitely be over before he runs out of counters the bigger issue with him is keeping him safe from things like Zeros Magic Light Charlottes Water Transformation Magic or any kind of bounce. Personally I like making him untargetable with Class Gs Tank but Protection of the Seraph or cancel spells work too. And the number one enemy of Creature from Chaos is Artemis the Gods Bow so packing additionregalia destruction can alleviate that.I would say Nyarla is better for an aggro strategy while Yog is better for control keeping in mind that chances are its better to never flip Nyarla and you need to take a bit of extra caution when flipping Yog. Heres a couple more tips for Cthulhu decks in NF sorry Wanderer is a bit too overwhelming for me!Most obviously Demonflame and Urashima Taro are musthaves with Nyarla.Fairy Tale Library Alexandria is extremely useful especially if your ruler is Yog and not Nyarla. It also makes the Creature from ChaosBlood Covered War Axe combo way more viable since instead of playing Creature then having to wait a whole turn before you can equip the axe and attack which in that time your opponent will probably destroy the little guy you can play Creature attach the axe and wipe the board immediately.Fairy Tale Kingdom The Light Palace can recover Human resonators so because Yog Nyarla Hastur Niggurath and Azathoth are HumanCthulhu any of them can be recovered at the end of your turn. Add Dreams of Flight to give them flying and an extra boost for a turn or Protection of the Seraph to make resonators like Azathoth or Creature from Chaos untargetable and white becomes a surprisingly great support color for Cthulhu.Another option for keeping Creature from Chaos safe from Bows or Azathoth safe from bounces becoming a bear etc is Class Gs Tank. Play it for  and then keep  will open to make them untargetable whenever theyre in trouble.High Speed Dash is great card for decks focusing on Yog especially his ability to clear the field of resonators of a certain cost. You can either bounce him back to ruler side before he runs out of counters letting you keep your  life or bounce him back then flip him again for however many willcounters necessary to get rid of any pesky resonators i.e.  for Gwiber.Worried about running out of goats with Niggurath? Horn of Sacred Beasts and Call of the Primogenitor will keep them plentiful!Good luck with Cthulhu building and remember to do lots and LOTS of testing to see what works best!!

10648453,0,t3_5sdgcu,So....heres how I feel on netdecking in general.  Doesnt matter what game it is this will generally apply.When somebody is netdecking I dont mind.  Usually the reason somebody will netdeck is because theyre new to the game or just dont feel comfortable trying to build their own deck.  Thats perfectly reasonable to me because sometimes gamesespecially card games with thousands of cards can be incredibly complicated and difficult to understand.  Hell sometimes people do it because they dont have enough money to buy boosters at a time so they go the singles route and netdeck something so they can have something competitive.  Its what happens after theyve netdecked that you really get in to the nitty gritty of the situation. The first thing they might do is to continue to netdeck because they can win with the best deck at the time so theyll try to do that every time they play.  As long as theyre willing to admit it thats perfectly fine.  Hopefully theyll move on to making their own decks eventually.  Or at least trying to get some variety in their decks.  At the very least youll always have something meta to test new decks against.  As long as they arent trying to pass it off as this totally sick homebrew I came up with the other night then its fine. Another thing that can happen is that they decide they really enjoy that deck and they want to continue playing it but something doesnt quite feel right about it.  So they start tinkering with it.  Unfamiliar with the cards theyre trying to use they keep changing things over time.  Trying to figure out what works best.  This is the main reason I have no problems when I see people netdecking.  Theyre trying to learn they want something competitive enough to keep up with real players but also something thats fun.  Once they start getting the hang of it theyll start moving on to their own things. Theres really only one other thing that can happen here.  They decide they dont like the deck.  So instead of telling them Hey just keep playing it youll get it instead suggest having them play another deck.  Netdecking doesnt need to be a bad thing.  Sometimes its good to grab some decks from the internet that you just always have on you.  Learner decks.  Cheap decks that teach fundamentals of the game so that if people are interested you can help teach them.  This is technically netdecking but its also a great way to teach.  And if a deck is cheap enough I honestly wouldnt mind passing one off to somebody every now and then if they really enjoy it.  From there youll usually end up with those first two results I listed.As other people here have said its not just the deck that matters when you play.  If you dont know how to pilot a deck then youll never play well.  But you cant pilot a deck well if you dont know your deck.  So if you see somebody netdecking and looking like they dont know what theyre doing with it off some help.  They might be upset but it helps in the long run.  Teaching them why a deck is good and how it works not only makes the quality of games against that player go up but it also might cause them to start understanding how deck construction works.  What is good and what sort of cards go together.The only reason I dislike netdecking is when everybody netdecks the exact same thing.  Cause then its nothing but the same deck over and over again.  Youll see it happen when something is far and away the best deck in the meta.  And watchingplaying mirror matches over and over again is boring.  So thats when you come out with meta killers.  Decks specifically tailored to beat those decks.  Suddenly that becomes the new hotness then you start getting more people switching stuff up to adapt to that deck.  And now youve caused a meta to develop.See....it really does seem like netdecking is bad but it only lasts for a bit until people come out with the new hotness.  Not everybody will latch on to it though and thats when you get that variety.  Netdecking helps a lot of people.  Especially those people that cant afford to just buy cards randomly without knowing what theyre doing.tldr Netdecking is cool as long as they arent being dicks about it.,FoWtcg,ddeb0py,4,t5_30zdk

10817365,0,t3_5un80p,A bit of an old topic but now that more people are trying and making ascended Alisaris decks work I have a bit of a conflict regarding the fairness of such a situation.Namely that the ascension campaign was an incredibly limited offer that many people either could not complete or missed their chance to complete.I get that making exclusive cards exclusive is great from a collectors perspective but where this bothers me is the fact that the cards actually change in power level from their original printing.Personally I think the easy fix to this is to errata the original printing of these rulers to have the same functionality as the ascended versions though I suppose thats not fair to the people that gave up all of those cards for the ascension process either.I suppose its a nonissue as the only one were really talking about here is Alisaris and the RDE ruler we just saw in the spoilers kinda ruins Alisaris decks in general. However if one of these ascended rulers actually became a T deck I think it would have caused a huge problem for the FOW community.,FoWtcg,ddvqgx5,2,t5_30zdk

10882969,0,t3_5vgcix,On the appeal of Zero  First off shes awesome I mean just look at her okay maybe thats personal bias. Seriously though shes got decent rulerside abilities a cheap judgement cost and her jruler side is really difficult to remove especially if youve got her owl out on the field. Removing swiftness and flying is pretty huge for the current state of the game as most of the win conditions involve either cheap swiftness resonators or huge resonators with flying. Outside of her gameplay potential I think there just arent many of her available on the market for purchase so pulling one is a good find.Between Vin Vin and CFC Im not sure I can suggest much in the way of a deck as thats a pretty tight deckbuilding constraint. Adding the limited ruler pool to that makes it even more difficult for me to make any suggestions. Most of the Vin cards are useless Vin has some good cards but require rulers and cards you dont have to really get the most out of it and CFC has a lot of cards that support the L starters Fiethsing Millium Mercurius Lunya and Mikage most of which you dont have.As for deckbuilding sites we do have a few sites for building deck lists but theyre not easily searchable to see lists that others have made. Gachalog is probably the most common but I believe Tappedout also has a FOW deck builder. There was also CardGameRobot but last I checked the owner stopped updating the site so its missing most of the newer sets.My advice for building a deck would depend on how competitive youre trying to be and your willingness to buy singles to craft the deck.

Thatd also give you Seal of Wind and Light as a counterspellIts not really meta but it has potential. Elves are scattered across the meta lists but theyre in support roles. Valentina . LumiaHook and some others use Sacred Elf and Melfee as a ramp package and a few copies of the Fiethsing resonator as a combat trickweird blink effect. Fiethsing Turbo uses Fiethsing as a ruler and the elf tokens play into the deck but it doesnt actually run any other elf cards.,FoWtcg,de9l7fz,1,t5_30zdk

11254682,0,t1_df7o16y,You had the right idea in the first place actually but for the wrong reason. Lapis effect says cards with no specification about their location which automatically implies cards in the field. The hand is not part of the field and chants on the chase never actually enter the field and require cards that can target spells to be directly interacted with.,FoWtcg,df7p95u,1,t5_30zdk

11418534,0,t3_62z0xp,For the vast majority of matches unless either you or your opponent can finish the other off in the  turns you each have the game ends in a tie. Whoever had the most wins prior to that game wins the match. Life points arent considered when in time. The only exception to this as far as Im aware is in the top  in a GP where they dont want games ending in a tie.,FoWtcg,dfqa24m,3,t5_30zdk

11518196,0,t1_dg1kb21,Duplicates removed.  That said from what I understand Grimm and Alhamaat are both good choices.  The former lets you fetch up the tools you need as you need them the latter lets you squeeze out a bit more bang for your buck with ancient magic.  That said I havent played too much Wanderer Ive just played six sages back when they were in New Frontier.  You might want to see what other people say.,FoWtcg,dg1l7ug,1,t5_30zdk
11538818,0,t1_dg3ub0l,If youre just starting I would recommend the Fiethsing Starter Deck. It includes a playset of Sacred Elves and a Playset of Tamas and those cards are usable in all levels of competitiveness. Also the ruler for the deck has been a major contender in tournaments ever since she came out. Fiethsing is definitely an aggro choice though so if youd prefer a more controloriented start I would recommend the Mikage starter. He includes  Monkey Trapped in Life which have shown up in a few competitive decks. Also Mikage is GREAT for control play in my opinion at least.TlDR. st choice Fiethsing starter nd choice Mikage starter,FoWtcg,dg3xe3v,2,t5_30zdk
