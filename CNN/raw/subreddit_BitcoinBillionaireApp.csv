4812090,0,t1_cu138mh,Okay another question I understand the need for people to buy bits for you to generate income and of course thats good because then you continue to develop. What I dont understand and I cant imagine many people ever buying is the upgrading of offline earning. It doesnt make sense to me why they should be lost when you reinvest other then a cashgrab but even then I dont know the numbers but I cant imagine any player who understands the mechanics spending bits on it because itll just be lost within a few hours or days. Is there any discussion in the balance of making them permanent but possibly increasing the cost?,BitcoinBillionaireApp,cu13r1v,1,t5_33qox

4931074,0,t1_cufx8ny,OK looked over the achievements again. I think it was me.  It must have worked.  I think being unfamiliar with the new achievement pictures caused me confusion. I think I was expecting a check mark but it doesnt get one because it was not a level achievement.  So in summary no more late nights for me.   Sorry for the false alarm.,BitcoinBillionaireApp,cug3my5,1,t5_33qox
