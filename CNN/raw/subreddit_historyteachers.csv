1335128,0,t1_cijsk6w,Thats what its all about right? Spread the knowledge so everyone at the school is reasonably proficient at ed tech. Then everyone at the school begins sharing resources and tools. Thats the theory anyway but I realize that many teachers will simply refuse to take part in any technology whatsoever  lol,historyteachers,cijtgt8,1,t5_2t7s5

2872443,0,t3_2sun5d,The program I am hoping to get into is a Social Studies education course. Its got some history and some teaching classes but will place me in both a middle school and a high school for field experience  internships. This is what Im told to do only if I for sure want to teach History and not another career that would be better suited with a BA in history. ,historyteachers,cnuliwt,1,t5_2t7s5
3692137,0,t1_cqcpvik,Books are great  I read a ton of history historical fiction and alternative history and I use Goodreads to keep track of them all. Right now Im reading  by Eric Flint and Unfamiliar Fishes by Sarah Vowell. The downside about books though is that they take so long to be researched and published that they are not as cutting edge as shorter published writings. Often I find the end notes to be the most useful part of a book because it will give me a list of organizations authors and websites to track going forward. ,historyteachers,cqd4lx3,1,t5_2t7s5

10371100,0,t1_dcjcndt,Came to say this. Check out the website It has some great resources. I have the Big Six book and it is my bible. I also use the resources at the Critical Thinking Consortium  This is also Canadian so you might look more at the concepts than the content. Our curriculum in BC has just had a major revamp under the direction of the projects listed above. ,historyteachers,dcjmjun,1,t5_2t7s5

11479230,0,t3_63tn1j,A good practice for this is dilemma questions or scenarios. For example Im teaching the Cold War UK based school and will slip in activities such as Stalin has blockaded Berlin you can choose to either ab or c and they will have to provide positives and negatives for their decision.You often find that students will go for violence as the first thought until they analyse the consequences..Also try to have a fascinator at the beginning something thats going to hook the class for example a game of wink murder or something to show how difficult it was to fight against guerrilla warfare in the Vietnam War or a Vietcong underground trail made from tables ,historyteachers,dfx615t,3,t5_2t7s5

Social Studies was my favorite subject so I got certified for it.  Science and Special Ed are also areas Id like to certify in assuming education doesnt totally collapse in the near future.,historyteachers,dgp1tlr,4,t5_2t7s5
