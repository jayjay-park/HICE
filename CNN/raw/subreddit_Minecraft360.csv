Zombie Pigmen every second with the overworld farm I have now.  With a Smite IV  Looting III Diamond Sword took a while to get one that only had two enchants so it could actually be repaired reliably Im not too worried about gold income anymore but I am curious if there are any good farm designs for abovethebedrock Nether farms that work on the Xbox version?  Do you have a link to any tutorials or images of something youve built by any chance?    As for the Enderman farm its something I was considering for a while.  Given the limited size of The End I felt like Id have to set up water on all of the surface and it seemed like a large enough build just in preparation time and resource gathering that Ive been putting it off until finishing my other large projects which means it could happen now if I can find a good design.  I have seen some interesting mini designs that would work on the Xbox version but havent seen any larger designs that have been testedbuilt there.

Your age doesnt matter as long as you dont scream complain or spout nonsenseprofanitiesidiotic comments. It repels other players and has put a damper on previous minigame nights. The given time is volatile and subject to change based on your availability so dont fret to comment what times you could be available. Were aiming for sometime around  am CST on Saturday the th of February. The prize for winning is the ability to choose what game is played next.

Just copy the worlds from the  to a flash drive then plug the flash drive into your computer load it with Horizon find them in the list and copy them to the computer.
