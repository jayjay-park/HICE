Either your list of words in Harry Potter ordered by appearance is pure facts and infringes by being an unlicensed reproduction of the work or its a new creative work in which case it infringes by being an unlicensed derivative work. In either case J. K. Rowling could pursue it and would have a good chance of prevailing against you in court.Excerpting a small portion of a copyrighted work  the first few entries of Rolling Stones list a phrase or two from Harry Potter whatever  may be fair use depending on the context in which you use the excerpt.

8999941,0,t1_d7so61f,Pick an undergrad subject that you like and can do well in  thats really all there is to it!  Law schools in Canada tend to focus far more on grades than in what you majored in.  To the extent that they do look at what you studied having a diverse class is also part of the equation they dont want a class with only poli sci students!  I know people who majored in music engineering journalism history film studies...you name it.  Unless you want to go into intellectual property law where having an undergrad in the sciences or engineering is specifically valuable any other major really only prepares you in the sense that it can rule out or rule in an interest for you.
