55823,0,t1_cekrtd6,Im not sure how this interface makes having everything all in one tree an advantage. If anything it seems a lot clunkier than any onepane outliner Ive used and it doesnt seem to have any real advantage over them. Am I missing something?,gtd,ceksa8k,2,t5_2qhck
266286,0,t1_cf7kwbm,Totally serious consider moving. In the Bay Area and New York data science is hot hot hot. As much as I hate to say it being a Michigan grad there is a lot of hadoop and big data research going down at OSU and that sort of experience is in high demand. Also closer to home for you if you know or can learn to use Hadoop to solve data science problems you can find a job at lots of healthcareretailfinancial companies that have lots of data and are just learning how to mine it.,gtd,cf8czhp,2,t5_2qhck

7424360,0,t1_d2ls6om,Absolutely. Some mail clients have this enabled. When you click Share or often the icon looks like a square with an arrow sticking straight up out of it you will get this screen. You can then select the OmniFocus icon to send the message to OF that way.It may be hidden by default so here are some instructions on how to do it.,gtd,d2m3nmu,1,t5_2qhck

8328484,0,t3_4tn0zp,A text editor. Then one that came with your computers operating system will work but Atom is free cross platform and scriptable. It has a few plugins to help you manage your tasks  GPD and undone and one called tasksEmacs and the orgmode plugin are even better but have a much steeper learning curve.Onenote has some interesting tag summary features you could build a GTD workflow around. It would take some effort but its doable.Remember the GTD system is a system of thoughtsactionsprocesses for you if youre following the processes a piece of paper works as a GTD tool. The various bits of software that get used can help with some of the workflow but anything that can emulate a piece of paper is something you can use to do GTD,gtd,d5im6aw,4,t5_2qhck
8388343,0,t1_d5q2s59,Yes I remember the setting looked for the topmost NEXT or whatever keyword you choose. If there are a few DONE tasks above it that still works.I synchronized work and home computer by having all the .org files in a Dropbox folder. I never used a phone or tablet for org. But there is orgmode for android.. thats the only one I know of.,gtd,d5q39o3,1,t5_2qhck
9705255,0,t3_5e355c,Omnifocus is great and adheres to the GTD methodology although it requires Apple devices. Asana works well for groups but doesnt have the context view GTD uses. ,gtd,da9dpv4,4,t5_2qhck
10147883,0,t3_5ki9vq,I keep everything in the same system. I think its fine unless your work stuff is very very sensitive etc. If you use for example Omnifocus you can use it without sync to the cloud and your stuff would be  in your control. ,gtd,dbu9so5,1,t5_2qhck
10219592,0,t1_dc2dxa3,Looks interesting but it doesnt seem possible to enter info into the calendar on their app and have it sync with Gcal.  Is there a way to do this?  ,gtd,dc2g5fs,1,t5_2qhck
10572437,0,t1_dd6dawv,Is there a reason your mustdo work tasks is not in your gtd setup? I do the weekly review but each morning do a mini review when getting into work to ensure that the priority is up to date and during the day schedule and estimayeimportant things coming into the inbox each time Im side tracked with a new must do its immediately pit into the inbox. This only steals  minutes during the day. This way I avoid that I dont look at the nonadhoc tasks gets overlooked. The setup with using the calendar to schedule tasks just means you run two parallel inboxes and I bet most of the tasks just needs to be done during the day so time of the day is not important and just make prioritization harder. ,gtd,dd6gpwr,1,t5_2qhck
11686815,0,t1_dgkoncu,Thanks for the recommendation!Its funny  Ive been looking for a good social habit tracker that works for both android and iphone for some time. And had a lot of difficulty tracking something down. This does the trick!I am still looking for a GTD buddy  mainly to foster the connection and learn and grow together in the art of GTD.Blessings to you for the act of service today!,gtd,dgkpuxi,1,t5_2qhck
