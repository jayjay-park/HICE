986661,0,t1_chg084y,gt politicians eager to sell land to foreign investors for cash at our peoples expenseCitation needed. Politicians are free to sell their own land as are you and I. Any land not owned by the politicians is owned by other people who are also free to sell their land to whomsoever they wish. This has always been the case as it is in most parts of the world.Are you claiming that the politicians currently in government are trying to sell CROWN land to foreigners? If so could you please elaborate on that? AFAIK there has been some public parkland in Lautoka sold but that has nothing to do with expats or foreign investors... was sold to locally owned corporations.gt its just that there is a dark secret hidden throughout the palm trees.Could you please elaborate on the dark hidden secret? Im really curious about this because AFAIK getting foreign investors in has been the goal of every government since independence and is the goal of every party currently vying for election in September. Fijis greatest money earner tourism is based on foreign investment. Wed be a failed povertystricken state if you stripped away all the foreign investment. And yet somehow youve painted it as a bad thing. Kerekere please explain.,Fijian,chgfw24,1,t5_2spz6

6590345,0,t3_45vsl9,Bula!My wife and I did our honeymoon trip recently  and I recommend renting a car all the way. We stayed in  different places and rented two different cars to go around the islands. We went all over viti Levu and Vanua Levu. At the end of the trip we meet some people and talked about our experience while in Fiji they chose to stay in the hotels without venturing out and were regretting their descicion since they felt they didnt get a chance to see the real Fiji. ,Fijian,d00zuld,1,t5_2spz6
