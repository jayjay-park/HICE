7082274,0,t3_4ckxgr,Gun for Hire in Woodland ParkWest Paterson. Not cheap by a long shot but their range is nice. Also RTSP in Randolph  I prefer RTSP to GFH. Both can be a zoo if you go on the weekends or after work. ,NJGuns,d1j53ih,2,t5_2w5dz

9313179,0,t3_578clm,I read a lot of really irrelevant answers. The bottom line is.... Will a prosecutor be able to demonstrate in a court room that the magazine will feed a th round? If yes if a judge or jury sees a lawyer strip off that sixteenth bullet before their eyes and it will only take about  seconds that will be case closed.,NJGuns,d8wiifi,2,t5_2w5dz

10399252,0,t1_dcmt03l,Yea I have  disorderly persons offenses but I also live in Evesham the town the charges originate from and a firearms lawyer explained to me that the chief could just see Ive been arrested a handful of times and decide to use the cover all issuing this person a FID would be bad for the community excuse and then Id have to appeal. Id be inclined to be honest on my application because I feel with my luck I wouldnt get the curtesy of a call Id just get an immediate fail. ,NJGuns,dcmtled,1,t5_2w5dz
