861200,0,t3_23yu5y,typically its used to build muscle and therefore people bulk on SL BUT that doesnt mean you cant cut on SL its been done and as a beginner youll still see nb gains. DO IT i loved SL for the  months i did it. now my DL is lbs  ,stronglifts,ch269is,4,t5_2rz3s

1704627,0,t3_2dxasy,I am kind of a noob myself so I wouldnt take it too much to heart but I think you need to crouch a little lower before lifting the bar and sit back more so your weight is all on your heels and your back is a little straighter.   I also think that the bar is farther away from you than it should be.  Are you supinating your right hand? I believe I was told to supinate the nondominant hand.  I hope this is helpful but again I am not an expert. Others might have a better analysis.,stronglifts,cju13j5,2,t5_2rz3s
1948286,0,t1_cknrjb0,Awesome I like that idea a lot. Ill probably start implementing that tomorrow. I think Ill keep squats with the linear progression but try that with bench OHP and rows. Any ideas on how to apply this to deadlift since its only  set? ,stronglifts,cknyzl0,1,t5_2rz3s
1952475,0,t1_ckm7qxy,I tried this yesterday staying at the same weight I was at before kg and it worked really well! Funny how the little things like that can make such a difference,stronglifts,ckoh6j3,1,t5_2rz3s
2158718,0,t1_cle4u41,Thanks for the advice! Im bulking and Im pretty sure Im eating enough though I might be able to stomach another shake per day.   I dont really have anyone who can film me but thats besides the point because the gym doesnt let people film anyway. ,stronglifts,cle80u7,1,t5_2rz3s
2207195,0,t1_clkdtyq,gt wow...thanks so much for the link..it seems very helpful,stronglifts,clkdzoz,1,t5_2rz3s
2337497,0,t3_2m3jgz,Short answer is no. Thats a horrible idea. Just do it as it is. You are not smarter than the people with decades of experience that went into this routine. Simpler answer Try it and see how far you get. ,stronglifts,cm0mlb1,10,t5_2rz3s
2451545,0,t3_2nl3lm,Same here! And you have just made me realize Ive been going up to kg at a time not . And now I understand the hell that has been the  sessions at the gym. Be careful with kg at a time when the weights start going up!You saved my life! Thanks!,stronglifts,cmepq1b,2,t5_2rz3s
2643652,0,t1_cn35d53,Smashed kg squats feels awesome. I f...ed up  rep got too into my music and didnt pauselockout at the top and consequentially I ended up not breathing in for that one rep... but I made it.,stronglifts,cn3nowu,1,t5_2rz3s
2752365,0,t3_2rl0nz,Those DOMS will get ya especially on your first time trying a new exercise. Honestly youll be fine granted that you do what is always repeated  eat enough and sleep enough.I do the dips and chinups after the respective workouts as well and it hasnt effected my progress. If it seems to be hindering your progress and youre stuck on a weight then scrap it.  ,stronglifts,cngxky7,3,t5_2rz3s
2854343,0,t3_2spte5,The gym bros told me is should squat with a belt from the start. I resisted until I approached  and tweaked my back. Use it. The internet bros are wrong and the gym bros are right.   I dont use it for any other exercise. I do use a mixed grip for DL  and over. ,stronglifts,cnsjfja,2,t5_2rz3s

3137781,0,t3_2w30sw,I got that message after my first stall at  maybe its based on body weight or first stall or  weeks or idk? Im curious now. Anyway with the warmups already super hard at  Im not complaining about switching to  lb increments for my work sets but if I felt like I could still do  lbs. I guess Id probably keep doing it. I lifted  then  monday and friday last week though and really did not feel like I had any capacity to spare.,stronglifts,con87eb,1,t5_2rz3s
