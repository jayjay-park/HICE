1507504,0,t1_cj56c2u,You dont typically see them because they are not to standard for showbreeding. Its a recessive gene so most of the time they randomly pop up if both parents are carries of b genotype. Now and days Ive been seeing a lot of people purposefully breeding livers to livers labeling the pups as rare colored and selling for a ton more. I honestly dont understand that logic personally but I dont need to go on a rant lol. I personally love the livers but there hasnt been a bull terrier Ive seen that I havent fallen in love with! Do you have a pedigree for your pup? Curious to know if theres any Anne Dees in the lineage. ,BullTerrier,cj58odp,2,t5_2sr6z
