4617056,0,t1_ctch6yy,According to Catholic Church teaching yes. There is a distinction between venial and mortal sins of which the latter deprive one of sanctifying grace which is necessary for salvation. A sin is mortal when its object is of grave matter it is committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent. If any of those conditions is false the sin is venial.John      If anyone sees his brother sinning if the sin is not deadly he should pray to God and he will give him life. This is only for those whose sin is not deadly. There is such a thing as deadly sin about which I do not say that you should pray.  All wrongdoing is sin but there is sin that is not deadly.,SocraticChristianity,ctck3sq,2,t5_395k5

5520363,0,t1_cwguno3,I dont believe it can be legally justified to murder immigrants.  However murder presumes that there was no legal justification for killing the illegal immigrant.This is not the case with abortion.  There is a legal justification because a government is charged with protecting its citizens and their rights from infringement.  In some cases such corrections may have to involve death of the infringing party.Infringement is not necessarily a vilification mind you.  It is simply an acknowledgment that the legally protected freedoms of a citizen would be infringed if the government chose to act otherwise.  In the case of illegal immigrants these are fairly easy to separate Did the illegal immigrant engage in crimes?  For an unborn child this is more difficult because the mothers freedom of choice is being hindered if she is not allowed to choose not to have a child and protect her own health and wellbeing.,SocraticChristianity,cwh9ylp,1,t5_395k5
5520819,0,t1_cwhbzbs,As I said I dont think mutability is the correct thing to use here nor do I think it has any bearing on the morality of an act. Persons preferences their causes and their mutability are extremely complex. I will stick with what I said previously sometimes yes sometimes no.,SocraticChristianity,cwhc1zn,1,t5_395k5
