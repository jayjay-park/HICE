4765546,0,t3_3ej9kh,He was a bit pissed in the game  partly because he could not fight for the first  rounds or turns? idk of the boss fight like  minutes because he had to go down on the flying carpet. I think he had total of  rounds so almost a half of a fight was him getting down on a carpet. It was kinda weird from Matts part. Matt told Percy that the machine would without any doubt break if the giant fell on it so i dont think it was necessary to trow the giant from such a height. Orion could not really do anything about it because Matt was describing how high did Tiberius go. The thing with Mind flayers was a good idea from Orions part. Matt said that two of them did go to the temple. They could have do some dmg or take some attacks from the KVarn if they would not be forgotten. Also it was great idea to rip of the one of the  smaller eyes of the Kvarn. If he could have been a part of the fight from the start he could have done it much sooner which would impact the fight greatly. I think he had many good ideas prior to the fight also. For example about sending a letter to his brother. If the group would build on that idea and send his brother more information which they had he may have provide them with some tactical information being expert on aberrations or some of the colleagues would give them some info on the horn and what it might do. Also dont forget that his character have wisdom . That is lower than Grogs intelligence. So thats why he sometimes acts poorly but that is mostly Tiberius not Orion. I think Orion is doing overall great job. You are being very harsh on him. ,criticalrole,ctv8oru,3,t5_385bw

5512753,0,t3_3qlnyj,Vax isnt taking a level as a cleric. As he is mainly an atheist in his moment of what felt like impending death Vax reached out to the only deity he can trust... that of his friend and Compatriot Pike.He asked for a symbol of Sarenrae after Tiberious informed the group that against vampires holy water holy oil and holy symbols can serve to damage them. Due to that he wanted to incorporate holiness into his gear to give himself an additional advantage.Dont read too much into Vax from a character class stand point from these actions. He is maturing as a character as him and Vexahlia no longer have to rely just on themselves. Hes found a new family and its changing him at his core. In regards to Percy... SO many possibilities the consensus ive been seeing is that he made a pact with a demon to obtain the technical wherewithal to create guns and avenge his family.As Gunslinger is a custom class ive naturally assumed that Matt leveraged its creation off the Warlock class. Percy though is not a warlock... it feels like they just used that as a story telling device for the character. ,criticalrole,cwgaypx,23,t5_385bw

5554573,1,t1_cwljb3u,They havent told you anything that supports it not having to do with GampS. The only thing that has been said unless Im missing something and Id like it pointed out if I am is that it doesnt have to do with contractual or noncompete with GampS. Assuming you believe that it doesnt exclude GampS having simply fired him. They havent actually explained anything at all. What is Orion supposed to do? Speak out and alienate himself further from his friends in the business? Silence does not mean that it was a mutual agreement. All we saw from Orion up until he was removed because it was removal given that there was no statement from Orion first or lead off like Pike got was how much he enjoyed the game. There is no evidence that this was anything other than his summary dismissal and it makes me sick to see the indifference here. Given the length of the game prior to production or internet streaming I cant think of anything that actually points to what youre talking about as if they slowly drifted apart and Orion decided he wasnt a good fit with the group or vice versa. It was abrupt and handled exactly like a corporate firing. Again if you have anything that supports it being Orions decision to leave or Matt deciding he shouldnt be there instead over GampS having fired Orion Id like to hear it. I didnt get any of that from any of the communications so far and I definitely didnt get that from Orions stream where he was emphatic that Tibs was his favorite character to play ever. I feel like the tone youre offering is just awfully fatalistic.,criticalrole,cwllg1j,3,t5_385bw
5554623,1,t1_cwlbyax,He was one of the few players who knew enough of the system to provide complex strategic gambits during combat including taking himself out of the fun of combat if he had another idea that could help the group and he was devoted enough to the character and playing him truely that it created IC drama which was positive. He also really embraced character flaws. Everyone keeps saying how awesome the Halloween episode was but I finally got around to watching it and it just seemed like a mess with the cosplay constant cracking up and pretty plodding nature of their progression against the BWs. Also the group tends to have no actual moral compass or selfawareness as to their prior actions versus future ones. They spent almost an hour going back and forth over whether they needed to be more noble in handling their enemies after butchering them the week before. Some players specifically seem to have real issues keeping their characters consistent in what is or isnt okay with them and Orion was always a constant in his worldview which the group could use right now. When Scanlan has to use Burt att at small to explain that they arent being consistent you know something is off. It just isnt the same game for me either.,criticalrole,cwllo2i,1,t5_385bw

The group seems to have taken to that very well and while we do get some moments where they try and get the kill unless Matt feels they have earned it he wont easily rule for them.That being said he also can be wildly generous for cool moments that have no direct effect to the combat or scenario at large.

Percy would also.  Vex could use displacement but the cloak of elvenkind is working very well for her so far.Speaking of Vex can we now lay to rest speculation that Seeker Assum was working for the Briarwoods?  His training just saved Vexs life.  If she hadnt been able to hide so much as bonus action she would have taken more damage.  More damageinstadead from finger of deathzombie vex slave of Deliah.

The problem with creating a radically new technology is that you often have to design new tools as well because existing tools lack the necessarily precision. Now that hes built one that works Id think building another one should be somewhat easier.  Reenchanting it in the other hand is still a major issue. ,criticalrole,cxyz4eb,2,t5_385bw

6073259,0,t3_3yp6ki,I forget who said it first but the quote that sticks in my mind is that DampD is like living a video game only better.  You can do whatever you want however you want.  You can throw away use tweak or make up any rules at any time for any reason.  Our mundane world is so boring why not create a realm where you get to be a hero or villain with some of your closest friends and go on an adventure?  It takes nothing more than some dice and your imaginations.  Pizza and sodas help too.Ive only dabbled with tabletop RPGs in my earlier years at college early s.  My groups never lasted long but I certainly understood the appeal.  I grew up playing other tabletop games with family and no matter what happened we were always having fun ribbing congratulating helping or hindering each other.  We still play when we can and will continue to rope in newer generations along the way.  My yearold nephew is particularly sadistic.I just happened to follow a random link from Geek and Sundrys twitter feed to catch the first episode of Critical Role live.  I was hooked immediately.  Matts fantastic gift for description and storytelling the casts amazing voice talent and nerdiness the high production value with limited resources and more make it infinitely more watchable than most television.  It has the perfect blend of everything that makes a great show regardless of whos in it or where you watch it.  The most important factor that makes it so enjoyable is the fact that when watching you can tell everyone involved is having fun.This whole thing started because a bunch of friends got together and told stories.  That hasnt changed since they moved to a more public forum.  It is still more about their game than our show.  We just get to go along for the ride.,criticalrole,cyfow5c,2,t5_385bw

6138403,0,t3_3zmmxy,These answers consider the rules as written RAW not keeping house rules or thirdparty rules in mind.. They probably attack the target which seems most dangerous or best to attack at the time of their turn. Its also difficult to separate in your head what your character would do and what you as a player know would be the best play.. PHB p.   gt Grappledgt  A grappled creatures speed becomes  and it cant benefit from any bonus to its speed.gt  irrelevant stuff   So yes RAW you cant move when youre grappled and thats it. It is up to the DM if there are further implications. For example if you specify you grapple an enemy from behind Id give him disadvantage on attacks against the grappler. Though being unable to move is quite a hinderance so breaking from grapple is usually the right thing to do considering that a creature grappling another creature can drag that creature with it when moving at a speed cost.. As far as Im aware no matter what the size of a creature it is still counted as one creature not separated into parts or multiple targets.  gt If theres an  dragon could Vex target any  radius that doenst encompass the back of Grogs head for a barrage of thorns? No. The description of hail of thorns is this  gt In addition to the normal effect of the attack the target of the attack and each creature within  feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw.

Keyleth could get a scroll and VM could perform the ritual.  I fear for the very real emotional fall out when that imaginary bear dies.  The group and Matt would have to decide if that would bring closure or make things worse.  I think it would be good.  If the new form is a small animal he could hide on Vexs person.  Im thinking ferret hijinks a la Beastmaster the Marc Singer movie or possibly snake or spider Trinket whipping out to envenom arrows.  Also he could still protect her coin purse fiercely.If Trinket came back as an animal not well suited to traveling with the group then there is still closure to be had when he is released into the wild hopefully under the protection of the Air Asharii or Roc obsessed gnome druid.,criticalrole,czi6wrd,1,t5_385bw

Shoot run Grog cant catch up for a couple more turns dashing each turn for ft would close distance quickly unless they were in a massive battlefield but before he gets in range Percy just takes a turn to duck into hiding and then starts the catandmouse till he can get enough range to repeat.Again not saying Percy would  win but hes got plenty of ways to stall out Grogs main class mechanic and play keepaway for a safe  if heavily drawnout  victory.,criticalrole,czo1csk,1,t5_385bw

A battle with them as sidekicks feels... unnatural from a narrative standpoint.Also from a technical standpoint I m not sure Mercer wants combats with many NPCs or many PCs as well. That means longer times between players turns and more chances of getting bored.

7205289,0,t3_4dv3h8, I hope Tyriok survives. Vax was really sadguilty when he discovered the body and I was surprised Pike was able to cleanse him. I think hell help them find Osysas mate in a roundabout way then get safely sent back to the encampment. Oh god I am so excited for this. I have zero idea what might happen but since the RQ doesnt seem to be worshiped too much it might be that she needs Vax to come to her in order for her to meet in person. Perhaps then she will tell him what his purpose could be and even go into how Vax is Fatetouched. My main thought was that since RQs main enemy is Orcus and VM is known to have somewhat thwarted Orcus by taking his horn and hiding it away RQ might request that Vax joins the RQs fight against him. I imagine this would involve getting Orcus other horn before someone uses it to do something bad. This could be the story after the Chroma Conclave. A tiein to what the Briarwoods were doing perhaps involving that sphere thing would be epic. I imagine it will be some time before Vax can go to the temple though. I just hope Vexs speech has raised his spirits a little until then. I cant wait to meet this sphinx. I imagine that he will send VM on a quest before he gives them any information at all. Like the obelisk said a name is earned and a name is very important information. I doubt knowing Osysa will do much to persuade the mate that VM have good intentions. I doubt Osysa and the mate communicate that much. Oh that would be interesting. Are there any orcs we know who may be with them? I so hope they have Pikes grandfather with him so we know hes not dead. That would be sad for both Pike and Grog.,criticalrole,d1x6mlv,6,t5_385bw
7218970,0,t3_4eby5o,Conditions Appendix PHB page gtConditionsgtUnconscious    An unconscious creature is incapacitated see the condition cant move or speak and is unaware of its surroundings    The creature drops whatever its holding and falls prone.    The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.    Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.    Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within  feet of the creature.    gt Prone    A prone creatures only movement option is to crawl unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.    An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within  feet of the creature. Otherwise the attack roll has disadvantage.gtIncapacitated    An incapacitated creature cant take actions or reactions.Movement In Combat PHB page gt Being Prone    Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game they are prone a condition described in appendix A.     You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example if your speed is  feet you must spend  feet of movement to stand up. You cant stand up if you dont have enough movement left or if your speed is .     To move while prone you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs  extra foot. Crawling  foot in difficult terrain therefore costs  feet of movement.ampnbspChapter  Combat PHB pages gtDropping to  Hit Points    When you drop to  hit points you either die outright or fall unconscious as explained in the following sections.    gtInstant Death     Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to  hit points and there is damage remaining you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.     For example a cleric with a maximum of  hit points currently has  hit points. If she takes  damage from an attack she is reduced to  hit points but  damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum the cleric dies.gtFalling Unconscious    If damage reduces you to  hit points and fails to kill you you fall unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.gtDeath Saving Throws    Whenever you start your turn with  hit points you must make a special saving throw called a death saving throw to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws this one isnt tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.     Roll a d. If the roll is  or higher you succeed. Otherwise you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success you become stable see below. On your third failure you die. The successes and failures dont need to be consecutive keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.     Rolling  or . When you make a death saving throw and roll a  on the d it counts as two failures. If you roll a  on the d you regain  hit point.     Damage at  Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have  hit points you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum you suffer instant death.gtStabilizing a Creature    The best way to save a creature with  hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isnt killed by a failed death saving throw.     You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it which requires a successful DC  Wisdom Medicine check. A stable creature doesnt make death saving throws even though it has  hit points but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable and must start making death saving throws again if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isnt healed regains  hit point after d hours.gtMonsters and Death        Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to  hit points rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.     Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.gtKnocking a Creature Out     Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to  hit points with a melee attack the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.This information is all available in the Basic Rules a free PDF official download from Wizards of the Coast.

Look at how many unbelievably talented people do artwork for this series alone. I dont think itd be hard for them to get a couple favored artists of the crews to illustrate an episode in nearfull as an individual issue. Each artist could put their spin on their artwork style while also letting us see the characters instead of the players during those events as a sort of companion piece to the main show.A full fledged new comic series with allnew material I think would be far too time consuming and wouldnt be nearly as profitable as people might think itd be. If they do choose to go that route though theyd be better served having Matt come up with an entire sidestory  issue miniseries or what have you with allnew characters set in the same world racing to obtain one of the Vestiges that Vox Machina might not go after themselves.

7387477,0,t3_4ghazz,It wasnt DampD but I actually had a GM just pretend a session didnt exist once and its my favorite insane gaming story.The system was Mage The Ascension modern day wizards basically. Kind of Dresden Filesesque.Our party had made an alliance with a group of local werewolves and had cemented it by helping them perform a very powerful very dangerous ritual for those familiar we helped them build a caern that would take a very long time and would require us to defend them as the ritual would be a giant beacon to spirits to come and try and stop them from basically ripping a hole in the local spirit world.So there we were in a brownstone while this ritual was going on. A bunch of evil spirits appear and we fight them. Very close quarters since were indoors in a house. Many of us are going toe to toe in melee with these things.When suddenly one of our party members decides to conjure several pounds of C and then enchant it so it basically does a bunch more damage for those familiar he prime charged it so it would do nonsoakable aggrovated damage.Which he then threw at the guy I was fighting in melee.Needless to say this didnt go so well. I died the spirits died the guys doing the ritual all died a few survived the explosion then died from the backlash of the failed ritual most of the party died.Only the idiot who threw it and one other party member a ranged combatant made it out and the nonidiot then proceeded to go berserk and follow him down the street hurling lightning bolts at him in broad daylight with witnesses watching which then caused magical backlash which killed the nonidiot.The idiot somehow did not realize the C was a bad idea despite the fact that and Im not making this up he was an exmarine.It got so bad one member of the party ended up crying in the corner wed been playing for years mind you and we kicked the idiot out of the group.After we calmed down the GM just decided to press the reset button and we continued like that session never happened.POSTSCRIPT The next day the GMs roommate a military trivia nerd emailed us all with an excerpt from the Army Rangers handbook or some other military guide listing the minimum safe distance of a single pound of C as  meters. Not say  meters.,criticalrole,d2hwlv0,9,t5_385bw

7464369,0,t3_4hlmie,Well were unsure of what Kevdaks gauntlets actually did besides make him larger. My guess would be that the swelling effect stemmed from the Knuckles casting some sort of Enlarge spell which adds an extra d to the damage of any melee attack. Thats not too powerful by itself.Now Im sure they did other things as well but what that actually is remains to be seen. Most likely they gave a strength boost and maybe some kind of AC bonus.Neither the Deathwalkers ward nor the Mythcarver have been gamebreakingly powerful yet. A  armor with shifting resistance against  different types of damage is great and a  longsword would count as legendary for a fighter who knows how to use it though not really being Scanlans thing. Still I get what youre saying. None of these items seem like theyd be enough to help a person fell Titans. Maybe the lesson here is that true power lies in the wielder rather than the artifact? Another possibility is that... Maybe the Vestiges can level up? Perhaps a champion who uses them correctly is able to unlock more of their potential than one who doesnt?

Thats the sort of thing that takes weeks of planning not hours.I know there has been quite some debate on this point but I do think that VM  Barbarians can take out Umbracil in her lair. It will be dangerous. Many of the herd will die there is a chance that some of VM will perish as well.

7669325,0,t3_4kbrxi,This fight was really weird even though they spent almost two hours planning it still felt really rushed and had a strange flow. I think part of that speaks to what you are trying to say  but at this point the game has gotten so homebrewed that the balance is really off and its awesome that the group is creative but sometimes the DM needs to reign that in a bit more based on the rules and mechanics. I agree one hundred percent that he should never have allowed them to DD into the dragon in the first place because the spell specifically doesnt allow it and the mechanics of what happens to them inside make no sense and just created all these complications. Plus it was such a bad idea that Matt could have not allowed it just to help the party. But since he allowed it Im not sure I actually disagree with his ruling that much on when they were inside. I think the AC wasnt lowered because it was more about them being able to move and do anything then it was about the dragons inside being protected. Vax was theoretically being squished by the dragons muscles so he didnt exactly have leverage to really swing or move so it was more like a small poke. The rod is pretty tiny compared to the dragon so it is more like a bullet wound. Maybe the dragon also has many stomachs so one being damaged isnt a big deal. Also I think it kind of fits with how damage is taken in general with DampD. If someone fell off a hundred foot cliff in armor they should probably just die but depending on the dice or their hp they are somehow ok and just take x damage without broken bones or anything like that. It doesnt always translate perfectly or logically and so I think for a gargantuan dragon a small hole being ripped in it or Vax barely being able to move and graze his muscle with a sword shouldnt do all that much damage.  But I agree with most of your other points and there was definitely some strange DM decision making this fight with regards to the herd and the dragon. ,criticalrole,d3dyie6,16,t5_385bw

The guy happens to have a purplish shirt youd see theyre not that uncommon if you keep an eye open for them. There are two other shapes in the comic that both seem to match common dice shapes but thats not much of a stretch they were simply built off of the cube premise. The author happens to be a DampD geek but a lot of people are DampD geeks.Theyre all very easily explainable even when you consider that so many of them are together in one short comic.However... the cubedick.Its really the cubedick that gets me. Its just too damn freaking specific the odds of it alone being a coincidence arent that high to begin with. And suddenly the unlikely presence of all those other things in combination with the cubedick make a strong case for it being a reference and not just a coincidence.But yeah confirmation bias. I see a cubedick Im going to look for anything CRrelated and Im probably going to find some no matter what Im looking at. The human brain evolved to recognize patterns and connections and its going to do that even when they are the result of random chance.But again that Id find so many in such a small comic...

7835867,0,t1_d3wa173,Really agree with everything youve said so far. Looking back on it one thing that struck out to me was Why wasnt Umbrysal flying and wheres it minions? and despite a few people being afraid I actually felt they were in a very good position and in no real danger. The problem with focus fire on the weaker members read mages is players tend to think youre picking on them when really its a case of facing intelligent monsters that know magic exists that can fuck them up. Also brings up the question of do you coup de gras unconscious PCs with monsterspeople in a world that knows healing magic exist?The point you said that struck out to me the most was the players are pretty bad at separating the monsters from Matt it really does make me feel for the guy though most DMs will experience this. I always cringe slightly when they shoutcomplain at Matt saying hes trying to kill him or getting upset when something they want to try just doesnt really make as much sense as they thought or would require a roll. Its something that is annoying and demoralizing as a DM but something you learn to live with. I agree that if a PC ever does perma die Matts gonna get a lot of flak for it though thats somewhat to be expected. Death should suck and sometimes people need time to decompress if they werent on a show Id say go for a walk to have time to think and sadly the DM tends to be the easiest person to let out your anger and frustration on.Still despite all my very minor nitpicks was very fun to watch and Matt certainly weaves an exciting story.

I made this local Commander of the Watch into the BBEG for the week. He was primarily a grappler who wanted to grab and hold members of the party while his guards ran them through with spears. My party is pretty mobile with reach weapons and evasion and such. I figured they could be fine and only let one of them get in reach to get grabbed. When they walked in to confront him the Dragonborn Barbarian decided to just drop all his gear and fight him with his fists. I was like Uh.... ok. The only reason they werent completely obliterated in the fight is several VERY well timed sleep spells that knocked out that Guards so that the Commander of the Watch had to do most of the damage himself. One member did unfortunately die but that was because the Barbarian opted to Coup de Grace the now sleeping Commander instead of spending the round stabilizing his buddy who just rolled a crit fail on his DST.

7868091,0,t3_4n26wd,I think Vax just didnt want to be around Pike who is a good cleric and champion of Sarenrae because she would be able to tell that he was falling somewhat into the RQs service and that she would in Vaxs mind be apposed to his forced servitude and think he should be serving Sarenrae. It is also obvious that he fears the RQ and possibly believes she is an evil or vindictive God which she isnt and thus is afraid that Pike will reject him. Meanwhile his own inner turmoil at having lost his sister and then brought her back only to be forced to live in servitude when he would much rather have died all while simultaneously having everything he ever cared about being taken from him by the same Dragon Thordak killed his mother forced them to look for the vestiges which killed his sister and now has destroyed Emon and Westrun the only places he really knew as home... I would say it has been rough on him. And the fact that he prefers to brood in silence and not talk about the things that are bothering him means that he certainly wouldnt want to talk to Pike who would certainly pity and try to comfort him. Vax strikes me as the type of person who hates being pitied and also rejects the very idea of being comforted due to that pity. His own selfloathing and jaded view of the world have made people like Pike  who are just innately good and pure  an enigma and he cant really understand them even if he knows them to be that way.  ,criticalrole,d40g2uk,5,t5_385bw

7952538,0,t3_4o3hid,Sorry but I really think this is misguided for a lot of reasons.. Trying to manufacture an outcome for Vox Machina that isnt Vox Machinas story isnt going to hook them into the show because its not Vox Machina.  Having the retired characters scattered to the four winds means none of the chemistry that they have on the show.. Youre investing time in parts of a game that your players arent close to playing yet rather than investing time in where theyre at.  It reduces the quality of the game for them which might make them less likely to watch CR.. Youre developing NPC backstory for vast parts of a campaign that your players may never experience.  They may choose to go elsewhere.  Or they may TPK.  By the time your players meet these characters theres a possibility they could be dead on the show and thats just damned awkward.  That is unless you railroad them into rapidly meeting the NPCs which also may diminish their enjoyment and make them feel like they dont have a stake in the game and less likely to watch the show as well.  If theyre about to meet one of the characters worry about developing them at that time not now.This sounds a lot like trying to explain something funny to your friends that they had to be there to understand.  Its great for you but possibly awkward for them.  Frankly youre not going to recreate the magic of  talented improv actors and one extremely experienced DM all by yourself.  I think youd be more successful if you really polished up the part of the campaign theyre currently at with a focus on the players experience. If you can get them hooked on DampD now it wont be a hard sell to get them to watch Critical Role.,criticalrole,d49xv5y,6,t5_385bw

8012481,0,t1_d4gdh2e,Theres no contradiction. Your argument hinges on this being a spell from the handbook. If it differs at all then its not a spell from the handbook regardless of how similar it is. My argument is that this spell does in fact differ from the handbook so your revelation as proud of it is you are doesnt really give us any information we didnt already have. Providing evidenceargument against an idea is not bashing it.The only difference between my post and PigKnights is that I made a counterpoint against the presented idea and PigKnight provided a differing idea of his own. One of us basically said no youre wrong and the other said no Im right. They were both legitimate counterpoints to your idea but for some reason you think only the latter is valid and the former is just bashing. Sorry but it doesnt work that way.The reason I made my post in the first place is because I too read imprisonment a few weeks ago and instantly thought of the Githyanki skull but  seconds later I read further and saw the problem with that theory. Fast forward to yesterday I see this thread that had the same theory that I did so I added my post with the thoughts I had about said idea. However your post also had some very clear implications that Allura was either wrong or lying so I added a few lines to defend her as well.

If I wanted to show somebody why I love Critical Role why I dedicate  hours or more of my Thursday to it every week Id show them the episode where Emon fell. Id show them Vex dying or the escape from the Underdark. Id show them the episodes where laughter and utter bleakness lay next to each other the rebuilding of the city after Umbrasil fell the hot tub episode the fight over the skull. Id show them the episodes where you can turn away from the screen and close your eyes and imagine the world like youre reading a book where even the author doesnt know whats going to happen next.I dont think Id show them this episode.,criticalrole,d5d0uw8,24,t5_385bw
8285445,0,t1_d5d6148,The point some people make is when the cast does it themselves there are almost no awkward pauses where you sit for  to ten seconds and listen to laughter. When the cast laughs in studio you see a group of people reacting to a good joke so the laughter feel more genuine. Sometimes the crowd would react to the live show in an extremely exaggerated way making the cast have to sit their and stare into the abyss. It felt like it broke up the storytelling for me.  I do not dislike the idea but I would prefer the cast keep to one shots or non critical story arcs for any future live show.,criticalrole,d5d8mkg,10,t5_385bw

8320773,0,t1_d5fa01n,To my knowledge bears while good at climbing in some species are not generally good at traversing limbs or treetops. Therefore the chances of them being bears since they travel via the trees is relatively unlikely.Also while the chromatics could totally end up working together especially with Thordak existing there are plenty of instances where Mercer changes the world. Trinkets abilities are an obvious point as was Garmeelis ability to charm without use of either ocarina or panpipes.Yes many people say that Mercer could change it and he doesnt really change that much but the rarity of personal touches on a world does not necessarily indicate the course of future rule changes. Besides whats wrong with theory crafting everyone deserves to have fun and some people have the most fun by digging into a world and coming up with fan theories so maybe take a step back and let people have their fun without whining about the possible overuse of a specific argument for their theories.,criticalrole,d5hni9x,2,t5_385bw

And as such the players get to be the biggest heroes around.  If someone else comes in and wipes out the dragons for them where is the fun in that?  Based on your comments I kinda wonder why you are even watching their game?  You seem to be making this out like its some sort of scripted TV program which it is not.  The more you expect it to be like one the more you are going to be confused and disappointed.Lastly to answer your more rational questionsThis ancient dragon conclave is meant to be a terrible overwhelming obstacle for an adventuring party that has already become very powerful.  As such the dragons are pretty badass true... but nothing is invincible.  By gathering enough powerful allies andor weapons there is a lot that could potentially stop one of these ancient dragons on their own.  A good exmple of this would be Syngorn which is preparing to fight back against the dragons all on their own with or without VMs help once they have finished making adequate preparations.We dont know much about the Conclaves motives because none of the dragons VM have encountered so far have felt the urge to reveal them yet dont worry you havent missed it.Clearly when they band together and surprise attack a city they can do a lot of damage very quickly as was the case for Emon and Draconia but a wellprepared city could probably defend itself just fine against one of them at least maybe even more.  Whitestone was protected temporarily simply because they were hidden from view thanks to some clever albeit untested magic but if Vorugal and his army had landed in the middle of the valley instead of on top of the mountain the city wouldve been fucked.  Vasselheim is another matter entirely because it has fended off ancient dragons before and is most definitely in the wellprepared category I mentioned especially after VMs warning.  Besides there are only  dragons  left now and there are a lot of cities in the world... so obviously not all of them are going to be immediately targeted.  For example most of the smaller towns like Whitestone and Kymal were left alone and we dont even know if Kraghammer got hit yet and thats just on Taldorei.  The other continents aside from the one Draconia is on dont even seem to be on the Conclaves radar at this point.  Anything else I could say beyond that would be pure speculation.,criticalrole,d6sxrl1,3,t5_385bw

8737128,0,t3_4znawp,I think Keyleth will take over the Ashari. That ones easy she has a welldefined character goal that wont happen until the endgame.Vax will probably strike out on his own as the champion of the Raven Queen. I dont see him running a guild. Hes too glum and antisocial for that. Grog might run a herd but personally Id like to see him eventually replace Earthbreaker Groon in Vasselheim. More of a satisfying ending that way and it would cement Grogs status as the strongest man in Exandria. Percy I hope will become a ruler. Though I can see the skyship option too. Whitestone is still his to rule any time he wants it and there are real opportunities to rule all of Taldorei. Vex...Im hoping Vex and Percy end up married. Bad News Bears is great. If she doesnt end up ruling alongside Percy Im not really sure what Vex will do...she doesnt have a ton of longterm objectives.I hope Pike doesnt go back to Vasselheim. Im so sick of her being in Vasselheim working on that temple. But that is probably the most likely option.  Alternatively she might reestablish the faith of Sarenrae in a rebuilding Emon.

That said though they now have a full week to properly think things through and perhaps he may feel differently once hes weighed all the options.  As much as some people are trilling about how they think this is such a perfect ending to his character there realistically are still several unfinished tasks he has that could easily justify bringing him back.  Not to mention they could have some fun characterwise if perhaps he isnt the same person he once was if hes revived... whether its a side effect of being revived in an unconventional way or if the death has a profound effect on his views.,criticalrole,d7ylkjq,28,t5_385bw

Also it doesnt seem in character for her to trust Vox Machina to bring her back. Matt is playing his dragons straight so far but Im a fan of stories where no one is irredeemable. Though if she does that much of a face turn then she would probably be more accepting of death anyway.

I think its going to be part two of that. Especially after the Sun Tree talking about how all the gods receded and left this place a long time ago and it reminiscing about how cool it was when it was first taking seed.I think there is a big good god that VM is going to team up with. They have the Raven Queen Sarenrae Melora Ioun and maybe Pelor that they could have as guys backing them up but there isnt a good version Orcus or Vecna on their side yet. I feel like its going to lead up to a war that hasnt been seen since the great divergence. I think that Matt is setting up some sort of red herring and then well all be blind sided by the BBEG who has been biding their time. It would be a cool story arc since Keyleth and Percy are sort of very over gods while Vax is coming into his own and Pike is gaining her faith back tenfold. While Scanlan and Vex just sort of deal with the fact they exist but dont particularly follow anyone just really appreciate what some of them do for their friends.This is hella long.

Wanting to get Raishan out of the picture quickly and without putting too many people at risk is the kind of thing Keyleth would argue for plus even though she clearly recognised how suicidal it was Keyleth is very selfsacrificing.Vax played it off brilliantly because he forced her to order him to go saying he would  this showed Vax was both testing Keyleth as a leader and playing of her unwillingness to send people to their death.

Its easily the best show on GampS so I dont think they want it to stop.If your worried about a TPK just remember that DampD is a brutal game. The heros may not always win and that character you spent a year or more on could die to a bad roll.I imagine they may have a few one shots as filler for Matt and crew to build a new party and into campaign.

I think theyre really able to just let loose when its not another standard raceclass Matt gets to play everything and look how great the characters are. Whatever happens though I still maintain that they have fun over what we want if they have fun playing any combo of raceclass for whatever reason they need to prioritize that over audience choice. I dont want them to change their characters based on some peoples opinions of how they play or how those characters are not well received. Its fine to have difference of preferences on characters doesnt mean those people are necessarily rightwrong.

Think about it she can disguise as whoever she wants the party would have to spend the rest of their lives suspecting that every social encounter could be her in disguise.

10039960,0,t1_dbfzea1,gt Probably very true but I could see Ashley dropping out due to career. While I hate to admit it you are probably right on this regard. Pike is a full member of VM so its pretty hard to relegate her to a less than main character status. The narrative also puts focus on Pike traveling with VM when she can.If Blindspot keeps going then Ashley may just become a recurring guest similar to how Will and Mary are now maybe a bit more recurring depending on her availability. But Ashleys PC may become less of a main character.Im not sure about getting anyone to replace Ashley though. Even without Ashley he still has  players which is already the ideal if not a bit much for a DampD group. The reset of a new campaign though means they can pick classes that will be balanced with just the  of them and not be dependent on AshleyPike always being around to save their ass cause Clerics rule!.,criticalrole,dbg8ec8,2,t5_385bw

She saw that Keyleth and Vex survived her th level spell while Vax laughed it off completely the rest of the group will be coming for her that all except Jarrett are immune to both her poison and fear and I dont think she has the Ill take some of you with me! mentality. Shes probably going to try and flee. She burned a th level spell slot on chain lightning so she would need to be level  to have another th level spell along with the th level spell she still has assuming Matt has left her spell slots unaltered. This actually makes a huge difference for her game plan because plane shift is a th level spell. If she does have a th level spell slot available she needs to use it out of sight from Scanlan and Gilmore so that they dont counter spell it. Her life becomes much harder if she can only use dimension door to get away because if either Vex gets off Hunters Mark or Percy gets off Hex on her they can track her and follow her. Theres also the air ashari creating a storm in the city that may keep her grounded depending on her size class. And if Jamon Saord is thrown into the mix with Hunters Mark pointing him to Raishan like a compass then its going to get even harder for her. Oh also Vex can sense her in a  mile radius I believe it was.EditChain lightning is th level not th level. I was remembering things wrong.

Not only that they almost guaranteed the success of the seige of emon. With Thordak gone the crystal shattered his lair destroyed there isnt much reason for the Seige to fail.

The game has rules that allow for things like resurrection. These characters are the game pieces of actual human beings who are playing a game they want to win with the avatars theyve poured their hearts and souls and years into. They would like to see their avatars succeed and survive so they can keep playing the game and sending their characters on fun adventures.

10251417,0,t1_dc2gz9e,Because true death permanently changes the narrative in a couple of interesting ways!It gives victory a cost and so makes the narrative up to that point all the more rewarding. It enforces the team to confront their own mortality It forces them to examine their own group dynamic because now they dont have Group Member for group role The whole thing shifts. When Pike left if forced Keyleth and Scanlan into more supportive roles. When Tiberius left it forced SCANLAN to become the arcanist specialist!The new character joining forces the team to deal with a new party dynamic and decide whether or not to accept them as a member of VM and also introduces us to a new character.Its not so much about sadism as it is about how enriching a true death would be for the narrative.

10339771,0,t1_dcfzp2n,Well that was the single interaction that possibly pushed him towards the edge. As a guy who has lost people cause of suicidal depression and is himself depressed. I can attest to the fact that yeah most of the time we would ignore peoples help say we dont need them do stupid and shitty things for no real reason ignore whatever anyone has to say or do because it is kinda hard to get it into our brain particularly the state we are in that people just want to help because they care. But that sure does not mean it doesnt help. We might not admit to it but positive interactionsattention does help.I mean if VEX ingame had written a Limerick after the battle whilst in Whitestone relaxing for Scanlan. Say a Limerick that is fun and jovial recognizing the mutual scare in dying being wounded. A Limerick that was meant to be uplifting telling in a short way that they particularly her valued Scanlan. That wouldve been amazing and meant so much for people like me watching home relating to Scanlan. But she instead wrote a note because she wanted SAM to use the FLUTE. Again I am not saying that was wrong or was bad because it really wasnt. She was having fun with her friends and It was a nice moment that made my heart swell. Its just when I imagine about Scanlan in my mind I feel sad that no one gives a Shit about him. He is all alone going down on a very dark path and it seems like there is no good thing that can come out of it. Which when I am relating to him personally makes it even more hard to watch because Maybe there isnt any solution for me either.   And I cant really think of a Scanlan moment where Vox Machina had banded together and made it feel like they had his back. I just cant. I mean maybe there are tons but its just that I am not remembering for the love of all things. I am sorry I really did not wanna make any of this about me. I am getting professional help I am slowly getting better. I just wanted to express my thoughts about this conversation and where my answers are coming from. It might be silly to care about a fictional character this much. But literally Critical Role is all I got going these days. The characters and the story are what inspires me every day to do shit to have a future.

10359613,0,t1_dci8q5q,Yes but looking at this from a purely story perspective it isnt unreasoanable to believe that an Ancient Green Dragon who has been alive for hundreds of years and is also one of the strongest magic users in the realm has ways of going without sleep.  Dragons are no where near the same level as humans and other PC races and considering those rules were meant to be applied to PCs it wouldnt be a stretch to think Dragons dont need nearly as much sleep or if they want can sleep every other day for example and still get the same benefits.

I was just pointing out that most of them use knowledge their characters dont have to sometimes guide their characters actions.  In this case Laura and Marisha were using that meta gaming knowledge directily against another player Sam and that its nice to allow Sam the player that very much doesnt metagame the ability to use his deception rolls against other players to combat that and allow him to continue whatever he has planned for Scanlan.,criticalrole,dcigkvm,3,t5_385bw

10589730,1,t3_5rjily,I hope you dont mind me sticking my nose in and replying here but I think theres a few important points that need to be brought up. Im sure a call to prayer like this is a fairly trivial everyday thing for you if its not then this comment is perhaps important and this might seem like overkill but here goes.. Praying for an outcome in a fictional game based in a fictional universe is a triviality abstracted so far from real life its difficult to express. Now either God is omnipotent in which case he can flick that die over just as easily as he might have  for example  allowed someone to hear some crying Alternatively God is not all powerful and you are asking him to flip a die roll when his time might be better spent doing some actual good. If the first is the case then I have some pretty strong questions to ask this deity. If the second then this appears to fly in the face of most religious claims but certainly suggests a call to prayer is a bad idea. If he works in mysterious ways then he acts regardless of prayer so why bother.. Regardless of whether anyone else joins you in this endeavor you are now  consciously or subconsciously holding yourself responsible for what happens. If the die roll doesnt go your way then you will write it off as him working in mysterious ways. If it goes well you will at some level believe that your praying made a difference. I hope you see how absurd if not unhealthy that is.. There are numerous churches denominations and so on who have literally demonised DampD over the last odd years. There are many people who have put up with what is essentially religious bigotry and persecution because of a dice rolling game. There is a good argument that calling for group prayer in this same game might be seen  if not simply ridiculous  then perhaps even offensive.,criticalrole,dd88zbt,-2,t5_385bw

10714913,0,t3_5t9g94,I really dont agree with your take on Vex here. As Laura has pointed out several times she wasnt the only one who haggled with that shopkeeper and she wasnt the one pulling out the extreme intimidation tactics. And the scene in last nights episode DOES show how much shes grown and changed  shes actively trying to not hold a grudge and not haggle for ever last cent since shes no longer scraping by. Haggling was a survival tactic for Vex when they had nothing  and shes good at it. Shes saved the party some ridiculous amount Im pretty sure someone did the math for that at some point and while its less necessary now she clearly enjoys it.Another thing to keep in mind  that shopkeeper took advantage of Grog from her perspective. He took advantage of her friend and the mama bear in Vex came out. Thats actually a pretty admirable quality I dont know why so many people are set in painting that in a bad light. Even so with some gentle prodding from Vax and Grog and inspiration from Percy see their conversation in the woods after defeating the white dragon she clearly is trying to work against her personal demons and be more forgiving. Clearly the character IS progressing and learning consequences. ,criticalrole,ddl5wco,57,t5_385bw

10763991,1,t1_ddpxopf,gtBut Grogs actions at during the ritual... absolutely pull the rug out from under his rant.I disagree. Scanlans main objection to how the group viewed and treated him was that he was just the clown. Grogs main point was that Scanlan taught him to laugh and he even said in the song No one can make me laugh faster. Those would have been easy points for Scanlan to use to if he felt like he was getting shortchanged by the group. Grog was another one that only wanted him back because he was their clown.Now this would be an incredibly unfair thing to use against Grog because the whole point of the ritual is for the living to say what the dead mean to them and why the living think the dead should return. Also this isnt meant to belittle Grogs contribution. I was crying before the song started. But Ive also been in a headspace like Scanlans and its really easy to twist motivations of the things said by people you love however you need to to prove your point. I dont think Scanlan was ignoring Grog I think he didnt hear him. There was enough he could have turned into ammo. ,criticalrole,ddq850v,1,t5_385bw

To be honest I just couldnt believe they were actually going through with it and when they said that theyve done it before....geez....I mean Christ thats something that violent gangs do to initiate people NOT heroes.  They could have set up an obstacle course at Whitestone or even tested him against some weaker foes or had a sparring match at Whitestone.....but a brutal fucking beat down like that Hells Bells and they were laughing about it!  They have to be some of the first people that I have come across that thought hazing was funny and hilarious and a brutal beatdown was something that everyone went through just to get into the club.I get that they all have their own mental issues and troubled pasts but seriously???  I think Grog kind of push back against whatever attitude that was infecting the rest of the group by telling Keyleth to not scry Scanlan... in order to respect his wishes and privacy and I think Matt pushed back against it too when the dockmaster said that he had no idea who they were or why he should give them a discount.  Sure they have been through a lot theyve done some pretty amazing things and they have seen some stuff but you dont see Superman thumping his chest and saying do you know who I am??? just to get his way.  I am hoping that they get a dose of humility in the future because that arrogance is really wearing thin.If they wanted to see if they could trust Tary then maybe there was some other way that didnt involve violence.  I mean theyre smart people why does it always have to turn to that just to see if they can trust someone? What does that prove?  Hey look this person can take a beating I guess that makes them trustworthy.....come on really?  We saw that there were plenty of other endearing qualities that he had and a fantastic backstory that they could have easily found out by not jumping on him....and yet they resorted to it anyways because theyve done it before and its funny and no one complained yet.I know its fictional and I know its not real but still it was disturbing to me and disgusting and I thought they were better than that but instead they started acting more like the Justice Lords and not the Justice League.,criticalrole,ddusi59,-8,t5_385bw

The reason I used it is because it has become that meme and is the most frequently used and easiest way of expressing that.I do disagree about the trio coming into play for most contentious issues.  Thinking back to the  most recent issues the Raishan issues post Thordak fight Vex taking the deck Vex not trading the deck Scanlan leaving the hazing only the first and the fifth mentioned have had the no criticism pop up.

10830053,0,t1_ddwwrrd,I think its kinda interesting that Liam described Vax as a master assassin because prior to this it always seemed to me that the assassin archetype was just the way Liam decided to express Vaxs combat skills and that Vax wasnt actually an assassin Ive had a hunch that if the Swashbuckler archetype had been out when they switched systems Vax would be that instead. Also Vax is only a level  Assassin Rogue with his other  levels in Paladin. To me that makes him a really good assassin if assassin is the word were going to use to describe him rather than a master assassin. To me he would be a master assassin by this point had he not multiclassed.My question then is how might these sorts of differences in understanding of Vaxs character effected how things turned out?,criticalrole,ddx1kzw,0,t5_385bw

10870302,0,t3_5v80xr,I cant really agree. Travis has fun with combat and thats ok but it also leaves an imprint on the character. To me Grog is most closely in mind to the murder hobo attitude.His first instinct is usually to solve problems with an axe and civilians dont rate terribly high on his value scale plus the occasional bouts of sadism enthusiastically participating in torturing Voc? mentally torturing the servant guy they were interrogating the needlessly graphic way of dealing with his enemies sometimes e.g. that goliath dude or the lizardman whose head the pulped with his bare hands dont lend themselve to good in my opinion....would be a nice way of saying he deserves the same amount of trust and favor as anyone else in the group...I dont think he does. Travis likes to use his low int stat to do some off the wall shit on occassion he has fun with it and its hilarious to watch but it does make Grog a bit unpredicatble not to mention borderline well retarded. There are reasons why we give custodians to people with these problems in real live so personally as a character I wouldnt have handed Grog the deck back for example unless truly dire circumstances made it necessary. ,criticalrole,de17024,1,t5_385bw

You will find that most of the vestiges are . So the Knuckles while cool seem in line with the other vestiges in terms of power. Now because of the way that gauntletsknuckles work differently than a lot of magic items that give magical bonuses the knuckles would be the equivalent of  on Pike for example.

I watched live along with keeping half an eye on the sub and I would say that there were some comments earlier on that Matt was pulling his punches which didnt continue whilst the encounter continued and I personally didnt agree with anyway and there were definitely comments around Marishas play  Id say they were more to do with how drunk she seemed to be rather than anything else though.Personally I thought that most of the comments werent toxic or over the top particularly but can understand that people disagree with the content. I may well have missed the nasty comments but I dont remember seeing anything too bad so I hope that doesnt discourage you from participating on the sub.Agreed that the DM and players deserve some kudos because that was a hell of a fight against an extremely tough opponent due to the length of the encounter what the kraken can do and the fact they were in an alien environment to them and Im pretty amazed that VM were able to get out of what seemed at one point to be a certain TPK.

11197175,0,t1_df13wfr,I was agreeing with Lokiorin who said that with Action Surge you can cast two spells because it gives you an additional action. Those sources do indeed support that point. I mention no bonus action casting anywhere.The singular source you link does not disprove what I posted only clarifies it. If you cast a bonus action spell and an action cantrip you cannot action surge another spell as an action. If you have not cast anything as a bonus action that specific rule does not come into play.I did read my sources brother. I read them plenty of times because I have this discussion with people quite often. In both RAW and RAI action surge allows two leveled spells or cantrips to be cast as actions but if you cast a spell as a bonus action then if you also want to cast something as an action it must be a cantrip.,criticalrole,df16ptt,1,t5_385bw

I wonder if he also knows that Scanlans words left an open wound in the group and that he wants to use the gatestones and earrings as pretext to correct that as well.,criticalrole,dga6hlh,6,t5_385bw

11634488,0,t3_65wuuq,Ive been rewatching the past episodes and have noticed how inconsistent some of the rules are. I know I know heres lots of home rules and lots of things going on at once especially during fights. The reason I mention this here is im pretty sure with the new campaign the rules will hopefully be set and consistent. And since they wont be switching systems there is a really good chance the cast will know what their characters can do. And dont get me wrong I like be the show! I also know it will be more enjoyable now that the cast is more comfortable with the system. ,criticalrole,dges5rz,2,t5_385bw

Should the mods be censoring you as they have in the past?There is a difference between people like you occasionally posting what mods claim are shit posts and the average redditor spewing shitty memes.What is that difference?  The average redditor WILL NEVER SPEND TIME HERE because its a subreddit devoted to a  hour weekly show watching nerds play DnD.  What the mods cant quite understand because they clearly dont understand how they world works is that these rules and the enforcement of them are wayyyy over the top for the size of this community.
