269579,0,t1_cf8p3ri,What i will say is that of course any writer can write a character that is ugly but i can think of numerous instances where characters affirm how good of a friend Hannah is and how wonderful she is at understanding things. Now you could argue thats again characterisations of the other girls but what makes it blurry is that hannah is inevitably seen as Lena Dunhams totem in the show as she is the writer and producer and creative director. She appears to be with one hand knowingly writing a hate able flawed character and in the other stroking her ego.If Lena Dunham had written exactly the same character and it was played by ANYONE else i guarantee none of the controversy about her character or the fact she gets naked would have had one word written about it. ,girls,cf8pa9n,1,t5_2qj0h

Here are a couple of questionsCould it be argued that all of the characters stand for an archetype which makes them so unbelievablesurreal in my eyes?  Is it because that all of the characters lack common sense and criticalrational thinking to some degree that sorta forces them to be perceived as characters rather than real people perhaps?

592682,0,t3_20uneq,Was she saying that to Marnie? or Ray?  kinda funny that these are the two people who Hannah feels judge her all the time. Marnie judges her for not being well enough put together and making bad choicesand in this scene we catch Marnie doing something Marnie would consider a bad choice while Ray judges her for being a naive shallow self centered representation of her generation the same kind of thing he judges Marnie for who he has just been caught with.So for me I really thought it was a clever move to make it not obvious who she was saying that line to.

617134,0,t3_2170bi,I like how much the show has made us hate Hannah. Everybodys doing good and so she acts like a bitch about it and loses her job. But then she gets accepted into the school of her choice and now shes super happy and nice to everybody therefore showing that things have to only be good for her so she can be good to others. Hey things are so good for her they can probably create good feelings for other people including her boyfriend whos gonna have to deal with not seeing her anymore! Everybody say yay for Hannah! Poor Adam man. But at the same time do you guys think its right to pass off an opportunity of a lifetime? In the end despite how big of an asshole we can be does that mean we shouldnt take an opportunity when it comes our way?And the fact that this is such a turning of the tables with a giant kick in the groin for Adam after Hannah felt like she was the one being abandoned. Holy shit does this episode give you a lot to think and talk about.Also I think I hate Marnie more than I hate Hannah now. Why does she have to use men? Using Ray that way is fucking awful. She steals Charlie after losing him away from a girl. Now she had to steal this other guy away from a girl? Like Hannah after being miserable with not being the center of attention she gets happy after getting what she wants while manipulating a mans feelings in the process. Then again while a nice and badass dude he should have definitely kept some distance between himself and Marnie. As a man if a girl treated me the way he did with Marnie hell yeah Id get turned on and assume she wants me. Man or woman just be aware of the signals you send out.Then with Shoshanna having all her hard work fall apart she must feel incredibly lonely in a dark place. But then here comes Marnie waltzing in with this confidence and smile on her face telling her Hey Im sorry about your loss but itll be okay. By the way I used your exboyfriend for my own selfesteem issues but I know you probably dont care. So poor Shoshanna feeling incredibly isolated in desperate need of another poor soul who once loved her and can understand her asks Ray the man used by Marnie to come back to her but Ray is already looking for his light in his own way which he believes wouldnt need to include Shoshanna.The writing here has great parallels and contrasts with all the characters that its so fun to point things out and analyze and this helps so much with so much character depth whether with positive or negative qualities that I just cant stop fucking thinking about everything. And I just gotta say I love the way men are portrayed in this show. How often is it that a show revolving around female characters and their relationships can have an accurate portrayal of how men behave and respond to womens actions? Fuck this show about girls understands us guys!,girls,cgaf3pe,19,t5_2qj0h

She returns to New York and gets a job writing for xoJane.com.Marnie begins dating wealthy older men. Shosh begins drinking heavily and doing drugs until Jessa knocks some sense into her in hopes she doesnt end up like her. She graduates college but feels lost and unprepared. Jessa dives deeper into drugs until she hits rock bottom waking up on the bathroom floor of a party filled with people  years younger than her. She struggles to get her life together while battling the feeling that shes getting old and might want a child. Adams cycle of using women and alcohol continues because of the breakup.

Basically she was responsible for some of his growth as a character. Ironically though she hasnt grown much as a character. As much as he has tried to help her throughout the past few seasons she just doesnt see much growth so it makes sense that they would part ways at this point. ,girls,copb7ee,19,t5_2qj0h

9453788,0,t1_d9eb1pk,Yes. Theres no denying that Adam and Hannah had problems in their relationship. However I would not call their relationship abusive. If their relationship was supposed to be defined by that maybe the writers should show us abuse instead of all those sweet moments that make us root for this couple even now.YeahI would not call it abusive either more like codependant and somewhat toxic and no offense to LenaJennyI know in thsi case they werent talking about JessaAdam in this articalebut they were also talking about how JessaAdam had reached a new level of passion and they would be great if they didnt kill each other eventhough theyre most deffinatly abusive especially in the s finale.But the award for the most dysfunctional and absuive relationship goes to the Girlss friendship on each other.Theyve been abusive and toxic towards one another for years now at least in my opinion.,girls,d9ec268,1,t5_2qj0h

10193101,0,t3_5luz0g,Ive mentioned it here before but I recommend listening to the episode about friendship in season  of Lenas podcast women of the hour. Its Jemima and Lena on a roadtrip talking about their friendship through the years. The conflict between them during season  that Jemima wanted to quit and that working together on GIRLS almost ruined their friendship is a big part of the podcast. They also talk about whether or not there is a lot of Jemima in Jessa and whether or not there is a lot of Lena in Hannah so if you find yourself thinking what the fuuuck when watching Hannah and Jessa interact the podcast will be very illuminating.

11056051,0,t1_del5d59,Yes I am Aussie accent is one of those things like a Boston accent either you get it right or you dont. Aussies are notorious for losing their accent something that makes more sense in the context of immigration so if this character migrated to England first thatd make sense but an Aussie in NY keeping their accent pristine almost never happens. I cannot stress how strongly it sounds nothing like a refined Australian accent or nothing like a broad accent to put a cockney spin on your accent to make yourself appear posh you would to be actually mentally ill. I also disagree that working class is so defined by accent it really depends on the person. One look at real housewives of SydneyMelbourne would tell you that money doesnt require a posh accent. Good Examples of the broad accent is someone like Steve Irwin a general accent Chris Hemsworth and a refined accent Kate Blanchett.  ,girls,del6nzu,2,t5_2qj0h

I feel like Girls never really get the credit it deserves and with this final season being so strong somethings gotta come out of it. Listen I get the Marnie hate but I gotta say  amid all the bullshit she had a slight mature moment in this one. For example when she calls out her mom saying that she only does things for male approval. Its a big deal for Marnie to recognise and say this. And also when she says she needs to be ready to be a godmother to Hannahs baby. For all the dumb shit she does I thought that was a tiny moment of growth for her. And I give her props for that.Also Im all for Hannah standing up to Jessa. And I just wanna slap some sense in Adam for not willing to admit that hes so not over Hannah. Goddamnit dude get it the fuck together and cut the dead weight that is Jessa loose!!Fucking hell Elijah with the acting! My jaw dropped wide open with amazement. Major props Andrew Rannells!

11241832,0,t1_df673u6,SPOILER Yeah shes at least sixseven months in the pictures from episode  so there is a time jump there.

Jessa and Adam has been in a relationship for like  months and Adam would need to work through that eventual break up in an orderly fashion.

Watching those scenes unfold when she came back to him was heart breaking.What Adam did to Hannah is not all black amp white thou. He was manipulated amp mind poisoned. His mind was not strong enough to defend their love when Hannah was away. He got lost confused admitting he made a mistake. I dont know where the f ive been at Adam S E This is a result of manipulations amp negative influences from other people planting seeds of doubt in his mind about his love for Hannah amp from those wanting them apart. I dont think Adam ever wanted to walk out on Hannah but again mind manipulations can change a person amp turn them into people you dont even recognise anymore. Like they have been replaced kind of thing original Adam became Adam ..

I think its hard to judge just yet what kind of parent Hannah will be. You can argue that its unrealistic for someone like her to be a good parent but I disagree. I think people can make surprising changes when they have children. In fact I know plenty of people that are still absolute bitches to every one else but are genuinely good parents to their own kids. I also know people who were incredibly put together great careers fantastic social lives who were pretty negligent and detached when it came to their kids.

They got closure many times over before this episode. Good writing is compelling and says something true and in this case the writing is telling us something weve already heard and come to terms with seasons ago.

11548033,0,t3_64kwoi,I understand what you mean about the pregnancy being presented as a positive step in her life when in reality its a shitty thing to have happened to an underprepared person. But ultimately I think its realistic that someone like Hannah would try to make lemons out of that lemonade. Shes insufferable and terrible but shes not actually an evil or immoral person and in theory wants to do the right thing. When you really have nothing else going on in your life thats an easy way to spin things that the pregnancy is a good choice. To me that removes a bit of the idea that were supposed to be happy for this bad decision  in many ways its just more commentary on how nothing in Hannahs life has really panned out at all and she doesnt really have anything else to do nothing else going for herself. Its a different thing from when you have goals and a purposeful direction in life. Almost precautionary in that way.,girls,dg4z0c2,1,t5_2qj0h

Aka GIRLS is not the voice of our generation it is a voice of a generation.I see what u mean tho. IMHO the show is remarkable in the way that it puts experiences many of us can relate to on screen for the first time  American Bitch is a great example  so it feels representative of our lives but then we have an episode where Marnie is bitching about her gym memberships and were like hell no thats not me!
