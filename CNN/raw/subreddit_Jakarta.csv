Even uploading photos on an online album now becomes a hassle and I find myself sharing less pictures with friends or family because of it. Most of the internet becomes irritatingly slow when all the upload speed is used. Everyone in the house then complains of slow internet when Im uploading. ,Jakarta,cma7ct6,1,t5_2rfez
3912366,0,t3_351hjn,If by safe you mean has anyone ever directly threatened metried to hurt me then no. I think its very safe if you mean it in that particular context. Ive been all over Jakarta alone as a young teenage girl I was  when I was still living there and never felt danger  even if I did feel some sort of discomfort i.e. one random mas catcalling me the locals would tell him off and apologize for me. The same cant be said when living in America  in fact I feel more safer in Indonesia than I ever did in America. HOWEVER is it safe from thiefs? Absolutely not lol. Ive lost countless of things here. If you leave something in a public place dont expect it to come back. But not all is bad I left my brand spanking new iPhone  at KemVill and had it returned by a very nice penjaga.... and I dropped my wallet in the gym and the cleaner returned it to me without a single rupiah missing I had  million rupiah in there. But thats my personal experience anyways. ,Jakarta,cr28u1f,2,t5_2rfez
