237284,0,t1_cf5cd1s,WARThe first contact between Panem and NCR was one that would set the tone of future relations between the nations a trade caravan out of Klamath unwittingly crossed into the heavily watched territory of the Capitol region and was taken into custody by Panems security forces. Under direct orders from President Snow these unlucky men and women were tortured for information once their foreign nature was realized. Most died in custody but enough intelligence was gathered to sound alarm bells among the Capitol elite. Surveillance craft were sent over NCR territory to learn more.Days passed. NCR was suddenly seized in convulsions when word spread that much of what had been land to the east was suddenly water. Economic turmoil ensued when trade with the East vanished overnight. This turned to outright panic when aircraft descended upon the capital city of NCR announced the existence of a mighty empire and demanded fealty to the Capitol. President Kimball a pugnacious man took personal insult from the arrogance of the Capitol and threw out the ambassadors. All NCR military forces were put on high alert.The attack that came was swift and devastating. Massed formations of Capitol bombers overflew the major cities of the nation Klamath Vault City Junktown NCR Navarro New Reno etc. and rained fire upon them. California had virtually no antiair defenses in place why would they? No one had had a decent air force in two centuries! so only a few aircraft were damaged in return. The effect was immediately recognizable in the horrendous casualty figures thousands dead tens of thousands displaced and most of the government eliminated. What was left of NCR was burned and broken.By chance President Kimball survived the vicious assault. During the night following the attack he declared over the radio to the largest audience seen in the wastes for centuries that a state of emergency was being declared and he was taking sole command of the government. The war had only just begun. Kimball immediately nationalized all resources necessary for the war effort and set into place a sort of war communism to handle implementation.What forces along the border prepared for combat were mobilized immediately into Panems territory but it was soon realized that such direct assaults were almost pointless the air superiority the security forces held made any attempt at a land invasion a fools errand. A new plan was implemented surgical insertion of Special Forces. Dozens of solitary Vertibirds stealthily infiltrated Panems airspace and deposited Rangers volunteer Brotherhood of Steel members spies First Recon sniper teams etc. across the districts. They were quick to discover the destitution of the people of Panem and many began to foment revolution among them.In the meantime President Snow sent another group of emissaries to demand the NCRs surrender. When these men were shot in the street the Capitol sent its security forces to invade. Several cities were brutally occupied driving the rebellious populaces into the countryside. Bloody battles throughout the country saw horrendous casualties for both sides. The loss of law and order gave rise to a resurgence of the horrors of the wastes Super Mutants came out of the woodwork Deathclaws began to resettle old territory gangs and bandits were born en masse in the chaos. Within a few weeks of the start of the conflict most of the NCR was either occupied or a frontline. Not a city remained in the hands of the government. Californians were introduced to more and more biological horrors as Panems scientists adopted Americas prewar inventions and expanded on them. It was by this time that President Kimball authorized the use of nuclear warheads and weaponized FEV to attempt to throw back the invasion. Numerous nuclear devices were snuck into cities nationwide and detonated while more special forces were planted in an attempt to infect the water supply of the Capitol with FEV.Nuclear terrorism was the final straw for the oligarchs of the Capitol and tactical nuclear warfare was authorized inside California. It isnt clear how many weapons were used throughout the country nor is it clear how many they killed initially or in the ensuing years. What is clear is that every moderatelysized military outpost in NCR was reduced to nuclear ash. Four months into the war the NCR sued for peace.Or so it seemed. President Kimballs last order before surrendering to the nearest Panem general was to send The New Vegas Reserve the forces of NCR that had been trapped on the small islands where New Vegas used to exist when the universal jump occurred into Panem to raise hell. They shipped across the sea and landed in District . Between them and the Free California Forces at home still fighting on as guerillas the war would continue for several more months.It was at the time of the official surrender that the efforts of the agitators inside Panem bore fruit in the form of open rebellion. With so many troops in California attempting to destroy the last vestige of freedom and democracy in the world tensions at home had begun to mount. Peaceful demonstrations soon turned to riots and they turned into street fighting. Aided by Californian implants the people of Panem were able to organize into an army to take on the Capitol. District after district joined the uprising and were able to almost totally isolate the Capitol.Eight months after the initiation of hostilities the forces of the Twelve Districts were at the doorstep of the Capitol supported by the remnants of the New Vegas Reserve. Most of California had been vacated to try to defeat the rebels but ultimately this was in vain. Overstretched Panem simply did not have the resources to prosecute a two front war of attrition. What remained of their military flocked to the Capitol proper ready to die in defense of the city.How exactly FEV was introduced into the city has never come to light. Upon the realization that the weapon had been introduced the commanders of the Californian forces advocated immediately sealing the tunnels out of the city. This advice was followed and for two weeks the city was left to rot. They say that the screams of the dying could be heard for miles. When biohazard troops finally entered the Capitol some time later they found a town awash in blood. And so only a few short months after hostilities commenced the war ended. The new Panem a federal democracy like California signed a treaty of friendship with the survivors of the nuclear holocaust.  Californians died in the War of the East while an unknown number of Panem citizens perished. War it was thought had finally become a thing of the past. But war...war never changes.,WhoWouldWinSerials,cf5cer3,6,t5_2z7qz
