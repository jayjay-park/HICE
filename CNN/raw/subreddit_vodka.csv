2725956,0,t3_2r9rr4,Interesting title. Where are you from and how  low quality is svedka considered over there? Svedka was launched in India some time ago and it has been priced and positioned as a pretty decent quality vodka  at the same level as absolut or finlandia. Im wondering if this is just a marketing gimmick by getting us to pay premium prices for shit vodka. ,vodka,cndxhga,3,t5_2r0x5

7962747,0,t1_d4ayqas,This makes me sad. My next venue is in Tokyo but it would be interesting to try maybe just a popup in the US. Vodka education... Nalewka and nastoyka are such an integral part of central and eastern European zymological culture its a shame that people only know of vodka and borszcz.,vodka,d4b37cp,1,t5_2r0x5

9859205,0,t3_5gdxwn,I see you had your first real vodka. The four winds are pleased and you are now an honorary Slav. What country were you in? I can help you narrow it down considerably maybe even find the exact one. Go for Chopin Belvedere Stoli Elit ubrwka or any other good nonamerican Rye or Potato vodkas for a safe bet.I have to completely disagree with uMasennnus  do NOT look for high numbers of filtrations and distillations! Nine times out of ten this is done by larger industrial companies to try and hide the low quality of their base spirit. The best vodka is never distilled more than three times and some of the best of all is even only distilled once.,vodka,dasoecf,4,t5_2r0x5
10456270,0,t1_dct9pr0,You sir are a gem I come by it at a nye party so dont have any better pictures unfortunately. Your right about it tasting good got me drunk from the legs up. My girlfriends uncle picked it up in Russia so thats where my guess was. I hope I get to sample it again someday. ,vodka,dctbmtm,2,t5_2r0x5
