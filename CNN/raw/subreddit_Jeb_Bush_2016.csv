6595423,0,t3_4527fa,I also notice that posts with links to certain threads at worldlawdirect.com mapleleafweb.com and rabble.ca that talk about some book manuscripts being seized and drug smuggling with firends of Jeb Bush are being deleted. Here is one of them  See post  after reading the below so you understand the realtionship between Bush Harper Chism Huxtable and the crooked FBI agent named Terry Nelson who CIA pilot Chip Tatum admits meeting at the Florida home of Bush.QUOTEChism used the machines to count out . million from the  million in cash that was delivered to the office earlier that week by Finta. Nelson himself would never touch moneys anywhere inside North America  only in Panama or the Bahamas. Chism then banded the money and wrote initials on the bands JB and on five smaller stacks of  each he wrote K. He then instructed me to take all the cash and meet with Katherine Harris in Boca Raton. He said I would meet her at the Hilton and to ensure that we met privately and not to let her open the Versace bag on the hotel premises. I asked if he needed a receipt and he replied Not necessary.He also then told me Be sure she understands that  million is for Jeb and she can keep the change I noticed that Eddie was a bit agitated and so I asked Problems in Paradise?. He looked up at me let out a long sigh and then a brief explanation that supplied the missing pieces of a previous conversation we had. Manny will not get released for a penny less than  million and that was NOT the original deal we had. I knew Eddie had more than  million readily available to him and could not understand why he did not just pay off the ransom and rescue Noriega asap. When I then asked him this very question he replied. I am stuck in an expensive chess match now and if I pay the ten they may demand fifty. This way they think I am not flush and will be glad to get what they can. And if they want to milk me I will do the same and get the most for my money. Having a friendly Governor will be good for business. This Bush gang is a greedy bunch Tony and I regret ever meeting that snake.I helped Eddie put the money in the fancy designer bag and was about to leave to make my special delivery when I realized I did not even know what Katherine Harris looked like. Eddie began giving me her description when my phone rang. What timing  it was Harris herself. Eddie then confirmed he had given her my number in case there were any problems in locating one another. But now as I answered the phone Harris said there was a change of plans and that I should deliver the package to a friend of hers who lived on Singer Island. She claimed she had to attend to another matter but her friend would accept delivery for her and she trusted him completely. She gave me an address which was somewhat familiar to me since my friend Elvin Feltner also lived at Singer Island in the same community. Not feeling comfortable with the sudden change I told Harris I would call her back in a few minutes.I was suddenly getting flashbacks to when Eddie wanted me to take that locked briefcase to Venezuela in their plan to make Chavez a partner. After hanging up the phone with Harris I looked at Eddie and asked Why do I feel like I am being set up Eddie? He seemed genuinely puzzled so I finally decided to tell him about my IRS fiasco years before and how I was led to have a phony meeting with an undercover FBI agent in a Miami office building. I replayed the story in great detail for him and actually he seemed amused. But I was not laughing. That little ruse cost me  months of my life. Now Eddie was pushing me out the door and advising me Just be cool and dont get yourself pulled over for speeding!UNQUOTEI think you should know that this is not the first book manuscript to be stolen via government dirty tricks. In  a book entitled THE SECRET TEAM written by a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel named Fletcher B. Prouty was released by Ballantine Books. Although  copies were published less than  copies were ever sold before a single buyer bought the inventory and Ballantine did not do a second printing and Ian Ballantine refuses to give an explanation. Something similar happened with another book called IMMACULATE DECEPTION  Inside the Bush Crime Family written by an Army General named Russell Bowen who has not been seen in years since ,Jeb_Bush_2016,d01iri0,1,t5_369dq
