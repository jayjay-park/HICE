515777,1,t1_cfyqzc1,gt I have been wearing the Balestras for over a year and a half now as an epee and during this time my opinion of them has drastically changed. gtAt first they were perfect to me light grippy and sufficient to my expectations of a good fencing shoe. However over time them virtually falling apart showed me that Nike really is the king of sports merchandise and could sell anything to nearly anyone. gtThe first issue that I had noticed was the poor quality in the materials used to construct the key points of the shoe. The laces for example are held together by loops of fabric attached to the inside of the shoe instead of holes that run up and down the sides of the shoe where the laces are threaded through. This means that at random times in a bout the loops would snap leaving the fencer with a busted fencing shoe and loose laces a HUGE nono on the strip. gtAnother main point of concern that I had run into while fencing in the Balestras was the quick tendency of the sole to wear down from one of the grippiest most satisfyingfeeling shoe soles into a surface friction akin to having a curling stone glide across an ice rink covered in lube. gtThat bad. NO JOKE HERE THAT BAD. gtIts only a matter of time before most fencers run into the same issue as many of my buddies with the Balestras feel the same way. gtAnother issue that many fail to consider is the fact that these shoes designed specifically for fencing fail to recognize the specific demands of the human body in the fencing position. gtOverall the shoes are very soft and rather flimsy in their structural integrity. This then equates to poor support of the arch and the ankles causing soreness and pretty sharp pain after a long day of fencing. If you tend to jump around on the strip I fall in this category the soft shoe may allow your back foot to slide around laterally. Mixed with sweat and heat BAM! youve got yourself a   blister right on the ball of your foot. gtMy final point of concern with the Nike Zoom Balestras is the blatant disregard for the wellbeing and safety Nike has for the athlete with the shoe. Again the company claims that the shoe is designed for fencing and aims to be the most advanced fencing shoe on the market in order to maximize the fencers potential. Has anyone else noticed the extension of the side of the sole that runs up the inside of the shoe? link at the bottom gtIts the little bit of extra rubber that helps keep the fencers back foot gripped when lunging signifying that the intention of the fencer is to roll their back foot onto the inner side of their foot. I used to suffer from the issue of lunging without putting my foot flat on the floor and instead rolled my back foot so I would rest it on the side of the shoe. gtAfter noticing it my coach explained the dangers of lunging in that manner how the rolling of the foot may cause serious damage to not only the ankle and the foot but to the Achilles tendon and calf muscles citation needed but coach of  years of experience with all three weapons is a pretty good source of fencing information. gtI know this post was way too long but I feel that this issue should have been illuminated earlier and I really wanted to have the opportunity to say what I feel people should know. I may get a lot of flak for something like this but I can only hope someone can benefit from realizing that  is a lot of money that really could be going nowhere by purchasing the Balestras. gtIt really is all a matter of opinion and personal preference when it comes to finding what works for you in your fencing but I know for a fact that I definitely will not be buying the Nike Zoom Balestras again.gt gt Link to picture of shoe  notice the piece of the sole running partially up the side near the front of the shoegt gt TLDR Used to like them now they make me want to wish I had bought wooden clogs filled with live hamsters instead as they would make for a better fencing shoe.

654579,0,t3_21mai3,gt The French grip vs. Pistol grip debate seems to be a huge thing in the fencing world right now. It really is NOT in Foil.  The higher echelons of Foil fencing are unanimously in favor of pistol grips of one kind or another.  Seriously there are ZERO nationally competitive Foilists using a french grip. The pistol allows more precision in parries and attacks especially when fencing at the speed most good fencers can command.  I am completely unconvinced that any serious advantage is gained by a french grip in foil.  In Epee the extra length is a real advantage.  I dont believe that you get more finger control with a French.  The prongs of the pistol mean you can use your third and fourth fingers more with the pistol and execute beats parries and disengages more crisply without using your wrist in a way you could not do with a french grip.I have yet to meet a Foil fencer in  years who can actually demonstrate a french grips advantage on the strip.  If I get a guy that uses a French grip in my pool  of the time hes terrible.I admit my tone is harsh but competition has judged the french grip very harshly in the last  years of Foil.  Please dont be afraid to get used to a pistol you owe it to yourself to get the most out of your training.,Fencing,cgeobs5,7,t5_2r6ai

Anything you are getting called against you consistently by a ref even if legalistically not against the rules should be a thing you have a plan to address.  Chances are that ref may not be the last ref to ever call it on you in your fencing life.Try having a friend take some video of you in practice see if you can spot what the ref was seeing.

1511324,0,t3_2bgxl1,If youre starting with sabre you shouldnt be worrying about point control until you are quite advanced or as your flair indicates you already have some experience with point control on another weapon. In sabre you use your manipulators index finger amp thumb and wrist to move the weapon to the target. The aids other fingers provide extra power amp stability of grip.Squeeze is a very poor term in my opinion because it sounds like a death grip to me. When taking a parry you merely provide enough pressure on the thumb to keep the blade in place on contact and that should be very little. I agree on the matter of the delicate grip. As well you should learn edge control  to make accurate cuts  from movement as those will be the fastest and least predictable.,Fencing,cj5py1j,3,t5_2r6ai

Remember as long as you stay dynamic and moving distance is the best defense there is! A parry can be counterparried or disengaged etc. Distance gives you safety! Ive gone and every other fencer who has fenced for years has done the same from better opponent to better opponent getting my rear handed to me every night. FOR YEARS! You dont want to win a practice match you want to practice! Youre not out there to win the Thursday knight trophy youre there to learn. Tournaments are for trophies everything else is for learning. And the biggest challenge is to be able to move fluently so youre not concentrating on your feet! I started out fencing in Germany and my coach didnt let me hold a weapon for the first nine months. Just footwork everyday footwork until I got it right. It takes a while but its worth it!,Fencing,ctgp836,2,t5_2r6ai

5522899,0,t3_3qn4km,So Ive read your other comments and it sounds like you are preparing your blades properly.I think you just need a different glue.My go to glue for several years is polyurethane because it expands and a good glue job will usually out last the life of the blade.I can use it to glue over wires that were originally superglued that have popped out.  Without recleaning the blade.Polyurethane expands and will encase the wire completely in glue.  Sometimes will even fix a blade wire whose insulation has come off and is grounding to the blade.I currently buy Gorilla GlueI leave my blades under tension for  hours to let the glue cure.After the glue is dry I sometimes will cut away some of the extra glue that has expanded out of the groove.My application procedure . I apply the glue to generously cover wire.  . Use a small screwdriver to spread glue evenly and remove excess glue.  . Leave for  minutes.  . Use screwdriver to remove more excess glue.  . Repeat amp once more.. return in  hours.Have fun.,Fencing,cwhllwk,1,t5_2r6ai

5878423,0,t3_3vrhu7,Well went to my first Div I NAC. Got to the venue warmed up blah blah usual stuff. Felt pretty good and had a decent lesson with my coach. Got a pool of  few of whom Ive fenced before. Won the first  using basically the same strategy. I made sure to watch their tempo and prep into their advance which was good. Lost the next bout due to trying to implement a strategy which I thought made sense given what Id seen of my opponent. Turns out it didnt so I lost two points there. Next bout my opponent didnt seem interested in attacking and I didnt want to do anything stupid so I mainly focused on feints. We go down to priority I get it but he catches me under the hand when I lose focus and do the wrong prep. Ah well  Ill take it. Got warmed up again for DEs found my pod and my opponent. Took a while for them tocall us but my opponent and I were pretty good sports about it. We started fencing he got up early until it was . My coach had left at this point probably to watch my teammate fence Gabe Canaux. Anyways I said fuck it and shifted strategies doing mainly fleches and double coupes. I tied it up at  but then he started fleching back. Turns out my counterattacks are only really effective against rightys. I know. Stupid. I really should practice against lefties. But anyways he now has a magic bullet against me. I try to use more parries and attack before he fleches me but he wins . In the end Im not too mad about my result. I made it out of pools with a decent result and fenced an alright DE. I could have given up at  but instead I pushed and came back. Also managed to pick up STMs which are a bitch to find in New York. However I felt that kid was totally beatable. Plus I would have fenced Jake Hoyle afterwards which would have been cool. After this tournament Im a lot more focused on getting better.

6500641,0,t1_czrbcva,gt the only way to do it is to watch World Cup bouts and try to be consistent with World Cup refsJust a word of caution. This is good advice for someone who has some experience with fencing at that level or close to it but it can completely mess up someone whose experience is more shall we say parochial.Toplevel fencers are playing a very sophisticated and subtle game. Its like grandmaster chess  they are seeing doing and reacting to things that the inexperienced fencer is simply not going to see. The referee does not explain their analysis so the inexperienced fencer is forced to relate it to the things they do see which are the wrong things and may even be things the fencer was intentionally doing to misdirect the opponent. So you can learn exactly the wrong lessons if you arent careful.You see this a lot at midlevel tournaments. Fencers charging forward with poorly timed arms and feet or just completely bent arms herkyjerky startstop attacks badly timed attacks on prep completely passive forward marches and various other errors. They see world cup fencers get away with this stuff but they dont understand why they are getting away with it and conclude that its all good fencing. Then they are completely baffled when a superior fencer sees their errors and takes them apart.I recall watching an FIE referee training video years back that tried to deal with this issue directly by illustrating various moves with two fencing masters with brightly coloured weapons. They would perform the move with academic perfection so you understood the basic theory and then they would switch to an actual world championship action that made use of the move. The latter move was anything but academically perfect and was often barely intelligible but if you studied it carefully you could see it and therefore understand why the call went the way it did.,Fencing,czrpre6,4,t5_2r6ai

I brought along one of our assistant coaches in order to get him his Monituer in saber which he successfully passed and I never doubted him.As for me I worked half on epee and half on foil. Much fun. The big thing I need to work on my coaching is change of tempo. My lessons tend to all be at full speed  of the time. I need to go slower and pick rare moments of speed. This is also something my fencing game needs. In foil I finally learned how to counter attack into a   and how to teach it. Its never made sense to me till this weekend. Seems a small thing but its blown my mind. We worked on lots of counter Attucks with s step in and locking out in four. Very rad.Its also opened my eyes to yet another hole in my game. If Im not doing a long absense of blade attack Im doing multiple compound attacks. Both of which typically deserve a counter attack which is my biggest weakness. Ive alwAys been able to see the weakness but never the problem. Now i see it a little more clearly.As for the rest of the camp it was amazing lots of work in timing and how to move as a coach.

Im sorry that I dont have much advice to add from what the others have said in terms of equipment purchases but I was lucky to start just before a tournament took place in San Jose last year. I went there as a spectator and spoke to a few different vendors and kitted myself out for about . I picked some highend equipment FIE mask because it was the most comfortable way too fancy of a bag because I was excited and entry or midrange for other things. Im fencing purely recreationally but I hear there are regular tournaments around here. It might be worth asking at your club if there are any coming up where you could talk to the vendors directly. Also Ive heard that some clubs get gear discounts with some vendors so it might be worth checking with the staff at your club.     Honestly though with real estate prices so high here I find its the club fees that eat the biggest chunk of my fencing budget. I could easily get a set or more of FIE gear for my annual club fees.

It doesnt do much good to teach your fencers random actions without an underlying explanation of when they should use one or the other.Decide whats most important and focus primarily on that.  I had my fencers once a week and only taught them footwork.  They couldnt parry very well but they were always in the right position to parry and so it worked out.Mindlessly doing drills is the wrong way to go.  They need to see it in context.  Plus theyll get bored.Teaching is its own skill.  Basically be patient with your fencers push them hard dont praise them meaninglessly always praise when its due dont let them slack off.  Have fun with it and make sure they do as well.  Try to avoid saying youre wrong but if you do make sure they understand why.  Kids have been conditioned to not be wrong but you have to be wrong to learn.  Make practice a safe space for them to mess up.  I used to give my kids open ended questions and explicitly tell them there are no wrong answers and instead just go around until someone gave me the answer I wanted.  Key phrase here is good answer.  What else?Work them as hard as you can.  If they leave practice dripping sweat and barely able to walk theyll come back.  If they spend all practice talking they wont bother.,Fencing,d3a2xjw,3,t5_2r6ai

Some small set of criteria that can be used to analyse the quality of different situations Ill use the word situations rather than positions.I really like your metrics. Opponent reacting to something youre not doing is a very clear and tangible way to put it. And its really fundamentally the same as opponent reacting too soon to something you were going to do. And it also brings up the obvious opposite opponent not reacting to something you are doing which is the same as reacting too late to something you did do.I think there is probably a at to talk about this in distance terms and talk about being the first one to recognise the distance and bite first and also not biting before the distance is correct.,Fencing,d3emwht,1,t5_2r6ai

I mean if they dont finish the call it might be all right to stop themselves but if they award the point then thats the point.Obviously refs should make the right call in the first place but sometimes refs make mistakes. Hopefully its not an atrociously bad call. If the ref starts changing their calls it shows that when they say something its not yet final and invites fencers and coaches to continue persuading even after they make the call. This affects the control the ref has over the bout and often leads to more bad calls.If the ref makes an incorrect call and immediate knows it after the fact all they can do is hope for video replay and try to make the rest of their calls correctly.,Fencing,d4crqlq,5,t5_2r6ai

Competing gives a new dimension to your training and lets you fence against different people different styles and have to adapt to different refereeing and a whole bunch of other variables you dont get it club. It gives you something measurable although not alway reliable to gauge your progress against. Most people including nearly anyone competing seriously fence on another level at competitions. It is nearly impossible to improve beyond a certain point without competing. Most importantly it is fun get to travel with club mates learn make friends at other clubs etc. I thoroughly recommend it! Its summer so there is unlikely to be anything until about September although I dont know about where you live but ask your coach or one of the senior fencers if there is a club trip coming up. Anything smallish and local would be good. Other than that fence your best good luck have fun learn and dont have any expectations.,Fencing,d56vgwy,5,t5_2r6ai

This is not always easy to find outside collegiate clubs.  Money making clubs are not this.  If what you want is not there for you dont pretend that it ever will be provided you ask for accommodation and are rejected.  Its ok to take a break.  Ive gone on hiatus for  years at a time.  When the fencing environment wasnt there or work was really busy etc.  Itll come back to you dont worry.  Focus on tournaments.  If your skill level is good you can maintain it yourself and still be competitive in tournaments.  Watch youtube videos practice with a ball and string keep up your cardio with football etc.    Take a larger role in the club.  Ask if you can help younger students earlier for some reduced cost of your own fees.  Teaching can be a great method of learning.

10914744,0,t1_de5r8tx,Hmm honestly Ive been trying to avoid just getting the essentials. I have  blades  body cords  gloves and etc. Its just that I forgot the spare parts in my university town while I was home for the week and my main blade picked today of all days to start breaking down haha.But yeah Im considering getting a couple more blades I think  isnt doing it right now.,Fencing,de5s15d,1,t5_2r6ai

11011044,0,t3_5x6wc9,What weapon do you fence? That matters some. Sabre has the most expensive equiptment and by far the cheapest blades. Epee has cheaper clothing and pricy blades. Foil is in the middle. Also what you need for each one and in chich order changes slightly. As a general rule for any weapon my first purchase would be a glove. Second purchase a mask. Third a plasteron. For weapons in sabre youll be pretty much fine using team stuff indefinately. In foil and epee  I cant recommend buying your own weapons soon enough after you know that youre comitting to the sport. The caveat here is that in foil and epee if you think youre only going to be buying one blade you are dead wrong. I have a few teammates who after  and  years fencing respectively have just started buying their own FIE weapons only to be severely dissappointed when they start having electrical problems. I told him that theres a reason that my fencing bag has  FIE blades in it. Two work and are good enough for tournaments. One is on the edge and is becoming too flexible. One has shed six wires and is now a practice only blade. Another is close to breaking and I fucked up when I re wired it as well and need to troubleshoot. I also broke another FIE blade yesterday that was on its last legs. Obviously nobody buys five or six blades at once when you start. But with blades it takes some experiamentation to figure out what you like. When you fence  hours a week plus tournaments your blades go out at the worst possible times. Also with blades you get what you pay for. Im a foil fencer but I fence epee on occasion. Ive always used team blades and Ive managed to snap or shatter four different blades in about ten times on the strip. The team epees are cheap old nonFIE blades and when I fence with any degree of intensity they dissentigrate. On the other hand I have foil FIE blades that have lasted me almost  years. ,Fencing,deg2ko6,3,t5_2r6ai

11143068,0,t3_5z2w6a,As the tournament organizer and a member of YJFC this is the official statement on the black card issue with regards to the rating and decisions of the eventThe YJO staff submitted the formal report to the Georgia Division heads this morning and informed them of the outcome of the events as they were reported. They let us know sometime at noon that the proper interpretation of USFA rulesT. . A competitor who is excluded from a competition may not continue to take part in that competition even if he is already qualified for promotion to the next round. He loses the right to his individual classification and the place that he occupied remains unfilled but the points obtained by the fencer up to the moment of his expulsion remain valid for the classification of the team in the team event providing that he actually take.During the event the YJO staff interpreted and applied the rules in such a way that Ayman was considered only a spectator since he was no longer fencing in any events after the final handshake of the final bout of Open Epee. The Georgia Division heads informed us that the proper interpretation was also based on this caveatT. b During or after a bout even if the fencer has already left the strip any act against the spirit of sportsmanship such as violently or dangerously throwing ones mask or any other piece of equipment will be penalized as specified in Article t. cf. t..  and .Consequently a silver medal cannot be awarded to Ayman Fayez. The one awarded is being retracted immediately and the event is thus an A. There is no decision to be made here as the USFA rules are very clear on this matter. The choice was made the moment Mr. Fayez kicked his mask into a crowd of spectators. If you have any further questions Ill be happy to answer them. I know this is disappointing for any fencers who lost out on a potential ratings but the rules have to be followed especially when violations endanger the health and safety of spectators.,Fencing,dev200a,18,t5_2r6ai

11534330,0,t3_64i54l,Div  summer national qualifiersSo the day already starts bad as I wake up late and dont have much time to do equipment check and warm up. Come equipment check my mask fails and one of my LP cords falls apart. So I have to shell out  bucks on new equipment. Not a good start.However I was on my game apparently. I dominated pools going  only losing to a D rated fencer. I came out tied for the nd seed. However during a pool bout as Im bending my LP blade with my hand to straighten it the thing straight up snaps in half. Shit. Thankfully the owners were there and they were kind enough to forge me a new one quick for  bucks. It has a blue blade too so its cool. DEs Im going against an obviously new and young fencer if I put energy into it I would have won  but I wanted to conserve so I won T  Going against another U thats of my skill level. However he had his coach there and I didnt after leading  at the break his coach saw what I was doing and I didnt adapt or finish my actions well enough after that. Ended up losing .Overall th place. Qualified for Div  nationals which Im extremely proud of ive been fencing competitively for barely a year now. Hoping to get lucky in a d roc before nationals to qualify but we will see. Tldr won th place qualified for div and was pissed on spending  bucks on equipment breaking.,Fencing,dg3f2u7,2,t5_2r6ai
