2738455,0,t3_2reiwa,The upgrade path you list sounds right to me as far as XI R gt XI R gt BI ..  Im not sure about CRS  as we dont use it as a discrete component we use BIP to run Crystal Reports.The software you need would probably have to be downloaded via one of the SAP portals.  Have you tried via the portal as below?  In general I will use the SAP Service Marketplace to communicate with them and request keys etc.This comment may be helpfulIf you are interested in downloading an unsupported version of software report an incident using component XXSERSWFLSHIP,crystalreports,cnfcmpy,1,t5_2uf4g
