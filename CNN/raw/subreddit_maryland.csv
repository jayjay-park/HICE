284286,0,t3_1x8a5z,Thanks for posting this. You just inspired me to write this up and send to my HoCo reps gt  I hope youre enjoying your weekend despite the cloudy weather. Im writing you to voice my support of the various efforts in the state to legalize or decriminalize marijuana and also legalize industrial hemp.  gt I am not a current marijuana user and have not used it in over  years even then I was an infrequent user. I served the nation in the Navy as a cryptologist and worked at Fort Meade for  years. Im currently working as an information security professional for a startup company and bought my first home in September . I mention this because I want to make it clear that I am a contributing member of society who believes current marijuana prohibition and enforcement is a detriment to our state. gt I believe marijuana is no more harmful than alcohol and its distribution can be controlled in a similar manner. Legalization would bring in additional revenue for the state while also reducing time and resources spent arresting prosecuting and incarcerating citizens caught with marijuana. gt  As Im sure youre aware there is also an effort to decriminalize marijuana and levy a fine on offenders instead of arrest and prosecution. While this falls short of plans to fully legalize the substance for recreational use I do think it is a step in the right direction. gt If either of these measures go forward I also believe that people who have been convicted of marijuana crimes should have their record cleared of said crimes. Also individuals currently serving sentences relating to marijuana should be pardoned of those charges and released from prison where appropriate.gt Lastly I also believe current marijuana enforcement unjustly affects minorities. This causes more harm than good and is devastating to families. gt  I look forward to hearing your views on this topic and hope you enjoy the rest of the weekend.gt Also Id like to invite you to browse and post to the Maryland subreddit at  It is an excellent way to connect with constituents. For anyone else interested in writing their reps this site makes it easy to find them and their email addresses ,maryland,cfa8awa,3,t5_2qnnv

The place to start is in smaller elections like for state delegate or county council where partisan politics dont necessarily dominate. If a third party can gain power through local elections their influence can grow to the point where they can be a viable candidate in a large election.

It wasnt even until the Clean Air Act that the relationship between industrial companies and fluoridating that you describe really took hold  there happened to be industrial waste that could no longer be put into the atmosphere safely hydrogen fluoride and they figured out they could make money back on its disposal by treating it in such a way that when added to water it destabilizes and becomes Fl and the other ions you find in natural water systems.The science of it being safe is old as fuck and peer reviewed again and again and again and again and again and again and again.

3467526,0,t3_2zyhi2,I did Skydive Baltimore with some friends this time last year. Ill get this out of the way immediately  one of the guys in our group broke his leg. It was his first time tandem jumping and he was a bigger guy probably close to the weight limit if not exceeding it. The instructors tell you to hold your legs out straight when you land and to let them do all the work. This guy couldnt get his legs out straight though and slammed down kind of hard on his shins. I got the whole thing on camera One member on staff said in the ish years she had worked there shed never seen anyone be seriously hurt. I still had to do my jump at this point and I was scheduled to jump with the same instructor as the guy who had just been carted off to the hospital. I went ahead with it and made damn sure to have my legs out when we landed and we made it just fine.The timing of our visit wasnt a great decision as it was cold and all the trees were still dead so the view was just kind of bleak but that was our fault since we went in March. The view is nice I think I could see some water but I dont really recall. We had  people in our group I think but their plane is tiny and only takes  tandem jumps at a time. We arrived at  AM but the last person in our group landed by  PM or so.I got the video package but was a little disappointed by it. They shot it all on a GoPro but then threw it into their crappy video editor and burned it to a DVD. The resulting footage was edited weirdly with some electronic music and deinterlaced correctly. I had to import it and clean it up. I really would have preferred the raw GoPro footage but oh well.,maryland,cpniu4w,2,t5_2qnnv

But with its lyrics as is thats really not possible.In the Civil War unit in school my teachers did a good job talking about how Maryland was more agricultural back then a slave state a border state and how it had plenty of Confederate sympathizers. I dont see why changing the state song would preclude teachers from teaching that history. Theres a difference between whitewashing history books and trying not to honor people who wanted to break away from the Union.You could change the song and still teach about how there were riots in Baltimore because of Confederate sympathies. You could change the song and heck you could still use this song in a class to talk about how well it illustrates the point that Marylanders had plenty of Confederate sympathizers.When does it start being revisionism? When you start pretending it didnt happen. When you teach it incorrectly in schools.Not now when were simply changing a song with hilariously outdated views that calls Lincoln a despot.I mean West Virginia has Take Me Home Country Roads and they fucking love that song.

Thats not what they want their kids to do says Symonds who is launching the Global Pathways Institute at Arizona State University to study this issue and urge policymakers to help students find the best pathway to success.gt At the same time high schools have dropped vocational and technical education programs over the past  years eliminating a key way young people are introduced to these careers.gt Over the last  or  years weve portrayed work differently and we reward some forms of education far more passionately than others says Mike Rowe host of Somebodys Gotta Do It and Dirty Jobs. After working bluecollar jobs across the country for his show Rowe started a foundation mikeroweWORKS to address the image problem.gt Higher education is in one column and everything else is called alternative. And those kinds of pursuits are reserved for people who are somehow deficient or somehow not cut out for the desirable path.gtRowe worries there are too many young people going to fouryear colleges racking up huge amounts of debt and ultimately ending up unemployed when they couldve taken a lessexpensive path and ended up with a goodpaying job,maryland,d0ccxoc,1,t5_2qnnv

11244001,0,t3_606cg8,This is the most fallacious argument Ive ever seen and seems like youre more intent on making evidence to support your opinion... than actually having a logical opinion.A The names of groups means nothing. It doesnt defame a practice because some groups choose violent names. Look at the names of street basketball teams or video game groups. Would you make presumptions based off those? I suppose you believe video games cause violenceB If you had a legitimate complaint against the person you were videotaping confronting him on private property and videotaping without his permission is wrong. I would hope incidents like Trayvon Martin might remind you that you dont go looking for trouble... you let the law handle it. Youre the one thats in the wrong and looks bad discrediting your entire argument.C Like names attempting to tie the practice of bowhunting rays to White supremacy is non sequitur. You are generalizing an entire organization and practice based off of singular individuals. It would be like claiming that every streetball game is gang related because gang members enjoy streetballD If you think the treatment of these rays is that unethical then are you a vegan? The treatment of most animals from hunting to agriculture would shock most people. Even the most ethical and organic farm slaughterhouse would shock the sensibilities of people live in ignorance of where their food comes from. While it might be wasteful the actual killing of these rays is no different. Not to mention at least the waste is going back into the ecosystem where other animals can feast on them... which is more than can be said about our food byproductsIf you want to make a point dont create sensational nonsense full of ad hominems non sequiturs and false analogies. Otherwise you look no different than people on the other side of the fence defending their own ignorant behaviors.,maryland,df6hoko,3,t5_2qnnv
