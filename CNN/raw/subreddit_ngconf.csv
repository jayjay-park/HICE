But the main reason for asking the question is to uncover a vision from the team especially compared to that of the React team  The point that React is not focusing on web components is an interesting one thanks.And yes React is focusing on the view which is why I asked about using them together but what with Relay and GraphQL I think its clear that theres more coming from that direction to replace other parts of Angular.,ngconf,cp5cld6,1,t5_379w9

If you are in this use case then it is extremely important that the initial page load for your app is extremely fast. How fast? At GetHuman our goals are ms TTFB amount of time for the client to get the initial response from the server and s document complete i.e. the user seeing all the content on the page. We have seen from our own experience and there are many studies from Google that when your site renders extremely quickly it has a dramatic effect on lowering your bounce rate and as a result your search ranking since Google tracks that.I talked about this and a lot more in my talk last night. I will post a link here once they have the video up on YouTube but feel free to let me know if you have any other questions.,ngconf,cp5njuh,2,t5_379w9
