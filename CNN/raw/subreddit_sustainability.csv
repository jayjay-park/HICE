2594877,0,t3_2pd5u7,I think all the concepts he discusses make perfect sense and is something everyone should be aware of. Quick question though from a current college student minoring in sustainability studies...What as a young  year old am i supposed to do when learning all these wonderful ideas? I would definitely like to eventually live in a building with a net positive impact but until those are more readily available and within a young persons price range what should i be doin?  I cant start my own architecture firm or afford to hire someone to build me a net positive house.Just a general question as I always ponder what I can do as a young man with limited finances regarding this topic and when learning about topics such as the impact agriculture and eating meat and other random sustainability issues. ,sustainability,cmxacy0,2,t5_2qjtc

Most people dont have access to bulk stores or the time necessary to prepare and cook like she does. She eventually finds challenges even she cannot surmount. Regardless shes innovative and creative in finding ways to still enjoy lots of goods without the garbage.But Beas not alone. I just got back from the Zero Waste Youth Convergence as a part of Zero Waste Week in Berkeley CA and theres some hardcores there with their little jars of trash.

5608998,0,t3_3ryaqh,Within  Years Humanity to Undergo Greatest Energy Shift Since the Industrial RevolutionBy Justin Gardner on Nov  image Within  years humanity will experience the greatest transformation of its energy paradigm since the introduction of fossil fuels. Instead of relying on the finite ancient remains of living things renewable sources of power from the earth and sun will take us into the next era.Bloombergs New Energy Finance research unit recently published a report on the cost of electricity worldwide and it shows that clean renewable energy is becoming mainstream.The Bloomberg report says that the average cost of electricity generated by wind farms on land not offshore throughout the world dropped to  per megawatt hour in the second half of this year. At the same time electricity generated by solar panel farms fell to  per megawatt hour.In comparison the cost of electricity from coal and natural gas actually rose in the second half of this year. Coalbased electricity cost  per megawatt hour up from  per megawatt hour in North and South America while natural gasbased electricity cost  in North and South America up from  per megawatt hour.What this means is that wind energy is now economically competitive with fossil fuel energy and solar is soon to follow. As clean energy technology and financing costs continue to drop coal oil and natural gas will become increasingly marginalized.A breakthrough technology has just been discovered that turns solar energy into hydrogen fuel. This has the ability to supplant gasoline for transportation.Adding to the monetary cost of fossil fuels are hidden costs in the form of damage to environmental and human health. The National Academy of Sciences reported that fossil fuel combustion causes  premature deaths in the U.S. every year and  billion a year in health costs.Pollution from extraction and refining operations dumps toxic materials into the atmosphere and aquatic habitats. Coal extraction now relies heavily on a method known as mountaintop removal which destroys vast swaths of forested and aquatic habitat. Not to mention accidents such as BPs Deepwater Horizon disaster and Duke Energys Dan River coal ash spill.The Solar RevolutionBloomberg explains how market forces and efficiency improvements will make solar energy outcompete coal and natural gas to become the primary source within  years.Solar prices will keep crashing solar investments will rise to the trillions and global electricity demand will slow actually declining in some countries. Just as important is the fact that power generation will become decentralized as rooftop solar and regional utilityscale solar systems expand rapidly.The biggest solar revolution will take place on rooftops. High electricity prices and cheap residential battery storage will make smallscale rooftop solar ever more attractive driving a fold increase in installations. By  rooftop solar will be cheaper than electricity from the grid in every major economy and almost  percent of electricity worldwide will be generated from smallscale solar systems.Bloomberg notes that fossil fuels will retain a  percent share of total electricity generation in  down from twothirds today due to legacy plants continuing to operate and developing countries adding coal and gasfired plants for quick capacity increases.However that will be the last gasp of the fossil fuelbased industrial age. The surge of renewable energy creates its own momentum according to Seb Henbest Bloombergs head of Europe Middle East and Africa analysis.Nonetheless the pattern is changing and as Henbest explains once there are more renewables online there can actually be a process in which their utilization undermines fossil fuels. Thats because renewable installations dont require any fuel to operate and thus dont have that recurring cost that fossil fuelfired generation has.So as renewables bid in low to supply power to the grid they come to supply more of it  meaning that fossil fuel plants operate less.You start to go from a world where renewables are expensive to a world where renewables are actually cheap. And thats very meaningful Henbest says.The simple reality is that renewable energy will soon make more economic sense. It will also allow people to harness energy from their own localized regions instead of relying on importation from volatile areas. The oilrich Middle East may see an end to the decades of western meddling that has kept the region in upheaval.The transition to renewable energies through market forces will be one of the greatest achievements of mankind. No longer will we have to level mountains create massive piles of ash build pipelines through sensitive habitats and spew pollution into the air and water in order to satisfy our thirst for energy.Read more at ,sustainability,cwscmsg,1,t5_2qjtc

Its hard to live on this planet and not bear constant witness to pollution crowding overdevelopment and the tireless pursuit of exploitation incentivized by our markets.  The problem isnt that we dont know were having a severe impact the problem is that our economic survival and by implication our actual shortterm survival depends on so many of these horrible exploitative systems.  What is the public to actually do?  Its going to take a revolution to uproot the foundations of our money and the laws that let governments and banks take your home from you if you dont have the money.,sustainability,d3kchz7,2,t5_2qjtc

8524211,0,t1_d672n8g,I would like to think we can figure out a way to tax things like large suvs campers private planes yachts etc. and tax to a lesser degree all fossil fuels but I think people would flip out.  Maybe they can figure out a way for people that have a low income that they get a credit to be able to heat their home fill up their tank etc. to a reasonable degree.  But what do you really think can be cut back on? Vacation flights? Roadtrips? Home heating? Not meaningfully!Taxing meat and dairy would be much much more beneficial but I dont think people will go for that. People freak out when you threaten their lifestyle.Point is I really dont think we can bring down consumption per capita meaningfully through lifestyle changes.  Only ways are population and scientific innovation like solar.  And ultimately the scarcity of resources will but thats what were trying to avoid... the scarcity of resources!,sustainability,d67377m,2,t5_2qjtc

9468352,0,t3_5ackc5,Golden rice is a bit of a question on the sustainability front.  The thought of modifying agricultural goods has potential for of sustainability but the details matter.  Check out this scholar who has done some incredible work on golden rice Abstract from one of his freely available publications on his website Abstract Golden Rice has played a key role in arguments over genetically modified GM crops for manyyears. It is routinely depicted as a generic GM vitamintablet in a generic plant bound for the global South. But therelease of Golden Rice is on the horizon only in thePhilippines a country with a storied history and complicated present and contested future for rice production andconsumption. The present paper corrects this blinkeredview of Golden Rice through an analysis of three distinctive rice worlds of the Philippines Green Revolutionrice developed at the International Rice Research InstituteIRRI in the s Golden Rice currently being bred atIRRI and a scheme to promote and export traditionalheirloom landrace rice. More than mere seed typesthese rices are at the centers of separate rice worlds withdistinctive concepts of what the crop should be and how itshould be produced. In contrast to the common productivistframework for comparing types of rice this paper compares the rice worlds on the basis of geographical embeddedness or the extent to which local agroecologicalcontext is valorized or nullified in the crops construction.The Green Revolution spread generic disembedded highinput seeds to replace locally adapted landraces as well aspeasant attitudes and practices associated with them. Thedisembeddedness of Golden Rice that boosts its value as apublic relations vehicle has also been the main impedimentin it reaching farmers fields as it has proved difficult tobreed into varieties that grow well specifically in thePhilippines. Finally and somewhat ironically IRRI hasrecently undertaken research and promotion of heirloomseeds in collaboration with the export scheme.,sustainability,d9g6h9h,1,t5_2qjtc
