Aside from these two series... not much else. I am a fan of JRPGs but I find it hard to find a good one as most dont appeal to my interests. I think my hesitation with Xillia is that I dont have a whole lot of time to devote to games. The length of the game isnt a problem but the length each play session could be an issue.

268908,0,t3_1x6mp4,Let me see hereGBA Zoids Legacy Its a lot like Front mission but instead of military mechs you have awesome Zoids and its turnbased but has a lot of customization. Medabots Another mecha JRPG that lets you customize it and battle. Super Robot Taisen Original Generation  you can change pilots weapons and even mechas you also have a the ability to customize skill and perks and even state points plus its just an awesome SRPG.DS Dragon Quest IX You can customize everything about every character from their look to their equipment and if you are one of the people who gets turned off by Dragon Quests firstperson POV in combat then youll be happy to hear that this is one doesnt follow that tradition. Etrian Odyssey series Like most dungeon crawlers you can customize everything about every character in your party. Infinite Space A lot of customization including your spaceship which is also your home base. Rune Factory series In the vain of Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing you can customize everything about your farm and home and even youre character to some degree with the add bonus of combat. SaGa  Another dungeon crawler game like ones I mentioned before that also lets customize everything about your character. Front Mission series There are two of them on the DS if you havent played them yet give them a try.PSP Class of Heroes  Another console another dungeon crawler. ClaDun x A dungeon crawaler with a retro look if you are into that. Phantasy Star Portable  This one is different its a dungeon crawler BUT! its in the future plus you can be an awesome looking mecha in this game you can be on in the SaGa games too but its not as cool as this one. Z.H.P Basically everything is customizable from your weapons to your base and to even your own body. Carnage Heart EXA You cant go deeper in customization than this game you get to customize your Mechs A.I aka programming a nice game if you wanna get a look of how A.I works in a general way and its just fun to make your own programs and Mech. Harvest Moon series. Phantom BraveDisgea series A dungeon crawler with actually good funny voice acting of course you also get to customize the hell out of everything you can even go into your weapons and upgrade them BY DUNGEON CRAWLING INSIDE! Ragnarok Tactics A tactics game like FFT or Ogre Battle where you can customize almost everything about each of your characters including names color looks. Valkyria Chronicles  Has a good deal of customization if you are into this SRPG series.PS Legend of Mana You get to basically customize the whole map you play on placing cities and jungles or whatever in any place you want you also can make your own Mech and customize his A.I and how he looks and what parts he uses and even what weapons he can use there is just too much to say about how many things you can customize in this game. Front Mission Also another console where you can find Front Mission games.PS Armored Core series I just wanna start by saying while this isnt a JRPG its one of the best if not THEE BEST Mecha customization games ever made the amount you will spend hours just playing around with your Mech changing weapons colors parts frames and even some very complex tuning with your energy distribution dont miss it. Dark Cloud  Both are great games and has a lot of customization options in the first you basically build your own city and change everything you want about it and the nd one has a good if a bit basic Mech customization. Metal Saga To put in short its Metal Max comes to the PS meaning you can customize your very own tank amongst other things...but really if the words you get to have your own Tank dont make up your mind then dont bother or if you werent a fan of the Metal Max series to being with. Steambot Chronicles Its really a stretch to call this a JRPG but the amount of customization and having your own Mech Steambot earns it a place in this list a really great game though in the vain of Megaman Legends. Disgea seriesNipon Ichi games Yea just basically anything from them has a great deal of customization from games like La Pucelle to other like Soul Nomad amp the World Eaters and even Makai Kingdom. Front Mission  I also believe that Front Mission  got fan translation but am not  since it might have been the PS one. Ring of Red This is like Front Mission but better yea I said it I hate how no one mentions this game ever and I pity the people who havent played it.I probably missed some but thats all I can remember right now.,JRPG,cf8ms3h,14,t5_2quw1

I agree with Hironobu Sakaguchi though when he said that Final Fantasy IX was the closest to the original vision of what Final Fantasy should be.FFX is a close second but FFIX edges it out for at least having the strongest and most coherent theme while VI has the best cast and IV had the best characters and VII probably had the best execution of the story.  FFX however is a firm second in all of those categories though and is still one of my favorite games and probably the best Final Fantasy game even if it wasnt quite what the original vision was.P.S. anybody know if the HD release comes undubbed or has that option to toggle?,JRPG,cfquv4s,3,t5_2quw1

CHARMING.Its like playing it I could feel the passion effort and just love the entire development team put into it not to mention the translators at Xseed.The story is definitely good the characters are great and its just the beginning of a trilogy. I cant recommend it enough. This is one of those games that reminds me why I want to go into game development. It has a soul.,JRPG,cg6a8xi,3,t5_2quw1

Now just because I love the game so much Ill be sure to grab this on PSN as well and beat it a third time.The only downside for me from it being vanilla instead of Golden is that its gonna be really odd going back to Chie and Teddies original voice actors especially considering I loved both of their voice actors in Golden.

819194,0,t3_23ifod,Command Mission isnt exactly a bad game it just feels....lazy i guess. in many aspectsI loved the fact that it utilized final fantasy Xs CTB battle system and I just love the setting along with the music. Then you get things like....The characters You get your traditional X Zero and Axl who are cool and all that but then you get characters called Spider Cinnamon Marino and Massimo. Theres a big problem with all these characters. From the moment theyre introduced a bit of character development is immediately thrown at you. This is good because you want these characters to stand out the problem is that once those  minutes of introduction are over the character feels almost completely irrelevant to the story and I mean that in the most literal sense. No really you can be far in the game and most cut scenes will show a random assortment of your playable characters and whats worse is that the additional characters usually wont say anything. Hell the boss battle with Botos has X Zero and Massimo conversing with Botos in cutscene before the battle. X and Zero get their lines in but Massimo he just...just stands there. You might think its a minor complaint but it just gets so annoying seeing these characters stand there lifeless why not just have the whole team there because at least then it wouldnt look so bad. The villains are just as bad because the majority of them feel so damn irrelevant why even include them?Dialogue Oh my god the further you get in the game the worse it becomes. Its only made worse by the terrible voice acting.Botos THIS HERE IS SUPRA FORCE METAL!X SO THATS WHAT IT IS!Story Ehhhh I guess its decent. Lazy but decent I mean props to capcom for making an RPG spin off story line that doesnt have Sigma in it. Difficulty There is none. Once you activate hyper mode on characters like Massimo and Spider you essentially win the game. but like I said it isnt a bad game. Its worth a play through but it isnt something I would constantly come back to.,JRPG,cgxe81j,4,t5_2quw1

849367,0,t1_ch0tet8,Putting my bias aside for a second Vesperia had excellent character depth if you were willing to put in the ridiculous amount of hours necessary to complete all the achievements. You really only scratch the surface if you play through the games story. Ravens character for example had some really nice parts that helped balance out his buffoonery and actually help shed light on why he was so aloof. Hes probably the most troubled character in the game who uses humor to cope with his loss. ,JRPG,ch0tsdr,3,t5_2quw1

I would honestly just be fine with  but the characters that actually got fleshed out in Suikoden II to a reasonable degree didnt impress me THAT much not any moreso than your typical final fantasy game for example. The plotcharacters may have been good for their time but I feel like we are past that now and can expect more. It might also just be my preference for more personal stories I feel like games such as Final Fantasy Tactics had the same problem a lot of optional recruitable characters interesting political drama surrounded by supernatural forces but because of the large scale it ended up feeling a bit impersonal.,JRPG,ch1o4jn,1,t5_2quw1

The story wasnt bad but I couldnt connect with it because I hated most of the characters. The only one who was even a bit sympathetic or likeable was Sazh. Everyone else needed a beating a slap a chill pill or a fat pile of coke.

So long as its not the nd half of the season.  That was pretty poor plot progression and makes me very skeptical of the next season they seem to be teasing.  I should add that I think you should make your own character for it because its not like .Hack where the company has the plot thought out for the anime and the games so it became a cohesive universe though confusing at times.

Most of the time they lock in half of your party with plot characters. So you pretty much just form a team of your favorites and stick with them. And if you need to switch to a new party member for some reason you can grind them up to your level in a matter of a couple quick battles.

The only reason I see that there is no need to this is because Drakengard  is a prequel to the series.I really reccomend tracking down and playing NieR. I will go out and say that NieR is a much more accurate representation of what the talent behind Dgard is capable of doing now and not only that NieR is far superior to the first two Drakengards in terms of music story characterization presentation etc.Its also much better in those regards to both of the other games you are thinking about playing...though it does falter in the gameplay department.,JRPG,chg327i,1,t5_2quw1

1326948,0,t1_ciitgys,Legend of Dragoon is definitely a game I play with nostalgia goggles on. I still love the crap out of it though I beat it last year and Im getting the itch again.My tip? Literally dont grind at all until the very end just before the point of no return right after you kill ghost Lavitz and are about to go to the moon backtrack to one of the rooms just before.spoiler At this point you gain levels and gold pretty fast and have a room with an easy heal point to keep fighting and healing without having to guard forever. A few hours here as opposed to constantly grinding throughout the game will net you plenty of levels like near to beyond  and plenty of gold to buy the best  gold head body and accessory slot items for each member of your main party.

Characters from the Final Fantasy series had a lot of heart and you cant get that from a selfinsert. Often in a WRPG the other characters only matter as they relate to your own character.Also JRPGs tend to do turnbased systems more and focus on deep gameplay elements. They also take more risks with the story with tragedy and such although I havent seen that lately.

It gets pretty much everything right.Microsofts money really helped out with the voice acting and translation. It also has one of the best battle systems but not as good as Graces arguably the best graphics thanks to the art style and some of the best characters.

2046665,0,t3_2i89d2,Yall been asking some intriguing questions lately.Variety in moves. Attack defend item magic run was good in Dragon Quest  because the game was like  hours long max. JRPGs are a genre that need to have variation in combat in order to facilitate the length of the games as they try to tell their entire story.On top of that if youve got a couple dozen actions you can make Id like to still be using  of them by the end of the game. This keeps things fresh. A common complaint i hear about turnbased games is that its mash X to attack over and over and unless youre grinding picking on low leveled enemies or in the beginning of the game good games will avoid thisQuick normal encounters long boss fights. This might cause disagreement with a good amount of you but I dont feel that each individual encounter needs to be a challenge. Enemies in a dungeon should take  party turns to beat in the middle of the game and about  to  by the end of the game. Though they STILL should provide a progressive challenge even if the fights are quickI like when enemies wear you down as you go through a dungeon not this thing that FFXIII and Last Remnant have where each encounter takes a long time but you heal after every battle.My preference is that going through a dungeon should be a survival thing where its a huge decision on whether or not to run or use that potion because youll get your ass kicked if you consume them too fast. Inventory management and spell management should still mean something. My exception is in SRPGs where Im usually done playing after  or  fights anyway because the games are set up completely differently. Short frequent fights as opposed to every fight being long in an SRPG sounds like a pain. In fact many aspects of this post would probably be different when taking SRPGs into account so for now just apply my opinions itp to traditional turnbased gtgtAnyway if youve seen a few of my other posts here you know I friggin love boss fights. But having every encounter be a miniboss kind of takes away from the awesomeness of having actual bosses. But besides that I do like my boss fights to take some time. I like getting anxious against a big HP sponge and again the tension of the decision of whether to pop that potion or try and go in for a kill when your HP is low cant be matched.Alright that will probably be the most controversial out of all theseVariety in enemy type. I dont think anyones gonna argue with me on this one I dont like fighting the same thing every dungeon. Not just aesthetically but enemies should have unique actions and strategies to beat them as well. Although I suppose you can say that about any game ever not just turnbased lolA healthy skilldevelopment system.Half the fun of a turnbased game and in a lot of cases most of the fun is coming up with your strategy before the battle. Having a good job class system or other type of skill development Id say is essential in keeping a turn based game fresh once you hit a few dozen hours. Even CCGs like Yugioh that are turnbased its real fun coming up with a deck before actually going to play. Likewise a turnbased JRPG has to let the player have fun setting stuff up.Good rewards in combat.Make every fight count. Give me gold EXP SP rare items meet a sidequest quota whatever. I know this has less to do with actual combat but thats kind of a point I want to make overall. My preference to make combat good it has to be holistic and encompass multiple aspects of gameplay. A good JRPG has good gameplay outside of its combat too and some of those aspects of gameplay should link together to combat. So having job classes crafting minigames what have you should all be things that make combat something that you can come back to after your hundredth thousandth enemy encounter.,JRPG,ckzz5sj,7,t5_2quw1

2063485,0,t3_2igzpw,Havent played that many SRPGs but I did play quite a bit of Disgaea.You want to play Disgaea if you want to minmax to ludicrous levels which is necessary for the post game content. The story is quirky and characters are loveable but thats just the cherry on top of the grind fueled sundae.Gameplay wise the game is simple. Take unit move unit attack unit. Its the underlying powering up mechanics that add insane amount of depth to the game. Youll be spending a lot of time trying to optimise your partyitems and trying to exploit whatever levelling mechanics to try and reach the highest possible ingame strength.Just remember Disgaea is not a game about pure grinding its a game about grinding efficiently!Personally Id just play them in order      and D. Even though most of the games in the series are non cannon except  and its sequel D they all reference and poke fun at each other.If you had to pick only one game from the series I think its fairly unanimous that Disgaea  for the Vita is probably the best. Tons of DLC huge amount of end game content and many improved mechanics imported from D. Also sardines.,JRPG,cl244d3,5,t5_2quw1

The most blatant being the conversation with the Eternian summoner in the Florem story arc she looks at Tiz and is captivated by something incomprehensibly beautiful residing within him they party thinks shes just crazy. Each summon is also modeled after some piece of modern technology like the bullet train because the summons are supposed to come from the Celestial Realm.spoilerThe AR thingy with Agnes talking to you when you start the game is also supposed to be her breaching into the Celestial Realm and begging you to help the next world before Airy slaughters the party. Airys Sister is also supposed to be talking to you but her existence raises more questions than answers especially once you consider that the version of her that appeared postcredits had a  on her wings.spoilerAlso did you notice?

2212869,0,t3_2kglui,IIRC Fire Emblem works that way and for combat system studies that ought to be close enough for your interests. Even farther off the JRPGpath Wasteland  and at least the bits of Wasteland  that Ive played work that way. I dont know whether in Wasteland  maybe farther down the game you get a practical incombat heal option but I dont have one where I am right now. In Wasteland  and IIRC the Fire Emblem I played both have healing but requiring the healer to be physically proximal to the healee is a significant impediment to the battle quite different from the white mage just lifting their arms and healing everybody everywhere.By contrast in practice Fallouts stimpacks end up functioning a lot like conventional JRPG healing for the player character.As to the problem of the traditional oldschool FinalFantasy lineup of friend vs. foe theres a variety of interesting solutions out there mostly focusing on making positioning relevant to what can be done.Another interesting possibility that Id like to see more of is the enemy having more AI. This requires a radical reconception of how the enemy works because suddenly you cant just give them unlimited MP. Where a Final Fantasy party might stroll through a dungeon of the random AI enemies theyll get slaughtered if every single enemy always opens with their most powerful attacks until the enemies run out of MP let alone what would happen if the enemies intelligently targeted the PCs. Also theres a lot of space between completely random and totally optimal play exploiting an enemys pattern that you discover ought to be considered legal and expected... it happens in real life after all...But to be honest Id be interested in playing a JRPG with foes that arent just as dumb as bricks and whose challenge is entirely created either by sheer numbers or in the case of TRPGs always getting incredibly advantageous positions. I dislike mechanics that exist for the sole purpose of disadvantaging me the player and for instance in the Tactics Ogre game I played it began to get old how in every single battle I was always rushing uphill. I mean I get it in a fortress assault but no matter where I was in the game I was always apparently downhill.,JRPG,cll3xlh,4,t5_2quw1
2213210,0,t1_cll4afm,Right you and the enemy are both putting sustained attackpressure on each other.  As their is no healing its a ticking clock as to who runs out of resources first influenced by player decisions.A healingbased system is as close to a nonattrition based system as you can get as the player has effectively limitless resources and simply needs to outpace the enemy while slowly whittling them down or strategically kill the healer first to eliminate the enemies ability to sustain resources.IIRC the duel system from the Suikoden games was fairly attritionless too it was more about connecting with the right attacks and predicting enemy attacks to effectively blockparry.  I dont think that would work for generic partyfocused encounters though.  TBH its hard as a battle is essentially a situation where attrition is an important factor.  Whether you can heal or not victory is determined by who whittles down the enemies resources first be it number of troops stamina supplies HP whatever.   You win when the other guy runs out of  and can no longer effectively fight back.,JRPG,cll5hqk,2,t5_2quw1

2325404,0,t3_2lupz1,What an atrocious review. What isnt English essay fluff is just far too abbreviated to be of any use explanation of basic game mechanics. The only actual hard content in the whole thing is that it takes  hours to get going. I could have gleaned more from Youtube.And whats with this bullshit about a loveletter to the original MegaTen games in the first two paragraphs and never referenced again? Needed padding for the beginning? SMTIV is the biggest departure so far from the original MegTens and SMTs. Most obviously the dungeon crawling is basically gone. You would think this would be notable in a series of dungeon crawlers. It blows my mind people bitch about FFXIIIs corridors but no one says anything about SMTIV when the ratio linearity of FFXIIIlinarity of past FFs is tiny compared to linearity of SMTIVlinearity of past SMTs. In fact those first  hours are basically the best the game will ever get. But even putting that aside basically every unique mechanic of MegTen is gone. The moon phase is gone or is it just useless? I cant remember. MAG is gone. Alignment means jack shit for your demons. MC death is a minor inconvenience. Game overs basically do not occur. And the mechanics that remain are gutted nearly past recognition. Changes streamlining no doubt to the fusion system rendered demons extremely samey. For most of the game their only relevant attribute is their natural elemental alignments. Stats were gutted eg no VIT equipment is severely nerfed element is basically the only important property of armor except of course the ultra expensive equip sets that certainly arent designed to sell the shitty free macca DLC items are useless and you cant carry more than like two of any of the important ones anyway. Not that it would matters since the bosses cant put up a fight even the famously bullshit AI is gone final bosses just kill themselves on Tetrakarn etc. enemies wont use multitarget attacks if only one character is alive if your party is being wiped one demon with Reflect Phys will often live and can auto the rest of the fight. The story is extremely mediocre for a MegTen parts of it seems to be included out of only a sense of obligation that these sorts of themes must appear with a carefully calculated frequency.

2380281,0,t3_2mldn7,For myself I would say Shadow Hearts From the New World and heres why.In Shadow Hearts one you have a dark story that has a quietly disturbing world building around it.  This was set up by Koudelka a PS JRPG which was originally supposed to be a survival horror so they married the two together.  It has its flaws but the chills you get from the claustrophobia to never knowing when your weapons will give out on you... Yeah Shadow Hearts had a great world to expand on.  This world is kind of a parallel history to ours and ends just before the start of WWI.So... after saving the world Shadow Hearts Covenant continues the story and has a great way of gimping the lead character down so he matches the rest of the party you meet.  The game is graphically more polished its kept the nifty spell casting and such from the old game and improved on it.  It retains its grim nature but has a couple of gags here and there to ease the tension at the right moment seasick lead characters are always good.So... onto Shadow Hearts FtNW it is now  before the Great Depression.  Apart from a few nods to characters that appeared previously its an almost whole new cast and the lead character is now a boy detective instead of an awesome  year old who followed the voice in his head to rescue a girl because he wanted the voice to piss off.  So young male lead who ends up being the leader... because.  Then add far too much inappropriate slapstick which makes the poignant and tragic moments... meh.  Then add a possible love interest who has large boobs and at least  years older.  Its just... this game lost its dark charm and harrowing vision that made you feel for the characters.  I really wanted to like this game but I could never replay it.  The first two Ive lost count of my replays.,JRPG,cm5wsya,3,t5_2quw1

So yeah after that somewhat discouraging experience I didnt expect to like Persona  much but despite its flaws it became one of my personal favorites.Back in the day I didnt expect much from Final Fantasy Adventure Seiken Densetsu . Most Gameboy titles were relatively simple action or puzzle games and didnt seem to present a large world or more than a hint of story. There were aspects of FFA that were frustrating but its world seemed genuinely vast and fascinating. Its story is not amazing now but it had several unexpectedly good moments.

The expansion story just adds to this and makes it all the better Final Fantasy VI  Surprisingly not my favourite FF game however the story in this game is sublime. The war the characters  Especially Terra and Kefka god is he wicked Valkyria ChroniclesId class this as a JRPG and I love the way it tackles the issues of war loss and racism while still being so bloody entertaining the characters are all sublime Persona   Lighter in tone to P however the characters are just as great and the murder mystery is intriguing so much so that its hard to put down.Lost Odyssey I adore this game the idea of tackling immortality and death is just sublime in this game with thrilling characters and some truely heartbreaking moments this games plot is beyond magnificent. Tales Of Vesperia My fav tales game its has enough comedy and intriguing characters to keep your attention with its standard yet great plot. Final Fantasy IX My favourite FF game not the best plot of the series but the story is still magnificient and nostalgic while at the same time being fresh. The characters are just greatChrono Trigger An epic with great time travel plot with great characters.Kingdom Hearts II  A bit confusing at points but an overall great story filled with nostalgia for all things Disney and FF Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core Easier to follow than FF VII this game has it all with its cinematic story telling the history of Zack the man who would make cloud the hero he becomes.Edited for spacing,JRPG,co1qxq3,0,t5_2quw1

I think that if the scenes had been portrayed through D art this might not have been a problem.I praised P in another thread and Im about to praise it again. Its a story in which many characters are insecure about their bodies and their sexuality. The game does not attempt clinical realism but it takes these themes seriously. One of its messages seems to be Youre a normal respectable person flaws and all. If I write an indie or freeware game I want to convey a similar message.

Rika struggles to understand the concept of death.Later in the game you have to prove your strength by clearing  tower dungeons on a forgotten planet.

You reunite them but as he doesnt recognise her he kills her. as she falls the veil comes away and he recognises her. He kills himself in despair allowing you to pass through to the next town.Later in the game a nuclear powered prison satellite falls out of orbit and destroys the capital planet. the debris wipes out pretty much everything and  of the solar systems population is killed their advanced technology is wiped out forever and Phantasy Star  takes place in the ruins of the fallen utopia.

The OS pretty much takes care of itself now too by default and most adults have to deal with normal PC stuff anyway for doing work.The whole build and setup takes a few hours at most. Im super incompetent mechanical things so a few hours for me is probably pretty inflated for someone who feels comfortable with a screwdriver. A few hours every X years isnt much of an investment at all unless someone is the type who outsources plugging in his TV to the BestBuy professionals. Thats definitely laziness and ignorance.

Every game has a system that they introduce to you and then you as the player get to try and take advantage of that system.FFVIII had a specific type of system and in order to take advantage of it you concentrated on junction over levels.  Theres nothing wrong with that its simply how the game works.People will criticize it because they didnt like the system just as theyll criticize other games that have nonscaling systems they didnt enjoy.  Theres absolutely nothing wrong with that but its a mistake to assume theres a perfect scaling system out there and FFVIII just screwed it up.I think where a lot of people may start criticizing these scaling systems is when you cant get an advantage in the system because tis too smooth or where you can easily find yourself in a spot where you cant continue reasonably because of the way scaling crashed into your character build.,JRPG,cqkaj2d,1,t5_2quw1

In an ideal world these stupid titles wouldnt exist because in the end regardless of where a game is made its a ROLEPLAYING GAME. Regardless were stuck with the names but every time theres a discussion on the top WRPG of the year some fool has to mention Dark Souls.Its a JRPG. No JRPG is not a genre. Action RPG is a genre which Dark Souls is.And I know some people will say but Dark Souls is nothing like Final Fantasy. Thats because Final Fantasy isnt an actionRPG but theyre both JRPGs. You wouldnt go and say Kings Bounty and Deus Ex arent both WRPGs because they play completely differently from one another so why try and separate Dark Souls from other JRPGs?Dark Souls is just as much of an actionRPG as Tales of Vesperia is and just as much of an actionRPG as Mass Effect is. You are in full control of your characters actions and success is based just as much on your reflexes as it is your stats.But the difference is I think JRPG is a genre because of certain things limited to it and things it wishes to accomplish together with qualifications that make whichever game a JRPG or WRPG. I consider Action RPG as another sub genre we can associate it with much like say Kingdom Hearts if we wanted to go into a bit more detail.,JRPG,cqlf6bu,3,t5_2quw1

3775144,0,t3_33nibf,I can think of a few games that require more than mindless offense and require support abilities.Unlike the other Tales games Graces f actually takes a different approach to battle. Rather than simply overpowering the enemy by brute strength and pressing X Graces f relies on evasion. The two most important stats in the game are evasion and accuracy. If you dont evade an attack by a boss you can get combod to hell and back and not be able to recover. It has a steep learning curve about a quarter of the way through the game and if you dont get good at dodging youre out of luck. Because of the reliance on evasion and accuracy defense is pretty difficult to come by. Some higher level enemies and enemies on higher difficulties absolutely need timestops or periods where youre in over limit damage is halved infinite combos etc. Also since its not turnbased theres no such thing a wasting a turn.Makai Kingdom and most of the Disgaea games really rely on being able to use buffs. On the bosses you unlock by making a wish if you dont have several characters use offense buffs or even attacks that induce sleep you can be OHKOd in one attack. The same goes for level bosses in the free dungeons. Though its easy to buff DEF  RES its fairly essential to use things that buff ATK  INT. Unlike ToG f Makai Kingdom is turnbased but using a turn on buffs or status doesnt feel like a waste of a turn.Shin Megami Tenseis late bosses are similar in that its almost required to cast status moves. And well Pokemon. Obviously status moves arent required to win the game but help in capturing them all. However if you ever want to play competitive Pokemon the use of status is fairly prominent and simple offense will not get very far. Most teams consist of two offense two defense and two walls. The defense and walls rely on status and theyre not wastes of moves.,JRPG,cqmlefw,9,t5_2quw1

3967728,0,t1_cr809a9,Rocket Slime for the DS did get localized. He is obviously talking about the third game in that series for the DS that was released in . I guess you just sort of jumped into this without actually being fully aware of the situation regarding DQs translation status or something.I think the point is that there was a time when they were enthusiastic about the series translating what you call ridiculously niche spinoffs and now they wont even bother with modern remakes of some of the most popular entries in the series from  years ago. People have a reason to be pessimistic about Dragon Quest release status in the west because there has been an obvious decline.Also you seem to be using a weird standard of counting the total of games in the series and comparing that to the number of games we didnt get in the past  years instead of the number of games we didnt get period. If youre only going to count what we didnt get in the past  years you should only match that up against the total number of games that were released from the past  years as well. In which case the actual figure for games that were released in the west is more like  out of . Thats counting spinoffs but not ports of the same game on different consoleslike DQ DS or the Android releases or Joker  Pro since its just a minor improvement release. If you dont want to count spinoffs then the number of games released in the west drops to  because the only  titles made in the past  years that were released hereor are planning to be in the case of Heroes are both spinoffs.Though DQ DS shouldnt take much work and its one of the most popular entries in the west from the series so I would imagine this case is low risk high return.

I think thats why people got so pissed off with his emo Cloud incarnations in both KH and AC although in AC hes so guiltridden and depressed over losing two people he cared for deeply and a lot of people forget that the Cloud we see through most of the game isnt really him. I think the closest we get to Clouds true self is the kid we see in Crisis Core. Also thank you for pointing that out with the AerisTifa personality swap thing. I hope they fix that and restore Aeris energetic personality. For me Tifa in AC was more true to her original character only she started to tell Cloud off for his behavior.

4299131,0,t1_cs9pq3q,The stuff about him calling JENOVA his mother is kind of irrelevant since we dont know if he actually believes that all. But he did read all the info on what was done to him by Hojo and the other researchers how he and the other SOLDIERs were created etc. He knows the atrocities of ShinRa and he knows the research they have done on Cetra JENOVA and the lifestream. If he read the stuff about JENOVA being his mother in one of the hundreds of books that doesnt mean all the rest was as inaccurate. JENOVA was poorly understood and that would have been reflected in at least some of the writings. This is not to mention the fact we dont even know how old all the texts were and that part could have been outdated but taken to heart. There are tons of variables stemming from the fact that those scenes are far from explicit and only serve to show that Sephiroth read everything in the library and then at the end had changed his tune.But on the topic of JENOVA as someone else stated it is mentioned in the game that Sephiroth being dropped in the mako reactor and becoming connected to the lifestream made him more powerful which is then explicitly shown at the end when you fight him and he takes massive monstrous forms that are nothing like anything else encountered in the game. That could be JENOVA again as you theorize but then why cant the portions of JENOVA we see earlier in the game do anything even remotely as impressive? And why is the likeness still very clearly of Sephiroth and not based on JENOVA?Which brings me to my final point that of everything in the plot pointing to it being Sephiroth and not JENOVAs whose will is being carried out by the JENOVA cells. If it was JENOVA why did she conveniently wait until one specific person who again conveniently discovered evidence to make him hate his former employers and creators to start wreaking havoc after millenia of doing nothing? Why wasnt it another SOLDIER who was still part of ShinRa and could more effectively take it down from the inside. Sure Sephiroth was the top dog but others were also quite impressive. And why did her cells continue to take the form of Sephiroth and do things that would be what Sephiroth would do in response to his discoveries and all converge at the point where the actual Sephiroth was located and interact specifically with those Sephiroth had interacted with ie Cloud and so on? Because it was Sephiroths will not JENOVAs. Corrupted or otherwise influenced in some way by JENOVA? Perhaps. But actually controlled by JENOVA or actually JENOVA herself? Highly unlikely and almost certainly false.,JRPG,csa8i39,0,t5_2quw1

4522403,0,t1_ct0n1zy,Look I get where you are coming from and preSteam refund update I would have agreed with you wholeheartedly.The nontrivial amount of people you speak of is being implied to go ahead and preorder anyway right? These people dont care about their money and dont monitor their spending. Yes it isnt nice that companies have this nick and dime attitude but at the end of the day they are businesses seeking to make a profit. That however is digressing the point. Again I will refer back to Arkham Knight situation. They had lots of sales numbers sure but the outrage at the poor port is everywhere. That really does not paint a success in any way. I dont quite get what you are trying to say with your point about doing whatever they can do get those numbers up. If the game is broken but then fixed then you got the product you paid for. If the game is broken and not fixed the refunds start happening. This leads back to refunds negating these negative results. High sales numbers but equivalently high refund rate is not a commercial success. Thats basically a lost sale.Why do preorder numbers matter when its an easily lost sale? Maybe Im misunderstanding you right now its  pm and I havent slept since yesterday pm but I dont see how its still a problem with refunds.

The dynamic between Lightning and Hope was enjoyable but Snow and Vanille made it difficult to take the game seriously at times. It also felt really linear.Theres no pretence in Dark Souls. If FFXIII and Dark Souls were people then FFXIII would be the gorgeous extrovert screaming look at me! whereas Dark Souls would be the quiet yet somewhat edgy guy full of interesting stories once he opens up to you.It has substance by the bucketload which is rarely seen in modern games. The fact that digging deeper into the lore always pays off isnt a bad thing. A lot of games try to do what Dark Souls did but fall flat because their world is not as enticing and abstract as that of Dark Souls.

4791027,0,t1_ctyehdw,gt So youre saying that Final Fantasy and Elder Scrolls are exactly the same type of game and should not be distinguished between? I unintentionally implied the wrong thing my point is that the labels themselves are worthless distinctions because it can be so minor a difference leading to really similar games separated and some vastly different games are bundled together when they really shouldnt be. Two completely different games with minor similaritieslike FFSkyrim shouldnt be described as simply RPGs with an added WestJapan label. Its not a specific enough distinction to have worth. If you are going to use labels to describe the differences why not use ones that actually describe the gameplay? Rather then this is a WRPG because WRPGs usually have action oriented gameplay ect. I could say Fire Emblem is a JRPG or I could say its a TBSRPG or a TBS with RPG elements. Calling it a JRPG does little to describe the particulars of the gameplay.A couple more examples does adding more open world aspects to FF make it a WRPG? If so is that a worthwhile distinction?If Chrono was a self insert character with a choice of personality does that make Chrono Trigger a WRPG?If Skyrim has a pre set character who talks and a turn based battle system is Skyrim now a JRPG? And the line between a pre set character and an insert character is closer then you make it out to be.  If you made an open world action game then added simple RPG elements is it now a WRPG?gt Genres exist to make clear distinctions between types of games Thats why descriptions like TBSRPG or ActionRPG are far more effective. gt The genres are distinct because the gameplay is fundamentally different at its core.But the gameplay is barely a focus of the WJrpg descriptions in your example focusing more on story the main character and how linear the game is. People generally know what you mean when you say JRPG but its not a well defined genre WRPG even less so.,JRPG,ctyg4zs,1,t5_2quw1

When playing it its hard to have the same experience twice with so many characters and endings. It has far more replay value than just about any game I can think of actually.  was the last Star Ocean game I got to playing but it ended up being my favourite when I did.  is actually my least favourite mainly due to the battle system although in every other department its better than  which pretty much only has the battle system and visuals going for it  but what a battle system it is. ,JRPG,cvurwmi,1,t5_2quw1

5470320,0,t1_cw67g70,Your framerate argument isnt a very strong one. FFVII is  years old and has relatively static gameplay. Its all menu based. Tales games are about frantic action and when its buttery smooth in fps it really makes a difference in how the game feels. Its  and a game like Tales should run at fps since it isnt pushing any hardware limits. Of course the game can be enjoyed as it is but I wouldnt downplay the difference the framerate can make on the fun factor of the game. ,JRPG,cwavvaj,1,t5_2quw1
5474258,0,t1_cwaqvg5,I mean to be fair the PSP Go had a lot of issues other than that. The stupidly high price point  much higher than a PSP  despite being able to do less  and the lack of early support and lack of certain big titles like Crisis Core and Kingdom Hearts meant it never stood much of a chance. It was like why would I get this when a PSP  is both cheaper and superior?If they did it properly it might work.

FF is the most recent in the franchise excluding FF.  FF and FF are recent remakes.  None of these things can be said for FF.  It would take more effort from SquareEnix to get FF to PCSteam than the others so I could easily see them deciding its not worth the effort financially.

The former being traditionally Japanese and the latter two being their view at least at the time of Western religion. Theyre more instantly recognizable.If you look closely youll find hints of everything in many games. FFX borrows heavily from nonJapanese Eastern culture Ainu Polynesian even Indian and so thats why you dont see Ramuh or Alexander running around. Look at Ivalice too. FFXII uses the mythologies of many religions with some Christian influence but primarily Middle Eastern. There are so many rich and complex cultures and religions across the world to draw from.Id love to see more games that are thematically respectful to one of the many African Cultures or draw inspiration from South American systems etc.,JRPG,cx4du5f,3,t5_2quw1

5761066,0,t3_3twbxl,Holy crap that is a lot of games to give away and a lot of potential entertainment for some lucky gamers! As somebody who tries to pay it forward as best I can it makes me happy to see posts like this pop up Id love to throw my hat in the ring for a copy of SC. I recently picked up a copy of Trails in the Sky FC after reading an article on Kotaku a few weeks ago about what the translation process and how dedicated the team waswhat they went through. Jason Schreier is the Kotaku RPG aficionado and Ive thoroughly enjoyed most of his reviews and the RPGs hes recommended so I figured what the heck? I LOVE a good RPG and love story telling even if its slow... And I am absolutely LOVING Trails in the Sky FC so far! So I guess onto the questionnaireWhat are some of my favorite RPGs? And why?. Legend of Legaia  This game had so many unjque ideas at the time and my younger self was BLOWN AWAY by the graphics the music and the story. The story was bleak and downright depressing at timesno matter where you went the mist was always there it had claimed lives tore families apart separated people from each other and causes them to live in fear. But then you had characters that cared about others that lifted your spirits that believed in each other or welcomed strangers. And dont even get my started on how unique the combat system was!. Legend of Dragoon  LoD is definitely more traditional in some of the tropes and clichs that it used but the setting and characters really sold me on this one. A multidisc epic that features love revenge betrayal multinational war mixed with great music and an awesome timing based combat system? Heck yes! I remember that this was the first game that made me cry with the events towards the end of Disc One. Sure the combat slowed the game down and there tropes a plenty but LoD has a special place in my heart. Final Fantasy Tactics  What a game. I came to the FFT party a little late and didnt actually experience this one until the War of the Lions remake for the PSP. The lore characters and story absolutely blew me away. I loved the idea of being caught in the conflict between nations and very much enjoyed the more political and serious nature of the world. There was so much at stake here and I felt connected to the characters within the first few mission. The depth of combat the job system and the world hooked me and hooked me good. Runnerups Final Fantasy  and the PS Shin Megami Tensei games Nocturne and the DigItal Devil Saga gamesHave I playedfinished Trails in The Sky FC?As mentioned above Im still powering my way through FC but am really taking my time and enjoying the trip. It was recommended that I go back and visit other NPCs and explore everywhere for various events as I play the game to really take my time and I still cant get over how much dialog is in the game! Im only Im the second chapter after having Shera and Olivier return to Rolent so Im still Im the world building phase but I hear it starts to pick up even more soon and I cant wait to see what they have in store for me! I hear things really come together in SC and since Im living on a really tight budget I am hoping to be able to get the opportunity to finish this story as soon as I can!This is an awesome opportunity for everyone and I hope you get a lot of entries from people who are just as enthusiastic about RPGs as you are. I happened across rJRPG while doing some research on FC and have been lurking in the community for a few weeks loving the discussions and hoping to be more active in the future. Good luck to everyone and thanks for hosting this!,JRPG,cxb7phv,1,t5_2quw1

5865000,0,t3_3vl3og,Personal opinion is that I think this is a good direction. Ill wait until we actually get more gameplay to give a full opinion but as a huge FF fan that has completed the game to varying degrees  times the battle system has finally started to feel dated to me. I wouldnt say stale but it needed changes and an overhaul. Do I think SE could have figured out a way to implement turn based combat in a more modernized form? Perhaps. But I think the action approach better suits the updated appearance. Personally still very excited for the game and I get why people are disappointed because of it looking more like an ARPG but I think everyone needs to withhold final judgement until we actually see more gameplay than just  seconds of a standard battle from the beginning of the game.,JRPG,cxofkkr,21,t5_2quw1

FFVII was a major part of my childhood and I love it too. Its fun and I dug the the plotthreads I could pick up but that doesnt change that Square shoveled a lot of nonsense our way. FFVII did not need two spinoff games and a movie to fully tell the story.Still! If youve got the bug and feel the need to fill in plot holes you might want to give FF Crisis Core a try.

6076285,0,t3_3yr8e6,Spoilers first of all. Nothing major but be warned regardless.Ive played every English released tales game since Symphonia and I think the only game thats less favorable is Symphonia  and even then its close. Zestirias story is incredibly weak Edna is just about the only interesting character the skill system is needlessly complicated for very little reward I played coop with a friend and we can see our characters about  if the time the camera is so bad and I dislike that you have to keep two of the party members in the active part at all times. In just about any other tales games Sergei and Alisha would have been permanent party members. The game reeks of last minute changes and the game suffers accordingly. Supposedly Roses Japanese va recorded her lines a year after everyone else which leads me to believe the plot with Alisha was originally a much larger part of the story but was cut. Further evidence being that you can buy weapons for Alisha well after shes left the party for absolutely no reason since when she briefly joins the party again shes got better gear than anything you could buy. All in all the game just feels incomplete. The middle portion of the game takes a long time and accomplishes next to nothing the villains seem to be evil just because the story needs them to be and plot threads seem to be introduced with no payoff. Remember the seven dragons they mentioned at the beginning of the game? Its not a bad game but its very close.,JRPG,cyg340d,6,t5_2quw1

6096360,0,t1_cyid2mn,gt So whats the problem exactly? A prealpha tech demo video was missing some models and textures? Thats to be expected its not really doom and gloom.You realize that Square has never ever done that. In fact I dont remember the last time a AAA company did such a thing showing a game with a completely unfinished area.gt I was comparing them on a technical sense as well. Development of an open world game like Skyrim is vastly different than FFXV. Night and day different.Both game requires similar amounts of assets perhaps Skyrim requires more due to how much you can manipulate and use all the objects.gt Who says the entirety of that landmass is usable playable explorable space? This isnt an official statement its a games journalist doing some napkin math cartography based on some sample images. Its not the size that matters but what they choose to do with it. I mean the Xenoblade Chronicles X world was huge and they billed it right on the box as if you see it you can go to it. but practically speaking over half of it was open water with nothing in it or empty open space with random mobs walking around. Even the detailed areas were just copypasted repeat assets that were barely used. Its the execution that matters.There is no open world game that does not have some repetition of asset usage. I agree with you completely that the execution is what matters and I can assure you that in my experience and personal opinion Xenoblade Xs world is immensely more engrossing and well designed than anything theyve shown in FFXV so far. From a technical standpoint FFXV has better shaders and lighting but from an artistic standpoint I personally prefer Xenoblade much more and I underline that artistic preference is personal not technical. But I do disagree that Xenoblade X is mostly empty space with water and that it reuses assets in any sort of predictable matter. Some areas have more aesthetic differences within them than others but all have landmarks rock formations water streamsfalls swamps different foliage bridges... something that keeps each of the areas diverse and engaging which is good because a large part of the game consists around exploring.gt Then perhaps hold off on the naysaying until you can prove it with more than a gut feeling was the point of my original post.I showed evidence to backup my arguments and I compared the development periods of the game and other companies who develop similar products. None of what I said is false. Part of it is opinionated or based on an opinion or perception that I have of the company after years of observing and enjoying some of their products but I tried to be as truthful and honest as possible.If you want a gut feeling you are an apologetic Final Fantasy fanboy who is blindly defending Square Enix and probably enjoyed FFXIII and the other fiascos that they associated the brand to. That is a gut feeling.Edit considering how harshly you criticized someone else who shares the opinions that Square messed up severely their postPS Final Fantasy games on another discussion it appears I am correct once again. Id like to make clear that I dont mind that we have separate opinions about how the development of FFXV is going and that you have higher expectations than I do thats perfectly fine but I do mind disingenuous comments and Id appreciate if you could refrain from making yours in such a manner.,JRPG,cyildmk,-2,t5_2quw1

Of course the moment I realized you got ranked on missions I had to start using a guide because I must get best score on everything.

My thing with Haseo isnt just that he was an ass ive loved plenty of characters who were terrible people. My problem is that he didnt really get much in the way of other traits. His only traits were Jerk and Vengeful he didnt get any charisma he wasnt funny he didnt even seem to have many other interests even.

6561946,0,t3_45hxip,I always see these type of enemies as some type of universal option for multiple problems that revolve around leveling. Usually in a JRPG if you cant beat a boss then grinding is usually the best solution. If you want to complete leveling a spelllike mechanic grind. For people who care about maxing out levels and stats or for a trophy you have these type of enemies to grind on. Inversely if you dont want to play the game and just overpower everything these optional enemies are the answer.I personally dont like over leveling and finding the challenge of trying to beat my adversary or surviving the dungeon. If I have to I will because some mechanics like xlevel death or xlevel to equip are things in some jrpgs. If I have to backtrack Ill usually run away. But if I ever come across one of these enemies ala RNG then Ill take it. I just consider it as a chance. Usually these enemies run away quick or are hard to kill so I welcome it.,JRPG,czy25w9,7,t5_2quw1

6624352,0,t3_46ergh,With regards to the PS games the graphics were D in a time where everyone was overawed by D graphics and CG cutscenes. Suikodens PSera success was always going to be limited by that. Most people I know who are still into JRPGs today were into Suikoden during its day. Those people I know who really only played FFVIIX and ignored most other JRPGs were not. It just was never a mainstream hit like some other JRPG names were. I believe those mainstream hits coasted more on their graphics and immersion more than their inherent JRPGness.I imagine the series death has to do with it not being a mainstream hit for Konami. Konami was never much of a JRPG company they were just a Johnny Come Lately to the JRPG party hoping to follow the s JRPG trend and make money. Same thing goes for Capcom and Breath of Fire. The Japanese companies who always had JRPGs as a major focus are still making them and have not let their franchises die off in the same way Konami and Capcom did.,JRPG,d04ijpo,12,t5_2quw1

6675941,0,t3_470vn3,Xenogears. Same composer and Mitsuda even said himself that Xenogears and Chrono Cross are his best pieces of work and I agree. In terms of how Xenogears OST fits the atmosphere Dark Dawn really set the tone during the opening cutscene. This isnt your typical or jrpg or happy story  its brutally dark. Theres a greater force haunting over humanity people die children lose their parents etc yet theres still hope for a better future however cheesy that may sound. My Village is Number One really puts you in the shoes of the happy villagers before shit hits the fan. I cant talk about how fitting Faraway Promise is without explaining the plot of events which occur before the games timeline within the same continuity but even without knowing that its a damn good piece just listen to it. Wings as you may have guessed is the flying theme and its my favourite flying theme out of any JRPG just listen to it. Not only is it a fantastic track but it really does feel like youre flying however silly that may sound. Theres so many more. The ominous tracks that leave you feeling uncomfortable the happy ones which just put a smile on your face the tracks which play during moments of crisis that really give you that sense of urgency.

However Im a big SRPG player and this game is by no means a cakewalk at least compared to a lot of other Japanese tactics games. Its refreshing. Honestly I now feel inclined to try out older installments.Ive heard little doomsday sentiment browsing FE boards or maybe I just missed the brunt of it when Awakening came out and Ive also seen plenty of praise of the difficulty in Fates and admission that oldschool FEs had similar cases of neon blue hair and shallow characters.

It has to be the principle rather than the reality that bothers everyone right?That is not true there are some good examples of important portions of games being cut out for localization purposes. The problem with censorship though that bothers me most of all is that its anticipating an audience that doesnt even play these games to begin with. If  percent of people playing this game wont be offended its absurd to censor what wont affect the vast majority of the player base. So its not the censorship itself that bothers me I really dont care about a bust slider or anything similar. That honestly gives me no value. I am however bothered immensely when they pander to people who wont even play the games but just write their blogs about social justice and complain about games. They make the choice to ignore their customers and instead listen to people who have nothing to do with them. Thats what sucks. ,JRPG,d0gihho,4,t5_2quw1

The Addition system seems to polarize some people but I find it incredibly satisfying especially when you get the hang of some of the more complex additions and watch your characters give the enemies some fantastically animated beatdowns. The world is very immersive too and has a nice variety of colorful backgrounds and lore attached to it. The story and characters for the most part are pretty decent so far but I havent beaten it yet so I cant comment on that.All in all Dragoon has been good enough to take up most of my free time outside of work.

7313279,0,t3_4etfkb,Its a bit odd to criticize the endings of games without having played them. Setting aside the idea that the journey can more than make up for a lackluster ending because for some people maybe thats not true sometimes just hearing the story secondhand doesnt give you a full view of how it plays out. So for funsies Im gonna pick out the endings I either liked or didnt think were that awful from your list. Not meant as criticism but maybe itll give you a reason to revisit something you skipped!In FF while the last fight is out of nowhere the rest of the story plays its themes wonderfully and the postbattle ending events are great tearjerkers that wraps up the story on a rewarding note. The secondtolast battle is a wonderful capper to the story that runs throughout the entire game and the music really kills it.spoilerAs for Star Ocean while the twist is widely reviled the next game in the series largely ignored it and played the world straight. People have varying opinions on that game but I really dug it and look forward to what the next offers. I doubt well hear much about that odd twist in the series again.spoilerThe story for Xenoblade Chronicles X definitely isnt the reason to dig in but its not localized around the ending. The whole story is at about the same caliber. That said I dont remember the twists seeming that forced or anything they all followed logically to me. That said the game is definitely all about exploring that world. If thats not enough for you thats totally legit.spoilerXenosaga had me scratching my head a bit though. The metacritic scores are mostly consistent. The second game was a bit of a bummer for me with repetitive encounters and lackluster art direction but the plot stayed in full force throughout the game. The third is actually my favorite in the series from plot to gameplay.You might have plenty of other reasons not to dig those games but sometimes oddities in an ending dont necessarily make them all bad.,JRPG,d29gxk0,1,t5_2quw1

7560082,0,t1_d302276,I completely agree with the author of the linked post.Back in the day I used to play a lot of the Gatcha games with Brave Frontier being the one I played the most and the longest.  At the time I thought it was the best I was going to get in terms of a free phone rpg.Then Final Fantasy Record Keeper was released and I truly saw the error of my ways.  In Brave Frontier you strive to collect or spend enough to collect a specific team of overpowered characters that constantly change due to power creep and then steamroll everyone with your broken party.  Battles had no strategy it was either you were stronger than your enemies or they would kill you.  Having the overpowered characters helped in beating enemies that were stronger statistically but nothing ever deviated from that.Yet in Record Keeper since you play it similar to a traditional turn based Final Fantasy strategy evolved to far more than Hit the portrait of my character and watch him do stuff and allowed me to not only Attack or use my special move but now I could equip abilities of varying effectiveness that ranged from damage healing and support and completely customize my characters.  In Brave Frontier I would put orbs on people to make them stronger.  In FFRK I could take a character like Paladin Cecil and equip him with Armor Strike and Saint Crossnow he is a DPS.  I could give him a bow put him in the back row and give him Shellga and Curajanow he is a quasihealer.  If I was lucky enough to have a unique Soul Break for him I could give him Lifesiphon and Protectga let him cast Protectga first and then Lifesiphon x  gt SSB over and over for massive damage.  All of these are valid strategies and all of them have a place.This is even further personified when people use only the Core Classes which are extremely underpowered compared to the real characters of the games and still use strategy and preparation to beat some of the hardest content in the game.Beyond even that the fact that even now over a year later from being a Day  player they still release several battles every week that is a legitimate challenge to me even though I have some of the best and most overpowered setups in the game.  It keeps things interesting and keeps me invested in a game I have played for far longer than most.Whereas Brave Frontier required you to spend money to stay competitive Final Fantasy Record Keeper only restrains you in the context of your own strategies and tactics and is a far more worthwhile play.To finally make my point Given that Final Fantasy Brave Exvius is literally the EXACT same game as Brave Frontier just with a Final Fantasy skin I again echo the statements of the linked poster and urge people to stay away from it.  If you are looking for something on your phone to play to give you a lasting good time without requiring any financial investment I highly recommend Final Fantasy Record Keeper.As usual enjoy my rambling manifesto!,JRPG,d31jmgt,2,t5_2quw1

7587560,0,t1_d34lwqa,gtBW bumped past Emerald to favorite Pokemon game for me. I for one loved the Unovaonly dex it gave a nice fresh experience and the actually great story. If BW had used the BW regional dex I would have loved it. Tons of new Pokemon to create an all new experience but enough old ones not to alienate long time fans. Thats how I felt when I played BW I really missed some of my old favorites like Salamence and Munchlax. Today however I actually like a lot of the gen  designs. Anyone who says pokemon is running out of ideas is retarded there are thousands of species of animals they have not yet covered and theres plenty of real world mythology that theyre starting to incorporate. Theyll point to Garbodor Vanilluxe and Klinklang lines I abhor the former two Klinklang especially for being so uninspired and Garbobor is Muk . but thats only  out of  new designs. Chandelure Galvantula Whimsicott Liligant Volcarona Samurott Eelektross Ferrothorn Durant Heatmor Liepard Reuniculus Gothitelle Krookodile Sawsbuck Excadrill Druddigon Braviary Carracosta Archeops... all of these pokemon are great Pokemon and welcome additions to the series.BW was pretty OK I guess.

But if you are playing a game thats more lighthearted a happy ending is not only okay it is pretty much explicitly promised to you from the start.

This generally applies to most of them.The only games where I see it as being discouraged is when you have unequal stat scaling e.g. in The Last Remnant where optional bosses would be all but impossible to fight if you were over an optimum level hence discouraging grinding and encouraging the player to rush.,JRPG,d4k9se2,1,t5_2quw1

8110523,0,t1_d4rol5n,gt You complain about cost but memory on a Vita is almost prohibitively expensive compared to any run of the mill flash drive.And? It isnt on the DS. And even then its minimally expensive and you can use it like an iPod storage wise. Easy peasy.gt This is just entirely factually wrong. The whole point of consoles is that youre completely locked into one ecosystem.Sure. All those problems Ive had trying to get my games to work Oh wait. I dont. POr maybe youre missing the problem with DRM. Its not that it exists. Its that it restricts. It doesnt here.But hey want to grasp through that route? Remember when Steam updated their Terms to be about how you dont actually own the games you buy? And you cant even buy the games physically to counteract that anymore lol.gt You keep saying Im contradicting myself but my position is logically consistent.Nope. Youve constantly tried to roll every positive of every type of PC into one big concept. Its cheap but its high powered. Its portable but its a gaming rig. Keep grasping.gt Ive maybe overstepped in a few places but was quick to concede.Didnt stop you from basing your arguments on the conceded pointsgt On the other hand youve spent the whole time arguing how sometimes portables are close to but still inferior to PCs Man you really are desperate lol. Good entertainment. You do realize I said that you were arguing that because your argument has literally been trying to demonstrate that they could achieve the same things? My argument was that they werent capable of that. But here you are trying to turn that around because youre stupid enough and upset enough to think I was trying to attack you with it. Oh boy.But hey declare to the world how upset you are. At least its fun to watch fanboys go on meltdowns.gt all while having shit taste in anime and telling me to fuck off like a little child.  I can see your neckbead showing again lol. For fucks sake who is so emotionally invested here that theyd literally go look up someones MAL? And hell if you want to try to delegitimize the last years of my life because you cant think of an argument Ill tell you fuck off every time. Everyone has a line they dont let other cross. I mean youre basically useless in society and you dont see me bringing that up as the reasons PC sucks or something.But hey declare to the world how upset you are. At least its fun to watch fanboys go on meltdowns.gt Its even more glorious to watch you get so triggered about your dead portable.DS is dead? Oh right. You wanted to try to put words in my mouth so you could feel better about how shit PC gaming is. All this after you tried to pretend a person who didnt agree with you was a troll for a blatantly stupid reason. You really want to see someone triggered?

The majority of the characterization IMO is from the private actions.Someone tried to tell me elsewhere that its OK for star ocean games to be poor narratively because theyre battle system games. Sure its true the battle system is what i enjoy the most but the previous games had somewhat entertaining scifi fantasy plots even if they werent the best critically  we still remember star ocean s plot twist.The part where youre looking for fiore is where I just gave up on the narrative completely for so.

8311216,1,t1_d5gg7re,gtIts a brand new game entirely new programming and design made from scratch sure its an homage to CT but its a whole new game why is the price unjustified?Depends on what metric youd like to use. Say the game is  hours long that make the game seem to be valued at  per hour of play. If we compare that to other games that are much longer at the same price it comes off as pricier in the current market.If we look at the graphics one can assume that it would take less money to make than say a full D styled game. I think its just the way that SE likes to price their titles and the price has been a common criticism  its obviously going to get a lot lower but for the time being it seems steep. Maybe weve been spoiled by the length quality and pricing of other JRPGs on steam and the community is out of touch but considering that were talking about the same developer that released  consecutive final fantasy XIII games Id say they are the ones that are out of touch.,JRPG,d5ggjjf,0,t5_2quw1

I actually liked all the characters which is rare for me in modern JRPGs.  The dialogue was good at most points with only a few blemishes.  I really liked how fast the plot moved.  There was nothing distracting from the quest.  No fetch quests and random inconsequential events to eat up time.  It felt like everything that was done was to further the story.

8561095,0,t1_d6bahkf,gtNever in my response did I say it was a fact. What seems different is an opinion one that I incidentally disagree with. Contrary to what people believe opinions can also have supporting arguments  its what I said your stance not fact lacks.Well it was just an off the cuff observation Im not really looking to write a research paper on it.  But lets dig a little deeper and explore the topic.gtDo you mind directing me to these shows that involve gay and lesbian relationships in a nonsexual nonfan servicy way? I know there are some but my argument is that there are a lot more that are concentrated on fan service than the actual exploration of gay and lesbian relationshipsIt seems like youre trying to shoehorn these shows into two different hardline categories.  Theyre either egregious fanservice or hardline serious when most shows dont fall into that categorization.  I dont know what you personally consider to be crossing the line as fanservice or overly sexual nor am I looking to get into an argument about it.  But for the record heres whats prominent on Crunchyroll.  Also of note is that I have not watched all of these series as BL isnt really my thing Im not saying anything about any of them just listing them out  The Highschool Life of a Fudanshi  A slice of life comedy show about a male high school student obsessed with Boys Love manga. Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE! LOVE!  An action comedy focused on a group of high school boys turned into magical boys  Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi  Worlds Greatest First Love  A yaoi comedy about a straight guy who takes a new job at a publishing company working on shoujo manga.  Gakuen Heaven  A yaoi drama about an elite all boys high school  This Boy Suffers from Crystallization  a yaoi drama about a boy whos body crystallizes when hes stressed and an earth sciences teacher fascinated by itHonorable Mention Dramatical Murder  an adaptation of a BL game that has the BL toned way way down.  I actually watched the first three episodes not knowing it was originally a BL game and had no idea.Thats five BLyaoi series just this season I may have missed a few that werent obvious and theyre not buried in some menu or  section but prominently displayed next to super serious anime like  Days kids shows like Future Card Buddyfight and hyperpopular stuff like Naruto.One thing thats worth noting is just how many of them are comedies as well.  A yuri or yaoi comedy is likely to feature sexuallyfocused jokes but two characters making a joke involving their sexuality isnt necessarily fanservice either.  Some of those series look like theyre fanservice central while others not so much.Theres also plenty of shows that arent primarily yuriyaoi themed but feature homosexual or nonbinary gendered characters in a way that isnt egregious overly sexual or what I would personally deem to be fanservice.  Off the top of my head from some more recent shows Psycho Pass had Yayoi and Shion both prominent main characters Tiger and Bunny had Nathan Sailor Moon had Neptune and Uranus as well as the villains Zoisite and Kunzite Legend of Korra if you consider it anime had Korra and Asami Both of the main characters in No. were gay,JRPG,d6bppqq,2,t5_2quw1

8578745,0,t3_4x8vsy,If we are just going by cast and not necessarily how well they were utilised I would have to say FFVIII. Each of them is a unique and surprisingly plausible and sympathetic manifestation of different trauma and anxiety coping mechanisms. Even though the plot becomes extremely polarised towards Squall and Rinoa in its decidedly poorly paced second half the reality is that many of them still gets some really interesting character development and demonstrate a lot of good insights into how we are affected by childhood events.It is a genuine pity that a lot of them dont get more screen time or a more mechanically sound game to be a part of the result being a lot of fans dismiss them summarily because this is the internet and of course they do. However the care taken with the characters informs why the people who do relate to them are so gung ho about it and I think we an important step in the way RPG heroes were represented. ,JRPG,d6dxe64,3,t5_2quw1

8669188,0,t3_4yoeiw,I think this game is one where you need to really have the intangibles click with you to enjoy it. There are games that are lacking mechanically or technically that certain people really deeply love because of the larger experience. An exampleZelda the Windwaker is a game with no challenge cut content forced extended sailing thats almost entirely non interactive and is shorter than any other major console Zelda game even WITH all the padding. There are people who just cant stand that game and theyre able to list a lot of valid reasons.Its also one of the most wonderful works of art to grace the medium. Not just in terms of the art thats drawn but in the lively vibrant optimistic and charming world the player explores. Its a world with characters and feelings that can leave an impression on a players heart with the smallest of joyous details that feel like an accident.And there are lots of these games in the world. NiGHTS. Elder Scrolls V. Suikoden . Final Fantasy VIII. These are all games that are mechanically underdeveloped poorly balanced or just plain broken. But each one is a classic thats deeply loved by a large audience.Odin Sphere may not be quite as GOOD as these games I listed but its appreciated in a similar way. To love it you need to love the cat and bookshelves at the start the detail to the food and the tablecloth animation. You need to appreciate the sense of wonder to the fairy tale and the sincerity of the telling.And if those sorts of intangibles dont resonate for you then thats okay. This isnt a game for you. Because youre right. The combat IS shallow the story IS self important the content is recycled to an absurd degree. So no its not just you. If anything the people who love the game would have a more difficult job justifying their position.lt,JRPG,d6p9oq8,12,t5_2quw1

8785881,0,t3_50dgat,Favorite  Final Fantasy VI. I played Final Fantasy VI for my first time in high school as I was starting to get more of a social life and making less time for video games. They were becoming something I did when I was younger.This game changed everything. The believable cast of characters the epic soundtrack the incredible plot twist in the middle the massive world  just everything. It surprised me like no game had in years. I fell in love with gaming all over again and Ive never looked back. Least favorite  Final Fantasy III. Each game in the series has something special about it that makes it stand out from the others. Well aside from III. Everything done in III has been done better in another Final Fantasy. Sure II may be worse but it at least has the super interesting leveling system. There is just nothing that sticks out to me about III.  ,JRPG,d73wpcn,1,t5_2quw1

In boss battleswhere your actions are limited  throwing stickers from two zones ago isnt much help.You also got coins from battles to use on the black market.So many people obsess over thisI just enjoyed the game.. I found the progression to be fair.Also there were times when they put in traps and platforming elements where yes you were intended to avoid enemies.  But that doesnt mean every battle was meant to be avoided.I dont get why people constantly harp on the game for this.

All characters fill roles but thats not the point hes trying to get across I dont think. The point is that these roles in Tales games are shallow and rudimentary.

Nothing worse than getting to the end with almost no health and no items and knowing you arent able to make it back outside with dying.But mostly its from the old days when a single save could become corrupt so we all made multiple save games to avoid this nd the habit has kinda stuck.,JRPG,d7iz6xl,3,t5_2quw1

8939817,0,t1_d7m283p,gt Fight Enemies gt Get Materials gt Craft Stuff gt Fight Stronger EnemiesI think theres a bit of a flaw in your loop.  Your loop essentially describes Monster Hunter style games arguments about whether or not theyre archetypal JRPGs aside and thats precisely why those games work so well and are so popular.The breakdown with many JRPGs is that the loop isnt focused on fighting stronger enemies but advancing to the next plot point.  Stronger enemies are simply a speedbump on the way to doing XYZ event to move on to the next area and the onrails nature of most JRPGs dictates that the stronger enemies are more like an old worn out speedbump so most players dont feel a need to grind levels or hit any real roadblocks as long as theyre keeping equipment to a baseline uptodate state and arent running from most random fights.From a design perspective if you take that loop and replace the universal resource of gold and the static acquisition method of buying stuff from shops with getting drops and creating new items youve now subjected the players to the whims of the RNG beast.  A player who got lucky in the last dungeon may have gotten enough Bear Pelts or whatever to just make their new armor whereas someone who didnt youre now derailing progression to force them to step backwards and go grind bears.  Balancing the two in a way where it feels meaningful without feeling punitive is a mountain to climb that has to be climbed over and over again every single segment of the game while only influencing short stints of gameplay at a time for what ultimately brings the player to an equivalent gameplay experience at best.IMO a system like that may have worked back in the PSX days but would likely be universally panned today.  Players are inundated with so many games to play that if they find something they feel is frustrating in your game theyre likely going to just put it down and play something else thats already competing for their attention.  Its no wonder why Nintendo Hard games are mostly a thing of the past and everything new feels like easymode but thats a tangential discussion.,JRPG,d7mfmwj,3,t5_2quw1

That is a clear complaint about its prequel nature.Other than that if we want to be serious  they cant even follow the storyline when a lot of their confusion was stuff explained within the opening narration or just being nitpicky you do not need to boil down every type of magic to a science sometimes magic stuff does magic stuff.The movie does have some pacing problems but the action scenes are not that hard to follow. Theres like maybe one  second clip that is but thats it. Character motivations and plans that they complained about are literally said in the dialogue for a lot of them or show quite well.Instead the critics jump on convuluted too serious too much action too simple silly names and left plot threads hanging to most likely tie into the game as their negative responses.And so far beyond every person that tries to say it isnt a true Final Fantasy usually because no women party members no turn based combat or because they are a party at the start dont have much problem with the characters or dialogue beyond it being a bit cheesy which is absolutely the case for all Final Fantasy games and if you dont think so you dont remember Spoony Bard and Son of a Submariner.,JRPG,d8yuwpz,1,t5_2quw1

9355953,0,t1_d91tmjs,Well the prevailing opinion is that Graces story is very cliche even by Tales standards. While other Tales games would have some major worldchanging twists and turns in their stories Graces just kinda... didnt. It was a lot more focused on the characters and the melodrama between them but the problem was that the drama felt really forced and not fully explored. Asbels relationship with Richard feels awfully halfbaked because they barely spent any time together. Cherias hangups with Asbel are completely dropped soon after the time skip and her character development comes to a complete halt. Hubert and Asbels feud is brought up in an effective manner and then... nothing really happens really. Every single time Asbel just earns peoples forgiveness by doing other things and the real issues were never addressed. And pretty much every character hangup is resolved early on through the game so the rest of the game youre left with characters with no real melodrama to make things interesting except for Malik whose development finished later on. This is to Graces detriment because as stated before despite the story focusing more on the characters than a central conflict like a war or something to that effect though it does have elements of this early on which is also quickly resolved the characters and their relationships with each other are halfbaked and not very interesting most of the time and the stuff that is interesting is dropped like Cheria and Huberts disdain for Asbels actions.Contrast this to the stories found in other Tales games relative to which I find Graces rather lacking. Symphonia and Abyss both had long sprawling stories with a central conflict that mounted in tension rather effectively with characters that developed a great deal over time and had some major personal beefs with their respective antagonists. Heck I would even contrast this to Graces fs own future arc which actually had different writers and a much more engaging narrative and skits. This isnt to say theres nothing to like but I see these sentiments thrown around a lot when discussing the games story.,JRPG,d91xngy,16,t5_2quw1

9433120,0,t3_59vqxv,Theres a lot of beloved JRPGs that I couldnt connect with because the characters were either unlikable or poorly developed. Persona  struck me as one of the former and Final Fantasy X as the latter. In both cases I think people really enjoyed the gameplayFFX in particular I hear people cite often as a perfect turnbased game. But I play like  for story so I go for games where the combat might be simple and repetitive but the story is great like Xenogears or some of the Breath of Fire entries. The inverse of this question would be that I really like Final Fantasy XII and did even when no one else seemed to. People are going easier on it these days but I always understood that Vaan was just the games excuse to explain the worlds rules to us and I never particularly felt like he got in the way of my enjoyment. I liked most of the characters actually if the plot hadnt gone sideways and inside out in the latter half it would be one of my favorites.,JRPG,d9bpopx,3,t5_2quw1

Tear is one of my favorite female characters in the genre. Plus it was beautiful to look at. Least favorite is probably Vesperia. A lot of people like it but it was actually the last newer JRPG I ever played for longer than an hour or two and it taught me why I was probably done with the genre beyond the occasional nostalgia trip.

9484360,0,t3_5ahrzs,Reading previous replies you say youre PC only? What other platforms have you owned besides the Xbox one? Which other platforms have you played?While League might be the only thing youre playing now what other games do you play and why do you enjoy them? Hell what do you like about League when you enjoy playing League?How much do you care about graphics and what are the games with the worst graphics that youve played and enjoyed? What are the oldest games youve played and enjoyed?Theres some good points in these other replies but a lot are making assumptions about your situation that maybe they shouldnt one way or another. If youre not comfortable with older games you should probably rule out anything thats all sprites and much of the earlier D stuff. Even things from the PS era can look pretty rough now.With the little I know about your preferences and options there isnt a ton to say. The only things I see on steam hard to get more accessible than steam if PC is what youre doing that Ive played and could recommend without too many reservations is the Dark Souls series though those are not your traditional JRPGs theyve much more of a focus on the action and the story is set up in a very different way than most other RPGs so without more information Ive no idea if thats even an appropriate recommendation. I also own Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky but I cant recommend it as Ive not put any time into it myself though others here do recommend that and it is generally well liked.If youve got your heart set on a Final Fantasy game for whatever reason  is probably your best bet and its available on steam. The game is old it was originally on PS and honestly this is literally the oldest game Id even consider recommending given what youve said so far and the graphics reflect that as does the use of FMV but its one of the most solid and polished JRPGs ever made on any platform and apparently the PC port isnt bad. It follows many common JRPG conventions and tropes good and bad so its a very good starting point in that if you dont enjoy it there might be stuff for you in the genre but itll probably be relatively niche while if you do theres many different avenues to pursue depending on which aspects you liked most.Anyway good luck.,JRPG,d9i5gbi,1,t5_2quw1

Golden Sun for me is superior in terms of just about everything with the sole exception of their characters. GSs characters are completely onedimensional while those in CT do have a little bit of depth to them. However when it comes to gameplay battles dungeons design which includes the GS puzzles and general world exploration GS excels and is far and away the winner. The world building was better in GS even if I try to account for the era CT was made. The music is better in GS. Sadly I never got into the CT soundtrack beyond Corridors of Time and the main theme.I dont think CT is a bad game by any stretch. Its remarkable for its era and it deserves its place in history.

It makes it seem theyre intentionally making it so it comes after the game is launched so they can make money off it instead of working on it alongside FFXV development. Sure this would take longer so waiting would be inevitable but thats exactly why it looks shady in my opinion.

Speakin objectively VII beats it in every category except graphics obviously and storywhich story you liked more cant be graded objectivly characters are more likeable. Battle system is far more open giving you more control over fights than what you have in XIII materia again is more expansive amp flexible than paradigms amp crystarium.

This sounds like it will work well.Yeah I mean I got the part at the end too. Im glad that the author was at least partly selfaware and able to see the contradiction he was presenting that has been dragged out repeatedly in criticism of XIII.The balance point as you described seems to be a sore issue with a lot of people and it seems like you can never make everybody happy. Im glad that you know exactly what you like! Maybe the next generation of of JRPGs will continue to struggle with this aspect of their form and content and people will study this time in their video game history classes.ampnbspEDIT I should mention that the reason that this sticks out to me is because Im not particularly concerned either way with the supposed linearity of a game. The thing that really bothered me about XIII was the incoherent story that required novels comics animes YouTube videos and other content to explain the details that was missing from its execution. This is my primary concern in XV too! It always struck me as weird that people went on and on about the ontherails focus of the game and not the fact that the rails were batshit senseless and that the incomplete writing relied on the intersection of tropes rather than actual plot.,JRPG,daj9yx4,1,t5_2quw1

Funny last night I spent time watching videos of Phantasy Star III and it bought back memories.  that game still looks decent today  but man did I hate  the endless random encounters.,JRPG,dazd2wt,3,t5_2quw1

9943781,0,t3_5ht2eh,I honestly believe that the best turn based combat system out there is ChronoCross. The percentage based accuracy vs. Damage combat made you think the elemental fields were challenging especially when it came to Summons and boss fights and the element magic system was fun if a little repetitive. ,JRPG,db3p693,2,t5_2quw1

9945492,0,t1_db3llqe,gtAnd each environment brings new and varied strategic things to utilize and play around.I just wish the strategy involved more than Spam all your turns with a heavy or a sniper refill ammo as necessary.The half movement penalty honestly doesnt incentivize using multiple characters enough and for a lot of the missions the only way to get the max rating is to simply spam your way through with one character blowing everything away.Theres a tank there?  Just run up to it and take all your turns with your AT to rocket spam it to death before it can act!  Need to take out a critical enemy?  Run up with a Heavy and use all your turns to kill it instantly.  Meanwhile the rest of your team sits back at the starting point and never moves.Unfortunately this wasnt improved in any of the sequels either.,JRPG,db3x7vh,1,t5_2quw1

The wife is going to make me buy this. She has become a bigger Kingdom Hearts mark than me. Ive yet to play through Dream Drop Distance in its entirety due to have only one low quality analog stick. The DS is not great for actionoriented games in my opinion so having this game on the PS will be great.Persona . Loved P and P. I want more of the same. End of story.Berseria. Im a sucker for Tales games good and bad. Ive heard this one is better than many of the recent Tales games but even if its not I enjoyed the lessertier Tales games like Legendia and Graces F.Final Fantasy  Remake if it comes out this year. I feel like Im in the minority when I say that I love the move from turnbased to action combat. I can always get my turnbased fix elsewhere.The Legend of Heroes series.

10161840,0,t3_5l2x5v,SMT IV Apocalypse and boy is it amazing. I have lost countless hours to this game because of how fun it is. In fact it feels very similar to Persona in that it is heavily stylized making monotonous things like grinding and fusing incredibly addicting and fun. Way better than SMT IV imoI am also playing Lunar Silver Star Sory Complete after completing Final Fantasy VII. I am actually surprised at how much I like this game. I mean I have tried playing it multiple times over the years but never got into it. Working Designs is what keeps me coming back though as they are amazing at what they do with these classicsOh and FF VII is overrated but a really strong entry in the series. It took me a while to beat it literally years because it did not hold my attention til the second half of the game. Now that I finished it got to say I did not expect to get Chrono Trigger vibes towards the end. I mean you can draw so many parallels to both games three party battle systems epic stories involving planet being in danger main protagonists that are important to the plot of the stories but are really shown to be much smaller parts of an incredibly large world would mention more but that can get a liitle spoilerish. The similarities are striking and I can safely say that each game is equally amazing.Also waiting on DQ VIII DS to release already,JRPG,dbvwg0x,1,t5_2quw1

Unless youre dying soon from a disease you do have  hours to spend on a game. Most people dont want to thats the truth.But I think people souldnt even have to.  hours games are an abomination.

Character swaps can be performed off any attack cost  level of the Break Gauge but refill one Soul on your character when they swap in.  You can double tap to do a quick swap inandout to get your Soul too.So you can end up starting a fight with  Souls doing a  move combo spending  Soul on your Break Soul arte doing a  move combo activating Velvets Break Arte finisher swapping to regain a Soul afterwards and continue the combo and repeating.  It ends up feeling pretty nice.Keeping an ear tuned for the sound of gaining a Soul from kills or status effects also means you can start expanding the combos into  move combos spending the extra Souls to chain multiple Break Soul attacks in your combo since every Break Soul without dropping Demon Form stacks a damage buff on Velvet.,JRPG,dd3v3ry,1,t5_2quw1

10649528,0,t1_ddea3vo,I dont think we ever get a ahem straight answer about Kanjis sexuality. Its left ambiguous on purpose. He likely hasnt figured it out himself. I do think his character is a bit more complex than the rest of the cast so I can understand having a hard time getting a good grasp on him. But I think its also important to remember that people who are in the closet tend to overcompensate their masculinity a lot. I know I did. Although the game never clearly states this I do believe that Kanji is gay but isnt ready to accept it just yethence why he continues to overcompensate.Edit As for his character never changing after the dungeon thats a fair point. I think the main difference is he becomes ever so slightly less aggressive and maybe a little less afraid of embracing his feminine side.,JRPG,ddef0e0,14,t5_2quw1

Honestly  you should probably start with the manga rather than the game. While it kind of spoils a plot point it makes the characters and story much more relatable. Which is one of Ds biggest problems. The DLCs arent really skippable and should also be played after  branches since they provide a lot of characterization which the main game sorely lacks.  Expect a lot of juvenile sex talk. Thats basically what all the dialogues are going to be about.

10750049,0,t1_ddorjcp,I didnt say that... But yeah I sort of said that. Thats your argument now?No I didnt say it nor sort of say it and it also happens to be partially correct anyway. Fact that you decided that theyre can be only one good balance and difficulty is the same thing really. You did all but directly so as much.I actually said the contrary was true. I said the developers have to spend a large amount of time balancing the game for every difficulty. Which directly implies that with a lot of time they can balance it for every difficulty.Name a single AAA thats a JRPG that isnt FFXV. Are you stupid?Whelp that is the dumbest thing Ive heard in an incredibly long time. But fine lets take your stupidity at face value. Pokemon is an easier game. Done.lol as an example of the latter I can confirm youre definitively wrong. How much I play story wise is entirely dependent on how invested I am in the gameplay...Thats not a counterexample at all. That has absolutely no relation to what I said.Exactly. Thanks for proving my point.... it is a simple fact. I wasnt proving anyones point. I was saying that these hypothetical examples which you brought up have no place in the discussion. Well thanks to admitting you you were arguing against a strawman argument then.Are you saying your own argument is strawman or what exactly?Youre basically telling people who dont like your opinion to fuck off lol. My goodness youre dense.Never said anything of the sort.It was arbitrarily decided as THE reward by you. Come on keep up.No it wasnt. It is the most common obvious and intuitive reward for a JRPG though.Well if you say so sWay to be a douchebag.Well youve never taken up basic logic or learned how to use gt on reddit for quotes god you are technologically illiterate eh?... As appeal to authority is a logical fallacy.Ive taken multiple logic courses... You are the one who questioned my credentials which is a poor way of arguing and rightfully backfired on you.So basically you have literally one definition of what balance is and are too closed minded to actually think outside the box let alone pay attention to the many game have already done what you claim is impossible.

10751229,0,t3_5tal1x,FFVI is fairly simple with respect to a lot of the battles but as you progress theres a lot of that not necessarily difficult but satisfying hidden or optional content you know and love from the series. My favorite things about ffvi are the lack of a central main character the rotating party members that way you kind of have to use everyone. I think after a while youll have some of the more popular opinions about ffvi. For me its the goldilocks FF because of the pacing world it really parallels what they wanted in  and  and oldschool mechanics. The game seems simple at first and a lot of the special skills can get you through battles before the game actually picks up but I promise that there is a greaterthanaverage amount of content that develops the game world than other FFs.,JRPG,ddownq7,1,t5_2quw1

10776544,0,t3_5u4syn,Its so sad they are making Tabata the fall guy for this. Everything he says in interviews is clearly spin to avoid stating the really obvious he had to rush the project to hit the Christmas rush release date and the game suffered on every level for it. gtBased on calculations that the development time and cost would double if the latter half of the game was to be an openworld environment as wellWhich is pretty straightforwardly him saying they didnt have the time or budget for it. Like you cant even call it spin at that point it is just pointing out the obvious. He only got the approval to make half a game and he limped it over the line.gt...we had already planned to make the latter half more of a journey by vehicle. The structure of this title  to create memories while traveling in the openworld environment during the first half of the game then have the story move forward linearly using the train in the latter half of the game  was designed and intended to be that way.Which contrasts this statement. It is definitely likely this is true because the train moving in real time suggests it was always meant to be there and it is very definitely true that you miss the adventures of the car and the game does a great job of creating nostalgia. What he isnt saying is that the areas being so underdeveloped is because of the above even if they werent ever going to be open world.I honestly wish he stopped doing these insipid interviews. Most fans get it the game was rushed it was a bad project Tabata did what he could. But all this rationalising it just makes you think he must be aware a sniper has a gun pointed at him anytime he talks publicly.

Within that you also get weapons that to influence the overall score you get when you send your characters off with them instead of choosing to keep them for other characters  they are usually very powerful The score you get determines the overall ending you get. Also sending certain characters off at certain times is how you acquire the best equipmenthow to finish the story with the best possible outcome.

Im not at all a fan of Atlus design methodology and I will silently wait until my Trails in the Sky The rd comes out.Also Tales of Berseria was well received. I wasnt a huge fan of that game either. I felt like the spirit of that specific series has drifted away with my childhood.Yes unpopular opinion but not all JRPGs have the same design or atmosphere attached to them.FFXV was also very well received.

11468539,0,t3_63otxt,I like it and they do it a little different every game but Ill admit that there always comes a point in every tales of game where my brain just checks out of the battle system and I just dont care anymore.  I have actually lowered the difficulty and left everything to the whims of the AI before to get through the last few hours of a game.Its always fun at first though.  There things you can do to change it up too if you really want to.  Play different characters.  Make everything AI controlled but micro manage spellcasting.  Play a higher difficulty that makes timing blocks more important.,JRPG,dfvybb1,6,t5_2quw1

11629935,0,t1_dg2bd0j,They really need to stop trying to go halfway between having a canon couple like Jostelle and having the protagonist able to date anyone persona style.  In all the games they do a good job at establishing how everyone relates to everyone else compared to most persona games for example where theres the group as a whole every individual to the protagonist and some duos here and there but since sky the lack of romance makes it less immersive imo.Take class  is it really realistic that none of these kids developed feelings for each other aside from Rean if he chooses to do so?  ,JRPG,dge9kos,1,t5_2quw1

So you cant have every character with everything.For example if you choose jobs that use Rods and Swords that character will NEVER be able to use any other type of weapon.Its not a job swap but rather you get two Job Licence Boards per character rather than one.,JRPG,dgfxuwr,1,t5_2quw1

11666626,0,t1_dgi3wql,Youre absolutely correct in that Nier Automata isnt dense. It is not the equivalent of reading of piece of philosophical literature. Nier Automatas crowning achievement is not as a book but as a video game. It manages to tie together its philosophical ideas extremely well with the actual gameplay and story onscreen and uses games as a medium to its advantage. Its ideas of predestination and overcoming the death of God are presented in a way that literature or movies never could. The ideas arent more deep but have a unique presentation. Given that this is the JRPG subreddit I understand most people here have a higher tolerance for the separation of game and story than I do so I totally get why the lack of meat is a larger concern.Similarly the game is not flawless  it does recycle environments and enemy design. But the praise the game is getting isnt because its flawless but rather because it is a unique video game that is executed very well. Its like the praise Spec Ops The Line gets  nobody will pretend that Spec Ops has exhilarating combat but its the experience as a whole that pushes it far above par to many people.  That being said I do understand and respect your opinion. I just disagree. Its the video game Ive personally thought the most about since MGS.,JRPG,dgife53,10,t5_2quw1

Was it only JRPGs or all games?Without context the data here doesnt mean much whereas the article title leaves out all those details and presents it like worldwide this is the case.
