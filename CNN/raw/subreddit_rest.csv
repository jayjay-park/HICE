There are almost no mentions of HTTP verbs. There is no mention of nouns as resources.Most people dont pick up on that so at least thats some progress here.Unfortunately the entire REST API culture is a cargo cult built atop poor understanding of the original paper.Youre right. RESTful architecture is not about individual APIs. Its about the entire platform within which APIs exist.If you wanted to built a RESTful API youd have to register your contenttypes representations with IANA and make sure multiple providers use them. And Im not talking about just JSON and XML because no API client can do anything with a generic JSONXML blob I mean specific resource representations like say User Product Order Store and so on.A RESTful API would be one which uses standard yet specific resource representations whose semantics are usable across the industry. And thats the problem because its nearly impossible to summon sudden cooperation from everybody at once when such resource representations are registered  everyone wants to have their take on them.And thats why REST makes no sense for APIs per se. Because business interests like differentiation and providing unique value goes  from what REST wants to be a generic set of API primitives anyone can implement.Examples of RESTful resources aside from the basic web exist but theyre rare. I could cite feeds Atom RSS. Unfortunately after theyve enjoyed some popularity theyre largely dead these days replaced by nonREST alternatives like Facebook Twitter this very site and so on.Maybe the web was a fluke. RESTful architecture is a solid concept and when it happens it takes the world by storm. But it happens very very rarely. Certainly not in some random companys proprietary HTTP API thats for sure.gt I do wonder why Mr. Fielding who had such an impact on the early web with HTTP. libwwwperl and Apache wasnt more involved in HTTP.My guess is he was interested in evolving the semantics of HTTP but HTTP wasnt that. The scope of the spec was lets keep the same semantics but solve efficiency problems.HTTP was never supposed to be the next step in RESTfulness or anything of the sort. Just a lighter and more flexible approach to the same protocol.,rest,d8b9dri,2,t5_2qmms
