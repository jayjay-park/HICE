5091934,0,t3_3kqput,I dont think that Everett limits the number of household pets like some other cities in the area but you may want to look at places located in unincorporated Snohomish County.What kinds of activities do you enjoy?The Navy base is located in North Everett such that her commute would likely be quicker from Marysville than South Everett. Marysville and the adjacent Tulalip Indian Reservation tend to have lower housing prices and can be fairly rural or small town in feel. Plus part of the Navy base is in Marysville. My guess is youll have a better chance of finding a place if you rent a house from a landlord with a small amount of properties.Consider using a real estate agent to search for rental properties.  They typically take their commission from the landlord rather than the renter.,everett,cuzrpzg,2,t5_2r04f
5505098,0,t1_cwfabkl,What state are you from? I take it youll be working at the Everett plant?Washington is a beautiful state. West of the cascades its cool and moist and green with plenty of outdoor and city activities. It dips below freezing intermittently in the Winter and gets random light to moderate snowfalls and the Summers are mostly warm with tolerable peaks. You can pop over the Cascade Mountains in Summer for scorching heat or deep Winter snow. North and east of Everett are quite rural to the south is more urban into Seattle and to the west is Puget Sound. So if youre outdoorsy find a place north or east of Boeing if youre the type wholl want to frequent the center of the known universe and smashing parades major league sports etc then you might went to keep to the south Lynnwood Edmonds to cut the commute down but not too far your work commute will suck if you have to use I. And of course if you want to be near water then stick to the coast. If you just want to hang out in your local city then Northwest Everett Bayside Port Gardner or Delta will keep you in walking distance of many activities. If you want to own acreage for your own horse or llama farm then the Snohomish Valley to the east or else northeast of Marysville.Try to avoid depending on I or Highway  for your daily commute unless you want that acreage.PDF Everett neighborhood map the Boeing plant is between Boulevard Bluffs and WestmontMarysville is to the north Lynnood and Edmonds are to the southwest and Mill Creek a nice yuppyish area is to the southeast.,everett,cwfbt2q,2,t5_2r04f

7436936,0,t3_4h2j45,Cant comment on beers or hikes but we have many restaurants we like. Everett is actually really great for restaurants. Fastish food Memos is great. Try the fish burrito. Drivethru!Nicks has good burgers and gyros. I love the fried pickles. Mikies has great burgers and shakes and onion rings. Barnies Pastrami should be considered a national treasure. Dude makes homemade real pastrami sandwiches the old fashioned way. Delicious.  The Sisters deli is delicious and right next to the Coop Grocery. Very granola but yummy. Less fast foodJanbo has the most delicious pho. They also have tasty everything else. I love the saltandpepper tofu appetizer. Place can be packed so we do takeout a lot. BhuPing has great Thai. El Tapatio has absolutely delicious Mexican. Love the mole!!! No ones discovered it yet. You should. Terra Cotta Red has delicious and slightly fancy Asian fusion food. Giorgios pizza is good. BarsTony Vs is the big one I suppose. We know Tony well and he can be a douche. The crowd can be very punkmetal. Depends on the night. We actually prefer The Wild Hare for just a chill neighborhood bar. Nothing fancy live music some nights the Prince cover band is great when theyre there generous pours once they know you and decent bar food. No atmosphere but sometimes thats what you want. ,everett,d2nj5i2,3,t5_2r04f
7627666,0,t3_4jsqxx,For those that were going or were intending to go the Venue has changed to a bar in Stanwood. Long Story short this is the first time this traveling midget wrestling group has come to Washington. They bring their own x ring with them but we have some law on the books that requires a x. Tony Vs was unable to fit that ring size with the crowd that was expected. No fault here just dumb laws that regulate ring size for wrastlin. ,everett,d3983it,1,t5_2r04f

The victim had a GSW to the leg and abdomen and has been taken to the hospital. There was a manhunt for the shooter.
