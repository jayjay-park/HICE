4036817,0,t1_crgdlvc,Well its not that I want the game to be easier its more the frustration of getting boned by this every other run right now. Every other death feels like it was my fault and I could do better next time. Blocked stairs is just a RNG screwing me moment. The console commands will help though thanks!,Cogmind,crgfekg,2,t5_30h9z
4125966,0,t1_crqku88,Oh sorry   I didnt mean to belittle anyone! Hes just the only active LPer that posts on the forums and stuff along with Phuket. My bad,Cogmind,crql2s8,3,t5_30h9z
4236063,0,t3_39dnb7,I have only been playing it for  minutes so far but I confirm that it still appears to work with Wineskin!Looking nice so far Kyzrati but I dont understand how to drop an item in keyboard mode is there an option?,Cogmind,cs33ncy,2,t5_30h9z
5091785,0,t1_cuzodkk,I since found that hiding up in the top right corner there. Thanks though. I tried following your stealth guide. It ended up being more of a run really fast while getting shot the fuck up strat than stealth but it got me to .,Cogmind,cuzr2s9,2,t5_30h9z
5311908,0,t1_cvq94ok,Bike works great for me too outdoors. I wish I had more than once or twice a week to do it but with family and all time is somewhat limited. That and I have trouble biking anything less than km at a time pGarrisons will introduce some neat stuff. Even neater than I initially imagined as I implement it now D Their primary purpose is as an alternative entryway for squads but like everything else in the game there are many facets to the mechanic. For one you can hack the gateway.,Cogmind,cvqnpi6,2,t5_30h9z
5385736,0,t1_cw01gy2,Thanks itll be worth the wait since its just going to keep getting better anyway. Promise ,Cogmind,cw036rr,2,t5_30h9z

6017116,0,t1_cy8b9y0,The last update does some neat inventory management things now,Cogmind,cy8dbvt,1,t5_30h9z
9122237,0,t1_d88bo2g,gt  is hard isnt it? I have a feeling people will say that a little less often come Alpha . But well seemaybe the new areas that make  easier are going to be hard as well in and of themselves P,Cogmind,d88cduy,1,t5_30h9z
9240750,0,t1_d8nb1jx,But everyone loves melee attackers and Behemoths! ltActually the main reason for buffing Duelists is that you can take their new stuff Pgt So how does one achieve this? Is it a secret?Not really a secret no since the release notes mention utilities which can help you head in that direction D. They wont quite bring you to  but there are... theoretical ways to do it? Not something I expect to really see often! Im curious if anyone can actually do it. Kind of a crazy number all things considered!,Cogmind,d8nbyxe,1,t5_30h9z
9265855,0,t1_d8qd24l,Why would you attach  wheels? Explain yourself.,Cogmind,d8qih8z,2,t5_30h9z
9393030,0,t1_d96fll8,Oh youre already over there? PYep lotsa channels...,Cogmind,d96msya,1,t5_30h9z
10053742,0,t1_dbi0ui5,You can also try AltF gt  AltF gt Spacebar for faster response time P,Cogmind,dbi0ztl,2,t5_30h9z
10903477,0,t1_de4010v,Thank you for the tips! This is very helpful. Didnt expect a response like that.The thing I really like about the avoidance display is that you also get to see the breakdown. Overtime itd be nice if we could get one like that for any given target. E.g. a display to actually see  enemy moved last turned etc.Thanks again D,Cogmind,de4m6v1,2,t5_30h9z
10909910,0,t1_de58lny,But... it is a button? Not sure what you mean since it looks like all the other buttons when your mouse hovers over it it lights up and goes beep and you can click on it to open the map and everything.Theres also a tutorial message that appears later once youve gotten further to let you know theres a map and how to access it but no one reads tutorial messages ,Cogmind,de5a37n,2,t5_30h9z
10915177,0,t3_5vy02a,I know exactly what Im going to do for Alpha .Pure melee buildWith multiple swordsDueling with a duelistWith Unstable EvolutionAnd Scavenger modesHolding a structural scanner because caveins are the most annoying thing ever existed! Thank you for adding this update!,Cogmind,de5tn9o,2,t5_30h9z
