4654187,0,t3_3eple6,Spencer is my top suspect. It would explain some weird things such as why Toby signed those papers and dropped the investigation a lot of Toby weirdness why he acts angry with her times that it seems like he is hiding something  why Peter was adamant about stopping the investigation what A is trying to make Spencer remember that weird dream Holes in the theory Peter initially encouraged them to investigate so either he didnt know Spencer was involved maybe Jessica covered it up? or its not her we have no proof Spencer was in Radley before except for that dream. The dream sequence seems to be a manifestation of her subconscious the girl resembles the girl in the poster by the door and not a flashback so I guess it is possible that she was there at the right time? ,MysteryLittleLiars,cth7xan,1,t5_399zh

4704199,0,t3_3fcbf5,Hi Im SoundSpiral but can you guys can refer to me by my nickname J.J. Im nineteen female also soon to be a college freshman. I decided to check out PLL during the ghost train also the mystery aspect of the show really fasinated me I throughly enjoy searching for clues piecing the story together I still do and Id been watching it ever since. Nice to meet you Mo and Dani!,MysteryLittleLiars,ctni2on,2,t5_399zh
4717114,0,t1_ctp4dr8,Yeah I definitely think theres a way round it.He could have done some training he obviously has medical knowledge as he was able to sort Hannas leg out and Charles was able to implant the tracker chips.I agree he didnt go to Oxford and possibly hasnt ever been to the UK. I think if Wren is Charles then Dr Palmer was his doctor and he took on the british accent as an homage to him. Id be surprised if Dr P being british when there is another suspicious british Dr in Rosewood is a coincidence.Charles also has the hacker skills and funds as you say to fake records and such to get him a residency. It happened in Suits so Im sure it can happen in PLL!,MysteryLittleLiars,ctp4prg,1,t5_399zh
4717714,0,t1_ctp7cvv,Wrenny ha! Yeah I mean even if you ignore the accent hes like a WrenJason hybrid so there is definitely something there.,MysteryLittleLiars,ctp7fph,1,t5_399zh
4733655,0,t1_ctr5gmh,Yeah the webisodes were neat but nothing much there. When I mentioned I didnt recall CeceJason having a scene together someone turned me onto the webisodes.I thought that same thing with the tweets last night. I like Sasha a lot but damn I know she hasnt been on set much already and theyre starting  and that little bit might have been for a visit!spoiler. Marlene sets people up sort of with false hopes and gets them worked up. Not to be personally evil imo but because its the nature of the show horrordrama not romancedrama. She may want to give them an experience of living in Rosewood but weve seen the set up for failure. Teasing Paiges return for example Ezria being the fabric of the show. Oh! Emison being the fabric as well. Julian being sorely missed Tammin being a big part of S ...the list goes on. I know shes not technically lying but it just gets people worked up and into fights and ugh campaigning for stuff. Another possible reason which may be more realistic is that the networks push this social stuff to get some kind of wordofmouth going and have some kind of positive numbers to brag about. Its probably a little of both.I just wish the fans knew how unreal it all was.And I know some of those Snapchats are purposefully throwing off the fans from whats to come! Example show a lot of Lorenzo people assume Alisons going to be on the show and with Lorenzo. And its ALL to drum up the hits replies tweets wars... I find it so meanspirited like people would be better off staying far away from those accounts if theyre going to take them so seriously.But theyre never outright lies theyre just oh heres Troian and Keegs arent they so cute! and people assume that means Spoby. Sorry for the long rant its just a bummer to see what they purposefully DO to people just to get retweets and drum up the drama.Anyway yeah Ive read Pratchett  I loved seize the throat instead of seize the day.

4805136,0,t3_3gpgde,I was  on the Wren is A train you all know this. As soon as CeCe turned around I was ready to quit. But I was gripped when it was revealed that Charles didnt mean to hurt Ali in the bathtub.  Then when Bethany pushed Marion for no fucking reason I was like bitch deserved to get gone then CeCe got into UPenn and I was actually so proud of her?! The biggest reason I didnt want CeCe to be A was because we were told time and time again that we would feel sorry for A and I could NOT feel sorry for CeCe or so I thought.  But then CeCe hit Alison and I could feel the anguish in her eyes and then when all she wanted to do was get her mother to forgive her... And then when she found her mother dead I was in tears. The way it was going was that I was really excited to see RC and BV unveiling but I could just TELL that they had planned for CeCe to be all of these characters but responded to fan criticsm of Sara when writingfilming the finale so they changed that up because there was nothing that Sara being in those disguises added i.e. Her character as RCBV could have just as easily been CeCe and I think they just wanted to give Sara purpose because it DIDNT explicitly contradict. Time to start my rewatch but I do really think this was planned from the beginning. Start of S anyway. ,MysteryLittleLiars,cu086s9,1,t5_399zh
4821091,0,t1_cu28bi3,And if she DOES do something like this... Its because shes read fan responses.  In which case everyone should get a cut ,MysteryLittleLiars,cu28l12,4,t5_399zh
