I am sorry I just thought you wanted the most durable holster possible if you are after a fashion good there might be someone.  Maybe uNstarleather do you have a pouch like this design?  He might be able to help you and your son he does good work in North Carolina or South Carolina I get them confused.  Either way he does good work.  Maybe someone else will think of something for you.  Good luck!,LeatherClassifieds,d7twdkf,1,t5_38b95

9482552,0,t3_5alk47,I have a similar bag available here but its actually the same price as saddleback. The difference is that its completely done by hand including the sewing. Id be happy to make changes to the design for you typically for no charge. I can also lower the price of the bag by using different leather as the chromexcel I have in the listing is pretty expensive.Let me know if youre interested or have any questions!,LeatherClassifieds,d9hxg85,1,t5_38b95
