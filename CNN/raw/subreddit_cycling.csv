When you factor in the cost of labor to assemble the frame and groupset prebuilt will be around  cheaper for a typical  new road bike.Used prebuilts are by far the best way to get bang for your buck.

Now add texting on the phone to the equation. Its all over. Youre roadkill.You need to make yourself more than just a little visible.

1346952,0,t3_29i5ak,First familiarize yourself with the Sheldon Brown website. Most of the questions that you will have on bikes will probably be addressed there.  miles is good if youre going out  to  days a week. Every week try to up it another  miles if possible or if yo have a regular route try to add in another mile or two every week. Dont go nuts right now you just want to get into shape. If the terrain is hilly use an easier gear range and go for cadence trying to mash the pedals will only get you sore knees. If your terrain is flatter go for cadence at first for a few weeks and then try shifting into higher gears and keeping the same cadence. Youll eventually train to go faster. I buy my shorts on Amazon. Pearl Izumi is a decent midpriced brand. You may need to learn to do some basic maintenance. At the very least learn how to fix a flat tire the most common woe. Or get some Continental GatorSkins which are Kevlar lined to prevent  of things from causing flats. ,cycling,cil5c6e,5,t5_2qhyi

I had the CAAD  with  and i sold the groupset and bought force  because i hated how it felt. Personal preference though. The two frames are both fabulous and i have spent a good deal of time on both. The carbon is smoother but you can easily compensate by losing a little pressure in your tires of getting wider ones which is the trend anyways. Honestly you cant go wrong with any of them.

I guess the reason Ive been able to use it is it turned an aggressive race frame into a relaxed frame by being higher but it is specifically the more aggressive position I was after and enjoyed more on other bikes since.In the shop today they seemed to describe the emonda as toward sportive but the trek website seems to say its the domane thats endurance vs emonda racingclimbing.  its possible that was just one individuals perception based on the slope but I know theres more to it...they do offer test rides it seems its possible whats going on is  works for me since long legs but also long arms .. so the saddle is higher but I can reach down just fine plus Ive heard of going one size down for more aggressive.

Consider every  feet of climb to be like an extra mile fo flat.Also wind is huge more than you would expect.Aside from tire pressure make sure your breaks do not rub.  Flip over your bike and spin the pedals.  The wheel should keep going for at least  seconds and should never brush against the brakes.  Same for front wheel but pushed by hand.Last is tread.  Bumpy tires grip dirt but slow you  on pavement.  Smooth tread is faster.Last make sure you have water salt and have eaten in the last few hours.

Dont buy junk it will be a poor investment. Bikesdirect.com is good value. You are also better off buying a cheap bike and just replacing the wheels with better quality  this is a concern because of your weight congrats on dumping lbs btw broken spokes from shitty wheels are a major PITA.  But Id run with the ones it comes with till you get failures. Do not tie the dog to the bike. Having it yank you off the bike into gravel just in time for your husband to land on you because of a rabbit will suck. Easy tips you want  speeds min. When you are out of steam that granny gear is a blessing. You do NOT want suspension of any kind. Usable suspension is well past your price point and bad suspension is worse than none. Fit for size and seat comfort are king. If the saddle is uncomfortable change it  this may take several goes High end bikes are expensive because they are light its way easier to lose lbs than take lbs out of the weight of a bike. If you take it up  and I hope you do  what you buy probably wont be your last bike. Buy something that fits and ride. Youll figure it out as you go. Oh on fit Put the pedals straight up and down when sitting on the saddle without rocking your hips you put your heel onto the downside pedal. There should be a slight bend in the knee. Put the pedals horizontal put the ball of you foot on the front pedal. Your knee should be directly above the pedal axis. That will get you really close to ideal.

While this is not very hard if you use a grinder it still attracts a lot of attention. Inspecting the bikes in the neighborhood and choosing which one to steal requires some effort. While a thief might not check how the lock works he will see that the plugin chain locks into the frame itself next to an unknown keyhole. A marking sticker with a text like antitheft system could do the trick.  The bikes in which we build our prototypes are fixed but can be made singlespeed too flipflop hub.

5262873,0,t3_3n02s9,Ok you said no hills and tri bike owning Floridian so as one of those I live in the Sarasota area I can help you out with some real world comparisons. First of all everyone is right in that keeping your cadence somewhere between  will dictate what gearring combo youre in. But heres where I as an average strength female triathlete average mph solo fall. Ill warm up often in the little ring with a medium gear to get my cadence up then switch to the big ring with an easier gear. Most of the male cyclists I ride in stay in the big ring medium gear for flateasy stuff. For overpasses I stay in the big ring going down to an easier gear unless Im in the mood to mash which is rare with my distance training. For actual hills like San Antonio or Clermont Ill be in and out of the little ring all the time. Going downhill max that shit out to get the most speed.It sounds like you want to get stronger so unless you have the opportunity to go to the hills once a week Id advise doing some heavy gear intervals to build up leg strength. A sample heavy gear workout for me is  minutes warmup keeping my cadence at around  then x minute all out with the big ring and hardest gear I can use and still pedal at around rpm with  minutes recovery in between. On a good day that maxes out my gears! Then back to a comfortable ride for another  minutes for a total of .

I just thoughthoped it was different here I agree that many people are uncomfortable cycling in traffic and use the footpath for safety but this creates many unsafe situations as well. Ive had multiple times where I was almost run over by a cyclist while I was walking because they were going too fast on a footpath. I think while it may be safer for cyclists it is not the case for pedestrians and in the long term it would be better for cyclists to become comfortable enough cycling on busier roads as there are many parts of citiestowns where cyclists really should not be on footpaths but belong on the road. The ideal situation would of course be people growing up cycling on roads and anticipating cyclists on the road as well as roads designed for cyclist and drivers to occupy together. Im of course not at all biased because that is the way I grew up  I know that where I live now several courses are offered to cyclists to learn to interact with traffic but unless drivers also learn its not going to do very much good... ,cycling,cww72dy,1,t5_2qhyi

6220301,0,t3_40r7x4,In my opinion youll be creating more problems than youll be solving by going this route. You may get better rollover in the front end by going with a  wheel but it will be counteracted by significantly more sluggish front end handling and the tendency to lose front end traction. A . wheel AND fork wont affect the geometry quite as much but will not give you a very significant increase in rollover ability. Also a lot of modern er frames handle much better than they did a few short years ago.

To start indoor training I bought a cycle ops mag trainer it was OK but didnt give me the range of resistances I wanted. I switched to a kinetic fluid trainer and I love it. Only a bit more money but the real to road feel and the improved flexibility I feel like I have on it was worth every penny. Im ditching it soon to get a smart trainer one that controls resistance for you since I do  days riding a week on the trainer.In terms of gear I agree speed and cadence are useful for understanding power and designing good workouts. Garmin makes a good ant  speed and cadence sensor that will plug into a computer with the sensors wirelessly connected to your back wheel and pedal respectively.

6370164,0,t3_42wgox,Yes you can fit x tires on the FELT. Your LBS will probably even switch them to s to seal the deal. Doesnt hurt to ask anyway. The Defy is an enduranceminded frame. The geometry is much more relaxed than the TCR or Propel. It is difficult to determine what size bike you should buy from just a few words online. if you are  and have ridden a SML bike painfree for a while then that leads me to believe you have short arms or a small torso. Id say at the bare minimum youd need a cm top tube. Bike shops will do as little as they need to do to sell a bike. If youve convinced yourself before you walk in then their job is done. Have them sell you on the bike. GIANT stores should all have a bikefit setup. They can measure you and tell you exactly what to get. Most bike shops should to be honest. ,cycling,czdpued,3,t5_2qhyi

A high vis tabard worn over a regular jacket will do the job. a mirror   handlebar or helmet mounted makes it so much easier to stay aware of whats going on behind you.Some kind of legwear that is comfortable when wet such as cycling tights or commuting trousersa good lock ie a ulock or heavy chain not a cable lock.Advisablea rack and some panniers  for a six mile commute its much more comfortable to have the bike rather than your back take the load also stops your back getting all sweaty.  Tortec racks are cheap but good quality I use the expedition as I like the option of strapping large items on the platform the velocity is a nice low profile option. Most people swear by ortlieb panniers and they are excellent I find them too small though. The combination of a decent pocket and much greater capacity meant Ive used my Altura orkneys far more.  If youre just taking a few things Id go for ortliebs however if you plan on doing a shop on the way home Orkneys are a better option. miles is quite doable in regular clothing however its much nicer in cycling garb if theres somewhere to change amp ideally shower at work then nothing can beat lyrca especially if you intend to push it and get a good workout. Some padded shorts winter tights thermal tops and a winter jersey should do you for now.clipless pedals and cycling shoes  not for everyone but I love em so much nicer to ride in especially if you are riding hard. Hybrid pedals like shimano M allow you to ride with cycling or regular shoes. If you arent overflowing with spare cash and you can wait a while aldi sell surprisingly good quality cycling gear at a fraction the price youll pay elsewhere in their special buys.

6791598,0,t3_48s4v6,That totally depends upon what your goal is.  If you are simply looking to complete the Tri you can certainly do it on a hybrid.  With a bit of training  miles is not too much of a stretch for most people on any kind of decent bicycle road hybrid etc....  If you are hoping to post a competitive time you wont do that on a hybrid.My wife completed both the BostonNY AIDS ride and some triathlon in Monterey CA on a total POS heavy steel Diamondback hybrid over  years ago.  Shes a fit person but not some kind of superathlete.  If she can do it on that equipment you should be able to do so on the . which is a fairly decent entrylevel machine.You will probably not be the only person on a hybrid unless this is some supercompetitive event. You will be vastly outnumbered by people on road bikes and tri bikes but there will be other casuals on bikes like yours and worse.As for finishing that leg of the race and leaving some gas in the bottle for your legs youre going to need to train to learn to cycle efficiently.  You need to learn to spin fast and light.  Youll be looking to maintain an average  rpm pedaling cadence and using light effort spread around  of the pedaling stroke  oclock to  or  oclock positions.  Dont ever mash the pedals and dont sprint and coast.  Steady even power output is your goal.  Dont worry about speed or time your only goal is endurance.As for bike modifications the most noticeable change you can make will be to fit some road slicks somewhere in the  mm width range.  You should probably get a bike fit youre going to spend a lot of time on this bike training.  If youre a flexible person you might also look into a drop stem to get you a slightly more aerodynamic position on the bike.Now with all of this said.  Youd be better off at least on a road bike. If you decide to pick up another bike for this event I would recommend against buying a TriTT style bike unless you see yourself specializing in this discipline.  If you think you may get into biking more and dabbling in the occasional tri etc... you could do well on a traditional road bike.  Either pick up an entrylevel new or middle of the road used road bike and that can serve you well until you make the decision on whether you want to go wholehog into Triathlons.  And even if you do you might want to n the tri bike because the road bike will be much more versatile and comfortable for other pursuits.,cycling,d0m476l,5,t5_2qhyi

7222014,0,t3_4ecdqz,Instead of echoing the more general suggestions I do have a specific suggestion based on experience the Trek .. My first bike was a Trek  the equivalent from a couple decades ago. What some have said about CXgravel bikes is very valid since theyre the ultimate doeverything bikes but if youre racing triathlons youre going to want a more aggressive geometry frame which those arent going to give you. My  was a roadracing type frame that also came with rack and fender mounts not the most comfortable for longdistance commuting but doable and was great for racing after Id upgraded the parts. I dont know many other bigname and thus both available in a wide range of sizes AND affordable bikes that offer both of those options but I could be mistaken! Even a lot of a racier CX bikes wont have mount points and you probably dont want the weight of disc brakes anyway. Re what was said about a backpack vs a rack it really depends on your commute. Mines only  miles but its nothing but hills and city traffic and with the amount of crap I have to carry a backpack or messenger bag is just unwieldily. ,cycling,d1z36sm,5,t5_2qhyi

Are you going to go back in time and tell all the riders back then that they arent really riding steel because their bars seatpost wheels stem cranks are all made of aluminium?Different materials suit different jobs. Steel doesnt make sense for those parts but it does for frames and for some things like chains and cable inners and maybe brake rotors steel is the only suitable material. Carbon is by far the best material for seatposts but there are some parts and uses its not welll suited for like forks on touring bikes.I dont know what the chip on your shoulder is  I ride carbon steel and alu bikes and appreciate all three.,cycling,d2pc1ac,1,t5_2qhyi

Stiffness refers to  resistance to flex. Endurance frames are often made with a softerflex carbon than an equivalent race bike in order to provide more comfort which is why I said the difference in stiffness between a quality steel frame and a carbon endurance frame wont be as noticeable as that between a steel frame and carbon race bike.,cycling,d2pv8v7,1,t5_2qhyi

7521480,0,t3_4idcup,My suggestion is to get a good fitting from a fitter at a good shop.     If your saddle height bar height reach to the bars and other easy adjustments are off the bike will make you sore.         Also lay off some of that protein endurance sports require carbs.     Be sure to fuel before rides with a bowl of oatmeal or a Clff Bar.       Take a  Cliff Bar some Cliff Blocks or GU packets with you.   To get to longer distances you will need to fuel on the bike. Drink plenty of water on rides.           Try to spin lighter gears to reach your desired speed.         New riders often mash on too hard a gear with slow pedaling.         This low cadence mashing of hard gears makes sore legs.       Ride on have fun. ,cycling,d2x5luh,18,t5_2qhyi

7587301,0,t3_4j82u9,I was in your position about a year and a bit ago. What I found helped me best was to plan routes that got progressively further afield and used strava to plan them. They have a good route planning tool and if you combine that with a handlebar mount it gave me much more confidence to go down roads I didnt know. This is a cheaper alternative to a garmin computerGPS. Maybe not as good and bulker depending upon your phone I bought a quadlock universal kit out from mount and use a Sony z but I was able to plan  mile routes down winding broads and country lanes UK away from busy traffic and had confidence to go much further and I have started to ride some great local roads. I found these quieter roads helped me to gain confidence and I enjoyed the ride more. Its also good to look what roads are popular with other cyclists and on strava you can look at other peoples rides and use them to plan your own.Ive only just switched to clipless pedals  found that Im proformas better but too still suffer slightly with cramps and numbness. I found having the shoes looser helps loads and now use a pair of insoles to give arch structure in my foot. Speed isnt so much of a big deal. Its affected by so many variables maybe focus on perceived effort as a guide for how your progressing. How easy local climbs are becoming. You will find the speed goes up. As for descending speed go at whats comfortable and correctly position yourself in the road if passing traffic is around. That will give you room to react and should make drivers overtake correctly. Food has been mentioned before and again use it if your riding more than around  mins. Even if its just a banana or a jam sarnie sandwich  something that can be eaten comfortably during a ride. Energy drinks not the Red Bull kind can be an easy substitute. I also found that during warmer weather isotonic drinks can be good for increased fluid intake. These are the things that helped me most. Others might not agree or have different advice but what ever works for you is best. Unless your training for racing then go with what you enjoy I like the sense of adventure cycling gives me to go through the countryside and I like the speed aspect too. And if that helps me to not be so fat the bonus. ,cycling,d34n0n1,2,t5_2qhyi

Wheels by themselves dont make a big enough difference to matter in cases like that. And your ride will most likely be rougher with the new wheels on nonpavement surfaces. New wheels do feel amazing on pavement though and that psychological boost might encourage you to go ride more and train more so that you can keep up on those hilly rides. Interval training and hill repeats are what will help you be a better climber. ,cycling,d3kv9ci,4,t5_2qhyi

Long head tube and upward turned stem mean itll be very hard to get into anything near a low or aerodynamic position.  Can you ride in a lower position? If not theres little point in getting drops.Maybe start by lowering the stem and flipping it the other way up. Put the spacers underneath the stem above it. Do a ride. How do you feel?

If you dont have time to install and buy gel pads under your bar tape you can double wrap the handlebars with a second layer of bar tape to have the same effect. Obviously you should switch out from using something like a Lizard skin to cork tape if you are doing this.With regards to the other comment I would think that lowering your stem would have the opposite effect of relieving pressure on your arms as it would create more vertical drop. You should try lowering your seat a little or moving your seat forward a bit which would reduce the drop and reach to your handle bars which should relieve some weight pressure.,cycling,d3t4j53,2,t5_2qhyi

8070486,0,t3_4pqrzi,Could just be a matter of cable stretch. Attempt to add some tension to the cable that activates the front derailleur. The front derailleur is the the device that physically moves the chain between gears on the front. If the cable has stretched your gear shifter twist shifter by the way can no longer pull enough cable to keep the chain on the biggest gear. Adding tension causes it to more easily shift the chain to the big gear. There may or may not be a mechanism for such adjustment. In some cases it is a barrel adjuster wherein you twist a barrellike coupling to create more distance between the shifter and the derailleur in terms of cable length. Should your bike not have such adjusters  these can be found somewhere inline with the cable most likely on the shifter or somewhere on the frame you will have to manually adjust how much cable is between the shifter and derailleur. If at al possible seek to adjust by means of barrel adjuster first. Should the barrel adjuster be maxed out return it to its most slack setting and reset the cable bolt on the front derailleur to a point that easily engages all front gears  these are called chainrings by the way. Then use the barrel adjusters to fine tune the way the bike shifts. TLDR if you skipped directly to this part seek a bike shop. ,cycling,d4n76ef,1,t5_2qhyi

8190888,0,t3_4ku484,Slight update hereI went tubless on my road bike. Ended up with the Schwable Pro Ones.The rubber on them do not seem quite as durable as my previous set of Conti Gator Skins or Conti GP  S IIs however the road feel is fantastic.Mounting the tires was easy I DID NOT need to use an air compressor to set the bead just a floor pump and a few minutes of pumping. How I did it place tire on rim like I normally would inject sealent into removable core valve stem apply soapy water around the whole rim on both sides rotating the rim while doing this to spread the sealent inside simply pump. I heard some hissing but after about  good pumps it seated and I was up to psi.I let it sit for a bit and checked the pressure and it didnt drop at all. Have taken it out for about  miles of riding so far and havent had any issues. Im very happy.Comments about the ride I dont know if its an improvement in rolling resistance or if it is just the feel of being tubeless but everything seems to be more responsive im guessing outer rotational mass has been reduced. the ride feels great. bumps arent as sharp. handling is great as well. I didnt loose any weight off the bike with the conversion but I dont feel as worried about having to carry a whole set up in my saddle bag any more so my average ride will be lighter overall which is great.I highly recommend people try out tubeless the gains for me definitely are worth it. I invested in a large bottle of stans sealent which should last me a few years both road and crossmtb  so IMO that investment was well worth it.,cycling,d51euxh,1,t5_2qhyi

About five minutes down the road I was kick standing behind a car waiting for it to move on. As I started to move my feet seized. Confused I got off my bike to have a look. My tie was caught up in the chain and rear mech and had managed to rip off the hanger and bend the mech. Tried to get it repaired in my LBC this morning but apparently the hanger is specific to my brand of bike vitus zenium and they didnt have it in stock.

The Cannondale summer sale offered a credit to the shops account on sold bikes so the shop did not lose any income on the deal. Other companies will give a long lead time of warning so that the shop can be prepared for the loss in profit on the products. These are the two best ways a company can do a sale.But often times companies do a bad job of implementing a sale. Either they drop it out of no where so the shop bought from the company at full price but then are requested to sell with a huge loss. Or they force a shop to buy in to a sale. So they have to buy a usually very large load of product at the sale price in order to be a part of the sale.,cycling,d6fw80r,8,t5_2qhyi

8628374,0,t3_4xz8ky,I recently found out about Garmin line of action cams. They have built in GPS and accelerometers so they can measure speed and distance as well as log the route map. They also have ANT so you can connect any compatible heart rate monitor cadence sensor or power meters to it which will automatically sync their data to the video time code. And then when you edit the video with the Garmin software you can set up a full overlay with any of that data displayed in real time on the video. Or have a GMeter and a track layout map with position marker for auto use.The Garmin comes with a car kit package that has a window suction mount. And it is compatible with most GoPro mounts as well.Video quality isnt as good as the Hero but it is on par with most better than average action cams. I would say about on par with the middle of the road Sony action cams.I will be ordering one at the end of the month for rallyX use and cycling.Anyway hadnt seen it mentioned here wanted to put it out there so you could check it out for yourself.,cycling,d6k5g6i,1,t5_2qhyi

On my commute home I increase the pace and stretch it out a bit more and typically average  mph for  miles. On flats I can maintain  mph indefinitely well up to a certain point say  miles but Ill usually push it to  mph on the flats for more training and since they dont last long in my area.But yeah treat every trip as a training ride unless you need to be not sweaty on your commute to work and youll be amazed at the increase in speed over a few months.If you are really interesting in how you stack up check out Strava and you can compare yourself to others on the same stretch of road. ,cycling,d6q9f3z,1,t5_2qhyi

Just an idea I would like to suggest have you thought about getting one bike for fun riding mostly training and such for around the .K price range and a second bike for racing like a Caad  or Specialized Allez Sprint Expert at about the k range? Because I agree with others that youre likely to lose some parts in the corners when you go for a swim in the pavement.

8830635,0,t3_514n9w,I frequently climb a winding road into the mountains that is also used by many other cyclists and road users. Many of the turns are blind and to the left with the mountain blocking any views of oncoming traffic. Im always afraid someone too impatient to wait for clear view will cross the double yellow just as another vehicle or cyclist is coming around the corner. Its much easier to descend on a bike at  than it is in a car and I dread the thought of a collision under these circumstances. When Im climbing and approached from behind by a car on one of these turns I will take my left hand off the bar and hold it with my palm open sort of waving it down by my hip. As soon as I can see the corner is clear I will wave them to pass. I realize this is sort of a distributive system and all road laws are written around singular responsibility but an evasive action could easily cause me to get hit by a passing car. I always appreciate the drivers willing to wait and without fail they have all waved or nodded as they go past. Of course theres always the guy in the lowered subaru that thinks theyre a race car driver that you hear blazing up the hill.Im not afraid to communicate to someone interested in communicating but I wont even bother when its more likely to distract or confuse a situation. I think the blind corners on this climb are a fairly obvious challenge for drivers so they get the point pretty easily. Cant say Id try this in many other places. ,cycling,d79bhmo,3,t5_2qhyi

Even so when Im fat and have been off the bike Im crap.  When Im fit all round Im a competitive B in a very hilly region even though Im in my s.  The reason is that most PDF us are far worse at moving blood around than we are at breathing.Hit the hills slower then build into them. Keep your effort at or below the biggest output you can sustain for the entire hill.  Make sure your gearing is right if your dealing with anything over  youll want a compact crankset on the front and at least a  on the back.  If your gears are too high you will be forced to put out too much power on steep grades.Lose weight if youre a little chunky.Ride a lot of hills on long rides.Use Strava to track your improvement against yourself  who cares what everyone else does??Keep up the hard work and youll be killing hills in  months!!,cycling,da8ryor,6,t5_2qhyi

9866213,0,t3_5gmxya,Many people here would disagree but I have a Cateye Volt  thats more than bright enough to see and be seen unless youre riding trails at gtkmh I generally run it at the lowest brightness level but if theres much traffic around Ill switch it to pulse mode constant low with fullbright pulses. If its very dark out and Im riding fast Ill switch it to mid or full brightness so I can see the road ahead better.If you decide that you want to go brighter DONT RIDE WITH THE LIGHT until youve taken the bike outside when its dark and checked that the light is positioned to prevent blinding oncoming traffic. Being seen is all well and good but if everyone who sees you cant see anything else for the next  seconds youre a danger to everyone else on the road.Multiple lights are a good idea especially in the rear only one blinking rear light means that youre almost invisible half the time while one blinking and one solid rear light draws attention and allows easy tracking of your position. The same is true of front lights. Fastblinking lights can be distracting to other traffic you want to make them aware of your position but rapid flashing will constantly draw ones focus while a slow flash allows them to track you while watching the road ahead. In the extreme a very fast blink rate gtHz or so can just make the light look less bright while not drawing more attention than a solid light.,cycling,datl9fo,2,t5_2qhyi

Because of this I can spend a lot more time in aero than with my redshift conversion. ,cycling,dct0auo,2,t5_2qhyi

10687473,0,t1_ddi6rz1,You are being a dick by being obtuse.  I would have thought the definition of open question is pretty basic English.  But perhaps Im assuming a grasp of basic critical thinking that goes beyond what I should expect.If the question is open that means it hasnt been resolved.  Its incorrect to assume any other position than we dont know.  To claim that sunlight doesnt damage the foam in helmets through normal use is just as incorrect as to say it does.Just because its an unresolved open question does not mean that there is zero evidence.  UV light does damage the kind of foam used in bike helmets.  Bike helmets are exposed to UV radiation.  Both of these facts are evidence but not conclusive evidence that resolves the questionThere is also evidence to show that the foam doesnt get damaged by normal UV exposures for bike helmets the only peer reviewed study that I could find addressing bike helmet degradation found no evidence of age on helmet safety.  Thats evidence for your position and pretty good evidence too.The study though did not look at UV exposure.Feel free to look it up yourself Kroeker SG Bonin SJ DeMarco AL Good CA Siegmund GP.  Age Does Not Affect the Material Properties of Expanded Polystyrene Liners in FieldUsed Bicycle Helmets. J Biomech Eng. So theres evidence for both hypotheses.You should note though that even in that paper the authors state that the issue of UV exposure is not resolvedgt Environmental and use factors that may be expected to influence the material properties of polymers include UV radiation exposure to fluids and chemicals changes in temperature and a history of impacts. While we excluded helmets that had evidence of impactrelated damage exposure to these other factors remains unknown but are potential causes of crosslinking or chain scission that may lead to an embrittled surface and a variation in the material properties along the depth of the foam . Changes in the material properties may include a decrease in the yield strength and yield strain and an increase in the elastic modulus . These exposure effects vary with the levels and time of exposure and can in some cases be mitigated. For example stabilizers in the foam can help reduce the effects of UV radiation and temperature . In addition to not knowing the exposure history for each helmet we do not know what design or manufacturing changes occurred over the range of manufacturing years we tested.If youre aware of any other peerreviewed studies on the topic that Ive missed even for other kinds of helmets then go right ahead and show it.,cycling,ddic04w,1,t5_2qhyi

I consider myself a causal cyclist and mostly ride on quiet streets where I live. When Im at work I can see both sides of the story and usually I side with cyclist but often times they can be completely jackasses. For me using the bike lane doesnt mean you own that lane. Often times people dont realize that they are in a bike lane shame on them for being unobservant but whatever and the cyclist becomes super aggressive and yells youre in the bike lane! I get that its the bike lane and everything but I think its better to just slow down and avoid the person and move on with your life. Also I think intersection are scary as hell.

It has an great sl frame with Zertz but when you compare the elite and comp with the new Future shock specialized released a stat of over  increase in compliance on the new frames over the sl. The new frames are also rider first engineered which is a huge plus coming from a guy who rides the  tarmac  settling between the elite and comp the comp has a few nice upgrades that you just need to decide if you care about. Most have been stated before but Ill write it again. Shifters are  gt ultegra so lighter and smoother. Brakes are mechanical tektro gt hydraulic shimano thats a no brainer for me because I am in love with my tarmac a hydraulic disc brakes.  Wheels are a small upgrade honestly not hugely noticeable. Praxis cranks are an upgrade again not huge. Those are really the changes. Sounds like your said you ride mainly just the weekends. I think youll be absolutely more than happy with the elite.  Im a rider that will want just a little nicer of things and when you ride and feel the difference between mechanical disc and hydraulic you will know what I mean but whatever is in your budget. Comfort wise you wont feel really any difference in elite or comp. Best of luck!!! ,cycling,dfopk6u,1,t5_2qhyi

I can tell you losing weight as a cyclist is pretty easy but you do have to be careful you arent overfeeding yourself on rides and also eating too much when you get back.gt losing leg musclestrengthYou are a cyclist? These are your engines? Why would you want to lose that? What you want to be focussed on is losing fat not muscle.I suspect that at cm and kg you probably have more fat than you think you do. Personally for me the easiest way to lose fat is low carb. These doesnt mean no carbs it means high quality low GI and crucially TARGETED meaning strictly postride. For km you really dont need to be eating excessively  a cup of brown rice sweet potato or something like that should be all you need to take post ride.,cycling,dg40ir7,1,t5_2qhyi

11581099,0,t1_dg80hyn,If you have a dent in the helmet you definitely should think about replacing it.  The protection could be compromised in ways that are difficult to see.  If its not too old of a helmet some companies will take your crashed helmet and give you a deal on a new one.  I did this once and got a new one for a big discount  the company wanted to study the helmet and analyze it for improvement.  Pretty cool really.Also keep in mind that helmets supposedly expire because foam degrades over time  just like with childrens car seats.  Some companies say only  years.  Im not sure how much to believe that because they want to sell you new helmets.  Other sources say  years.  As youll see from the linked discussion there isnt a straight answer and it isnt even certain that helmets do expire.  But if you look at the OP from that discussion youll see a link to another source that gives the  year figure.  So its not a sure thing that replacement is necessary just due to age.  But technology gets better foam definitely degrades at some rate pads definitely wear down.  So replacing a helmet every so often is good insurance for your head considering what you pay when spreading it across a couple years.  I replaced my last helmet after about  years.As for your question I have a Lazer helmet I bought a couple years ago for about .  It isnt the lightest or lowest profile but its worked well for me during many hours in the saddle.  I personally wouldnt go much cheaper than I spent just to make sure its somewhat decent.  But if it has one of the official safety ratings on it price shouldnt be an issue. It just may not be as comfortable cool light or cool looking though of course that doesnt matter!.,cycling,dg8q34t,2,t5_2qhyi

11638974,0,t1_dgf9nps,So when you shift chain rings you need to pedal forwards several times before it really shifts which is to say before the chain transfers from one chain ring to the other.If you look closely at the video you posted you can see the derailleur move when you change the shifter. When you pedal forwards after doing that the derailleur is supposed to knock the chain off one chain ring so it transfers to the other one.What youre seeing when you then pedal backwards is what I would expect to happen when you shift but the chain hasnt moved yetIf youre shifting while riding and you pedal forwards several times if it doesnt move to the other chain ring you might just need the derailleur to be adjusted. Im a complete shit mechanic so Id take it to a shop to have a tune up done and tell them the problem youre seeing.,cycling,dgfaheq,2,t5_2qhyi
11639054,0,t3_662ymt,One big thing Im not seeing in the comments here is crosschaining. Technically you have  gears to choose from  front x  back but you really shouldnt be using the small chainring with the highest few gears or the big chainring with the lowest few gears because the chain is getting pulled at an angle. Its hard to explain but basically it can cause wear on the chain and ultimately shorten its lifespan. This is especially true when youre using the small chainring and shifting up on your back gears because you can cause the chain to rub up against the big ring. Youll know when youre doing this because youll hear a sort of rubbing or thumping sound coming from your chain that might be the sound youre referring to.So which gears exactly should you use? It differs from bike to bike. On my bike a Giant Defy  Ill typically use gears  through  and  through . Really though I just listen to my bike and shift chainrings if I hear that grinding noise. One other thing to keep in mindthere is generally an equivalency between two separate gearings on your bike i.e.  might feel the same as  etc. When shifting your front gears it helps to first quickly shift your back gears up or down a couple times first so when you do shift your chainrings youre not making a huge leap and its easier to maintain your cadence pedaling rate. Hope this helps!Edit Someone did actually mention crosschaining but Im leaving my comment anyway because more advice couldnt hurt.,cycling,dgfat61,1,t5_2qhyi
11644534,0,t1_dgftc9s,MTB and SPD are the same thing in this context.  The Shimano road standard is SPDSL.  And yes SPD cleats are generally recessed in the shoe and SPDSLs protrude from the bottom.Spring Tension and Clipin Tension are almost certainly the same thing.Yes float is how much lateral motion your heel has before encountering resistance from the spring.  In my opinion you want a pedalcleat combination with some float for comfort.Aside from that the Double Track pedals are pinned which have great grip on rubber soled shoes maybe too great.  In my experience you have to basically lift your foot entirely off the pedal to reposition it and if its the type of pedal that wants to flip to the cleat side it becomes a pain in the ass.,cycling,dgfx6tk,2,t5_2qhyi

11742961,0,t3_67efj5,If youre fine with doing preplanned rides printed cue sheets are the traditional approach and they work fine you may want a handlebar map holder like this one theyre quite handy. You dont even have to handcreate them as sites like RideWithGPS will create them from the same routes that youd load directly on to a GPS unit. Where a Garmin will win out is if you want to roam around without planning things in advance but still see a good map of the area and maybe navigate places and if this is what you want Garmins are going to be better than the Wahoo Elemnt or Elemnt BOLT. I will second ukopsiss suggestion of actively working to develop a sense of direction for your area its very useful to have even with a GPS unit for various reasons including having an overview sense of what your planned route will be like.I have an Elemnt and vastly prefer it to the Garmin  I had first but Im going to assume that youve looked at the options there and decided that the Garmins are the way you want to go in GPS units.,cycling,dgr3eum,1,t5_2qhyi

You can also do gravel races without being on a team zero need to pay for a USAC licence to do gravel events.I raced for a long time on the road and CX for a couple different teams as a Cat and then M racer.  My busiest years had me doing between  races and I loved it.  Near the end I had a pretty bad accident training and took a needed step back from the echo chamber that is the local racing scene and never really went back.I still need some type of motivation to train or I just wont ride enough so I pencil in  gravel races every year.  If the weather is good Ill be there if not I dont lose any sleep over it.  I do miss stage races and to a lesser extent crits and ITTs but the scene I dont miss at all.
