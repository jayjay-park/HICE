4439703,0,t1_csq8yor,I dont quite understand your point but Im  and Ive been smoking since my teens. I know what schwagg is we occasionally got it here where I live Balkans but it was rare. It had the seeds which pop when smoked and the high was shit. Thankfully we I havent seen any of that shit in the last couple of years. But we have some fields near the city with weed. Dunno if it was for industrial purposes or just wild weed. Smoked enough to get a throat ache and no high.Schwagg  low quality weed not wild weed. ,NorthKoreaPics,csqb4zt,1,t5_34i6n

7637746,0,t1_d39qprj,I havent been to the DPRK but I was thinking of going a couple years ago. Instead I used the money Id set aside for going there to go see more of SK and Japan some of my cotravelers objected to going to the DPRK so I decided to postpone. I got interested in finding more pictures mostly because of my redditing activity  I founded this subreddit dedicated to North Korea as a continuation of the other subreddits dedicated to other nations that I also founded or helped build up like rUnitedStatesofAmerica or rJapanPics. Running these little subreddits has been a great way to find out about new places photographers and to share it all. ,NorthKoreaPics,d3adahp,1,t5_34i6n
