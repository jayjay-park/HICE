It would be great to have an Illinois school add a program and I think an Iowa school would make sense as well.

I have been buying a friends ticket that hes had for years.  I myself have been on the wait list for season tickets for  years now.  I get to see every game from a nice spot on the blue line!  They also instituted a fee this year to keep your seats in the same location.  Pay up or risk getting moved somewhere else.  I think it was a straight  no matter how many seats you purchase.I have to say our new AD is trying to make changes that arent sitting well with the fans in smalltown Oxford OH.  Theres a LOT of fans that have been attending for decades and come hell or high water have supported the team and been there at every game possible cheering them on.  a LOT of them are saying enough is enough and have dropped out after all this new BS with seat rental fees and keep your same seat fees.  These are the same fans that are there for every game no matter what whereas theres always a lot of empty seats from season ticket holders that only attend a couple games a year and dont even really follow whats going on in the conference let alone the big NCAA picture to know where we stand.Next season is going to have a major shake up in our fanbase and I dont think it will be for the better.,collegehockey,cha2gtq,2,t5_2srx4

5255520,0,t1_cvjgvhq,For me the most difficult part on my road to college hockey was moving away at age . I was young and was always very family oriented so when I got thrown in with a random family in a town  hours from home that was tough. It was the best thing that could have happened for my hockey career though. When I played my two years in AAA the team gives you the road to success. Everything we did was oriented towards becoming a Jr. player and from there I just had to put my work in and know that if I worked hard I had the chance to play Jr. From juniors its the same thing just try to get better every day  and work hard. For an aspiring college player I just say work as hard as you can every chance you have. If you put the work in every day and live your life off the ice the right way good things will happen.,collegehockey,cvjh869,8,t5_2srx4

Football and basketball cast a very large shadow.I think college hockeys cult following is largely due to the lack of televised games. Im not talking BG Network we need more NBC games ESPN games etc. Its almost a chicken and egg thing.

7704095,0,t3_4kru7d,gtBUBC as a comboLets take a second to set aside how amazingly unlikely this is and imagine what would go down if this happened.It would leave HEA scrambling to replace teams.  The Ivy League schools all seem happy in the ECAC together but lets keep going nuts  Yale Quinnipiac and Harvard to HEA to fill the conference back to its current size.  This again seems difficult.  But it would serve the purpose of replacing Hockey Easts premier rivalry with two more good ones in addition to setting up some ongoing stuff between Harvard and Northeastern.  It also solves QUs big problem with a Hockey East move in maintaining their local rivalry and starting up a potential new one with Connecticut.  It would cause college hockey people to continue insisting there will ever be a hockey rivalry between Boston College and Notre Dame.  This will continue to not actually happen.With NBCSN covering Big Ten games and BU and BC joining the Big Ten the Beanpot becomes a nationally televised event.  With the realignment Im describing this also makes it a Hockey East vs Big Ten thing.  A rivalry between the conferences is cultivated by college hockeys media until it actually happens.  BU and BC wouldnt enjoy this for very long.  At first itd be great becoming the premier hockey rivalry in the conference but their lack of rivals outside of themselves would be a problem.  Its hard to imagine Michigan and Minnesota fans forming a lasting rivalry with BU for example.  The inability to easily travel with the team would bother fans to no end.  Because both schools try to keep old rivalries alive in their nonconference schedules BC and BU end up with the toughest slates in the country year after year.  This either makes them even bigger than they already are or damages them tremendously.  Talk of a move back to HEA becomes stronger as other BG members potentially explore starting programs over time.Again Im really just having fun with this.  Never going to happen.  But a fun thought experiment.,collegehockey,d3hwkcp,1,t5_2srx4
