We have been going for years and it is an amazing environment. On one end of the beach they have the people who are there every weekend. This is the far side with the volleyball net and mostly everyone is nude on that side. The entrance has a lot more newbies and there is a mix between closed and nude people. There are some rules that are enforced by the community their which is kind of headed by a retired fireman guy that is extremely chill. He is always chugging a beer naked and introducing himself to everyone and asking people to join in on volleyball matches and stuff. Rules include no indecent stuff Masterbating sex overly gawking at people and most importantly no littering. The beach was almost closed due to littering last year and it is important to keep this at a minimum. If anyone ever wants to join us PM me or if you guys want more info. It is a great place to meet new people and I have a lot of friends that love the beach. It can be intimidating at first but after you get used to it it is a blast.

I can understand some of the confusion here considering that many students in the states dont take a full IB curriculum but instead take specific classes i.e dont have to face TOK or CAS. Anyway spoke to my counselor about the CSUMentor form which Im assuming youre having a problem with. What I did was First make sure that youre filling in the domestic application not the international. I know its weird but if youve tried the International they tell you to go domestic. Dont fill out anything related to the classes youve taken. Just confuses you more. I think youre having a problem with this more than anything. When asked for the GPA I had to take at least a couple days to figure it out. My counselor told me to just enter . and email the admissions office letting them know that you take the IB and that your school doesnt convert to GPA. Finally once youre done paying the  fee send the admissions office an email specific instructions are on the form if you cant find it just PM me. Hope I helped and good luck into getting in!

3376168,0,t1_cpd39hf,I  understand why the university wants to blame it on Greek life but that doesnt make it right just like it isnt right to convict an innocent man so the victims family can have some sense of justice. Sometimes shit happens and the most reasonable thing is to prevent it from occurring again by educating people about the dangers. If they want to track down every person on that roof and fine them then go right ahead but blaming Greek life is idiotic and is another instance of the disconnect between the administration and the student body. I can guarantee the student body would prefer they make real progress towards easing registration congestion instead of punishing those involved with st frattys day. Instead of actually helping students get a balanced good quality education theyre focused on maintaining the perceived value of a cal poly degree. Its sad to see under appreciated aspects of such a unique college environment deteriorating because the administration wants to turn Cal Poly into an architecture and engineering academy. ,CalPoly,cpd3wie,3,t5_2s470

6564057,0,t3_45ir4c,Congrats and welcome to the Mustang family! Ive lived in housing for multiple years in an RA and heres what Ive gotPersonally  I recommend Santa Lucia engineering red brick as the best choice. I lived there my freshman year and i loved it. Its a great blend of academic and social and you definitely get all of the opportunity you could ask for from a dorm. If you leave your door open and are open to making new friends youll have a good time. North mountain is a great place to live as well and theres much more room in the rooms as well as more freedom to relax in nature. But it does tend to be a little more socially closed off and takes a bit more effort to make friends if you live there. If you like to have more opportunity to be alone its a better place though i recommend that everybody open themselves up as much as possible in college! Theres also no common room NM residents use the Santa Lucia common room.The towers are VERY very social which is fun for most people. People in the towers tend to make a lot of friends. They also party a lot and they party hard if thats something you like. However as a result its harder for them to get academic work done.  The rooms here are the same size as red brick rooms. I dont recommend living in the apartments unless you really crave a more independent lifestyle. Its less social  less convenient to live there and generally people prefer any of the other dorms to the apartments. ,CalPoly,czya12g,2,t5_2s470

They arent happy with the academic program for their major they arent happy socially they fail out they cant afford to pay tuition they want to go someplace closerfarther from home whatever. I think Cal Polys rate of students transferring out is on the lower side compared to some schools but some people do transfer whether its to another four year university community college or they just leave.,CalPoly,d7839jy,17,t5_2s470

11453464,0,t1_dfu74oh,I did engineering first and decided I really like music. Compared to a lot of CLA programs the music program is pretty rigorous but is doable because I decided to do  years of half and half engineering and half music courses. Liberal arts students do not necessarily feel less important but they are put down sometimes. Like the other commenting our CLA programs are pretty incredible. For instance the psych program is on the down low but it is one of the best Learn by Doing programs we have its masters program is also one of the best. If I were you I would start with pursuing a minor in the desired liberal arts program if possible and choose to do more of it later.,CalPoly,dfu8ph6,0,t5_2s470

11679592,0,t3_66luw2,Assuming you got into CS at UCSB as well you are doing really well for yourself and there probably isnt a wrong choice.Schools are different though and what gets stressed in your education will be somewhat different. Cal Poly will offer certain opportunities that UCSB wont. UCSB will offer certain opportunities Cal Poly wont. At the end of the day you can achieve roughly the same things with your UCSB degree as you would with your Cal Poly degree.  The question of people not hearing about Cal Poly is rather moot in California and along the Pacific coast  you will find that Cal Polys reputation is right at the top of the pile next to Berkeley and Stanford in terms of BS in CS graduates and their quality.  This reputation is narrower than that of UCSB UCLA or Berkeley grads and boils down to if you want to hire someone who will be ready for the job on day one hire a Cal Poly grad which is a phrase I have heard spoken by employers A LOT.   If you are ok with being part of such a perception your decision to stick with Cal Poly will not be in error. At the same time if you are waffling about the major and may want to consider switching to Political Science Economics or Physics UCSB will probably be a more welcoming place.  The CS program at Cal Poly runs you through CSspecific coursework very fast with sixseven core courses in your first five quarters here. Any  changeofmajor decision either needs to be made quickly here or it will be costly. And it may become impossible after a while although there are plenty of students on campus who changed their major at least once.Essentially Cal Poly and the CSCPESE programs within it specifically is very well structured for those who understand what they want out of their education.  Not so much for those who want to spend a year or two choosing the major.So going back to your original question... You have the same opportunities to succeed and land the same type of a job in both places. The question here isnt really about what you will be able to achieve but about how you will be doing it. ,CalPoly,dgjwcq2,3,t5_2s470
