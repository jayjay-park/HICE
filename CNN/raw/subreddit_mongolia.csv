2059097,0,t3_2id5vq,Last week we had first snow in September. Fat heavy snow. Wheat still in the fields was lost.  This year we also had snow up until  of May. Potatofarmers wait until the last snow to plant. This year they were two weeks later than normal May . So now we have  less yield. Also because of wet September many potatoes bloated with too much water then froze and cracked after harvest.  Mongolian wheatfarmers get subsidised diesel workforce but still their wheat comes out more expensive than importing from Russia Belarus.The only thing that can grow here from itself is grass and weed.,mongolia,cl1k1bs,1,t5_2qll8

7799287,0,t1_d3qcqdt,Yeah its pretty silly. The system requires two pieces of information when inputting manually the two letternumbers code and the total amount. Or you can input the long unique identifier alone but that is a pain.HOWEVER with the QR code scanner the QR code only contains the letternumber thing so errors can easily happen if the scanner sucks. What would be better is to scan the code and it asks you for the amount after. ,mongolia,d3sp8e4,1,t5_2qll8

11013228,0,t1_decynlc,I really do think it is the lack of infrastructure. There really arent any high end hotels etc and until they exist tourism will be limited to adventure travel. And even still it will always be easiercheaper to fly somewhere like Japan or Korea  If there was a bit more infrastructure and government oomph then it could be a good niche market though.,mongolia,degbh50,1,t5_2qll8
