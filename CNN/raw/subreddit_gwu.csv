885896,0,t3_248con,I find it somewhat humorous that the one question I have actually seen be answered with helpful tip is a question about engineering answered by engineers. P.S. I am a GW SEAS student so I am pretty sure I can say that without being offensive. ,gwu,ch4z9vk,5,t5_2s5bd
1163801,0,t1_ci0j8dg,....and thats exactly the point.I simply offer my perspective on the experience I had with the schoolYour perspective and experience will obviously be different because youre an International Affairs major... and probably represent the majority of the snobby GW kids. That being said I believe the school has a lot shitty qualities that cant be changed by switching majors.If you have anything specific to argue about the bullet points then go right on ahead. Dont just say I had a great experience because all the people that seem to be having a good time are rich frat boys who have their futures set because of their parents.,gwu,ci0jp8d,-7,t5_2s5bd

2089144,0,t3_2it7y0,No it is not too late to rush! Go out to rush in the spring semester if you feel it is for you. Other than that immerse yourself in doing exactly why you came to GW. Go find those cool places to grab coffee on a Saturday afternoon. Hit up the library of congress and read there. Research a non profit related to something that you fucking love and call them up and see if they need an intern! Become a barista or a bartender up in dupont. Talk to random girls or guys who might be alone or afraid of talking to people with their iPhone shields in front of them. When you see flyers around the gym or on Phillips hall attend the event. Introduce yourself in a funny way when you go to meetings. Buy a bike. Bike the crescent trail up to Bethesda. Do the recommended readings in addition to the required. Make a movie. Learn the piano. Become interesting. When spring is here youll realize you never had to find friends but in doing all these things youll start naturally attracting them. Do it.,gwu,cl5dk3z,13,t5_2s5bd

11387805,0,t1_dfmqz1c,In a couple years you will likely have a better understanding of why people likely are not interested in having high schoolers crash their parties.Freshmen normally go a little big for the first bit of college and are a mess.  Having people even younger than that will be even more of a problem ignoring the legal liability issues that the host would be putting themselves under.GW is not a giant state school so the college movies of giant parties that spill out of frats are not here.  Parties like that no one is going to care about  children sneaking in.  That isnt what most parties at GW are going to look like.Its not about being hardened.  When I was a junior or senior there is no way in hell Id let  random high school strangers anywhere near my party.,gwu,dfmseji,5,t5_2s5bd
