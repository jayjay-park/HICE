541883,0,t3_20ay5p,When I crochet its usually really big projects like a blanket or a really small project like an amigurumi so I like to use Love this yarn or Knit picks brava both are incredibly soft.  If Im really crunched for cash Ill pick up Red Heart Love.  With knitting it really depends on the project.  I tend to use knit picks Galway and Cascade for big knitted items like a sweater and I use Malabrigo or Madeline tosh for smaller items.  The pride of my stash is a laceweight skein of Vicuna but I have yet think of any project thats suitable for its awesomeness.  Instead I just take it out every once in a while and pet it like you do...,bistitchual,cg1v9yt,3,t5_30vay

5861947,0,t3_3vio0r,I knit and crochet super tight but with knitting the variance doesnt seem as bad. With crocheting I have to go up multiple hook sizes. It kind of makes sense. With knitting the stitch is around the needle lessoning the variance but with crocheting a treble stitch can be way different depending on how loose you crochet. So I would say do a practice swatch but I never do. I just usually get to a part in a pattern and it says you should be about  inches and I have crocheted  inches. Then pull apart and grab a larger hook. I should make a practice swatch....,bistitchual,cxo14ur,3,t5_30vay
