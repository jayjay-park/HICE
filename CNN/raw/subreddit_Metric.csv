864416,0,t3_23ycdx,There is this false rumour going about that metrication failed in the s.Those of us old enough to remember the last time the government pushed ashift to the metric system would also remember not only how miserablyit failed but the ridicule that accompanied it.This is actuallyvery far from the truth. Before the s the entire American economywas based on USC. Nothing was metric. But since then a lot haschanged even if it is hidden from view. Alcohol medicines some sodapop sizes automobiles etc that were once all in USC are now inmetric.It is a fiction that the government wanted to metricatethe US. In truth it was big business. They knew that if the US didnot change their ability to do business with the world would suffer.The small ma and pa shops that deluded themselves into thinking theydont need to export to the world resisted.The result of thisfailed change over was that the multinational businesses uprootedthemselves from the US unemployed millions from high paying jobs andopened new modern shops in metric countries. They were then able toimport the metric products they wanted to make into the US. Inaddition growing countries like Mexico and China are now able to selltheir metric products in the US.Many a ma and pa shop thatdepended on the big companies to buy their services closed when the bigboys left. Those that remained had to adopt some form of metrication orgo out of business. Depending on who you ask   of Americancompanies operate in the metric system now. For a program that failedmetrication is far more along than before it was implemented.Thisis not a good thing though. The US economy as a result is divided downthe middle as one industry operating in metric cant or wont dobusiness with those industries operating in USC. A perfect example ofthis was a proposed joint venture between automobile and airplanemanufactures that never took root because neither wanted to give in ontheir choice of units.This is not good for the US economy andis part of the reason the US economy is weak. You cant have your housedivided against itself as it will surely fall especially when yourunified worldwide competitors are all using one system one standard.Soif metrication was ridiculed it is metrication that is having the lastlaugh as the present status quo is destroying the US economy and theAmerican people are suffering with increased poverty.

969321,0,t1_chedlhz,As I have mentioned before the s metrication effort was not the failure opponents and those ignorant of the situation insist upon.  Before metrication in the s the US was virtually   USC.  Film cigarettes etc were a few examples of metric usage before that time but it may have been that in the factory they were produced using USC.  The s metrication effort pushed the usage of metric from almost zero to about  .  We really dont know where exactly the percentage is and to the best of my knowledge there are no industrial surveys to determine a precise count.  Even if there was a survey how many industries would be honest or worse yet how many responding on behalf of the company would know or even report their company is metric to some degree?Being split down the middle is an economic nightmare.  The costs have to be much higher due to conversions errors out of tolerance parts refusal of one company to do business with another due to measurement incompatibility etc.  A good reason to have your entire operations based in a metric country with a harmonised system and easy availability of any metric product or service needed. ,Metric,chegzfq,0,t5_2r25p
1224482,0,t3_27v9vj,Consider thisBefore metrication in the s USC use was   universal in the US.  Despite the belief that metrication failed it managed to be raised to about   usage in American industry what remains of it.How many people who are out of work or are graduating from college or a technical school dont have SI experience and would either be disqualified in working in any of the SI industries or if they got hired would be constantly struggling?  Does everyone want to work in low pay service jobs?Maybe everyone now is taught the fundamentals of SI in school but how quick is that forgotten or how often does the person have to constantly convert SI to USC?  This is time consuming and error prone not to mention a cost to productivity.Working in SI on the job is cumbersome and difficult if one is not familiar with SI outside the job.   Even if some claim otherwise trying to think in litres or cubic metres on the job is difficult if one thinks in gallons or cubic feet at home.  The same for every other unit.  Using SI in the home environment reinforces a working knowledge of SI in the work environment and viceverse.  Americans are not good when it comes to being bilingual in language and they arent any better at being bilingual in measurements.I believe that SI if taught in the schools is taught as something that must be converted to USC.  Actual working in SI is avoided so it is no wonder SI is forgotten once school is over.  In the work environment the education would kick in and all encounters with SI would mean that the SI needs to be converted to USC and rounded to sensible USC.  A system designed not to make SI work. So you do need to establish references to SI in the home environment if you are going to be able to function in SI in all environments.,Metric,ci7df6u,1,t5_2r25p

None of what you say is verifiable as fact and is a total lie fabricated by metric haters. gt gt gt Then there are myriad other examples the litre the German metre standard which was actually slightly too long the initial error in the calculation in the distance from Paris to the North Pole which doesnt seem to matter to a group that redefines the knot in integral metres and your latest blunder the incredible shrinking kilogramme.There has always been and always will be one metre and since  this has been codified by treaty.The socalled initial calculation for the metre was never a definition.  The only definition of the metre was the rod made from the calculations and that metre has NEVER varied.  In that period feet and inches varied at least twice times Mendenhall Order in  and change in .     The kilogram is an artifact that will change and that can not be helped.  That is why the BIPM is working to define the kilogram with invariable constants in nature.  The pound as an artifact varies the same way if an artifact still exists.The facts that you and the American Curmudgeon with Warts Association seems to conveniently ignore is that the pound and foot standards did vary by such a noticeable amount that they had to be abandoned for the kilogram and the metre.

2327056,0,t1_clzbnlo,I think the players would notice the difference between  yd and  m as many first downs are hard fought.  The  m field and  m first down chain would have minimal impact on strategy of game.  So the problem has solutions I think it would just get everyones hackles up and make them oppose metrication.  I would give it a VERY low priority and wait until people begin to say everything else is metric why isnt this.I agree on other sports and most already have international metric versions.Note With  m field I would use numbered lines every  m solid lines at  m and hashes every meter.  First downs are formally decided by the first down chain and chainsmen not the field grid so no math just make it  m.  For any drive of less than  m call the chainsmen.The problem obviously has solutions but unless NFL and AFL agree nothing will happen.

Think apothecary is the same as troy with a smaller pound no longer used at all going back to the time of horsedrawn carriages and bloodletting.Their proposed solution metric weight seems to go off the assumption that hospitals are in some sort of vacuum not in the US which using avoirdupois weight.  So ignoring what exists outside the bubble isnt really a solution to me its political solutions in quotes. . .I think your passiveaggressive mischaracterizing what I said  which was actually that pounds are whats used out in the world that US hospitals are located in like it or not  is the same sort of problem and thinking that the groups you describe have.  Until they get the US to convert to the metric system their proposed solution is the same sort of poorly thoughtthrough solutions that politicians propose.  They never actually happen that way because they ignore or dont coincide with reality.Kids are weighed in pounds just as much as adults moot point.Medical professionals dont have to memorize two values as the computers convert automatically.  In fact last time I was in a doctors office Ive memorized my metric statistics Ive seen them in paperwork so often they COULDNT USE THE METRIC VALUES as the software would only take pounds feet and inches.I dont particularly care how your strong obvious biases and emotions play into it  At least as far as that particular chain of hospitals is concerned the input is customary and the output is metric.No one learns conversions as dual values and the software converts to metric.Thats FACT.  Thats REALITY.  Same reality as probably  or  of people knowing customary and only customary vitals.Ignoring that invites disaster and a whole new category of errors that just looking at the numbers and the reality is a lot bigger.Well now youre advocating because  there MIGHT be errors REQUIRING an extra step that they may or may not have time for in emergencies so Im gonna have to call bullshit on that as objective advice.You seem to care more about your favorite system being used than weighing the possibility of error against time saved.  Youve called into question my qualification over medical professionals.  What are your qualifications in medicine here that youre going to make a judgement call in a timecritical situation huh?You can argue all you want about DMVs.  Meantime theyre all pounds feet inches only.  Thats the reality for  of American IDs and I hear Canadian licenses are the same?  So youre either ignoring or unwilling to deal with the current situation instead talking about what COULD be.  That acutally makes no difference in an emergency room or hospital today.I have to call into question your objectivity in evaluating this fairly rationally when it comes to SAVING LIVES.  Youre operating from pushing the metric system on everyone so thats not compatible with the hypocratic oath and the United States today for one.Youre not being logical and unemotional.  Youre putting your emotional personal preferences above the logical thing to deal with the reality of American measurement today.  This isnt Star Trek in the th Century its  United States culture.Well it makes sense that passports should HAVE TO have metric because most other countries use metric.  But again what does that have to do with Americans in American hospitals?Also they dont even get only country right because its obviously not just the US that uses pounds if Canada and the UK write articles and recommendations about it.  Come on.  I dont trust articles that either deliberately or thru ignorance twist the actual usage.  Maybe you should watch some Stanley Cup playoffs.  Those Canadian announcers even in games between Canadian teams sure use a lot of feet inches pounds in broadcasts coming from TSN Canadas ESPN network.What the law specifies or should enforce matters not as were talking about hospitals and patient vitals.If anything hospitals have their own rules that trump the law because the law generally requires both at all times unless specifically excepted doesnt it?Addendum umetricadvocate Medication errors related to metricimperial conversions is in the article not your Kilogrampounds conversion still a risk in US hospitals so I can only interpret that as you deliberately TWISTING the headline.As to why incorrectly measuring in kilos is actually CORRECT  The software takes pounds and turns it into kilos.  Typing in kilos would in effect be a DOUBLE conversion.So IDK if you WANT it to be that way misread it yourself or hope none of us will read all that unrelated stuff but this is a misleading headline and what youve reported doesnt match at all with what theyve said.

11050289,0,t1_deki104,The opinions presented are not mine they are the opinions of an American university professor with a Masters degree in Science Education and a Ph.D. in Entemology who experiences these problems continually in his work.The difficulties of science and engineering courses are due to the subject matter. Using a difficult and inconsistent measuring system would not make them easier. The metric system has a set of units which logically relate to each other and make it straightforward to calculate abstract quantities and to relate them to other measures.American students are unfamiliar with the metric system. They do not use it in everyday life as their foreign counterparts do and the US media tries to remove any mention of it from American news and culture. You have commented on the article about George Orwells American publishers and the metric system. This shows that this problem has existed for nearly seventy years.I am in Australia where we completed our metrication process thirty years ago. Australians are a practical people and noone here is pining for the good old days when you could buy a pint of beer and a couple of pounds of steak and still have change from ten shillings. We also have a lot of immigrants who are familiar with metric units and do not now need to learn Imperial units.I grew up in England in the s and s and remember having difficulty learning what I saw as a set of illogical and inconsistent measuring units and a currency that was similarly complex . The difficulty of learning these measures was eclipsed by the complications of calculating maths problems in them. An American teacher and metric advocate has stated to a Congressional enquiry that the US maths curriculum would gain the equivalent of a whole extra year if they stopped teaching the US measures and used the metric system exclusively.,Metric,dekj4on,2,t5_2r25p
