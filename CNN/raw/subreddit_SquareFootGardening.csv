From a wood working view if you dont stain the inside and stain the outside eventually it will rot from the inside out because moisture will build up between the plastic and the wood. If you decide to not stain the inside if your liner hangs over the top even a few inches the id stain it to what ever color is pleasing to the eye and then polyurethane it then it should last for years.  You could use danish oil. Witch is similar to tong or linseed oil but dries quicker and food safe once completely dry,SquareFootGardening,dgb46jr,1,t5_2rlah
