7781008,0,t1_d3qd6xq,The cursed lover one wasnt great but it did do a good job of going into why Alba was so concerned about Xo and Janes virginities.  She had gone through scrutiny for losing hers before marriage and didnt want that for her childgrand child.  Then when Xo gets pregnant at an early age she is just trying to protect her and Jane.  It is a flawed way of thinking threatening that she will be ruined if she doesnt stick to it but its what shes working with.  Alba is more than just the strict grandma and thats why this show is awesome. ,JaneTheVirginCW,d3qmwn1,6,t5_34k1r

9846959,0,t1_dar0tuf,If this were a fullblown ongoingforcenturies telenovela Michael would die Jane would grief and then start dating Rafael again then after a few years suddenly its revealed that Michael didnt die so they got their love triangle back. Then Jane falls back in love with Michael Mateo is now old enough to try to manipulate situations to bring Jane and Michael back together they get back together then another crimelord shows up and kills Michael for real OR DIDNT HE? Find out after two completely unrelated arcs! and Jane and Rafael get back together. But alas this is a semipseudotelenovela so I feel like Michael will have to die and it makes me sad ,JaneTheVirginCW,dar2y42,9,t5_34k1r
9963365,0,t3_5i7ens,Im enjoying this season a lot.  The love triangle drove season  and wasnt totally settled until the end of season  even though Jane and Michael were back together midway through season .  So now that the triangle is no longer the story the direction of this journey really had to change in season .  Also now that Jane has moved out of the house the Villanueva household is not the center of the story anymore.  So there are a lot of changes but Im okay with that because its all part of their journey.The first part of season  still had major issues to resolve though Michaels survival his recovery Jane and Michael having sex Petras awakening Michael and Rafael bonding Xo and Ro moving on from each other.  It felt to me like the first part of the season was wrapping up all the loose ends of the Season  finale.  But it was also short with only seven of season threes twenty episodes.  So I expect the second half of season  to launch into some pretty intense drama...  This isnt a prediction thread so the only thing Im going to say is that I believe Petra will be back with a vengeance in the second half. ,JaneTheVirginCW,db693o5,10,t5_34k1r

Dude she lied to you throughout your entire marriage cheated on you with your best friend tried to trap you with your sperm succeeded in using it once you were divorced tried to take your child tried to sabotage your relationship with Jane covered for her mother after her attempted murder of your girlfriends grandma manipulated you out of your hotel shares and I cant even remember what else!
