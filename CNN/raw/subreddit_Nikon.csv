2870680,0,t3_2sylo2,Take a look at your files that you use the mm on. See what focal lengths you use the most of those. Are you often more at mm or more at mm. When using it do you more often wish it was wider or longer?There are a couple options to replace the Tamron and the Nikon mm. Sigma mm f.. This lens gives you primelike wide aperture and offers a bit of zoom. It doesnt go to  or mm but you do have the mm f. and mm and mm if you need that.  Tamron mm f. VC. This should be a tad sharper than your mm and it also has VC aka VR aka Image Stabilization.  Sigma mm f..  and it supposed to be a very nice lens Nikon mm f.. If you really like the range of the Tamron mm and just want something sharper the Nikon is an option but its really pricey. Some people will justify it saying then youre ready if you upgrade to fullframe but if youre not planning on upgrading by the end of the year who knows how long it will take and by then there might be a better newer version or the cost on this may have gone down. Or maybe youll decide you want to switch brands I know sacrilege but take a look at what Sonys doing with their A line... who knows maybe something like that will be more appealing ifwhen you decide to go full frame Im not saying dont get it. If it is the only lens that fits your needs go for it but try to ignore the sunkcost mentality of getting a lens that is fullframe incase you might go full frame some day in the future all your DX lenses will still be worth something and youll be able to sell them if an when you do go full frame.Definitely sell the mm if you dont use it. Evaluate how much you use the  and the mm do you use one more. Could you live with just one? If you only occasionally use the mm you could sell that and if you feel you need to have  or mm capability just incase you can get either a .x or x teleconverter to use with the mm which would make it a mm f or mm f. respectively. The downside is you loose aperture it can make the image a touch softer and it can slow down autofocus. But the mm basically has all of those problems compared to the mm so the biggest issue is youd need to remove the lens to addremove the teleconverter when you need to change lengths. Of course if you realize you really dont need that range much at all you can just shoot with the mm and crop a little when you need nice thing about having that MP D.,Nikon,cnueb1q,2,t5_2qr6k

When I got my first DSLR D amp  which is the old version of what youre getting I though Id really need a bag  but I didnt. I didnt get another lens for the camera for quite a long time because the  is a great allpurpose lens for learning. When I was taking pictures I ended up carrying a camera bag that only had an extra SD card and a microfiber cloth in it. I soon found myself leaving the bag at home. That little camera has literally travelled around the world  and when it wasnt taking pictures it was just wrapped in some clothes and put in a pack.

4725421,0,t1_ctpwrtj,I didnt feel like mentioning the Zeiss Otus lenses because it would require explanation... For some people they are great for others they are not and youd have to decide for yourself.Depends on your definition of state of the art. In terms of optical design they are very good and one of the best designs out there... so yes that is state of the art.However ultra sonic autofocus are another kind of state of the art which the zeiss lenses do lack. Some people do not need autofocus. Some people do concert photographers tend to prefer autofocus but not all and Ive shot concerts with a Lecia range finder which is manual focus but a range finder is kind of cheating.Finally the advantages of the Otus lenses might be a big deal of some photographers and applications or others it might be too subtle a difference to make the price worth it. The Sigma mm f. Art and Nikon mm f. are other options that one might consider.

AFD version is also great but you will have to focus manually. Tokina mm . D Does not have in lens motor. Will not autofocus. Priced at  new and is optically very close to the Nikon assuming you can live without VR and autofocusing. Serious macro work will usually not need autofocus. Does flair a bit more in sunlight when Ive done portraits. Dont think ED elements is as good as the Nikons. Tamron mm . VC Better price than Nikon but still more expensive than the Tokina. I own this pre VC version. They changed the internal glass so I cant say much regarding optical quality. It will autofocus on your body. All of these can be bought from Amazon Adorama at a reasonable price. I recommend checking your local craigslist as well. You can find some lens for extremely reasonable prices and in great shape. I found a gentle man who sold me the Tamron for . If you buy used check for dust haze and fungus. Check with a flashlight when inspecting the lens. There will most likely be dust in there regardless so dont be scared if you find some. Make sure it auto focuses if you get the Nikon AFS. All the lenses I named are extremely well built and have partial to full metal construction. Check front and rear elements for scratches as well. Edit I wouldnt bother with the mm or mm macros. They wouldnt give reasonable working space. Theyre still fantastic lenses and are extremely sharp. Bought a mm AIS . macro to replace my mm .. It is much sharper than the . at f..

The  is a fine zoom for macro I would consider the Nikon mm . over the  or . Neither of those will give you macro. Though they are both very cheap. The mm will run you just under  but is an actual macro lens. The other issue is if youre truly thinking about the future then everything you have  want to purchase is almost useless in the FF world.

5261488,0,t3_3lv08q,Depends on your budget and needs heres a few options mm f.D... about  new a little less used. Its small light and very good in low light but no zoom. Roughly the same field of view as setting your zoom to mm on your D and thats it no zooming in or out from there. mm f... Can be had pretty cheap used Around  gives you a reasonable amount of zoom. You dont have VR on this but you can probably set your ISO a stop or so higher on the D and compensate for it. The lens also can focus pretty close if you want to do pseudo macro work. This isnt a long term lens but its good to get you by if your budget is tight. Nikon mm VR. If you can find a deal on one used its over priced outside of a kit it works well and would be comparable to your mm. Tamron and Sigma make similarish lenses too. A mm f VR which gives you a little more zoom range and a consistent f max aperture. Again... this lens is over priced when sold new outside of the kit but you can find some used deals from people who bought the lens as a kit with a camera. Or you can blow it out with a mm f. type lens which is going to cost quite a bit even for a Tamron version... but will give you little zoom comparable to your mm but with better low light performance.,Nikon,cvk7ovx,1,t5_2qr6k

I pulled the trigger and since have acquired the Nikon Trinity and couldnt be happier. As far as lenses go it depends on your budget really. I was fairly happy with the kit  lens that came with my D until I got ahold of the  .. Holy crap is that a great lens. If you are shooting landscapes the mm .G is a great landscape or walking around lens. Its fast sharp and not too expensive.

Not so on the D. ISO  files from the D are silky smooth no noise at all. Now shoot a photo at ISO  with the D. Do the same with the D. Now compare them side by side at  pixel resolution.

Perhaps using a mm Macro lens would be a better choice for larger fishlife as it would allow you to still move in fairly closely focuswise but give your picture a little more context by including a bit more of an environment in your frame.

7858085,0,t1_d3z8fuv,Youre talking about a confirmation dot. Im not sure if its like in my Nikon F but the confirmation dot is basically a function of the autofocus system. There are  elements that must all be synched to work properly image plane on the ccd ltgt autofocus system ltgt viewfinder. There are two mirrors in the mirror box one is the main reflex mirror for the viewfinder and the second is the submirror for the focusing system. If the focus is tracking properly between the autofocus system focus confirmation dot and the image plane and the image is only out of focus in the viewfinder then the problem is with the viewfinder. The finder has several points of failure. The focusing screen can be improperly seated the mirror can be incorrectly positioned. Check first to see if the focusing screen is seated properly. If you know that the focusing screen is seated properly under the pentaprism then the only remaining point of misalignment is the main reflex mirror.The most important thing is focus agreement between the viewfinder and the image plane i.e. if its sharp in the viewfinder its sharp in the picture. The focus confirmation dot should of course track with focus in the viewfinder and image plane but thats what the autofocus fine tuning adjustment is for.Ive never directly worked on a D before so take what I say as general camera knowledge.,Nikon,d3zbiim,1,t5_2qr6k

7883314,0,t3_4n2ulk,Glad youre thinking about getting a real camera. When it comes about your first DSLR it helps to bear two things in mind There arent any bad DSLRs anymore. And lenses are more important than bodies.With that in mind Id suggest you go to you local store and look at the entry level bodies from both manufacturers and try them out. Look how they fit into your hands take a good look at the menus and buttons. The best camera is useless if it feels weird to handle. Also You mentioned youve used cameras in school before. If they were Nikons or Canons Id suggest sticking to that manufacturer because youre already used to using one. Do you have friends who already own DSLRs? Then you might consider buying into the same system. Makes it easier to swap lenses flashes or other equipment between buddies. Canon or Nikon doesnt really make a difference these days. Even the cheapest entry level DSLR from any company is capable of capturing stunning images. ,Nikon,d425og6,1,t5_2qr6k

9725411,0,t3_5e5u4u,Ive never used the Peak Slide but Ive used the Black Rapid single a knockoff version of the Black Rapid double and I own the Peak Capture original.The peak capture was the first of the bunch that I owned. I thought man is this cool just attach it to something and snap your camera on and arca swiss compatible  I knew that was a standard. Problem is I use Manfrotto RC plates for my ball head and another tripod head that I own.I later got the black rapid single and really liked the thing.The problem with both of these is that I usually have two cameras and like having another lens attached to my second body for speed. I never really did look into using the Capture along with the BR but I did find a knock off of the double strap version of the Black Rapid on eBay and while it doesnt seem as durable its softer and more comfortable and it lets me use two cameras.Yes its annoying trying to sit down in the thing but if youre careful nothing terrible happens.All of these glowing reviews of the Peak strap made me look into it but I really want to be able to use two cameras.The drawback of the double strap is that the plates they use spin around too easily and the BR mount thing for the bottom of the camera doesnt have a  thread to add some something else to.EDIT My main camera has always been gripped and before my D is was a Canon D so the grip was nonremovable. I always felt that the Capture wasnt ideal for a large camera like that.,Nikon,dabvc41,1,t5_2qr6k

9769516,0,t1_dagjhbj,When on a APSCDXcropped sensor camera the  any  would look close to what about mm would look like on a full frame and likewise a mm lens would look like a mm on that same camera.  So yes in a way putting a  on a cropped sensor would look very similar to how a  would look on a full frame in terms of the framing or zoom.Some people thinkassume that a lens from Nikon marked as DX is therefore already accounting for that crop but thats not true.  Regardless of body a Nikon DSLR lens mounts the same distance from the sensor its just that full frameFX bodies have a wider and taller frame there by showing more of the light projected by the lens.  On the same body any  will look wider than any .So anyways if you stick with a cropped sensor camera this doesnt matter much since youll get used to seeing certain lenses as being what theyve always looked like to you.  Plus Nikon DX lenses can mount to FX bodies they just have very dark corners since the light doesnt reach them very well.I hope that makes sense! ,Nikon,dahb54s,1,t5_2qr6k

But I am not a photojournalist like you just a hobbyist.I sold my D and  . and bought a D the price was about a wash. I like the images on the D but did not like the layout. In fact I fn hated it so I never used it. Always grabbed the D.Essentially Im down a lens. A very good one but when you dont like the body to which its attached it goes unused. I was thinking of regetting a D and stopping my GAS but logic and reason has never been my strong point!Also I got an Epson V and the wet scanning tray  about as good as it gets in a home scanner. I was going to get heavy into film but I sold it. Not because I needed the money but because i wanted to stop my film indulgences. I knew I was headed for an F and all that. So I decided that I will shoot some film and just pay to have it developed and scanned. I too have several aiais lenses as well as the new Irix mm. I have no problem using them on the D and D. I do miss focus sometime and they are not for action just walkabout. They work great. In fact my only autofocus lenses are a  a. and a . So I made the decision to go FF and am not looking back. I reason that the cameras will not loose much in depreciation  I can shoot them for a year and sell them for close to what I paid for them.
