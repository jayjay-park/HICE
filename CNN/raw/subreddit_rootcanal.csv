7038642,0,t1_d0uaosr,Between now and my last post I went to an event where a lecture was on revitalization. Right now it seems that revitalization is still in the baby stages. There havent been enough cases to go forward with clinical trials. Evidence tells us that primary and secondary root canal treatment is effective. Revitalization is used in specific failure cases when they have access to specific practitioners who actually know how to perform revitalization. Its unlikely that you or a dentist would want to perform a revitalization therapy on you if your teeth are doing fine and you have no pain or evidence of pathology. ,rootcanal,d1e6q0o,1,t5_39htu
