They normally feed patients but we sometimes have multiple feeders and not enough CNAs. They also normally schedule tube feedings the same time as regular meals and some patients dont like the pump so we have to do it by gravity but our facility does not provide bags for gravity.

I arrive get report from the day nurse set up supplies needed through the night assess my patient do the typical night duties that anyone would need done and the patient goes to sleep. Through the night the patient is turned every  hours cathed every  hours ventilator monitored consistently documented every  hours vitals assessed through the night. Medications are administered as ordered feedings administered as ordered.. I work  hours a week most of the time. Occasionally I can pick up extra hours when needed.. I am in my early s and I started off as a newgrad at hour. Yes. I feel like Im well off considering my age.. My path to becoming a nurse started early in life. When I was in middle school I was required to complete volunteer hours for school. I chose to volunteer at different local hospitals one of which was where my best friends mom worked as a labor and delivery nurse. Ever since then I knew this was what I was going to do in life. Nursing school was difficult for me but I completed it without any major problems.. I am eligible to receive medical benefits also including dental and vision I believe. Being as though I live in America and Im under  I am still able to be on my parents insurance. I dont receive any paid time off holiday pay. Im also not able to receive a pay increase until after working at this company for more than one year.. During my shift I work alone. The only time I see another nurse is during shift change.. I love being a nurse. This is what I honestly believe I was born to do. I love my specialty pediactrics. I love my patients.

It does not require oddly interjecting my own thoughts but if you think that empathy comes only in the form of listening and offering nothing of self opinion then I would venture to say you are quite incorrect. Treating people as human is very important. An aspect of of this would be to have a typical polite conversation not one where you nod hold their hand and refocus their thoughts like that load of manure we were taught in nursing school.  These rules that you spout are for people like you that cannot be compassionate and courteous and pleasant and wise and knowledgeable and professional and flexible and listen just a little more than they talk without a set of rules to guide them.With my child we have certain rules because her skill at her age is not on par with an adults in terms of her ability to reason and critically think. So things like taking your shoes off IF they are dirty become ALWAYS take your shoes off BECAUSE you do not understand how dirty is too dirty. Your rules of therapeutic conversation quite remind me of this. I never said long silences were wrong nor that introspection is wrong not knowing what to say is perfectly fine as well. You seem to seek to edify me in something you have no business doing so. You speak in rhetoric. I hope it works for you but I am able to be human and appropriate and a portion of that is exposing your own thoughts in response to your patients. Set down the nursing textbook let the mantras you must repeat midconversation go and actually HAVE a conversation with these people. Therapeutic conversations are about hearing what they are really saying and I simply dont agree with that academia nonsense you are espousing,nursing,cg54vnw,-19,t5_2ra72

I work on a surgicaloncology floor so some people get some heavy duty pain meds including combinations of oxy SR IV dilaudidmorphine oxycodone ativan seroquel ambien etc. If I know the patient and know their tolerance I have no problem giving them their dilaudid and ativan together. I normally try to stagger them so they have something to take every couple hours then they arent stuck hanging if they are in pain  hours later and have to wait  more hours until something is due. If their bp or RR is low or they are drowsy to the point of nodding off mid sentence I will usually hold off much to their dismay a lot of CYOA charting on my part as well or give them the med most likely to put a dent in their pain and least likely to drop their bpRRLOC drastically ie offer tramadol toradol or motrin instead of the morphine.

Heavy emphasis on teamwork! It is so much easier to run an ER with coworkers who help each other out. Get shit done. If you dont know how do it find someone who does and learn how. In an ER many things happen to patients in a very short time. Try to be mindful of their authority though. I always give patients the right to refuse care even with IV insertion. Ill say The physician would like me to give you medicine through and IV. Is it ok if I start and IV on you? Do this especially with any invasive procedure.Protect yourself. The people you will see will be complete strangers. You will be surprised at how many people have scabies and bed bugs.  Customer service is a huge thing with healthcare these days and in the ER you will see more patients than any of the other nurses in the hospital. To keep them from getting frustrated tell them the plan of care and update them as their visit progresses. Tell them what you are waiting on and an approximation of how much longer it will be. If they dont know whats happening behind the scenes they just feel like theyre being ignored and theyre stuck waiting around.I went from critical care to ER about  months ago and I love it.

While I will admit there were days were running mph I was only able to give adequate care and not the great care I strive for the problem isnt with the hospital  its with the system. Why are we trying squeeze hospitals many of which are loosing large sums of money. We need to reclaim emergencies rooms for emergencies not convenience.  month abdominal pain can go to the PCP from triage not occupy a room for  hours the drunk the police found need to go to the drunk tank not the ED and for my rEMS friends if it is a BS call instead of having to transport them they should be able to call the police and that person should be fined . It shouldnt be difficult charge everyone a minimum  per ED visit if youre on welfare your PCP is free but the ED costs if youre not emergent you dont get to be seen let alone testing frequent flyers need to be managed outpatient more closely probably by a certain specialty group no work notes free parking or can vouchers and certainly no mg of morphine as a reward for a brave adult who got an IV like we give kids toys when they were brave for theirs. ,nursing,ch9or8x,9,t5_2ra72

Most people I know have at least  years. Cath lab is not considered a critical care area. I actually recently met a nurse who started in cath lab as a new grad and she said she hasnt had any luck transitioning to the bedside. She wanted to move into an ICU but she lacked a lot of the bedside skills that you would learn by being a bedside nurse. Like the above poster mentioned most people in the cath lab or any procedural area are former ICU nurses who wanted to get away from the bedside  wanted a change. Its usually not a new grad position. It seems like a great opportunity and if jobs are hard to come by where you live I would definitely accept it but just keep in mind that it wont necessarily help you in your quest to become a critical care nurse or CRNA.Procedural areas are VERY different from bedside nursing acute care and critical care nursing and require different skill sets. ,nursing,cii7o64,2,t5_2ra72

1405916,0,t3_2a7vvx,Wow! Thats very interesting how you are considering two very different areas to potentially work in! You still have plenty of time to figure out if you want to work with patients who have acute medical problems or clients with psychological illnesses which also can be acute. I do feel these two areas are some what polar opposites although most patients have both medical and psych components of their history. I work in ICU which is extremely stressful hectic and fast paced where we primarily treat clients with cardiac or respiratory issues though we do get the occasional patient with severe psych problems who must be medically cleared or stabilized before they are transferred to a different unit that will focus on their mental health. I have always been drawn to areas of nursing that dealt with the patients that were acutely ill or that suffered from conditions such as congestive heart failure respiratory failure sepsis or acute MI opposed to schizophrenia or bipolar disorders because the pathophysiology of these illnesses made sense to me where as mental conditions were a little trickier for me to figure out. During my psych rotation in nursing school I knew right away that this area was not for me as soon as I heard people screaming or throwing objects and just because of how uncomfortable I felt around many of the patients due to their unpredictability. I also love doing procedures such as starting IVs inserting indwelling catheters or assisting the doctors with procedures such as inserting central lines or intubating which I dont think would happen very frequently in a psych unit. Although psych is not for me I can definitely appreciate nurses in this area because people with these conditions equally need treatment as other individuals with medical problems therefore both choices are good. Good luck and remember you can always switch to a different unit. Thats the beauty of nursing!!,nursing,cisifeg,3,t5_2ra72

1512763,0,t1_cj5j67z,I wasnt even going to justify the comment with a response but to add to what youve said.Yes its had a huge impact in the insurance industry but the hospitals are still billing and getting paid in roughly the same way.  The collection rate may be lower but more patients will have coverage and more sick people will maintain their coverage so hospitals are one area that should benefit from ACA overall.  Additionally many hospitals offer their own insurance plans and usually have fairly good benefits so they were already ACA compliant and if using their own inhouse plans premiums arent as much of an issue.  Finally the hiring downturn occurred around the mid recession which was before Obama even was elected and ACA even born.

There are no second chances given for CRNAs in my state and if I were to go back too early I dont want to imagine what could happen. I struggle with the prospect of going back even though being a CRNA is what I love.

Thats something I will have to continually work on. I know many who have gone back successfully with continued monitoring and naltrexone an opioid receptor antagonist as backup. I know others whove relapsed and lost everything all over again never to return to practice. Anesthesia practice is an environment of temptation for addicts because of the ready access.

1979290,0,t3_2hd57l,It depends on your experience and there are many different factors to consider. I honestly would begin researching four or five different schools and their requirements. Then try to get  that you can complete the prereqs for. Most schools including ADNs are doing away with waiting lists and instead are going for the top X amount of applicants per semester meaning if you dont have enough points to be in the top you wont start the next semester. At my ADN school the new criteria gave people points based on their GPA anatomy grade only A or B received points anatomy II grade microbiology comp I comp II lifespans grades TEAS test scores in reading and math ACT score and I think one or two other things that I cant recall. If you ranked within the first  people you could start. This way you can apply to several schools an have a potential to be accepted. I know people who placed their bets in one school only to be declined and had to apply at a nd or rd school. All are good students. Nursing schools receive a lot of applicants. BSNs are preferred by more hospitals however if you go the ADN route the school has probably partnered with another university to allow you to be able to apply for a RN to BSN program. I have an ADN and graduated Dec. . I started this March for my RN to BSN and I applied for graduation this December. I also work fulltime in an ER. Experience is super important too. Try to get a position as a nursing assistant in a hospital and do well too. Even if it is one shift a week. Also your preceptorship is important too. Oh also keep in mind financial aid. The financial aid laws are tricky and so you need to research them carefully. There are length of time number of credits and whether you have graduated built into the new standards. They are called satisfactory academy progress. Read online horror stories of people who took too long to graduated or were unable to get financial aid for another degree. Each school is different so I would start looking now and seei f you can talk to a financial aid counselor about how you will be impacted. ,nursing,ckrpeih,2,t5_2ra72

2030580,0,t3_2i1eaf,We usually treat c.diff with IV flagyl at my hospital. And then patients are switched to oral vanco if they still need treatment.  Generally the best course of treatment is to not give abx and allow the GI tract to recolonize with healthy flora but this is not always possible in unhealthy hospitalized patients.Oral vanco wouldnt be a first line treatment in a hospitalized patient. It would be flagyl metronizadole andor fidamoxin which is a newer drug that I havent seen used yet in my area  just heard of it so far. The reason that oral vancomycin works and IV vanco does not is because oral vancomycin is concentrated in the stool which works to have a bacteriocidal effect on the clostridium spores that are basically camping out there.

But its also showed me how hard of a job it is and I can see how a lot of people romanticize nursing. I went to the CNA route because I dont have much of a choice. No money for school shitty grades on highschool. Im working and saving up for a year then trying to get my BSN. CNA exp is great to have but godddamn it is a hard thankless job a lot of the time. Were constantly understaffed at my facility. They pressure us into working doubles then get on our cases about overtime. They work us understaffed but expect the shift to go perfect. This isnt something at EVERY facility. But understaffing is a problem that plagues geriatrics where most of the CNA jobs are.I love my job and residents I hate my companys management. The route you take is really dependant on your situation. If you can afford to jump straight into BSN go for it. Try working PRN as a CNA once you can get lisenced to build up some experience for your resume. Lots of people at my facility go to school during the week and only work on the weekends.

This is further reinforced by the statement later in the paragraph statinggt the CDC updated their criteria for Ebola transmission to include being within  feet or in the same room as someone infected with the virus. Standard droplet precautions can prevent dropletbased transmission.

2211450,0,t3_2jrcak,Hey Im in my final year of a BN program as well.The realization that my ADD or ADHD as it is now may be more influencing then I was admitting to myself hit hard this semester. Specifically a teacher whom I consider to be one of our best is concerned with my level of work and flat out said You seem to have an issue with meeting due dates. I suspect Ive had a pretty lenient group of teachers throughout my schooling. I decided to use the knowledge Ive acquire of the last four years to help me understand ADHD to a level I was never capable of as a child. I was diagnosed as a child like grade . Then at  I stopped taking medications because I dont need no medication to be normal dammit! So naive. I dropped out of high school went back got a equivalence degree did technical school dropped that career did EMREMT technical school and then went into Nursing.Anyways Ive been reflecting on my adult life and have decided to try to start accessing mental health resources. In the mean time I felt it was time to update my knowledge level on the subject Which needed A LOT of updating. My mental health education skimmed over ADHD and related it primarily to signs and symptoms in children. As I learned about adult ADHD I realized I had been covering for my symptoms well into my adult life. Upon this my intelligence had allowed me to get away with things like reading the content once straight from the book not studying and generally doing all my work for projects within  hours.I had to look at myself in other situations like work. Sometimes adults with ADHD have trouble with work for a variety of reasons I was not experiencing any issues. Then I looked closer at my actual job as a Nursing Attendant ER tech in the States I believe in a trauma  ER. The NA job is almost the perfect job for a adult with ADHD. Tons of smalls tasks which are externally motivated pushing stretchers grabbing supplies transporting patients do CPR hold this patient get security the flow of tasks is unrelenting In the ER the very environment creates constant demands that need immediate action and have quick resolutions. Another work area that adults with ADHD may experience is being late. Being late for work wasnt a factor with this job as I could easily sleep inbrowse facebookwhatever roll out of bed throw on scrubs grab a Cliff bar and be on floor within  minutes. While I cannot comment on ER work as a nurse I suspect an ER nursing position or any high acuity position would definitely play to the needs of ADHD nurses. From what Ive been reading ADHD is very much an adult problem especially if you were diagnosed as a child. In Adult ADHD the hyperactivity isnt as common but the lack of persistence towards a long term goal ability to resist distractions and disorganization can be very pronounced. However as adults compensating measures are created. I for example when faced by several different long term tasks create step by step lists which I check off as I near completion of the goal. An example of a negative compensation I do is that I rarely ever put myself in the position of having several long term tasks preferring to place myself in a day bubble.As such much of the research Which has been heavy with Dr. Russel Barkleys work Ive been reading highlights two things. Medications for ADHD are probably the most effective in any mental health branch. Upon this behavior therapy in combination with medications can produce drastic effects. While teaching just skill base interventions are not as effective it is not a lack of knowledge about how to organize its about a lack of capacity to produce and maintain intrisicmotivation which is required to transfer organization knowledge into organization actions.TLDR... Any high acuity high demand nursing job will probably engage you! Educate yourself on adult ADHD. Identify how ADHD may be influencing your behaviors. Identify how youre compensating for those behaviors. Seek professional help and explore if pharmaceutical and CBT therapies can be beneficial!

2212967,0,t1_cll2zjf,I understand this position but come back to the point that this was volunteered for. Volunteers that if allowed had every intention of returning to work in a hospital full of compromised patients.  Potentially depriving many people of family income etc. by infecting them unnecessarily. Ebola and its outbreaks have been here for a long time with no surge in volunteers until now. It doesnt even scratch the surface of Africas list of needs.Im not a doomsday type of hypochondriac but understand that there is no room for a whoops... we were wrong if it is allowed to gain a foothold primarily because of a few people that chose to be vectors. There is nothing unreasonable in saying we need a new standard that works. If you decide to go treat Ebola patients before we have had a chance to develop that you will be quarantined. MOST quarantined peopleanimals arent positive. Thats not a solid argument against quarantine. There has been a late reporting of symptoms by all infected medical workers up to this point. Not because they didnt probably notice with horror at the very first symptoms but because the human in the equation doesnt want call the alarm unnecessarily or be the next one on the news. A bigger point is that we are speaking in terms of nurses that have an understanding infection control when we make a judgement on this topic. The fact that MDs and RNs have contracted it anyway notwithstanding the rules are largely considering the general public. What of the people that decide to go and have no aseptic practices at all?This sub is awful with the updownvote  like button.

Im on a dementia unit and deal with mostly behavior issues. My friend upstairs is constantly dealing with messed up labs broken everythings and a variety of meds. LTC is a nice slow start for me I tend to be nervous and I dont think I could handle the hospital! Also my job is ? Salary...new thing should be  but more like  lately...Ill always whine about this so I can go home and have dinner with my husband after work while my coworkers cry about the night shift. Im not trying to be a jerk just pointing out some possible perks!  For every skill people say you lose you gain a different one. Im developing my management skills and Im learning a lot about dementia and psych issues in the elderly. Ive learned to speak better in public from all of the meetings!. Its also easier to change things in my opinion. If I do some research and present it to the team they are likely to agree or tell me to quit while Im ahead....

If financial reasons are causing you to need to quit please talk to your school first there may be assistance out there that can help you get through.

While I understand you are already studying and working a carerAIN job will prove invaluable experience to you as you relate subject information to real life experiences. There are facilities in Sydney screaming for people to fill those types of positions too so you would probably find it very easy to get a job and have flexibility with days and hours you wanted to work.I personally studied through Wollongong University even though I live and work in Sydney as they have a campus at LoftusSutherland and depending where abouts in Sydney you live  this could be an option for you too. The thing I loved about being on a remote campus is that classes were very small and access to teachers was fantastic. You were known on a first name basis and getting extra help if you were struggling with any aspects of the course was easy.From what I understand  after completing your first year of BA RN through any NSW university automatically enables you to work as an AIN  so if later on you decide that is a path you want to follow for more experience after your first year of study then that is another option you have up your sleeve too.Good luck to you! ,nursing,cq41io1,1,t5_2ra72

The key difference is they are not required to but Im not arguing for or against that.Ill add that I came to this subreddit in hopes of a helpful answer.

For instances an RN starting out in community can expect anywhere between  hr and cap off at max hr where as a RN starting out in hospital here can anticipate anywhere between  at max. For RPNs starting out in community . RPN starting in hospital . I mean compared to many of the States we do quite well our cost of living is higher here but regardless the discrepancy between home care and hospital nurse in Canada substantial. I should also stress that I live in Ontario and things can differ from one province to the next much the same way as in the States. For instance here in Ontario our government funded home health care is streamed through CCAC Community Care Access Centers. CCAC is responsible for assessing client needs and setting up services as needed on a case by case basis i.e nursing personal support occupational therapy physiotherapy social work etc..Each region has its own CCAC who receives their budget from the government CCAC then contracts out a good percentage of their client case loads to service providers like the company I work for. CCAC provides a budget to us ... theyre like the middle man of health care here in Ontario and were hoping the model is changed because its not effective and theres a much better approach.

I dont know your marriage but it sounds like theres been a serious lack of communication over a very big issue change of career. The fact that she got rds through school without you realizing night shift work would be involved is telling. Maybe shes sick of teaching. Maybe she wants to earn more money as an RN and hospital RNs generally earn much more than RNs who work at doctors offices. Maybe she wants to work set hours rather than filling in as a substitute teacher. We dont know and from the looks of it you dont either. Not to mention that night shift positions generally pay better than day shift getting day shift straight out of school is very rare and night shift is generally better for a new nurse than days. Night shift usually gives the new grad more time to learn how the hospital works how to manage time how to handle everything the hospital throws at her. Day shift for a new grad can be overwhelmingly stressful especially from someone whos not used to working in a hospital. Nights will allow her to ease into her new profession until she gains more experience and can go for a day shift position. ,nursing,cszpbnr,4,t5_2ra72

5099963,0,t1_cv0q1ym,Well its  per case essentially but on busydaysyoumay end up taking care of more than  patients. That being said the care you give is much different than the kind on the floor.  If you are a circulator it is about appropriate positioning making sure the surgical team has the things they need helpful maintain a sterile environment as well as other tasks.  When you are scrubbed you are passing instruments helping dress maintain sterile technique. Theres more to it in practice Im just simplifying for brevity sake.  You are sort of like advocating for the patient when they cant advocate for themselves. I definitely think you need to have a certain personality for the OR as the environment can be challenging sometimes. You also have to be on your toes because procedures can have unexpected outcomes  I would say its stressful like all nursing  some days are great.

5116391,0,t3_3kscwd,Obviously correct answer is clarify with provider. Moreover you have to look at a risk vs benefit. Risk of holding one cc fluid bolus preprocedure. Basically nothing. Risk of giving cc into stomach NG tube immediately preprocedure gt aspiration gt pneumonia gt risk of death. Risk of giving cc via PEG tube as you did possible theoretical slim risk of backflow of some small amount of liquid into stomach creating small risk for aspiration. Should probably be held but shouldnt matter too much. Aspiration risk during standard induction is huge and should be concidered before giving anything beforehand. I would have held it although as you said with a PEG it probably does not mater. Also cchr LR should be enough to maintain hydration.  What is normal UO? Greater than mlhr. ,nursing,cv2psxj,1,t5_2ra72

She went out on stage and spoke of something shes passionate about and because it lacked the entertainment factor of a jig and a jingle she was ridiculed on national television. And yes. Nursing is a profession and thus you can extrapolate my point and say it can be said for all professions. And maybe it can be. But for me what it comes down to is this. You look at a world class violinist and you know the difference between that person and someone who goes through the motions to play the same tune. You call the world class one talented. You acknowledged that they have trained and practiced for years and call that talent. You value that person for that talent. This young woman stood up there and tried to convey her hard work and practice and training. her talent.  but because she didnt entertain you she is mocked.

I have a few days off afterwards and I try to get it when I do have a few days off following the shot because a few times it has made me feel a little achy but this isnt usually the case. One time I even got the flu a few months after the shot. But Ill still get it every year because statistically the benefit outweighs the risk. Which is pretty much what our whole field of science is about. Almost every procedure and medication we provide comes with risk but the benefit outweighs that risk.There are exceptions to getting the shot dont get me wrong. Serious allergic reactions imo the only acceptable excuse for a healthcare worker. And when that happens I dont feel like requiring you to wear a mask and being extra careful with hand hygiene is too much to require. You should want to do that.I feel like a lot of this controversy is about people being upset about being forced to do it taking away their choice or freedom.I mean Im all about freedom but you have the freedom to choose your profession and this is something that you should expect and accept when making that choice. So to me that is not a good excuse.We tend to think about how the consequences of our decisions effect ourselves and not others. As a healthcare professional you should understand this psychological behavioral aspect that you are prone to and make a more informed and logical decision. ,nursing,cvhzh8w,1,t5_2ra72

Far too often nurses take jobs only to find out its not what they expected resulting in understaffing and unsafe patient care when theres high turnover. Id recommend that it remains anonymous but also somehow verify that raters are actually nurses. This would reduce BS ratings.

Id never expect a patients family to stay with them the whole time and I always make sure they dont feel guilty leaving by telling them it is important to take care of him or herself and their other family members. Have you considered changing careers? From this and your other articles posted on here which are met with heavy downvotes and criticism it is pretty clear that youre burned out from nursing.

A good school that works to keep its waiting list short will be competitive to enter.

5854775,0,t1_cxn2hm5,That does make things clearer and is a bit of what I suspected. What you describe is completely normal for a new nurse.  Think of it as gradually incorporating new information into your subconcious.  Right now youre like a kid.  In Piagets terms youd probably be in the concreteoperational stage of nursing.  As you gain more experience a lot of the things you hyperfocus on now procedures charting time management become more subconcious youve made them habit youve memorized them you dont need to stop and think through every little step on how to docheckchartobserve each thing.  When that happens you can focus on every other little detail that goes on in nursing.  Youll move from formaloperational to be able to observe and incorporate more abstract stuff.What Im saying is that its important for you to be at the phase youre at right now as a nurse.  You need to learn all this stuff to be able to move onto the next step.  Just focus on doing what youre doing.  In a year youll be shocked at how much more you know and see.Heres an example from my own life.  As a new nurse putting in an IV used to put me in a cold sweat.   Before I put one in Id think about my technique think about which catheter to use think about all the steps.  My mind would think about the IV for at least  minutes before going into the room thoughts of poking through the patients skin looming.  Id gather my equipment announce to my colleagues that I was going to attempt an IV to prepare them in case I missed go into the room announce I was going to put in an IV to the patient.  Id nervously assess their veins and go for the largest most obvious vein.  If I had success Id congratulate myself.  If I missed I felt bad and sheepishly went to go find another nurse to go attempt after apologizing to my patient.Id think about why I missed the IV as I went home Id look up information online on how to get better etc.Now that I have more experience IVs are easier for me so I focus on other things.  I check all my patients info in the morning after report.  Look up all my patients who need IVs replaced gather my materials and change their IVs during my morning med passes as I do my assessments.  That part of nursing has moved from concious to subconcious and I can focus more on other details such as family dynamics patients psychosocialcoping issues plans of care labs ect.It will come.,nursing,cxn3890,7,t5_2ra72

5947868,0,t3_3wucdb,Travel Murse here travel as often as you want. Contracts are usually  weeks. If youre any good at your job the hospital will want to extend you. Ill have been in WA state for months before I leave. Theres always a shortage of nurses every region of the US will have contracts available just depends on if your agency has ties to those regions. I pick an areacity I like my agency looks up possible contracts. If my specialty is needed they send my package to a couple of places. If the hospital likes my info they call me for an interview. If the interview goes well they offer me a job and tell me when they want me to start. It is good to start working on the next contract while youre at the end of the current one so youre not sitting on your thumbs with no job for long periods of time.  My agency finds me housing although Ive heard finding places for yourself will save you some money. But Im lazy about that kind of stuff. My apartments come furnished. Ive heard AirBnB is a good option for temp housing though.  I do PCUtelemetryICU stepdownCVICU stepdown. Different regions call my specialty different things Ive found. I can do MedSurge and ED as well but I dont put that on my packet info because Id rather not go to random short staffed facilities and work those types of floors.

Please no. A thousand times no. Even if the doc is okay with you doing this charting something you didnt do is still falsifying a medical record. Thats one of the few major screwups that really can cost you your license. Dont do it. If you do get this permission from a doc chart it officially as an  order.

That means that during a  year time period the privately educated has  years in the workforce. All things created equal that equates to kk x years minus taxes minus school debt. Thats still a positive kk in the bank account. This does not include the benefits from raises or experience which are huge. That also does not include any overtime which is huge. Now you have  years of schooling. Lets say you somehow work during the summer and pay off your school. So k income x  years minus k school debt.

For example it could be obstructed by a foreign body or swelling or traumatic injury.

6331913,0,t1_cz99edc,gt people are being thrust into independent practice without enough experience.First of all thanks for contributing respectfully to this discussion. I would love to see a standard residency for NPs however I have to point out that this not enough experience argument is quite misleading when its presented to the public as it is in this article. While certain MDs and Im not saying you are quick to point out the difference between NP clinical hours vs. med schoolfamily resident clinical hours they dont seem to want to factor in the clinical experience of an RN prior to even going to NP school. By the time one graduates from a BSN program theyve clocked s of clinical hours. To be even considered entry to an NP program you must have at least  years of fulltime RN experience at least another  hours. Usually in this time RNs have also developed their practice through  additional courses workshops teaching etc. Im not saying that hours in a BSN progam are comparable to FMD residency hours but to say that an NP only has  hours of formal training is just flatout dishonest misleading and doesnt contribute positively to any real kind of discussion. Now as a caveat I think the the counter to this argument is that not all experience is equal. An ICU or Emerge nurse with  years of RN experience is likely going to have significantly more knowledge and clinical judgment than a nurse who has only practiced for  years on subacute medicine. It is for this reason that I like the idea of having a mandated family NP residency program where regardless of past experience you have a standard amount of training to prepare you for the career. ,nursing,cz9dap7,6,t5_2ra72

I didnt sign a contract and you can always apply for what spots you want mostly they want Full time. of course you can apply for part time and take classes to become a Nurse. most hospitals will assist you with becoming a nurse or any spot that the hospital will use mostly nurse though go figure a hospital that needs more nurses.I hope this was helpful from  CNA to another good luck. forgive my spelling and others Im just getting off my  shift. oh thats the other thing I forgot to say.

Sometimes ICU turns would take the full  hours especially if Pts needed cleaning. I can honestly say my form improved drastically because if it didnt I would have started hurting my back.

But medsurg gives you a great foundation for assessment skills and time management. Its easier to identify whats not correct on a patient when you know what the norm should be.Also what if you go straight into the ED and hate it?

Nurses do the IV sticks and if your fellow nurses at night cant get it you wait til the morning for the IV teampicc team to arrive to start either a peripheral or central line. If it throws off an antibiotic schedule you should notify pharmacy and you could notify the in house MD just to let them know the schedule is off for documentation purposes but the MD on call wont care. Sometimes if the patient is simply being followed by the internalists you could even get a PO order and IV unnecessary at this time torbvI feel like this docs life is overly complicated.As for notifying about dumb vitals us nurses are required to often.

I am not trying to say you did something incredibly bad but I and I imagine a lot of people would never think of taking anothers narcotic medication. Not even once. So even the fact that you see that as something small that willingness is not great honestly. Nursing is incredibly stressful. Running straight for  hours pulling out your hair patients yelling. You will be around narcotics constantly. What happens when a patient asks you for ativan for anxiety you pull it go in the room and scan it and they are sleeping soundly. You have  patients demanding your every moment and you are so stressed you cant think. Would you go take it and find another nurse to witness a return? I am not saying you are bad or anything honestly. But diversion is a HUGE problem. I had heard about it in nursing school but had no idea. I work in a large hospital well respected. They find on average  person every month who is diverting. That just blows my mind. They said it used to be a lot worst. Just crazy.Anyways it is not terrible. But for the love of all that is HOLY do not admit this. It seems nonchalant to you. Just a one time thing. But imagine it from my perspective. Someone who wouldnt even think to do this. That is the same perspective of the college. They are not going to see it the way you do I promise.Deny deny deny. Do not admit to anything. Wait for a response to see if there is anything they want you to do if its possible to move forward. If they boot you then that is that. Apply to a different college. But do not admit this. Especially with nurses diverting such a huge problem in this profession. I would bet on everything I have that if you try and explain this they will boot you regardless. Maybe report.

7445832,0,t3_4h7y73,What do you want to do long term? MICUSICU will give you the best overall ICU experience. However the specialized ICUs get the same ICU patient exposure vents pressors ect but then they also have the added factor of whatever the specialty is. For example earlier this week I had a patient who had pnuemonia was vent dependent and also in acute hepatorenal syndrome. However on top of all of that she was also status post emergent quadruple bypass surgery. She was on CRRT nitric and had an IABP at . All of those issues you will see in a regular MICU or SICU minus the cardiac aspect of it. So while a CTICU typically gets cardiothoracic ICU patients they also have to deal with everything else the MICUSICU gets. Keep in mind though that all ICUs will get other ICU overflows though from time to time minus things that strictly need to go to one ICU or another. We get MICU overflow patients all the time and even some neuro ICU patients unless they have an EVD  fuck those thingsAlso if you are even debating going to grad school for something like CRNA your best bet is to do the SICU or CTICU. Any ICU works but having surgicalcardiac experience is a little more preferred. As for the smoothest transition it all is based on your strengthsweaknesses. I hate neuro. It never really clicked with me and I dont like not really being able to see what is going on with my patient. However I loved cardiac and was good at it in school so a CVSICU was the ICU choice for me plus I want to go to CRNA school. Time management in an ICU is worlds different than a med surg floor. So while that experience will help it is still vastly different. For example there are days when I have two vented patients who we are not trying to extubate today. So I basically completely control their care. Then there are days where I have two but we are trying to extubate either one or both of them. That completely changes my time management. If I know Im possibly extubating one Ill give the other patients meds early Im talking sometimes giving am meds at  so I can be with the fresh extubation to make sure the patient flies and doesnt need to get reintubated ect. Then there are days where you have an absolute train wreck of a patient. Sometimes this will be your only patient other times you get paired with a very stable patient possibly awaiting dischargedowngrade ect. Now your stable patient is blowing up the call bell and being extremely needy you know the patient and your other patient is basically actively trying to die. Getting the right balance between the needy stable patient and the trainwreck takes experience. There have been times where I literally havent stepped foot in my other patients room for upwards of  hours. Now granted my coworkers will go in there and make sure everything is okay and do my med pass and stuff but it is still my patient that I havent seen in a while. Balancing that seems to be the hardest thing for new ICU nurses as you dont want to seem like you are abandoning the patient but your other patient really requires  of your attention. Also another time management thing is trying to prepare for the worst. After a while you will get that intuition that someone is going to code on your shift. Maybe your coworkers patient is just steadily declining for days and today on your third shift of the week they are basically maxed on everything and still declining. Its am but you know this patient is going to code sometime this shift and you are going to need to help out. This is when you give your meds super early again so if they do code you can help out without worrying about ifwhenhow your patients are going to get their meds or drips ect. Replace stuff early so that ifwhen shit does hit the fan you can focus on the shitstorm and not something else. Sorry for the long rant just took my preworkout and sitting on the toilet for my pregym shit but hopefully this gives you an idea of what the ICU can be like. Everyone is different and everyone practices a little different but this is how I go about my work day. ,nursing,d2ojl4t,7,t5_2ra72
7455757,0,t3_4helbd,Dogs are pack animals and social creatures. Even if people think theyre fineor adapt to being alone for long periods over the majority of their lives it isnt really the quality of life they deserve. They need socialization exercise and interaction with their pack.  hours or even  hours confined alone is not a quality of life I would wish on any creature and I dont understand how anyone thinks thats okay. Ive owned big dogs for over  years. Been an RN for . I have always had  hour shift jobs and have hired walkers plus a doggy door to a large yard. Or in recent years I take them to a doggy daycare while Im at work where they play and hang out with the same pack of dogs theyre used to in a cagefree controlled environment.Personally I would never confine any animal alone for  hours. Even with the run of the house. Videos amp pics you see of the destruction dogs cause at home arent cute or funny theyre a reflection of the dog being bored and anxious. If youre doing that or considering doing it take stock of why you really want a pet to fulfill their needs or your wants? Please dont commit to a pet until you know you can absolutely positively afford and arrange for the best quality of life possible. Being lonely all day and locked up in the house or a crate is not quality of life.  Find a walker or a doggy daycare. Or dont get a dog. And dont think getting  is the answer. There are a million stories of people coming home to bloodbaths and one dead dog. They can get bored and end up fighting when they are just trapped alone and without stimulation or exercise.

7500723,0,t3_4i3grh,Ive been a nurse on a medsurg unit for almost  years. A typical shift for a CNA would involve getting vitals at the start of the shift make sure you have your manual BP skills down because on my unit there are a lot of times were we cant or arent able to use the BP machines then the CNAs will go around to each room and fill the water pitchers for the patient. Depending on which shift theyll make sure to get up the patient for meals clear off their tray table etc.. Some patients will be feeders so the CNA can be asked to help feed certain patients. Lots of toileting patients! Lots of turning and positioning patients every  hours. Changing their incontinence pads putting them on bed pans. Documenting patients intake and output emptying Foleys and drainage tubes. If its day shift then they will help bathe patients if its evening shift then theyll help patients get ready for bed brush their teeth etc. They can also take patients for a walk or help them with range of motion exercises. Then take more vitals! Obviously this will vary depending on your unit and hospital policies but this is the basic CNA role on our unit. I LOVE our CNAs and am so grateful for their help everyday.

The faster you can get those meds to the kids the better while still doing checks and documenting on time. Its not a hospital environment so getting used to adapting your routine around the kids day while still being safe is key. It was a camp where the same kids stayed for wks at this camp so we also had to deal with script refills and parents getting the meds to camp. Be aware that you may be dealing with parents as much as kids!I absolutely loved it and am going back to a similar job in a couple weeks. Any other questions let me know!,nursing,d3g2191,4,t5_2ra72

Im hoping to get a bite but at the same time am terrified to leave the safety of the federal system. I know my post doesnt help but there are people here can relate to what youre going through.

I dont know why you cant understand it in a really exasperated tone of voice... Yeah dont be that way to an orientee.When I get a new orientee Im the helicopter nurse until I can get an idea of what they know what they can do and what they still need help with. I like to push them out of their comfort zone safely of course but not make them feel like Im tossing them off a cliff. I try to add something new  new skill new task etc.  every day if possible. For example when I precept new nurses in the OR for csections I have them for  weeks. Day one is a lot of watching while Im explaining what Im doing since most of the new nurses Im working with have maybe only observed a csection or  at that point in their orientation. By the end of the  weeks theyre doing everything  admission IV consents all surgery prep time out counts recovery charting  with me nearby as a reference. I give advice and reminders to make sure things get completed but I dont just jump in and take over unless its an emergency. I try to explain things and give rationale not just say this is the way I was taught thats just what we do. If theres something out of the ordinary on the unit I try to make sure they either get to observe or help out. If theyre struggling with something help them...if theyre comfortable with something have them keep doing it. Be approachable. Be ready to stand up for them. Dont make them feel stupid like my example above.Being a preceptor is a learning thing for the preceptor as much as the orientee. Each person learns differently so what works with one orientee may not work with the next one you get. Be flexible in your teaching methods. Its their job to learn the information but its your job to make sure it gets across.,nursing,d6q4hr9,3,t5_2ra72

Always consider what the worst case scenario may be for your patient in addition to the most common issues and proceed from there. Is the abdominal pain a AAA? Well the pain isnt in the right part of the abdomen and is chronic and their vitals look great so probably not. Is the indigestion a MI? Its an older diabetic female so quite possibly lets get a stat EKG. If you did med surg youre used to juggling lots of things at once but you dont know sick patients yet. Help coworkers with sick patientsnot just the codes but also the septic patient and the unstable decompensating CHF patient that youll see far more frequently. Learn what people look like before they start circling the drain because its far easier to fix most problems early.Learn who your resources arewhich nurses are smart AND willing to talk to you about a patient when you need to talk through something? Which techs can you trust when they say someone doesnt look right remember you may be working with paramedics with more experience than you? ER MDs are used to working closely with RNs and youll develop a different relationship with them than you had with MDs on the floor. If youre nervous youll probably do fine. Focus more on your thinking common presentations new meds signs of sepsis than procedures. Things like IVs and splinting will come with time.,nursing,d76kb84,12,t5_2ra72

8929513,0,t1_d7l033e,I think its unethical and unprofessional for sure. The part about sharing with uninvolved employees probably is illegal most places or at least could be seen as damaging for the sake of a civil suit. I looked into the issue regarding employers asking about illness where I live MO USA and found that its actually a legal grey area and its important for employees to know their rights as well as their employers privilege regarding this issue. The employee has a right to privacy but the employer has a right to know relevant information to the operation of their business. Usually this means that the employer needs to know how long the employee will be absent which is one reason that boilerplate physicianexcusedabsenceforms will stipulate a return to work date. So if youve seen a doctor then you can just tell your employer that the doctor thinks youll be able to return to work after X days. You dont need to share anything else because your employer is decidedly less qualified to draw their own conclusions about your estimated date of return. Where it gets dicey is when you have not seen a doctor and you are trying to keep your privacy intact and your employer is asking pointed questions. Yes the employer has a right to know what to expect but I suggest that you have a scripted answer ready before you call them in order to maintain your privacy. For example I have an illness that causes me  pain intermittently and urgent trips to the toilet. This is similar to illness that I have had in the past which resolved in hours. After saying this if you get to work and someone says Hey I heard you had the shits! You can tell that person that they have the story wrong and ask who is spreading that rumor.  ,nursing,d7l7247,2,t5_2ra72

When you get to the point where it has been several days and the patient is completely noncompliant you begin to discuss palliative care.  If the pt doesnt want treatment ok then lets make you comfortable and get hospice  involved.  I understand that the maggots didnt kill this man.

I think what gets me is the thinking in to it the why like I want to see a bigger picture for her.  I want to be able to rationalize her behavior in honesty to give her better care. Like is it generalized psych or is it addiction talking to me in this instance?  So this is a patient who is constantly saying that theyre pain isnt in control seeing the bigger picture to me helps me better choose a path to advocate for her like if it is generalized psychanxiety maybe I need to ask for anxiolytic.

As an RN you obviously carry responsibility for the whole patient but remember your run of the mill respiratory therapist has had  years of college education to get those shiny RT initials on their badge. Theyre adults so when they mess up on something that is their responsibility its also their problem. As the nurse you naturally have overarching general responsibility but when the specialist fucks up their job that is within their own specialty Id say they carry more of the blame. They will be one called in front of the respiratory care board and probably lose their license were things to go bad.Especially if you work in a facility where RT isnt the one running that ECMO IABP or Impella which it sounds like you do  well then they really have no excuse for not paying attention to the airway do they? Im not one thats usually big on shifting blame but in this case no its completely reasonable to expect your RT to handle everything at the head of the bed  and its also completely reasonable to lay the blame on them when it isnt handled appropriately. ,nursing,dc8v1rt,2,t5_2ra72

Unfortunately we were told that if the bed is ready and we confirm the floor has received the ED handoff record we are to send the patient no matter what. Its a recipe for chaos and animosity.I wish our facility did a better job of moving patients out as they are ready to leave but magically beds become available for all ED holds between  am and  pm...every time. Hardly anyone goes to the floor in between. Like how is that convenient for anyone?gt Im like whaaattt wait! I didnt know I was getting a patient!Ugh. That feeling. I will be in a room triaging someone come out and theres a patient just sitting there in the hall or another room waiting for me without explanation or warning. This happened once with a rapid a fib.

Its a whole different set of rules and lingo. Lots of acronyms but youll pick it up fine if you came from ICU. Different rules like you cant just walk into a room and tell the patient to sign a consent so you can proceed you have to actually sit with them and explain the ramifications of being a human research subject and their rights. But once you get the hang of it its fun.Be proactive and ask to help. Ive sometimes seen researchers in training just get sidelined because the other coordinators are too busy or dont want to train. Remember you dont have to be an RN to do this job so you being an RN with ICU experience gives you a leg up on a lot of people!

10884251,0,t3_5vgcyn,Just a personal example of this issueI have spent about  years in a CVMedical ICU. We accept transfers from a very large area and see just about everything. My family and I went to a pizza place that just opened up in our city.  There is a claw game that is in the back of the restaurant and about fifteen minutes after we got there we are eating the first bite of pizza and all of a sudden the claw game makes a sound that is exactly the same as our code alarm that floods the unit everytime someone codes. I immediately spun around knocked my drink over and went into code mode. It took about  seconds for my wife to see that something was wrong. I felt my heart race and I honestly couldnt stay focused on my family. For about five minutes I couldnt stop thinking of codes that I had been in. It was much more than a pavlovian response.

With my schizophrenic patients calling their delusions thoughts sometimes was upsetting because they werent just thoughts to them  they were pretty damn real. This is mostly an establishing rapportgetting a history thing though in other contexts they were totally fine with it. I couldnt really figure it out ergo I am not a psych nurse. ,nursing,de5qdtm,1,t5_2ra72
10920224,0,t3_5vvtbq,I worked in inpatient psych from  to  before switching to a medical floor. My advice for establishing therapeutic rapport with your patients is to concentrate less on the language you use and more on the tone of your conversation. If you spend too much time focusing on calculated textbook phrasing you risk appearing disingenuous. A lot of the inpatient population have extensive experience interacting with mental health clinicians. If what you really want to ask is why theyll likely pick up on your attempts to dance around the question. Why can be a great opening to a conversationdont assume that your patient either doesnt have an answer or will somehow feel threatened by the question. Really a lot of it is intuitive. You have to feel them out the same way you would when talking to any stranger.That said Ill offer some easytoremember advice regarding tone. For paranoid patients maintain a neutral affect. Avoid being cheery smiling or using animated expressions. In the US theres a cultural expectation that we greet a stranger with a smile. I cant tell you how many paranoid patients have misinterpreted that expression on my face. Keeping your face and the tone of your voice neutral can go a long way toward establishing trust with these patients. Also a lot of schizophrenic patients with negative symptoms like apathy and reduced range of emotion are put off by bright cheery demeanors.For severely depressed patients people who have trouble mustering the energy to get out of bed or dress or eat its often very effective to adopt the attitude of a concerned parent. Use humor when appropriate. Probe into and acknowledge your patients feelings. Imbue your conversation with empathy but avoid being condescending. Set attainable goals but be responsive to their feelings. If I have a depressed patient who wants to isolate in his or her room I start negotiating. Maybe an hour in the room then an hour participating in an activity on the unit. Be aware that socializing can be exhausting for these patients.While depressed patients often require caring flexibility manic patients need firm limits on behavior. Boundaries and consequences should be clearly delineated. These patients can be fun but its important not to reinforce behavior that can easily escalate out of control.I could go on and on about this subject... lots of tips for different problem sets but my cell battery is about dead. I guess Id just add that I think we do a disservice to new nurses when academic training about therapeutic conversation focuses on the content of our words and not the subtext behind them. Sticking to open ended questions and avoiding why are pretty poor guidelines. The most important questions we ask are often closeended. i.e. Do you want to die? Do you hear voices? Are you afraid of anyone in your life? Its not as if we cant further explore a yes or no answer. That being said its important to be conscious of the flow of the conversation. If youre doing well truly reaching your patient then they should be volunteering information they should be speaking more than you are. Tldr Use the nursing process to establish therapeutic rapport rather than rules about what phrasing to use. I think you should assess your patients emotionalmental state and plan a general approach to your interaction. Reevaluate your strategy as necessary.   ,nursing,de6cesz,12,t5_2ra72

If Im circulating I manage the flow of the room that day interview the patient bring them in and help anesthesia intubate the patient.

By the end of it my clinical preceptor was spending the day chatting with her friends while I took care of the patients.

But then I figure it was gonna be a bitch to get two full sets anyways so whatever. ,nursing,dese79d,3,t5_2ra72

11491581,0,t1_dfyh0j0,I feel for you in the doing more with less department. nursing budgets are always being cut and I know first hand that this mantra sucks when dealing with peoples health. In the bigger picture this is looking more and more like a systems error than nurses simply not knowing or respecting what STAT means. As you mentioned the contracts between the LTC facility and the pharmacy dont include extra charges for STAT runs so the facility is shielded from the real costs of this service. Nurses should know that everything in health care comes with a cost but usually management takes care of that so us at the bedside are further shielded from this process and the costs. This perpetuates the idea that its no big deal to put in a STAT order for that warfarin when the last dose is given as opposed to earlier. This also highlights the issue with the rd party insurance system we have in the US but thats a different discussion. I agree that if there was a fee to the facility the DONs of these facilities would start cracking down on STAT requests and you would probably rarely see them.The other thing with nurses and meds is that often we feel nakedexposed when we dont have something that is ordered. Again facilities cracking down on late administrations and the fear of what may happen to the patient without the medication play into this. The STAT order is likely more for the nurse so that heshe can have the piece of mind that the med will be on its way rather than sitting in a bin waiting for the next routine run. On a final note Im sorry those nurses are rude to you. they undoubtedly are understaffed and overworked but thats no excuse to act like that. ,nursing,dfykiig,2,t5_2ra72

Considering the risk of post op infection the damage already done via ingestion of steel and the high likelyhood that he would repeat this again in the future the team decided against surgery.

11655162,0,t3_668bej,I always loved preceding new students and new grads. In fact thats one of the downfalls of my current weekend night line. My first thought is that its not many RNs who dislike students. It may seem that way though because negatives stick with us more. everyone will complain about that one nurse who made their experience miserable but very few will talk about the nurses who gave them a neutral or positive experience. So right off the bat there is a false perception of a large scale rivalry between the two that may not even exist.The second major reason and one that has been covered by others is jerks are gonna be jerks. They may have been bullied as new nurses and feel the need to perpetuate that stupid tradition they may have become jaded by years of experience or they may just have always been a jerk. Youre not going to change this overnight all you can do is be kind to them and dont fuel their jerkness. when you become an RN strive to be a nurse who wants to help students and new grads learn.Another issue is students and new grads are slow and often throw off your rhythm. As I prefaced this I love teaching but even some days I can get annoyed with the slow down that a student or new grad presents. Those who canlike to teach can either hide this annoyance or constructively push the student or new grad to hurry up. Those who cant resort to nonverbal and verbal backlash that shows their displeasure.Also keep in mind the type of person that nursing generally attracts. The type A person is characterized as being competitive time urgent and easy arousal to anger or hostility. These maybe arent the best character traits for teaching but often times its all you have on the floor. Its not entirely the nurse either fueling this. Sometimes students are overly cocky or judgey and that can certainly rub any nurse the wrong way. Other students may not appear to be competent. this is source of stress because then we feel like we have to watch the student extra close and that slows things down. Final note In the end there probably isnt a lot that can be done about current generations of nurses who are already this way. The best you can do is strive never to become this and encourage your friends and classmates to do the same. Some will inevitably fall into this tradition of health care but as this problem becomes more transparent and more education is done on it hopefully less and less people become the bullies. Nursing is stressful thats for sure but to have that stress fuel bullying and push people out of nursing is very counterproductive given our current shortage.   ,nursing,dgh4l67,2,t5_2ra72

11664814,0,t3_66ei5h,Hm. Lucky for you Im currently a nursing student at SJSU. I can answer any questions you have about the program and the school.Also you should know that CSULB Sac State and SDSU nursing are much hardercompetitive to get into than SJSU. CSULB especially...the average admit gpa is like a .??gtHowever Im still pretty bummed out because of my dilemma. I actually got accepted into UC Davis UC Irvine and UC Santa Cruz as a Biological Sciences major as well as UC Berkeley as a Public Health major.Looks like you got into Berkeley. Grats. Bet your parents want you to go there right?  My sister goes there I heard their Public Health program one of the top in the nation. You should find out what youd like to do for a career. Public Health or Nursing? Id recommend you actually shadow a nurse or even Youtube A Day in a Life of a Nurse to help you make your decision.gtI definitely would consider becoming a physicians assistant which is somewhat similar to being a nurseLooks like you should read up on what a nurses duties consist of compared to MDs and PAs. It sounds like you dont really know the details behind the different medical roles. gt The job prospects for a new grad with a BS in Biology are very slim  This is very true. Bio majors from UCs are a dime a dozen. Literally every asian from the South SF Bay area wants to do Bio and apply to med school....I kid you not.gtPersonally and for other high school students as well my reasons for wanting to go to a UC school are considerably petty yet understandable for your typical high school student who feels like he tried his best in school. The main reason for wanting to go to a UC is for the experience. As dreamy as it sounds I would love to be dorming with friends meeting tons of new people from all over the country taking classes on a huge campus taking advantage of the large facilities and ultimately feeling like I have a sense of adulthood and independence for the first time in my life. I feel like this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and how everything I did in high school both socially and academically has lead up to this point despite not having the best GPA or SATACT scores.My highschool was really competitive and alot of the kids bragged about which UCs they were going to. Also alot of them looked down on CSUs. Personally Id advise you to tune that out and figure out what youd like to study cause you dont really know that yet. You can still experience dorming and meeting new friends if you go to a CSU you know. My bet is you want to go to a UC because of the weight and prestige the UC name carries. I know I did in HS Dont fall into a notion that only UCs can provide this college experience youre looking for. Keep your options open.Lastly if youre adamant about going to a UC and your parents can afford it do it. Like you said theres lots of ways of getting into the medical field after undergrad.,nursing,dgi7zpw,2,t5_2ra72

11690410,0,t1_dgl120j, days?? wow. Thats heartbreaking. We had a patient who was a  on the GDS scale fall and break her hip in January. She was lbs at that point. It took  days for the fracture to be diagnosed because she was walking fine no signs of pain or discomfort until day  she started to limp on her left leg. So we got an xray ordered and they came out and did it. Came to find out she had fractured her right hip. After speaking with the husband about his options he chose to push for her to have physical therapy. So we dragged this patient through a month and a half of physical therapy sat her in wheel chairs although she would not bend at the waist and it took  people to transfer her because she was unable to assist. Got her on a fentanyl patch and then after she was not in pain the husband wanted it taken away because he felt she was too subdued.Finally towards the end of March the husband requests info on hospice. At this point she is lbs. We got her put on hospice and the patient was still experiencing a lot of pain. We all spoke to the husband about morphine and lorazepam and the husband absolutely refused.On the th of April she stopped eating and drinking completely. It took  more days of the patient laying in bed yelling out for the husband to finally agree to the morphine and lorazepam. She laid in bed basically unresponsive until she passed peacefully on the th.It has been a long hard few months with that family.,nursing,dgl4jkh,17,t5_2ra72

11756709,0,t3_67q9wu,Choice of country is subjective. Just like in the States Im sure you could find a spectrum in terms of school quality in both Australia and Canada. I would also suggest skipping the LPN route if the scope of practice is anything like here in the states. The biggest question is probably In what country do you see yourself being inworking when you graduate? This is because you will probably want to get your education and your original license in that country first. Then while you are working your first job go through the process of applying to the other country. If your partner can just up and move the choice is less critical because of my first point. But if they plan on staying with their company in Australia for  years it may make more sense to get your education in Australia.  ,nursing,dgsni8a,3,t5_2ra72
