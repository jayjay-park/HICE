7392286,0,t1_d2hwdwk,LOL.And do you know what cost Uber nothing at all?  Not doing any of these dumb assed things!! What exactly is the end game for Uber?  Discouraging Lyft drivers?  What is the cost benefit to that?  How exactly would that be measured to evaluate if its effective or not?Im curious does your tothemat belief in a conspiracy of corporate espionage reductive enough to qualify is a counter intelligence fallacy?  Or might an even simpler and FAR more believable explanation be that users just cancel rides for benign reasons no one will ever know.Im super happy youre around.  I hope you stay a good long time.,lyftdrivers,d2igbp3,2,t5_30lxq

11717976,0,t3_6768la,Their response to me asking if the queue is visible or nonexistent... anybody else ever go to an airport with no queue?Hi RobThanks for reaching out to us.Since theres no queuing system in the airport theres no way to filter the ride requests youre receiving. This means that youll receive both airport and nonairport requests.If youd like to know more about the airport regulations please refer to our Help Center at,lyftdrivers,dgo9fg0,1,t5_30lxq
