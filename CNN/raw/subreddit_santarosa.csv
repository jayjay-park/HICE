1116494,0,t1_chv0qmr,Im surprised and disappointed that there exists a measure with a tax increase for which there is no opposing opinion to be found.gt Approval of Measure F does not guarantee that the proposed project or projects in the Rincon Valley Union School District that are the subject of bonds under Measure F will be funded beyond the local revenues generated by Measure F.It seems there is a permanent sales tax increase to pay off a finite number of bonds.  The rest of the money earned by this sales tax goes into a general fund where it may or may not go to upkeep for schools.  What happens then?  Another tax hike?Is there nowhere in the existing budget for the maintenance of Rincon Valleys schools?Im not advocating against the measure yet but the lack of dissent troubles me.  I feel like this deserves discussion before I place my vote.,santarosa,chv7e5j,1,t5_2s88z

Not necessarily a bad thing but considering the guys attitude the officer wants to make sure everything is safe and he doesnt have a weapon. To be sure the officer asks him to show his hand. Guy refuses and again with his confrontational attitude this does not look like a safe situation to the cop. So just to be safe the officer pulls out his gun to have ready. He doesnt point it just has it out in case the situation escalates with the guy potentially holding a weapon out of sight.,santarosa,ctuizgm,3,t5_2s88z

My understanding is the first year as a teller they make you run around a lot as a floater one day at Coddingtown one day at College one at Mont. Village etc. but after you prove your worth they keep you planted and will keep incentives in front of you. My Friends mom started out as a teller less than  years ago and is now a branch manager. They promote from within pay reasonably well and they even gave bonuses to employees amp their relative who were affected by the Valley Fire to try to get them back on their feet.   would apply again. ,santarosa,cw1496e,2,t5_2s88z

8265931,0,t1_d57l8sj,gt Taylor Maid Farms in SebastopolJust went yesterday. It was...okay. Their brewed coffee is great and they offer a lot of options as to how its served pour over press etc.. Its also cheap which is always nice. The service is great.My issue their espresso. Its bad. Its very flat and lacks depth. Im sure if you cover it up with milk and sugar via latte or whatever its probably okay but just tasting the espresso itself or in an americano shows how it really tastes.So Id recommend Taylor Maid Farms if you want brewed coffee. If you want espresso go to Coffee Cats.,santarosa,d5asru3,1,t5_2s88z
8330314,0,t3_4s9gwj,Might I add Brew is a super rad spot in downtown Santa Rosa. It is located on Healdsburg Avenue. Its small but great folks own and work there. Cooperage is another new brewery that is a lot of fun great folks and fun events. Cooperage is located on Airway. They have a small beer selection but the place is always packed. Railroad square and downtown Santa Rosa are great places to wander around and people watch. Wednesday night market is a lot of fun.Going up to Bodega Bay particularly Goat Rock State Beach there are some nice trails with great views to wander. Armstrong Woods is awesome. I also second Sprengers tap room. Their breakfast is on my list. As for the ice cream I wanted to add one. Shuffles Magical Ice Cream shop is located at  th street in railroad square. If you catch them at a quiet moment theyll do some magic tricks for you the also have regular shows and their ice cream is all homemade with some very fun flavors. I love that spot. Lot of great stuff around here. I appreciate being reminded of it all because it is easy to lose track. Also if you want a killer sandwich go to Ikes on Mendocino. Want to be nostalgic and rent a movie? Go to Video Droid on Mendocino. Man I love going there! Welcome to NorCal! Friendliest place I have ever lived is Santa Rosa. Love it.

9498033,0,t1_d9jnbo3,Nothings free broseph. The cost of suburban sprawl is damaging our ecosystem. We need to build up and putting in protections to prevent more suburban sprawl is one way to force that.  We have to get away from the car culture. Santa rosa is not a very walkable city despite having k people. Just like having the train we need to invest in the future. Id rather see people get bussed to work than see houses from here to St . Helena. One of the things I loved about Japan was that between Tokyo and the next city was a lot of greenery. It was the exact opposite of California. I would love to not have a car. I feel disgusting knowing I have to jump in it just to buy a gallon of milk.  Also we dont have to tear down our beautiful Victorians to build up either. The Rosenberg building was lifted and earthquake retrofitted  some odd years ago. I agree development costs shouldnt be so high  but we do have to do it right not cut corners and maybe someone can ask for subsidies that isnt looking to line their own pockets first. ,santarosa,d9ju26g,8,t5_2s88z
