1474584,0,t1_ci7bgfa,Probably late but I love playing as England and conquering France.  Just ally before you unpause with a decent bordering nation that will distract the stacks of France I prefer Burgundy for proximity and if they fail against France a weaker Burgundy is good for you but Spain can work as well.  Austria is my rd string big allied nation. Dont focus on these as allies but if you can get BrittanyAragonSavoySwitzerland on your side they can also help distract and pick at France.Id also recommend building a huge ass expensive inflation crazy army.  If you have France engaging in a war on two fronts then your large army should be able to find and destroy any smaller stacksvassal armies.  Also use your navy effectively.  Be ready to retreat across the sea with transports if you see a angry death stack heading your way.  Use your navy to out manuever your enemy and take advantage of military access in neutral nations. Say youre sieging up in northern France and youve beaten some smaller stacks.  There will definitly be FrenchVassal forces down in your southern possession unless youve allied with Spain.  At some point they will send a death stack to your main stack leaving behind token siege forces.  Then you send as large of an army as you can onto your transports and head for southern France and the rest over the border of BurgundyBrittany to hide from death stack. Then your naval forces move in and absolutely destroy the southern siege forces and cause the death stack of France to head south to meet you.  If you have armies of equalish size siege a very mountainous province like Foix and try to bait the French army into attacking there with a huge negative by splitting your army but leaving the reserve close enough to come in and save the day you get a huge boost to your morale during a battle with reinforcement.  Meanwhile your northern force is sieging Pariscapturing a few northern provinces you already have cores on.  You dont need to completely break France but do so if you can.  Blanket siege the fuck out of them if you can crush their death stack.  Just watch your war exhaustion and dont be afraid to run away to avoid losing all that manpower and causing revolts in the homeland.  When that starts happening take whatever you can get from the peace treaty focus on only a little bit of land and make sure you already have cores on them and try to release nationslike Guyenne keep normandy for yourself if you can.  That way youll have some decent vassals right in the middle of the enemy to further break them apart.  Release all your mercenariesovertheforcelimit armies but keep as many knights as you can in early game they are unmatched by infantry.  Pay back your loans and wait a few years until France thinks it can get revenge or if youre worried about Burgundy absorbing France and then build up your economically unsound army and try to crush them.  Seriously the minute you have completely destroyed their stack you need to start disbanding troopsbut leave enough to blanket siege France.  Youre going for the long game here so even if you have to get inflation up to not preferred but quite manageable do it for the sake of destroying France.Within two wars if you do it right you can have possesion of Ille de France and France down to a single province.  Then slowly let the missions do their job for youtaking Scotland and Ireland annexing your  vassals you released on the mainland.  Youll soon be printing money and have a ton of manpower.  If you havent allied with Burgundy they will fight you sooner rather than later but with your extra vassals and the sexy manpower bonus of France you should be able to stop them and once theyre covered in the glory of England you are absolutely unstoppable.  Take SpainPortugal after this and you pretty much have a jump on colonization for  years and then itll just be one or two colonies from Sweden or Naples you have to worry about.,eu3,cj1445b,1,t5_2soil
