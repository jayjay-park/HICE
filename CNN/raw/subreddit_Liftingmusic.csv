1515919,0,t3_2bkjeh,Yeah IMO this shouldnt be anywhere uplifting. Almost no tracks of Metallica have an uplifting tune see One Master of Puppets  with the notable exception of Wherever I Roam and No Leaf Clover. However there are some excellent Covers performed by Metallica Whiskey in the jar is a great one.,Liftingmusic,cj6apdo,1,t5_2vbwn
