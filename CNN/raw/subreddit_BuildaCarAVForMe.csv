I couldnt tell if he was giving solid advice andor pushing me on to that amp for some other reason like maybe he gets some money out of the amp...

11668297,0,t3_66f72w,If you are having everything installed then I would visit a few shops and get quotes. That will get you the best deal since they will usually discount equipment or labor if you get a package from them. If you have Nav on your phone then I would not get it on the headunit as it adds quite a bit to the cost. Sound deadening will make a huge improvement to midbass and should definitely be considered. I would replace stock speakers. You will gain clarity crispness and get a sound you like warmer brighter etc....,BuildaCarAVForMe,dgim825,2,t5_2ycn4
