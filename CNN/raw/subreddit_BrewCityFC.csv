2286440,0,t1_cluac2v,Right now were looking at either a usl pro or nasl team with a substantially higher investment for the latter. A usl team is a great first step. Since most teams will be affiliated with mls teams the choice is either become an affiliate or get trounced week after week because wed be playing better players. Whats the down side of being affiliated with an mls team? We have our own team and ownership but wed get high quality mls players financial stability and a connection to mls. No one here has any allegiance to an mls team. This would give us that. Suddenly not only would we care about our own team and results but those of our mls team as well. ,BrewCityFC,clubk3f,2,t5_34e80
