5239721,0,t3_3mro4j,I think having seeding and wild card based on total votes isnt such a great idea. Some groups will be weaker than others letting worse teams get more votes. Also some days may have more or less voters. Im not sure how to fix that though. Other Than that I think Im good with this. ,TheRedraft,cvhkrar,1,t5_398gn
5240354,0,t1_cvhltxz,Im open to any ideas right now. This is all of our thing.Like I mentioned in a previous post Im trying to strike a good balance between keeping it fair and interesting and not overly confusing and complicated.One thing Id prefer to not do is have matchup writeups or like a selfproduced summary of your team and what you think their strengths are etc. Id rather the voters just look at the roster and pick which one is better. Also I dont want to draft or pick any coaches because Id rather the votes simply be based off of who drafted the better rosterteam.But as far as tinkering with lineups for certain matchups Im open to that idea. Though actually when I think about it it might be a little complicated if everyone wants to keep changing their lineup each week. So yeah giving that option for the more critical games when we only have  might be better.I also dont want people who arent necessarily super involved to get upset about something not being exactly right about their lineup and not making an adjustment on time and then demanding to get a revote and be upset about it. Id like to avoid revotes at almost all costs. So honestly it might be best and less complicated and have less room for problems if we all just set our lineups and roll with it for the tournament or at least for the group stage and then maybe make adjustments for the bracket stage if need be and also for the Final  like you said.But at this point Im leaning toward keeping it simple. Like I said I dont want someone to come back like a day into a vote and demand a revote because they didnt tell us they wanted to have x player on the bench instead.So for now I think it is best if we just go with the default lineups we have on the official draft roster board at least until the final  like you said and if people want to make changes to post them here. Like I mentioned earlier I dont think all of our participants will be equally involved I think many have essentially peaced out so I want to try and make the process as uninvolved as possible and just really focus it on the teams they all drafted because we spent a lot of time drafting our teams.,TheRedraft,cvhni5r,2,t5_398gn
