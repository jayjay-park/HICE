I toured both schools and when I went ndsu was super professional and very helpful and und had no idea what they were doing and didnt have anything ready for us. So that was a huge factor when I made my decision. I would say go see both walk around campus talk to prospect teachers and then make a choice. ,NDSU,dau9ak6,3,t5_2sphd
