Lets refresh what youve actively conceded to here Emotions arent actually created thats just terminology we use to communicate a change in brain states.Every choice is a maximization of utility meaning we cant come to a meaningful conclusion on this unless we examine the exchange further back in the causal chain which would also render your argument invalid.The economy is necessarily zerosum based on the physical trade of commodities and the social manifestation of wealth.By extension of your argument that the question Is the economy zerosum? requires units by which to answer it you have conceded that your answer is nonsensical unjustified and otherwise just a complete red herring.That maximizing utility doesnt necessarily reflect the legitimacy or justness of the exchange whether or not the individual was ripped off lied to or coerced.

The problem is the moons orbit makes that figure variable by up to half a circumference or a full diameter.So then you go from the center of the earth to the center of the moon but then that doesnt take into account apogee and perigee.It all depends on what youre arguing. Some people might for example argue that Bitcoin is stupid because its a digital currency while not understanding that the USD is largely a digital currency as well the actual amount of money in circulation is just th of the debt let alone the entire economy.And thats the point  people have to choose their analogies wisely and be willing to admit where an analogy suffers because in the interest of simplification all analogies fall short to an extent but are difficult to grasp otherwise.We shouldnt throw out analogies that are helpful at times just because some people take them too far.I like the K figure because it helps people get a simple grasp on what  trillion really means as a number.

3596204,0,t1_cq1qlk9,Well I gave you an upvote because I think the question you posed is a good one that should be addressed. As it happens Im a dual major one of which is ECON. I graduate this summer. So I can speak to this although only as someone with a bachelors degree so take that for what its worth. First Point is that in many of the texts Ive read on market structure is that although many people may think economists prefer large amounts of competition this is not always the case. If you take the time to chart out the supply and demand structure of a particular market and its ability to raise consumption the optimal market structure is not always a perfectly competitive one.So lets list some common market structures in order of more competition to less. Perfectly competitive monopolistic competition dont let monopolistic confuse you its not a monopoly oligopolistic duopoly some texts dont use this monopoly In perfect competition there is so much competition that in the aggregate not a particular firm but the entire industry the power to set prices is nonexistent. As we go down the list this situation changes notably at oligopolies firms start to gain price setting power. Obviously at monopoly structure we have a firm that can charge the highest price a society will support. What may seem counter intuitive though is that not all markets tend towards increased comeptition or perfect competition. Most markets do tend towards that on their own but there does exist markets that tend towards olgiopolies or even monopolies. You may have heard the term natural monopoly before and its is a text book term speaking to the fact that some very rare markets will be optimal for society if they are a monopoly. Optimal because consumption for society is increased see indifference curves. My point in bringing all of this up is that a market free from interference from government usually tend towards the optimal structure. The simplistic view that all markets tend towards monopolies that extract a dead weight loss and welfare costs on society is simply not true. This is because these arrangements are inherently inefficient compared to their alternatives. As an economist where there are inefficiencies that lead to market concentration it is almost always from market distortions caused by government. Take for example Obamacare and lets focus only on market structure. There are many many ways to measure market concentration but one way is to count how many companies offer a service or products. In  the U.S had  companies that offered health insurance and since then that number has decreased to just under  in a matter of  years. So to sum that up monopolies arent always inherently bad if they are what economists call natural monopolies and most of the time that you do see market concentration that is inefficient in nature it is because of mostly government interference.   ,Shitstatistssay,cq26znd,3,t5_2u3ds

The way I look at it they are benefiting from the same services Firefighters police courts etc. that we all do however they dont pay property taxes on their land holdings nor do pay on the money they receive that isnt used for charity but instead used for thugs to silence dissenters in the case of Scientologists or help Nazis and other perpetrators of crimes against humanity get away from seeing justice. Ive seen a few comments about how theyll get to lobby and campaign for candidates though the problem is theyre already doing that  To me its a nonissue.I will concede though that there are many atheists who sadly replace the fantasy of a sky wizard god with that of collective marble building godsdesses. However I see no reason why we cant tax religiouscultish institutions on their property for services rendered and the incomes used not on charity work but for other purposes like housing drugs prostitutes etc. I also can see some arguments being made about how this the last vestige of freedom where some institutions and people can escape the government tyranny of taxes but I dont see it that way. I see it more like as the government picking winners and losers in the marketplace of ideas. Established cults err... I mean religions benefit from no taxes where as new upstart philosophicalcultsreligious groups have the burden to pay taxes.

If it drops me as a client it will notify other insurance companies of my behavior and they will be unlikely to take me on either effectively making me an outlaw. Many businesses will refuse service to me as an outlaw.There may be insurance companies that deal strictly with outlaws who operate remote businesses where I am unlikely to get into any more trouble  something like a mining town.

Most minarchist libertarians think anarchocapitalists are loons and most anarchocapitalists think minarchists are working with a flawed premise.So yes like killing in selfdefense theyre an inherently horrible act but to say theres never a justification is a pretty bold claim.gtThe most important part of this though is that you can also urge your fellow countrymen to join your side and vote for the change you want to see.

Thats much more rare than I think you realize.  gt It is not coercion because the government is not asking you to pay back an amount anywhere near equal to the benefits you have received from being a part of their society.Agreed but in the opposite direction.  For the staggering amount of money taken from me I could easily afford all the government services I receive AND pay directly to hire people to work for me.  In no way is the government a unique provider of roads security and so forth.  gtOne of the many benefits of a government is that they can and do run deficitsSure in abstract youre right.  But weve gone beyond run a bit of a deficit and weve spiraled straight into crazy town.  Paying the interest on these loans is enough to continue to skyrocket our debt.  Its not called debt because we dont have to pay it back.  And the magic that the government talks about to pay it back we control our currency! just means that were able to inflate to cover that expense...  its bad because its done on the backs of the poor.  gtAll that said by design a government gives its citizens more benefit than they ask to be paid for. Yes we are told that for decades but I simply think its not true.  I understand the argument Im used to hearing it hell I used to make it myself.  But it isnt so.gt Economies can ruin for various reasons but this is rarely the fault of the governmentOh come on.  Rarely?  Economies that are ruined are ruined due to either acts of god or acts of legislature.  The Soviets tanked their own economy.  Look at the  list of fragile economies.

They all have powerful governments and a populace that desires such governance.  gt They think that money means something outside the game but it doesnt. It loses value completely the second you ask for it to be removed from the system completely.Money isnt about the system.  Money is about individuals.  There are no actors that exist that arent individuals period.  And that money is worth whatever people are willing to exchange for it.  Yes Ive been told the same things youve been told about how we need it and all that I made As in all my high school and college history and civics classes.  But it simply isnt true.  Its a fiction.  We dont need them the way they tell us we need them.  I promise you we dont.  The one thing people are extremely good at is trade.  Everything else...  were kind of hit or miss.  Every facet of our lives reflects trade because its all time and effort in exchange for reward.  This conversation is our time and effort and our reward is whatever we glean from the exchange.  Theres no point in human interaction where this stops being true whether its working at a job buying an ice cream cone or whatever.  The whole world is just individuals and trade.  Everything else is a shadow on the wall of Platos cave that people tell us is somehow necessary.  gta huge part to the work that the government does especially the management of the economic system and laws that make these dollars so healthyYou cannot make something healthy.

I know its tough to consider that all the lies weve been told are exactly that.  And dont fucking lump me in with conservatives.  Fuck them.  They fucked up the whole conversation so I have to reinvent the goddamn wheel in every discussion and say yes I know they say they support what we support but theyre liars and heres why... over and over and over and over again.  Theyre control hungry power monkeys just like their nearly identical counterparts.  They dont give a shit about individuals any more than Democrats do.gtThis is because of what the state represents most and how most assume it was arisen Out of the necessity of enforcement of rules. All this enforcement of rules thing sounds like religion.  And much like religion it requires the faithful to defend it.  Theres three distinct concepts that weve been taught to muddle  society  culture trends among individuals to like or dislike certain things and hold certain values rule of law  how we choose to enforce those rules that we view as abhorrent  government  the monopoly of force that many societies choose as their rule of lawLiberals and conservatives treat those three things as largely inseparable.  Individualism understands that theyre all very different.  One may reflect the other but its virtually never accurate beyond perhaps half of the picture.  Just some poor reflection of the wishes...  Here...  an example for you.  Sanders represents the progressive society in America well by and large especially the coastal liberals NYC San Francisco etc.  He currently participates in the government and his decisions are respected by societys acceptance of a government as a rule of law.  Now when Sanders doesnt get elected it wont be because he doesnt reflect society it will be because he doesnt reflect government as it exists.  Not because he wishes to change government but because government has its own power that it uses to selfserve it cannot have people who rock the boat.  This isnt to say theres zero likelihood of things changing far from it because one of those three things can grow so large that it will upset the balance and generally tear apart the others.  ,Shitstatistssay,crjlphd,1,t5_2u3ds

Its by choosing to stay on that landlords property  despite having the ability to leave and while understanding the restrictions staying entails  that indicates a persons agreeing to that landlords terms.If your State made emigration illegal you could make a strong case for why you think it an oppressive institution but given that all people are taught how their governments work from a young age and choose to stay with them anyway pokes a few holes in your trying to declare them illegitimate while simultaneously supporting the existence of private institutions that do the exact same thing.,Shitstatistssay,ct8mbcq,-8,t5_2u3ds

I understand where youre coming from because my fiancee has a masters in public health and we butt heads about this sort of thing all the time but your comment seemed unnecessarily dismissive of the importance of individual liberty while also intimating that the state should be directing the behavior of the individual and not the other way around which is exactly the sort of thing were here to mock and ridicule.  People should be left to their own devices even when theyre doing stupid things that hurt them in the long run.  I realize that part of the argument for restraining such behaviors is that society ends up picking up the tab.  You balance that by continuing the practice of distributing the cost of bad decision making and banning behaviors.  We here would balance it by making those engaging in the bad behaviors bear the costs of their own decisions and leaving government out of the equation.,Shitstatistssay,cvc0c5g,6,t5_2u3ds
5224787,0,t1_cvejgz1,Its not ambiguous unless you divorce it from historical context. The passage arose in response to a particular problem in Roman tax collection. Rome at the time essentially contracted out tax collection to private parties. They often abused the system by collecting more than was lawfully owed and keeping the excess for themselves.Jesus here is specifically addressing the problem of tax collectors corruptly taking more than they were lawfully authorized to take for their own benefit. Church Father Justin Martyr wouldnt have found the passage ambiguous eithergt And everywhere we more readily than all men endeavor to pay to those appointed by you the taxes both ordinary and extraordinary as we have been taught by Him for at that time some came to Him and asked Him if one ought to pay tribute to Caesar and He answered Tell Me whose image does the coin bear? And they said Caesars.Chapter  First ApologyJustin Martyr wrote this passage in a letter to a Roman Emperor. He is giving reasons why Christianity should be allowed in the Roman Empire.

Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes. . A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. . Abolition of all rights of inheritance.. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels. . Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly. . Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State. . Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State the bringing into cultivation of wastelands and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan. . Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies especially for agriculture. . Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country. . Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of childrens factory labour in its present form.

7693677,0,t1_d3gkwhu,There is actually a truth that WWII ended the depression but its not in the way people think.WWII caused the Roosevelt administration to stop focusing on tinkering this way and that way with the economy in ways that were unproductive and actively prolonged the depression instead pulling out all the stops and getting all the roadblocks out of the way to allow for maximum productionwhich had been the furthest thing from their minds before when they actively destroyed goods in the insane belief that this would affect the economy positively by holding prices up.Once their goal became maximizing production and once the citizenry was on board with the idea of working as much as possible the economy really did boomeven though people at home werent able to live the way they should from a booming economy since they werent producing enough consumer goods for that and all the production was going to the war effort.But the combination of maximizing employment and maximizing production did lead to a booming economy.  It was of course built on debt and therefore unsustainable but it was able to be translated into real economic growth by ramping down war production right at the end of the war and allowing the quick conversion of many of the factories to peacetime production.The biggest factor here though is that the war was the cause of the Roosevelt administration ending its insane micromanagement of the economy with other ends aside from production in mind and instead having maximizing production at all costs becoming firmly their number one priority.  Of course if they and their predecessors in the Hoover administration hadnt been interventionists with no clue as to the negative impacts of all the things they were doing on the economic health of the country we wouldnt have needed a war to end this problem in the first place.,Shitstatistssay,d3gpzho,2,t5_2u3ds

Removing money from circulation is not equivalent to destroying real wealth.Thats beside the fact hoarding money is almost impossible in a modern economy. How could you even hoard money? If you put it in a savings account then the bank is using your money for other productive things and they are just promising to give it back when you ask for it. If you put it all in stocks then the counterparty to your trades now has your money so you cant be hoarding it. If you own businesses factories machines etc then your capital is being put to use by increasing the productivity of your employees.The left always seems to conjure up this Scrooge McDuck strawman that apparently makes swimming pools full of dollars and somehow hurts the economy by doing so.,Shitstatistssay,d4y1azp,15,t5_2u3ds

Even so private property isnt coercive because you have to first show that you have a right to use the property that other people claim or create. If you break into my house while Im sleeping and I shoot you or use force to make you leave thats not coercion on my part thats self defense. It is me responding to a threat of violence on your part. Like I always point out in these discussions your only hope is to drag ALL systems of property into pure obscuritysubjectivity because in comparison private property requiresresults in the least amount of force.

Even when it does the worst thing that happens is a higher capital requirement for starting a competing business. The worst thing that can happen with no regulation is much worse than that and will be much more likely to happen since competition will push companies to do everything they can come up with to lower their costs.

10138831,0,t1_dbsyx9q,gtWhich countries have property rights that arent respected as much?Not entirely coincidentally the ones which are wealthiergtUsually in conversations like this people correlate a strong welfare state with a lack of respect for property rights do they not? You dont seem to be doing this.Usually in conversations like this people are hiveminding around hatred of a strawman about how freemarket types just simply read Ayn Rand in college and started LARPing and growing a neckbeard.  Most people havent even begun to even adequately restate our premise let alone make a cogent argument against most of it. As far as I can tell reddit millenials simply create echochambers and regurgitate the same falsehoods until everyone believes that that is really what the freemarket proponents think. . .to be fair there are a good number of clueless conservatives or Trump altrighters who have no clue why they even pay lipservice to free markets except MURICA!.  I cant pin this all on ignorance of the more scholarly aspects of the freemarket position.But yes forcing people to pay taxes even for something as noble as to try and help the poor is an inferior property convention all other things equal I wont call it a property rights violation since effectively at least the state is the current arbiter in what property rights are and they of course say taxes are legal what is meant by better or more secure property rights refers to how much or how absolute of protection it gives to claims by individuals and communities of agreement in other words if you had a country where literally every single person was already going to willingly donate  of their income to the government for the purpose of administrating and distributing relief to the poor. . . that can hardly be considered a tax or a property rights violation.  But again not all property rights and not all property rights violations if youll take my shorthand based on the meaning I elaborated on above are created equal.  Which is one of the reasons that if it were possible to simply get a government to do exactly and only exactly what the electorate voted for and not have other factors I would absolutely favor more spending on welfare and a lot less on war and protectionism and picking winners and losers on the market and a lot of the regulation and occupational licensing and rent control and other price setting and certainly the direction of the police state and topsecret sectors etc.gtMind if I ask where youre from?Forgive me but Ive heard that question so many times during discussions of this kind and it is almost always asked as an attempt by the opponent to discredit at least in their own minds the interlocutor on the grounds of their character or perceived experiences.So forgive me for the snark here but Ill just go ahead and let everyone assume that I am a white cisgendered shitlord who was raised in a privileged uppermiddle class household in the U.S. Daddy got me good jobs as early as high school and I went to the wealthiest school district so I was a shoein to a good college where I didnt have to work to put myself through and could just focus on academics and then used my Dads and my communitys network of people its who you know right? to secure a good position at a stable firm right out of college and Ive lived happily ever after since.Actually I lived many years in the Philippines where I had to see real grinding poverty people literally not figuratively dying or dead in sewage filled ditches alongside government buildings and squatter slums barangays. . . and not be able to do anything about it other than start to question what the real differences were between western nations and developing countries which weve been told are freemarket bastions.  Turns out property rights norms and enforcement are one of the biggest things and government corruption and exclusive institutions spring from the power to tax and also the massive disruptions left behind previous colonizations and meddling by imperial foreign powers.  Turns out that when countries liberalize economically and protect property rights. . . they almost always make big positive transitions and all other human rights tend to follow along with economic freedoms and the wealth and culture which develop which now has the luxury of thought and means whereby to do something about lingering human rights violations or poverty or environmental pollution. . . . so no most mixed economies are not all that bad.  I am relatively grateful for what I have and that I live in a nation that ranks higher in the freedom and property rights indices than the Philippines. . . but the world could be better a whole lot better and statism is the religion the disease of the mind which is holding us back and inculcating this hubris in everybodys minds that social democracy is the pinnacle the endallbeall of political technology and societal organization when the real overarching trend of history that has made life so much better than the past is not democracy per se but freedom economic and personal.Youre not a statist if you think that the market without a state will simply fail too profoundly to deliver some of the public goods that governments now produce such as national or regional defense possibly even the titling and registration and enforcement of most property claims themselves and certainly imminent asteroid impacts. . . youre a statist if you not only cant see the ways in which governments have distorted the market to crowd out their ability to provide lesser public goods. . . but you also celebrate the taxation and the force necessary to fund such an institution.  The state is at the very best a necessary evil but still an evil and nearly all of our entrepreneurial political and research efforts should be focused on diminishing this institution to every extent possible and finding means of providing public goods voluntarily.,Shitstatistssay,dbt3e9s,7,t5_2u3ds

Bet you are going to say socialism has never been tried.  In fact socialism will always create a static class system with super rich government officials at the top who will direct the economy and societal evolution.  See NAZI Germany and the current European style of government.gtUnions and labour movements shut downIn a socialist economy labor unions are not needed as the workersgovernment control the means of production.  The government is the labor union.  In fact the previous labor unions become factions inside the one party system of government.gtThe government colluded with corporations industries and banksYes  A government that operates under socialism had to deal with countries that are not under socialism.  Are you say that unless the entire world is socialist than socialism does not exist?   So the government controlled socalled corporations industries and banks controlled by the government did deals with corporations industries and banks from countries that were not socialist at the time.   gtThe Nazis calling themselves socialist is like the Juches calling the DPRKNorth Korea Democratic.Incorrect again.  The Nazis did in fact take over the means of production in the name of the workers and instituted socialist policies throughout Germany.  They had a socialist economy.  From free healthcare to direct control of the means of production.   Not one company existed in Germany at this time that did not take its orders from the workers government.gtt was a term used by the Hitler to coop existing socialist sympathies within the German working classes.Also incorrect.  They proclaimed socialist ideology and when they gained control of the government they implemented these socialist ideologies.
