8311421,0,t1_d5gdt80,Thankfully she doesnt use facebook too much except for spying on her younger collegeage son... haha. So there hasnt been any big announcement on FB from her which would be way over the line for me. Shes at least asking me before she tells people though I also know shes already told a mutual family friend without asking but that friend probably also noticed that I hadnt been drinking.  Im just worried about a family wedding were going to this weekend since my MIL gets drunk after  drinks. I have this nightmare that shell start telling everyone on my FILs familys side during the reception which would be mortifying because its someone elses wedding. Fingers crossed that that nightmare doesnt come true.,February2017Bumpers,d5ghgtn,1,t5_3fh4t

8525615,0,t3_4wbpew,Im  and JUST started noticing differences. I thought maybe last week I could feel my uterus... We got our NT scan  and the tech was scanning much higher than I anticipated an inch or  under my belly button. But as of last night Im sure its my uterus Im feeling...

8637157,0,t1_d6l796x,Agreed! Ive been going to Disney year after year for a decade I am a happy blessed woman for sure and my usual mosquitomagnet self has never been bit once on Disney property. Disney is a moneymaking operation primarily and a failure to aggressively combat mosquito populations onsite would be disastrous for them especially as Zika impacts fetuses who would grow into children their biggest customer. Also Im just hitting the second trimester so Im beyond thrilled that my reduction in nausea coupled with my increase in appetite will coincide with Food amp Wine.

8638353,0,t3_4y6rev,Ha! I am always struggling with my MIL. An over bearing jewish mom that expects her son to do everything the jewish way when he married a catholic Portuguese girl! No gender disappointment as of yet we are having twins and dont know the sexes yet but i expect she will be disappointing if one of the  isnt a girl since she had two sons and always talks about how she would have loved a daughter to continue on all the jewish traditions. I will say she has been very excited since we announced and will give her that. I think its mostly because her other son has officially stated he and his wife do not want children and my hubbie and i had fertility issues so shes just happy to be having grandkids at all! Please vent away to me whenever you need! I have MIL stories that i can share,February2017Bumpers,d6lei22,2,t5_3fh4t
