3965742,0,t1_cr89lna,Im thinking my solution isnt really valid and you would still have to add a static DNS record that resolves to a local address as explained by rancidsploit for cases when the cached DDNS name is still pointing to a previous external address that has now changed. Until that DDNS names TTL expires your site would be unreachable.If you cannot control DNS settings on all computers redirecting all traffic on port  to the router where the static entry resides would override servers specified on those computers.    ip firewall nat    add chaindstnat srcaddresslistoverridednsfor dstport actiondstnat         toaddresses... toports protocoludp    add chaindstnat srcaddresslistoverridednsfor dstport actiondstnat         toaddresses... toports protocoltcp,mikrotik,cr8btzk,1,t5_2sibt

7642005,0,t1_d3anfu6,The scenario is messy I left out the fact that there is a need to tunnel a VLAN from the WAN also through the LAN to accessports. I really do not want to span the VLAN over the whole LAN thats just digging blood from orifices. Setting the tunnel sourceip to the VRRPinstances virtual ip solved tunnel endpoint migration upon VRRP failover...I can think of two options VRRP and Dynamic Routing. VRRP would require the least amount of having to work with the provider and billing but will require some tinkering. Dynamic routing ought to not cause any issues as long as there is no masquerading going on. Masquerading is happening at the core now but could be migrated down towards distribution instead...I have to make time for setting up a lab on KVM...

I would strongly suggest not using PPTP in favor of LTP IPSEC because of security concerns as well as the fact that no apple devices will allow PPTP to work anymore.  The LTP server will create its own peer and proposal provided the default one hasnt been edited.  Using the profile tab under PPP set up a profile to use on the LTP server. create a pool if IP addresses and you can also specify DNS in there.

11484988,0,t1_dfxoc6b,The answer is most likely Station Pseudobridge.Ordinarily most wireless APs dont keep a separate MAC lookup table like switches have to know what MAC address is on which port. Instead they use the wireless registration data meaning they expect to only ever see the MAC addresses of the wireless clients. Mikrotik APs and several other enterprise APs keep independent MAC tables so they can handle multiple mac addresses coming from the same wireless client what occurs with Mikrotik Bridge mode.Station pseudobridge causes the mikrotik to masquerade all the mac addresses of devices behind it so it is compatible with standard APs think of it like NAT for MAC addresses.,mikrotik,dfxtl72,1,t5_2sibt
