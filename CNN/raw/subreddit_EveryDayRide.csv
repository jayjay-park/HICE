3435075,0,t1_cpjqbqk,Shimano still make standard aero levers that are virtually identical to the s ones I have a pair of s  levers that I compared to a friends brand new ones and the only difference is the lack of  labeling. From what I recall theyre pretty cheap too so if you dont mind downtube shifters they might be a good option to keep the bike period correct and theyre lighter too to the point that some pros continued to use DT shifters and aero levers for a long time after integrated shifters became readily available.,EveryDayRide,cpjtoea,2,t5_2sdht
