11328558,0,t3_61ompw,At about round  a teammate of mine managed to get a noclip glitch rendering all impassable terrain able to be passed through. After he died all of the enemies slowed to a halt. He then reset once more and the enemies suddenly sped up and killed us all very quickly abnormally quickly. Finally after we all fell victim to the superfast monsters this happened.Unknown how the noclip glitch was replicated but it may have something to do with the tavern.,LegendaryGame,dfg2n5j,1,t5_3g03s
