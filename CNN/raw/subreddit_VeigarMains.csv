7819673,0,t3_4mavi9,Well its a lot better than Laundrys I suppose. But I would never recommend either on him at all regardless. DoTs and Lasting effects arent great on Veigar since your goal is to remove someone from the fight. While the HP is useful youre just as well better off with a RoA or Banshees. ,VeigarMains,d3uzvrj,1,t5_34n2e
7843283,0,t1_d2akt75,Did you guys forget about the complete removal of his ult scaling with enemy AP as well? Wouldnt that be a huge nerf by removing that  making it only an execution ability?,VeigarMains,d3xnjkp,1,t5_34n2e

8786044,0,t1_d52sbl9,I tried it just built him similar to ashe. it was actually decent once you get er but I would guess its probably best with a poke support possibly a sona would be one of the better combos since youre just an no ap veig early. ,VeigarMains,d73xftt,1,t5_34n2e

10114497,0,t3_5jj83k,hextech GLP is pretty good in veigar with it you can  vs  adcs like vayne lucian ezreal and with other life item you could have  hp other hp items like ramduins banshess veil deadman ludens echo. I really recomended build Morello GLPRabadonVoid StaffDefensive item you some times can change order and items morelloGLP for zhonias Abyssal scepter but never make of last item rabbadon or void staff is better build them like third or fourth item and shoes in any moment jonias or sorcerer.S diamond  veigar main.,VeigarMains,dbpxedh,1,t5_34n2e
10809379,0,t1_dduumcf,Lategame maybe early the .sec stun is a lot more dangerous.. But it still gives you a free Q thunderlords and you can back off  good trade.If you have this problem a lot you can try lich bane it gives you good damage against opponents who can dodge W,VeigarMains,dduwt5x,1,t5_34n2e
11572347,0,t3_6559bz,Morello gt voidearlier powerspike gt rabadons gt tank item gt tank item. Boots somewhere inbetween depending on game. Top  boots for me are mercs cdr tabis. But all of them have uses. You may get zhonyas or abyssal aswell. If you want to have fun get ludens and try to snipe them with w. It gives your w  Bonus dmg lategame.  ap Base dmg  . ap scaling you should have  at this point.,VeigarMains,dg7qcg1,3,t5_34n2e
