The coast guard does give housing allowances and you do get slightly higher pay for being married. I however have no knowledge of your last question except you could get stationed at a small boat or air station then you wouldnt necessarily be on a boat. Hope this helps my dad was in for twenty and I am myself will soon be in.,coastguard,cy2aodb,1,t5_2t0hc
