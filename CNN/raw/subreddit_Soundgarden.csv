2816077,0,t1_cno1xdc,i just checked with the record its a hair flatter than drop Eb. My guess is the song was originally recorded slower in drop D and they sped the whole song up.,Soundgarden,cno6ilx,2,t5_2sdgz

4652781,0,t3_3ep4e0,I think Soundgarden lives up to their name in that they are a huge blend of many different elements and genres. Punk metal rock psychedelic eastern influences etc. I usually just call them a rock band. The Sup PopSST days were the type of stuff that comes to mind when I hear the word grunge Louder than Love and BMF were metal leaning Superunknown and on is all kinds of different influences and experimentation.,Soundgarden,cth1knf,5,t5_2sdgz
