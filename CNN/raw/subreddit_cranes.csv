Its basically a third mast that attaches at the base of the second mast for the luffer and allows you to luff the jib down to a pretty extreme angle so you can install sections of jib in mid air. The principle is that the jib hangs vertical and you attach the top  pins of a jib section suspended horizontally from the assist crane then scope out until that piece is vertical and install the other pins and disconnect the assist crane.  Neat idea and if you ever have to have it then it would come in handy. ,cranes,cs11rv2,1,t5_2t1o7
