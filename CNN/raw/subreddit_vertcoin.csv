211809,0,t1_cf2kgqg,Youre better off than me. Im mining with integrated graphics. I get kh with typical scrypt and kh doing vertcoin.Try to stick with smaller pools so that were not clustering all our power in one place.

220389,0,t3_1wn1qk,Im using la.vertcoin.org no issues.  I think the ny or eu pools are also good.  There is a list of pools on vertcoin.com.  Try and pick one with low latency from your location.Short answer is yes go with a pool.  A pool increases the probability of finding a block due to the combined hash power.  The downside is you have to share and pay a small fee.I am cpu mining on linux.  I didnt have any issues after i compiled the mining app.  I am using both ubuntu and redhat.  I have yet to GPU mine in linux.  I did try before i mined vertcoin and had issues with the driver setup so I switched to windows to get it going quick.  There is a good guide here   on how to set up the mining in linux.  When I get time Ill be setting up some linux boxes to mine with ati and nvidia GPUs.The community has grown alot since I started mining shortly after the coin came out so it looks promising.As for the tipbot see here    Basically you have to PM the tipbot to register then after it responds send it an info command to get your wallet address.hope that helps.,vertcoin,cf3jqlp,2,t5_2zq7t

440939,0,t3_1z4im6,Heres an excerpt of a previous post of mineWhy Vertcoin?There are many different types of cryptocurrencies out there and they each offer something a little different. Vertcoin was designed with the concept that mining power should remain distributed and decentralized in order to keep the network accessible to everyone.As well as all of the benefits that come with its being a cryptocurrency in the first place Vertcoin has a few other features and design attitudes that really makes it stand out.ASICresistantMining any coin can be profitable so many people will build really powerful computers and run specialized mining software to earn much more than the average user. People would build ASICs application specific integrated circuits and these would have the sole purpose of mining coins. The problem with ASICs is that they can be so good at what they do it will making mining with a personal computer unprofitable due electricity costs. Then instead of having a decentralized currency managed by the people we are back to a controlled currency. Those who control the ASICs control the currency. Vertcoin is built to be ASIC resistant which is incredibly important for a cryptocurrency. It manages this by using an Adaptive NFactor algorithm for its transaction system. This means that the way the transactions are verified changes over time in a sense. By the time an ASIC is created to mine Vertcoins they will not be effective because mining will have changed by that time. This change means nothing for the average miner but it makes developing ASICs impractical since they will always need to be redesigned.MultipoolresistantThere are many different cryptocurrencies each with their own exchange rate at any given moment in time. Most of these coins use one of two common solving methods hashing algorithms SHAd like Bitcoin and scrypt N like Litecoin.In order to maximize profits centralized pools of miners will sometimes mine one coin when it is most profitable and as soon as its profitability decreases they will switch to another coin. These socalled multipools are thus set up to always mine the most profitable coin. By hopping currencies like this they can create wild fluctuations in the overall network hash rate causing issues for regular miners and increasing the chance of forks in the block chain which can result in wasted mining effort. It can also create unfavorable market conditions as multipools often seek to exchange all their mining profit into a single currency like Bitcoin.Because Vertcoin uses the scrypt hashing algorithm with an adaptivelyadjusted N factor currently N it uses different mining software than most other BitcoinLitecoinderived scrypt currencies. For this reason it is not yet practical for multipools to mine though this may change.MultipoolawareNot content to scare away multipools with an unusual algorithm Vertcoin also employs a difficulty retargeting algorithm called Kimotos Gravity Well KGW. KGW ensures that difficulty retargeting can happen rapidly upon the arrival of a large amount of hashing power to the network like a multipool. This prevents multipools from reaping unfair rewards thanks to low network difficulty levels that may otherwise not respond rapidly enough to regulate the block solve rate.In addition KGW ensues that once multipools depart difficulty returns to a normal level for the remaining hashing capacity which ensures that it wont take extraordinarily long to solve the blocks after a multipool distorts difficulty.KGW means that the Vertcoin network is able to deal with multipools even after they are able to effectively mine Vertcoin and that these multipools wont mess things up for regular dedicated Vertcoin miners.There are many other advantages to Vertcoin as well but perhaps the most important would be the smart team behind Vertcoin. There are many cryptocurrencys out there and new ones pop up commonly but Vertcoin is the first and only coin that solves many of the issues that cryptocurrencys face. Cryptocurrencys are all about technology and Vertcoin has an amazing dedicated team of programmers to work on the technology. This is the first coin that can be seen as a viable long term cryptocurrency rather than a short lived pump and dump coin. Cryptocurrencys very well might overtake our current forms on currency much like credit cards did to cashchecks and Vertcoin is a very promising currency to do that.,vertcoin,cfqguzx,5,t5_2zq7t

I dont think the reactions to the AMA represent any sort of schism so much as it illustrates that both the development teamroadmap and the community itself are of equal importance in shaping this coins trajectory. The proof of work that keeps a coin strong isnt just happening in our mining rigs. Its in what each of us do not only to advocate and promote but to create. Yes weve got a solid dev team but they can only give us the platform  its largely up to us as a community to bring it to the world through not only evangelism but with realworld practical projects.,vertcoin,cfvpb9z,2,t5_2zq7t

578930,0,t1_cg5x0fc,maybe you are right but i believe it has happened with bitcoin hell its even useless to mine peercoin with a single block eruptor... I would argue that they invest millions to control the coin not destroy it and im not talking about  attacks but rather creating limited supply like de beers and diamonds... and it is true that they do not want gpu mining to become obsolete but the reason for this is to make it accessible and viable for people with at least a gaming pc but really if all the gpu powerhouses jumped from ltc to vtc my measly kh would be pretty worthless just the same against a bank of  xs or whatever they have as a few block eruptors would be against a farm of blades... so its all relative people with more money will always be able to control.... asics just make it easy...

929429,0,t1_ch9wrg4,Systems like BitShares and MasterCoin are pushing for the complete opposite of what youre advocating the ability to fund and operate a company anonymously and with no obligation to any sovereign authority or law. Personally I have massive reservations about a system like that. I think it is imperative that operators identify themselves prior to any investment occurring. I think it is important that they exist in the web of trust and can demonstrate that they have been involved in cryptocurrencies for some time. Investors even casual ones now live in a world where they have the opportunity to invest in companies placed anywhere in the world without incurring crossborder fees or any complications. And just as with any fiat currency investment investors still need to do their own due diligence exercise caution and invest because they have confidence in the team behind it.I also think its disingenuous to claim or believe that a company that is involved in cryptocurrency is infallible merely because it is in the US or that an investors funds are even recoverable in the US. Have you seen how ButterflyLabs has been able to circumvent all legal action thus far despite being in the US and having screwed customers out of millions of Dollars? They have an active class action complaint against them and yet they continue operating without pause. The same goes for AMCVMC who also have a case building against them  being in the US is certainly not saving the AMCVMC investors on any level. The US civil court system is most assuredly not something to be feared by rotten individuals. Ultimately these bad actors will be able to circumvent law because they have unforetold amounts of cryptocurrency stashed and nothing stopping them from leaving the US.,vertcoin,ch9xidx,4,t5_2zq7t

My issue and a point I disagree with you on is that longterm investors who look into investing into Vertcoin see how closely associated MON is with it and are then turned off.  Im not worried about people looking up MON and being turned away Im worried about people looking into Vert doing a basic background of the coin and seeing this silly MON so closely associated with it then turning away from Vert.

Meanwhile the community could face a panic from all aspects of the community.If a PPool operator does it he is likely to get around normal to lucky MHs for as long as miners stay. This would not hurt the community nearly as much.I am not saying the SimpleVert operator will do that but I cant say he wouldnt... or can anyone else.

1416956,0,t3_2acd9r,URO just EXPLODED in value for a time surpassing the .BTC mark so it pulled up all the Xwhatever algos with it probably since a lot of people mining these algos like myself are profit switching between them.EDIT Just for comparisons sake heres a random snapshot of my profit switcher showing the estimated daily profitability of each algo on my   ti equivalent mining equipment profitability pulled from the TradeMyBit API and adjusted for  tis. While X is showing as especially high in that snapshot which could well change within a few minutes all the Xwhatever algos are showing as extremely profitable right now.EDIT Looks like the URO pump has pretty much subsided and things are getting back to normal Xwhatever profitability is naturally still way higher on Nvidia rigs but its getting closer to normalising if you dont get x your scryptn hashrate on X. Actually scryptn should be better than X for AMD cards going by the rates in that snapshot the order of the algorithms reflects their profitability on TMBs API which is supposed to reflect AMD hashrates.,vertcoin,citw722,3,t5_2zq7t

Sure regular miners may see a decrease in their profitability but that will be temporary. Also it may help to protect the price agains massive dump from multipools.

Vertcoin needs something else that will make it big if this can happen the coin will rise to  again and lots of us will be very rich we just need to brainstorm but the path we are on is not it.EDIT added a suggestion!,vertcoin,cl6l5x0,1,t5_2zq7t
