10256595,0,t1_dc6k4ld,If they ask ill send them whatever info they need.To answer the questions you asked though. Im using fiber optic. I am using the same SSID and i did delete and recreate the network connection on all of my devices.. havent tried to force any to use just . or GHz.If i switch back to my old router i no longer have the problem again till i switch back to the google wifi again.,GoogleWiFi,dc6n3en,1,t5_3ggya

10681429,0,t1_ddgu6rd,Soooooo funny enough. Right after this post I saw Google Wifi came back in stock at Best Buy again. I thought my order would surely move forward but I ended up making a second order just in case.Woke up this morning the second order was shipped while the first order is still hanging in backorder limbo. WTF Best Buy? lol Regardless thank you for your stock site!,GoogleWiFi,ddhpio9,1,t5_3ggya

11722962,0,t3_678rd5,From other users experiences GWiFi doesnt do potentially dangerous NAT loopback.However going forward I have noticed that for IOT devices that it maybe best to have them on their own separate network off another router within your LAN which you can then do whatever you dream.,GoogleWiFi,dgottdv,1,t5_3ggya
