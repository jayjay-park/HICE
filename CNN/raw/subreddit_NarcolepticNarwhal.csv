4417557,0,t1_csnke1k,but on boss rushes they are amazing... huh? Because of their higher Base Power I assume? Since I thought you take on the Bosses one after another not all at the same time o.Anyway yeah the Touph Ring would be awesomesauce though I probably wont get it just like every other EventAnnouncementNewspromotedAccesory what a mouthful xD since the last  or  BattleRounds that is the one where you choose the Dungeon see where you get the Characters  MCs and so on are usually where the Mobs start actually surviving one hit from my physical guys aswell as dealing actual Damage so Im pretty sure the Bosses dont fare much better.That being said the Sephiroth Event on Elite turned out harder then I anticipated now I curse me and my big mouth DOhwell I switched over to normal Dungeons well their Elite Version anyway I actually managed to complete every classic Dungeon up until now o again anyway trying to get some more Mythril to plonk into the Squall Banner who knows  maybe my latebloomer Luck from the Tidus Event returns?,NarcolepticNarwhal,csnldav,2,t5_38qan

Giving Mighty Guard to anyone as an SB sounds kind of broken in my head for some reason if they dont make it cost atleast  Bars and I cant really imaginge handing it out as an Ability otherwise. Im also actually wondering just how they would make Blue Magic work if they ever added it unless they just take the more recurring ones  Needles Aqua Breath Revenge  ??? etc. and make those creatable.,NarcolepticNarwhal,ctkdi27,2,t5_38qan

7004238,0,t1_d1a9thf,We only have  lvl  samurai Gilgamesh MC being out now which is what I was alluding to. Though Auron joins the ranks here really soon.  Samurai is just really strong for this fight since they have an AoE blind. I totally understand. There are definitely better Knights for the job than Gilgamesh Agrias Beatrix and Pecil are so amazing!  And strictly speaking Aurons sprite isnt nearly as good as Gilgamesh and thats why he loses!,NarcolepticNarwhal,d1a9wou,2,t5_38qan

7448714,0,t1_d2out8l,Crown is nice and Zells gloves are nice but the rest doesnt interest me at all so its less tempting by a lot.  Selphie is a character I have no intention of using ever and Seifers coat is okay but I could use more  weapons first. Same goes for the Mage hat though mag boost  hastega is good no doubt Rinoa dress is earth so not ideal.

7453740,0,t1_d2pfw0j,I had Meowna who just straight heals  HP without taking a turn. Its crazy OP.  I think the thing FFRK got right that most other mobile games like this dont is that the characters arent the Gacha. You can always play your favorite characters if you do the events or Hall of Rites even if you dont have a SSB. That makes a huge difference to me.,NarcolepticNarwhal,d2pfydi,1,t5_38qan
