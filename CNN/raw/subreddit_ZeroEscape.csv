6875005,0,t1_d0ujiu0,gt response Okay so Im going to try to counter your argument cause if we have another imposter situation Im going to flip out.So it seems like this argument is resting on troy baker being the VA for Kyle outside the suite in the US version while the JP version having none at all. Lets look at it from a fully JP point of view. Kousuke Toriumi voices old Sigma and Daisuke Ono voice young Sigma. Simple right? And Troy Baker voices old Sigma and Travis Willingham voice young Sigma. And because Kyle is an exact clone Uchikoshis comment would also make sense. Now the argument you make is that Troy Baker voices Kyle outside the suit therefore Kousuke should have voiced sigma in ZTD. However I believe the ending for when Kyle was outside the suit was left intentionally blank in the JP version because its not Kyle but ? yea its the same body but it makes more sense for there to be no voice actor to signify it is neither Kyle nor Sigma. I believe Troy Baker was used just because of localization discrepancy. The script probably signify different actors for K and Sigma old or young and the localization probably just went with it. Now to address some stuff. You said that K must have used a voicechanging box due to Akane and Kyle being in the suit. But that does not make sense to use Daisuke Ono in ZTD unless you wanna say sigma in ZTD really is an imposter who somehow uses the voice of K in order impersonate someone who is neither sigma nor kyle but I think it is more likely a slight discrepancy in VLR. Still I do not know where the wiki got the info for the VA of kyleembodimentoutsidethesuit or where you got the information about the voice being cut due to time constraints if you could link where you found that info that would great. If those two things are prove valid that you may emphasis on may be on to something. I just feel you make a few too many assumptions based off one quote and deductive reasoning.  ,ZeroEscape,d0vlfo8,1,t5_2w69i

Are Alice and the ancient priestess Allice not the same like we thought at the end of ?Whats interesting is the socalled Allice that was in the coffin was not seen by anyone in the game. So then what was the visual of Allice that was introduced in ? I think that will be a fun thing to think about.Essentially his answer to me was that any connection of AllIce to our lovely Alice is all misguided because we are basing this off the visual of AllIce which was really just Junpeis imagination alone.

Maybe your bf is dead or youre a police officer now or did a test you were very anxious about.Once that day ends your consciousness moves back in time and you realize youre on the day your friend might die or where youre about to enroll in a new job or take that test of yours.You know what happens after these things but instead of letting those things happen you choose differently realizing that your choices are causing different outcomes.The end of that day comes and your consciousness moves to another body of yours but in a different timereality.Thats what ZTD is about.,ZeroEscape,d418uo5,2,t5_2w69i

Its definitely the most complete stories out of the Bad Endings of VLR.But yeah that Safe Ending was something spectacular.Im not particularly inclined to believe that something similar to VLR will happen in ZTD. There are  endings not  meaning that it shouldnt be character based. And if it is only  of them would be since most of the cast we dont need some sort of revelation about them. So I think itll follow more of a complete story with tragic ends and such. Maybe because theyll probably end with only  characters each they can info dump for a person but I think itll focus more on the bigger picture kinda like the Sub ending where we discuss Sevens backstory and Lotuss story but they connect in a way that isnt forced and then starts asking questions in regards to the nature of the game or maybe just that ending.Thats my take on it anyways. I think Uchi learned about stretching out unnecessary endings out of VLR so hes definitely going for that Quality approach.,ZeroEscape,d46xzrw,3,t5_2w69i

But I can see how someone would have that impression.Theres a section on the Zero Time Dilemma page labeled Full plot summary but at this time it is quite incomplete and only contains information about one of the opening scenes of the game which has already been seen on this board.  There is also a section labeled Endings that gives the names of the main endings.Both of those sections start out collapsed and need to be opened to see them.  The Endings section does reveal how many main endings total there are even before opening it but again this is information that has been released officially through interviews with Uchikoshi and promotional materials and so on.I looked at the profiles of a couple characters as well and the only information on those is information that has already been released.  Im going to go ahead and guess theres nothing major spoiled on the wiki at this time.HOWEVER.  Some of the information already available may be information you have not seen if youve been avoiding officially released information as well.  .  Exercise caution.  Just dont go on the wiki right now.  Just because there are no spoilers there now doesnt mean that wont change.

I know that sounds cruel but to me its simply logical and I dont believe that Eric and Meera would not have made a bigger deal of it. I find it so bizarre that this old man was simply ignored by everyone for most of the plot like a fly on the wall. Who pushed his wheelchair? Why was there no dialogue about him? Why was he never mentioned in the lifeordeath equations? My only explanation is that hes like Professor X and has the power to make people believe hes not actually there. But thats inconsistent with the plot because at various points in the story Shaunbot Meera and Eric shoot him.Also if Delta was the participant and not Shaun why did the chart in Zeros office have Shaunbots image and not this feeble old man? Wouldnt the fact that he wasnt on the wall have made him wayyy more suspicious? Another plot thing  if they get amnesiaed after each trial shouldnt they have a mental adjustment period every time they wake up? Do they remember character attributes and backstories from previous segments? Does Eric berate Shaunbot each time because of his helmet like he does at the beginning every time they wake up?

Then the surgeon was the one who was going to operate on Sean that died so Sean didnt get the treatment he needed and died.And then reading the post game notes about spoilerss the other phiit mentions she was working at the facility that phi was transported to and they say that phi was adopted by researchers there.

8232653,0,t3_4ruc2v,I actually talked about this with a friend recently and we were both pretty adamant that VLR was the best in the series. But I think we liked it for different reasons.I personally think VLR is the best simply by virtue Heh. Virtue. of being the most interesting part of the plot and also the best in terms of smooth presentation. There are other things it does right but its mostly carried by presentation and the fact its the one that builds the world the most. Nothing feels like an out of place plot twist and everything feels within the realm of what was set up in . I think the only real downside to VLR is that it was neutered in development tonally but even then I dont think that affected it too much all things considered. They worked with what they had and while it might have been better if they didnt have those restrictions I think what we got was a very steady visual novel classic.Next I was a little unfair to  and I considered it possibly the worst of the three by a hairs width but only due to the dated clunky presentation for a story with multiple ends and the fact that the world wasnt as fleshed out by this point in Zero Escape as a whole as it was in ZTD But it still carried the lack of background by giving us interesting characters to explore it with too.. However it was almost a tie between  and ZTD just because I thought character motives and generally actions in  were a lot more interesting  almost or actually better than VLR in some places. I just put ZTD above it because it did some... interesting things in terms of plot etc. but the more I thought about it... Hoo boy... I just had to put  in a steady second.  also has a really cool location IMO and atmospherically Id argue it could be the best Some creepy shit goes on yo and the air of mystery is a real nice touch. but I think VLR still beats it by a wide margin. Again mostly just by VLR being the most interesting part of the story to me and one that creates some interesting series conventions on top of that.Finally Im actually kind of annoyed with ZTD. Not enough to hate the game but still... I still think the presentation is better than  and I still liked the characters Bar one. sure. But a lot of the plot points in ZTD felt like they were out of nowhere or them rehashing ideas from VLR in ways that somehow still felt like cheap Deus Ex Machinas Everything felt weirdly convenient even with the foreshadowing they gave us. Even the foreshadowing seemed forced in places and that really dampened the tone of the game. I think a lot of people feel the same about this. and while it all makes fine sense the logic feels out of place for the series as a whole since information is kinda spoonfed to the player all the time.. To boot I dont think ZTD paced itself nearly as well and its even a far less interesting location than in either other games from a design standpoint. It also does a nasty job at kicking some of the series conventions and trivializing events already established as important IMO which I was not keen on at all. It genuinely feels like they totally changed their focus middevelopment to me and thats why its the worst of the three. I really hope this isnt the last of the series not just as a fan of the games in general but also because I think a sequel would be welcome to clean up some of the wrap from ZTD as well. Again not like I hated the game but Id definitely like some recompense for some of the shortcomings of it as an end to the series.TLDR VLR gt  gt ZTD because the series as a whole has a bell curve of quality and an unsatisfying end is far worse than the arguably slowish start to get to the really good stuff in .,ZeroEscape,d56myoy,3,t5_2w69i

And it makes sense by your explanation ok Sigma was hanging out at the AB Project during a time window where ZTD happened and he only got back after it ended. Couldnt the ZTD Sigma who is actually Dr. Klim have written some letter to Sigma even if just DONT GET NEAR THE FUCKING BOMB?

8371782,0,t1_d5mjrqe,I honestly think that its the transporter existing that caused a lot of the issues here. The mind hacking I could get behind the morphegenitic field and SHIFTing concepts in the previous games helped establish that human consciousness effectively being cloud storage and restore points makes hacking someones mind a possibility but the addition of the transporter seemed so lazy like they couldnt think of a better way to get certain points across so they just threw in an alien civilization that can apparently warp through spacetime via D printing. The worst part is they could write around Phi and Delta as just existing previously hell Id take longlost relatives as an excuse they couldve even had a gag where Sigma went well that explains the names but the transporter was basically necessary for the bit where Sigma and Diana walk into the Pod Room. Seriously they couldve ditched the sigma and diana are phis and deltas parents bit have them establish a romance after the eventson the path where VLR happened but then would be stuck because they needed Diana and Sigma to be in the same room as Eric Sean and Carlos when they discovered the bodies because they helped give Carlos the answer he needed to save Akane and Junpei in the timeline that VLR has occurred AND its necessary for Akane and Junpei and Carlos to be in the same timeline that VLR occurred so that they could send Old Sigma and Phi back to the start of ZTD some  years later. If they wrote a different path to VLR from ZTD without using the transporter room and got rid of it entirely I imagine the game would have been far better received. True were not sure how the hell Alice and Clover are supposed to get back to their proper time and there are other questions that could be answered like who was the one that killed Diana when she opened up the X Door? Was it Delta all along? Were we to just believe that Delta was always off screen and just mind hacking the player or everyone else into calling Sean Q or completely looking him over the whole time? Even though he said he could only do it for a short period of time? but given that the transporter room acts like this giant deus ex machina providing the literal birthplace of Delta and Phi AND the method that VLR occurs AND also explains how Phi is so young while Delta is so old I think it just rubs people the wrong way because its so lazy.You could have everyone here discussing and theorizing about this or that due to loose ends but because there was such a lazy copout people got frustrated that the ending of the franchise was on such a sour note in terms of story telling.,ZeroEscape,d5o0tx3,3,t5_2w69i

Part of Junpei in ZTD is because he hasnt gotten used to being in the criminal organization and hasnt seen this dark side of humanity until now which is why its taken such a heavy toll on him.Tenmyouji in VLR has experienced the apocalypse and hes used to that life but a part of him has also seen the perseverance and kindness of humanity in the darkest of times as well. He has a solid relationship with Quark and they love each other in a grandsongrampa sense. Hes wiser as a result and has taken some pride in being humanThe survivors overcame their own misery and loss and made the best they could of the hand theyd been dealt with. Isnt that worth something? Isnt that the best thing that humans can aspire to? Is there really any point to a world where everything is happy? Are people who struggle for a better life just idiots? Being human is about fighting even when it seems hopeless and finding happiness even in a world that hates it.Akane in ZTD does have characterization I wouldnt call her a blank slate. She has moments of cheerfulness fear sadness and anger.

But since that would ruin everything Akane was trying to acomplish I might just ignore that idea.My idea of an ending worse than that but still believable... would be an ending where the s Phi shows up as the terrorist that would eventually cause the  billion deaths. Her motives would need to be... complex. Old Phi would also turn out to be Akanes great grandmother and was scheming this whole time to made all this today possible just to be able to meet her parents after they experienced the truth about her.

11430979,0,t1_dfrmysh,I do remember that part about Seven in the QampA and youre right but whats that big headache he got then ? Uchi explaination makes sense to me even if its a bit far fetched.gt Akane isnt saved until Junpei solves the puzzle. Before that point her existence is an undetermined state not properly alive and not properly dead.I respectfully disagree with that. Thats actually totally wrong in my opinion.This theory comes from ppl who played VLR and then applied its mecanics to . I think this is a mistake. There is no Schrodingers cat multiple timeline no paradoxe in . Young Akane just has visions of multiple futurs during the first nonary game none of them actually happened. Only the true ending is real therefor there is no timeline where Clover dies. So no Snake doesnt put Clover in danger. Well he does but I believe he trusts Akane and knows her plan will be successful.Dont take it as an offense but I had this discussion too many times and I dont want to develop it again specially considering how convinced I am about it.,ZeroEscape,dfrotzx,1,t5_2w69i

11729902,0,t3_67b9ea,Went through  spoiler free somehowVLR I got spoiled with Tenmyouji being Junpei and the base being on the Moon both from the  wikiZTD nothing primarily from the story but Sigma being  in the  yr. old body got revealed to me early mostly from the ZTD promos since I didnt start playing the series until then i think its more of a VLR spoiler than a ZTD one,ZeroEscape,dgpm5c0,1,t5_2w69i
11742097,0,t3_67aajv,Heres what I would change More interaction between characters like mixing the teams up. This would have added depth to the new characters along with variety. Answers for VLR plot threads Another Time Left FTS. Allow the  to actually escape like in  and VLR instead of just SHIFTing out. They also could have included a final puzzle here like . Either defeat the extremist in the game or not include them at all. There shouldnt have been a cliffhanger like that imo especially seeing as this was the series finale.,ZeroEscape,dgqzvyg,2,t5_2w69i
