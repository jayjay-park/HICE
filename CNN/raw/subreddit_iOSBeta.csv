8003635,0,t3_4ourkb,Yeah I run into this  especially as I tend to keep my phones volume pretty low which places the volume slider closer to the lefthand side of the Control Centre tab. I agree that a paginated Control Centre seems like a bit of a step backwards... It takes more actions for me to change a track or my phones volume setting now  sure it looks cleaner to have the settings subdivided across pages but it doesnt actually improve the experience of performing music or volume related tasks. ,iOSBeta,d4fon9a,3,t5_2sjys

That is news to me.For a lot of those touch interactions theyve just been reorganized. Its a tap to skip a tap on the album name to see the album and a swipe up for lyrics.My only  bugs are that skipping a song over bluetooth sometimes has a MASSIVE delay Im talking s but I think thats more of a bluetooth issue and some albums when searching cause the app to crash.,iOSBeta,d60k8vp,1,t5_2sjys

8782553,0,t3_50d5vd,No I absolutely hate the new UI in Apple Maps. I will be less likely to use Maps in iOS  because of it. The new floating side bar UI blocks too much of the map doesnt intelligently get out of the way when you start dragging around the map and requires too many swipes in an attempt to minimize it as much as possible. Google Maps UI does get out of the way better. Its less intuitive to find flyover now than before.  The iOS  top search bar UI didnt block the map as much as the new iOS  UI and didnt seem as intrusive. I would much prefer if by default the UI just showed the search box. Nothing else. Expand when searching or when swiping down. Usually when Im in the Maps app i just want to see maps  not recent searches. I hardly ever use Apple Maps for directions because I have had too many recent instances of late announcements and the lack of lane guidance is extremely irritating. ,iOSBeta,d73hofi,1,t5_2sjys
