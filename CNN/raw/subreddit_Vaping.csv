Do you have a rubber jar opener?  What I do is screw it back onto my mod as snug as possible without putting too much force into it then getting a jar opener and wrapping it around the base of the tank where it screws into the mod and twisting it off.The reason you want to screw it onto your mod is because thatll give you extra initial leverage to help get it loose.

I find that the best way to enjoy the flavour Im pretty new though so I dunno really is to lung hit and exhale the first tiny bit of the vapor through your nose. Just my two cents and maybe you just dont like vaping but Id hate to see someone miss out. I cant get enough of the stuff. Again this is just from my experience!

3232423,0,t1_cowy6k2,Ive trusted Kamry myself since I bought the KTS haha.  Id recommend playing around with one if youre on the fence.  While I love this mod I feel others might not.  Theres not much of a middle ground.  And yes the power is sufficient for most avid users needs.I personally love the feel.  It reminds me of a flask though it is not curved like one.  Its pretty hefty heavier than a VTR if you remember that vw box.  Its a brushed steel finish and wrapped in what seems to be sleek faux leather with relatively impeccable stitching.  I like the feel of it in my hand.  It looks and feels pricey almost classy.I was worried about the atomizer placement but its grown on me and after using the mod it makes sense.  Its easy to use in both hands.  The wheel turns super easy which is indeed a gripe I have.  Just bumping the wheel can offset the wattage not by much just a watt but still.  It has a  click on and off so as long as you turn it off I dont see it firing en pocket.The screen is set so the readout faces the atomizer while its slightly annoying turning the mod to adjust settings I guess its easier than flipping it all the way around when using it in another hand or having it on a side and needing to flip it.  Its actually quicker to see the readout and adjust than other boxes Ive used.My biggest complaint is the battery door.  Theres no screw or magnets but a small pin that slides in holding the door shut.  While I dont see it coming loose on its own if it did or if the pin were to be dropped the mod would be useless until a replacement was ordered.  The pin is also small enough that if its out losing it wouldnt be too hard.And as I said before anytime!  I enjoy answering the questions and actually evaluating the mod!More pictures of what I mean.,Vaping,cox1od4,2,t5_2rg4n

3756581,0,t3_33fmtx,Did you have a multimeterohmmeter to check the coils before installing them? Also before wicking did you fire it to check that the coils glow evenly? Sometimes coils can have hotspots and relatively unheated spots. Hot legs the part from the contact to the coil could be the part thats getting more heat. Uneven heating needs to be fixed before wicking. The best fix I found for this is the strumming technique which I believe you can see on youtube much more easily than I could explain here.Though firstly looks like your coils got a little bent up during install or werent tightly wrapped one good tip is to installscrew them in while still on the drillbitrod you wound them on then the tightening of connection wont bend the coil much. If this wasnt the issue practice getting a few more even wraps first.If you refuse to wrapinstall new coils to have them more even fire it without the cap on and see where it is or isnt making vapor. Still unsure? take the wicking out and see where it does or doesnt glow. All of this is assuming you know that you got your ohms right for your mod. Any more questions feel free to ask. shots of it glowing without wicking amp juice could help too.,Vaping,cqkh7p4,1,t5_2rg4n
3760376,0,t3_33griq,Welcome aboard  You are right here that is what you are going to need to buy. If you dont mind me asking are you looking more for ease of use or flavor? Hugeee difference here. An RDA Rebuildable Drip Atomizer will give you much more flavor but would also be harder to use since you would need to understand wicking creating coils and you need to drip juice onto the cotton from time to time. With a tank you can get a regular or a rebuildable one. The regulars such as an Aspire Atlantis or Kanger Sub Ohm will be easy to use and when the coil starts to go bad you buy a premade coil and just pop that sucker in and vape on! The rebuildable ones are the same as an RDA except they are more difficult to build and dont have as much flavor as an RDA. RDAgtRTA for flavor and cloud density but RTAs are a lot easier and more user friendly! Hope this helped you!,Vaping,cqkwssh,2,t5_2rg4n

4619465,0,t3_3e9lg5,I have two i frequent.  Beyond Vape as in the people who sell Aria has higher prices and only caries the well known premium juices at suggested retail. They also sell ft spools of kanthal for . Cotton is  for two squares. Would never buy wirecottonbatteries there. However theyre easy to get to and I go when cant wait for juice via Internet order. They have a  off juice happy hour which is nice considering the astronomical mark up on premium juice. Plus the staff is really nice and they provide juice menus seats at the bar couches bathrooms and drinks if you want to hang out. They have tip jars and I usually leave a few bucks because I usually spend a while trying juices and asking questions.  Vape Depot totally independent has lots of premium juice at retail cost but also stock plenty of cheaper options. Wire is  for ft which is fine for me if I dont want to wait for something from Amazon. Cotton is less expensive than  and so are batteries. Only issue is that customer service isnt nearly as good as . If I ask for recommendations on juice Im pretty specific on flavor profile and looking for multiple choices usually suggested the pricier options as the guy blows clouds in my face waiting for me to say sure without giving me any other options. They dont offer much in the way of sampling. At least  I havent been offered that or a menu. I only go there if I know exactly what I need. Just feel like they started a vape shop for the love of vaping which is great but dont know anything about service or how to make their spaceservice inviting. Were all vaping for the same reason. I havent even been able to ask them about modstanksattys because I feel rushed. That said their prices on staple items are good which is what I go there for. For reference to your statement about the price of a subox kit locally I bought mine and another local shop not one I mentioned for  plus tax. Was totally fine with that. Pretty much what I wouldve spent online plus shipping but had it right away. Id say you should price things to make money pay bills stock plenty of goods pay staff well but still be competitive given that somebody can walk away with a product from your store rather than wait for something online. Also focus on that customer service. That will bring people back to pay for goods from your shop rather than shop online as much. ,Vaping,ctcuzqz,1,t5_2rg4n

5133501,0,t1_cuyhjpo,Meh its good but the guy in the shop seemed to have the impression it was better than the MutX. Im not sure why to build on its not really any different. The juice wells could be deeper and the airflow adjust leaves little room for larger coils. My framed staple is wrapped on a .mm bit and I can only close the airflow half way. Not that I want it closed but its not really the point. Also it leaks quite easily mostly down to a small juice well and the airholes being quite close to the deck. The negative post airholes are a good idea but make a negligible difference. And god damn is the thing heavy. On your lighter mods youll notice the imbalance. Ive also had a problem with the positive screw inside the  not being long enough for some mods. I had to loosen it off so it made contact on my snowwolf which introduces a slightly loose centre post then. There are better attys thats for sure.

5572167,0,t3_3rg40q,Mmmm there might be a few reasons for it honestly so I can run through a few of the things that I personally experienced. Those tanks cant handle high wattage. Forget volts for just a second if you are pushing any more than maybe  watts then that coil is going to burn. If you are using a high nic juice then that will make your coil burntaste bad quickly depending on how much you vape. Also depending on the type of juice you use. Custards or very sweet juices will gum up the coils and make them burn taste bad quickly again depending how much you vape. What I would suggest if you prefer a tank as opposed to a drip setup is invest in a better tank and box. Look at the sigelis and get one of the high wattage temp control models with a decent tank like the smok. That tank can run at   watts no problem and you can run that thing on a mechanical mod as well if you really want to. My suggestion is go to your local shop and talk through the options. Spend a little more money now. What I did was go cheaper on individual components one at a time and now I have a drawer full of shit that I wont use. Honestly look at getting the sigelei  or something similar with a smok tank and go to town. TLDR upgrade ,Vaping,cwns1ou,1,t5_2rg4n

Organic cotton was used as an alternative to bleached cotton pads for makeup removal. Not sure about nickel and kanthal wire but I imagine it has other uses as well.

This means that the battery can put out  Watt for  hours or  Watts for  hour or  Watts for . hours  minutes.  So considering you run at W youd get about  minutes of activating the battery.  Assuming a  second puff thats a whopping  puffs before you drain the battery.Thats my biggest issue when looking at getting a DNA the battery life is really worrysome.  With something like  LG HGs you get  Watt Hours which means in theory it should last a lot longer.I dont have experience with DNAs so I cant say for sure but its something that would concern me as I typically drain a pair of s throughout the day.  There are other things like internal resistance and other stuff that I dont understand which help the battery life on mods with the Lipo batteries that most DNA mods come with.If someone with a lot of experience could comment on battery life and share their experience that would be awesome. ,Vaping,cxsjc3s,1,t5_2rg4n

5920754,0,t3_3wfakq,It is a tough question to answer.In general more surface area generates better flavor.  So more wraps would give you more flavor.On the flip side more power gives you more vapor and more flavor.  Usually this is done with lower ohm builds fewer wraps and lower gauge wire.If you have a device that can push the power through that coil Id say that it is fine.  If not I would recommend dropping the gauge to  or lower and keeping about the same number of wraps.,Vaping,cxvqqaz,1,t5_2rg4n

Your mod will have a lowest limit that it will fire at for resistance so Id go with a . or a . most mods wont fire below that unless they are the higher tech mods you wont need a high tech one to start out. Higher resistance drains your battery faster seeing as you generally have more wire to heat up than a lower resistance coil. Itll heat up slower. The problem with lower resistance coils is they are tougher to fine tune your wattage but not hard to do at all by any means. Just start around watts and work upwards until you find a sweet spot.,Vaping,cy5ntsy,1,t5_2rg4n

What we ended up doing was she would have her Ciggie and do a little vaping in the morning too... And slowly she would vape more and Ciggie less until she ended up starting her morning with a vape first and a bit of ciggie after if she still needed it. Her last day was Sunday.

However you can cloud chase go for flavor crazy coils high power setups theres conventions and even cloud competitions for vaping.gtAnyone can go out and buy a  vape and chuck clouds but people who actually enjoy their cars spend thousands. Its not something that you just go pickup. This is relative because you can spend any amount on a car or a vape and be just as passionate about either one. You can love vaping with a  istick just as you can love cars with a   yearold Honda. You could also vape causally on a  mod just like you can own a  Challenger and just use it for getting groceries and taking your kids to school.gtTheres so much more to cars that the majority of people dont understand because its just an appliance to them. You could say the same about vaping though. Theres a pretty big science behind it when you get into the electrical of it beyond swapping prebuilt coilheads on a tank.gtAnd for most vapers and some point theyre trying to quit all together. Youll always have to drive a car for now so its personal. Good on them for quiting but many of them arent trying to quit they just liked the cleaner alternative.

Now the good juices use the best they can source and for me  thats wizard labs nic  and their pg essentials depot for the best vg period  and mostly capella FA FW  TFA flavorings.  But in the end  the flavor combinations matter and if I can taste the pg coming through.  So those companies that youve never heard of also source quality ingredients and have a good flavor profile per juice which is why you are seeing those results.   Copper Creek Ejuice is my example of this.   She makes some of the best spot on flavors Ive ever experienced.  We juice makers basically use similar sources  thats all Im saying.

6401855,0,t1_czhb96x,I stepped up big from my pen vape to my current mod. If money is an issue and it seems it is Id suggest something like the subbox kit. It is sorta the go to around here. I like the fuchai with Uwell Crown or Herakles Plus. Give you a ton of room to move further but not so much on the mouth to lung.

Im definitely disappointed that I feel I wasted my money on what I bought though. I bought it locally and what I have now is what the store owner recommended Im just disappointed with the product. It hurts like hell when it spits hot juice in my mouth. Since Ive had the product and researched it more it seems it has other potential issues as well. I usually vape all day so Im looking for something fairly easy to use. I basically use it to replace cigarettes and until today it has.

Now i do like with the subtank  raise the cotton up put the chamber cut the cotton slightly above the chambers height then push gently the cotton down. You want to make a wall at the exit of the juice conduits so the liquid has to pass through cotton if it wants to leak.Also be sure to . Close airflows. Remove the top cap. Fill with juice. Replace the top cap. Put the tank with the drip tip facing downward. Open airflows. Put the tank upwardI used to lose half my tank when filling now i only got  or  drops and it is my first build using this wicking method.

You can buy a coil wrapper like the coil master V to make it easier. I picked up a knockoff at a BampM for  a while ago and it does make it fast and easy. I didnt recommend that before because  everybody seems to have the idea that wrapping your own coils needs to be a big investment when for along time I just wrapped mine with whatever I had lying around.If youre looking for straight power and no temperature control then maybe look at something like an istick w.

Possible it could be coil related but I would doubt it.  Did you quit smoking?  Sore throats are a common side effect of quitting usually after a few days to a week of quitting your body starts to clear mucus out of your system that it built up to protect itself and will cause a sore throat and you might cough some stuff up for a while.

6965140,0,t1_d15t77b,Yes! I just got it yesterday in the mail. It has the perfect weight and feel to it. I switch hands and also use my thumb or my index finger to fire it. Its comfortable no matter how I use it. I use it on the power setting and so far it fires very consistently. Ive seen on some reviews that they say the door is loose and wonky but as of right now it stays in pretty well. The only con I can say about it is that it has this rubbery matte finish on it. I have hands that are pretty much always sweaty so the mod always looks like it has wetness on it. It comes with a cover so I think Im going to try that out and see if that helps.

Simply because if its off to one side the coil is going to be a lot closer to the corner? edge of the juice well which might cause a short. But you have to be able to thread your cotton in and tuck it under that little space youve given yourself having it off centered. The  post design is kind of fool proof given both the positive and negative posts are going to centre the build automatically almost where as with a  post design you have to manually do that..    Try tightening your positive post with the coil closest to the positive post and leave a little slack on your negative. Before tightening the negative give it a push to the centre youll bend them into place that way. ,Vaping,d1dii97,2,t5_2rg4n

I defended the position that I am a non smoker and therefore would rather not stand in the vicinity where passive smoking would be an issue.  I was told it didnt matter if I was an ecig user I would have to stand with the smokers.  I dont want to use mine indoors etc I just dont want to be forced into a smoke filled area.  I chose to stop smoking and yet they want to put me in harms way each time I want to vape.

Its personal preference based on personal taste. Some vapes dont work well with high vg because of viscosity. Some people prefer higher pg for a stronger throat hit.

7108876,0,t1_d1m3w7q,I liked it a lot. Used it on the Koopor Plus and the RX and it was great. the dual coil claptons were awesome. The  coil was also a lot of fun but found I couldnt really chain vape it because it couldnt wick fast enough. As far underpowered hits goes  sometimes I would accidentally open the top air flow on the drip tip. I also found that the coils had really random life spans. a couple lasted only  days others  weeks. Theres quite a few other things that could contribute to your issues. PGVG ratios Higher VG will give off bigger clouds but wicks slower. Corrosiongunk on the  pin the batteries or the mods battery connectors Im sure theres a better phrase for that but it escapes me right now. The batteries youre using may be going out if youve had them a good amount of time. Ive also read that the TFV has a slightly longer  pin on it that while I didnt have any issues because of it it seems a lot of people have with the RX and might be an issue with the Snow Wolf too.

The rebuildable portion on the TFRTA is worlds better than on the TFV. They keep a lot of features from the parent tank yet at the same time have made improvements so if you build on it it will perform more similarly to the Griffin or Aromamizer Supreme. Just my  cents... if you already have the TFV use it when youre on the go or when your RTA needs rewicking and you cant stop to fuss with anything. If your back up tank acts up just swap out a premade coil on the spot and move on with your day a craving free and satisfied vaper.,Vaping,d1x2z5q,1,t5_2rg4n

For quite a while. I usually let mine sit over night so I do it at bed time.Then start vaping on it at about  watts.Over the next day or two ramp it up to your desired wattage.It is ceramic so it takes longer for it to saturate.

7687992,0,t3_4kmgxo,It gets slightly complicated with a mech. Your voltage is fixed so the only variable you can change that affect power output is the resistance of the coil. If you build high resistance high mass really big fat ones with lots of wire then youre never going to get a pleasant vape. The trick with mech mods is balancing mass of the coil and its resistance. Basically if you want to build high resistance on a mech then the mass of the coils has to be quite low as well otherwise it will take forever to ramp up to a temp high enough to vape well. Mech tubes are cheap though... Pick one up and experiment. ,Vaping,d3g2r7s,1,t5_2rg4n

Far as coils go I started out with Claptons which are good but ramp slower to tiger which ramp quick.tbo Im liking the tigers more for flavor.also have tried a few different gauges but imo I dont notice a difference in better or less flavor with different sizes . For me what wattage is most important so if I have a single Clapton five wrap at . ohms I fire it  watts or the tiger I like to run dual gauge wrap . ohms a little higher at watts.

8652888,0,t1_d6n69j3,Hmm other than cutting off oxygen to your brain from inhaling vapor time to time amp making your breathing shift.. Not really. I mean you could be allergic to certain propotions of VG and PG depends on your body yet it varies from person to person. Yet you would just be inhaling flavoured steam which i personally dont see the problem of it just dont be ambitious thinking nicotine will aide your journey.As for as steam rooms go I think it might be worse for weight loss. Youre just sweating which doesnt equal calorie loss. Nice skin and relaxation is a plus side of being in a hot moisture rich room though.

8782991,0,t3_50evju,The eVic VTwo Mini goes up to W. The UWell Crowns lowest resistance coil is the . ohm Ni for temperature control. Running that at the max of W gives a current draw of .A. Since its running in temperature control it will probably never continuously draw the full amount of amps.Lets say you only use it with the wattage coils. The lowest resistance wattage coil for the Crown is a . ohm coil. Running that coil at the full W only draws .A.You may ask where Im pulling these magical numbers from. Please acquaint yourself with this fine tool Steam Engines Ohms Law It can help you stay within the safe limits of any battery you end up using.The Crowns recommended battery discharge current is if you run the Ni coil on a high power mod at like F that pushes over W continuously or the . ohm coil at anything above W both of which causes the battery to discharge over A. Apply that to the VTwo Minis recommendation of gtA and we get anything over W continuously with the Ni coil and anything over W in wattage mode with the . ohm coil.To answer your question the current rating for batteries is the max safe discharge current. Running a true A battery on a setup that pulls A is perfectly safe. Conversely running a A battery on a A setup is dangerous and could lead to battery venting or at worst thermal runaway.As for battery recommendation given your setup I dont think youd need to worry too much about exceeding the current rating on a A battery so I think a Samsung Q or the quintessential LG HG both mAh would work perfectly fine for you. Buy from a reputable seller like Illumn or IMR Batteries to ensure you dont end up with counterfeits or rewraps that are rated for lower discharge currents.tldr  Yes using a A battery is safer than a A in almost all situations as the rating is the batterys max safe discharge current. Do you need it? Probably not. The LG HG A mAh should work perfectly fine for your setup. This all changes if you keep the Crown but upgrade to a more powerful mod. In that case read the entire comment.,Vaping,d73jnos,5,t5_2rg4n

What I think it was though is during the priming or whatever I made sure to really do the small holes in the coil well and make sure they were filled as well as the larger one.  When the guy at the shop did it for me he only put like  drops in the small ones.

And if someone does get vapor around them because of me I immediately apologize. Most people will see that you are actively trying to away from others and will respect that.

9001158,0,t3_53if7h,I started out on the TFV that was not a new vaper friendly to the lungs hit dont get me wrong super smooth amazing flavor all the cloud I could want and absolutely no spit back. But my lord it made me cough so bad. My wife got the Cleito and loves it. She did have some spit back issues but once she adjusted her watts to  the issues completely resolved themselves. So I went and got one for myself and I LOVE the Cleito. Great smooth hit flavor is excellent no TVF but then again that is gonna be hard to beat unless you are dripping IMO. I run mine at  watts. Have not had any leaking issues. No spit back issues except for when I refill my tank but the spit back is very very very minimal spit back and even then it is only for a few hits. A lot of people have issues with leaking but what I have come to learn about the people that are is that they are either loosening the coil when they are refilling they have the air flow completely open or they have upgraded to the ML tank they make for it it just does not fit as snug around the bottom O Ring. Over all I highly recommend the Cleito just dont upgrade to the bigger tank. I go through about ML a week vaping on this. So about  bucks a week in juice compared to the  a week I was spending on smokes had this for  weeks vape it daily every chance I get and finally just had to change a coil yesterday. Give it a shot I do not think that you will be disappointed.,Vaping,d7tssrf,1,t5_2rg4n

He said you SHOULDNT DO IT since those batteries arent usually designed to be charged at over  Amp.Think of it this way if you had a FIFTY AMP charger do you think you could ultra fast charge them in two seconds with it? Hint nope theyd probably blow on your face.So to be clear you SHOULDNT charge  batteries at over Amp. No they probably wont blow up theyll just die faster on you BUT and heres the thing theres not some kind of guarantee that they WONT blow up on you.So to be  safe dont do it.

9682972,0,t3_5dqjjw,Nobody really knows the long term effects. Ive been vaping for around  months now and I havent noticed any immediate effects. Honestly I feel like I have a higher lung capacity. The ingredients in vaping VG PG Nic and flavoring have all been studied and the only harmful thing is the nicotine. VG and PG are both metabolized into harmless stuff and flavoring is well flavoring. Edit Cigs have nearly  different ingredients from the pesticides used in growing tobacco and all the stuff in the filters and what not. Vaporizers can have a lot depending on how you mix your juice. But only  come to mind. VG PG Nic Flavor and Caffeine. so chances are the cancercausing ingredients in cigs arent in your ejuice.this is just imo from my experience and research.,Vaping,da6mpmn,3,t5_2rg4n

10109456,0,t1_dbp98q5,True. But the technology will probably improve very rapidly. They already have computer chip prototypes that can wirelessly charge from the energy contained in a WiFi signal. It also wouldnt have to be  s it could be done with battery cells specially made for the vape. with my phone it takes  hour  min to charge the battery from dead to something like mah with a cable and with the wireless charger its  hours  minutes.. From the same power source you can charge  s from around  which is when my vape dies to  mah in about  hour  minutes them  minutes of a trickle charge.. Im not sure exactly how the math breaks down here but that should mean that  wirelessly charging s could potentially charge in about the same time as the wirelessly charged phone  hours or so. I have a feeling that as the vaping industry grows and evolves there may come a point where s just dont cut it though and some sort of specialized batterycapacitor will be used instead. ,Vaping,dbp9tws,5,t5_2rg4n

If the tank you got does not give the clouds your looking for the Cleito and TFV do a great job. For me I have used my vape in the same habitual manner I did smoking. In the morning coffee and a vape. If I eat I would have a few puffs just like when I was smoking. I found this to help replace the smokes easy. Up the nic gear that replicates the smoke clouds and replace the cig habits with the vape. Thats just my take on it so far Ive been quit for  months after  years.

Nicotine has become a choice for me now. I wouldnt worry about it just keep dropping your nic slowly down to mg then mg then .mg over the next  months or whatever. Nicotine is effectively non carcinogenic and non harmful in moderated low doses. You wont do any more damage by vaping nicd liquid than you will vaping mg so take your time dropping back to ensure your brain adjusts.,Vaping,dcm152t,3,t5_2rg4n

Im just trying to get across that as long as you know what youre doing and you know your batteries you can build low for a daily driver without coming to harm.

When you know everything is safe and are aware and in control of what you are using it is a much more positive experience  just remember that as long as you practice safe usage and have the knowledge you will be safe! Im actually pretty sure SS may be a great harm reducer as far as compared to kanthal which the ingredients are slightly odd imo and SS is... well its steel.

Its likely not that dangerous but you are inhaling chemicals that you normally wouldnt. Theres also small amounts of burnt cotton and probably fumes from metal and by products used in that metal production. The mileage could vary greatly depending on what is used and how its used.

So when in a shop you would tell them the flavor nicotine strength and bottle size. Mod is a term for the box part of your set up. Holds the batteries chipset fire button etc.The Atomizer aka Atty is the term for the top part of your set up where the vapor comes from. There are many different types of attys.

11440248,0,t1_dfspolp,Ah okay. I absolutely agree that vaping is  better than smoking cigarettes and is a great method for quitting smoking. If ecigs allowed you to ditch cigs then that is fantastic because of how damaging cigs are. I was arguing that inhaling anything is not going to be better than not smoking and ecigs are so young that there have been few studies on their effect on the lungs so they cant be claimed to be  healthy. So while they are much more healthy than cigs that doesnt mean they are harmless.Anyways In the case of OP I feel like its a bad idea to reintroduce his nicotine addiction to vape when hes already quit smoking. Fueling his nicotine addiction with ecigs could even lead to him picking up cigs again.,Vaping,dfsqpea,4,t5_2rg4n

11478152,0,t1_dfwizjw,First off you wont find a vape that will work for eliquid and dry herb. At the very least you would need a seperate atomizer that works for dry herb. I dont know any brands but the better ones work by convection rather than just conduction. The conduction attys just burn the bottom and leave the top of the bud unvaped. If you are into concentrates you can get a special atty for dabsrwaxpen is a good resource as is rvaporents. If you want to put a little work in you can make eliquid with thc in it that would work with any tank. The best ones are made from concentrate but you could make a fairly strong juice just from bud.Moving on vape shops in NYC are absurdly overpriced. I live maybe  mins away from nyc and the vape shops by me are much cheaperthough still quite expensive compared to ordering online. Assuming you dont care about overpaying anything by vaporesso ijoy pioneerforyou and asmodus will work great. People on this sub love smok and wismec but they are often of poor quality in my personal experience. Decide how powerful you want it. I almost never need above  watts even though my mod can go to . Next decide internal or external battery. Internal batteries are handy and can be charged via usb port but once theyre shot you need a new mod. External batteries ideally need a seperate charger its possible to use usb to charge them through the mod but will ruin the batteries much quicker than an external charger. However you can replace batteries without needing a new mod have a second set ready while one is charging and generally get better battery life if you get good batteries. Ok the next issue is size. Do you want big or small? Is this a pocket vape or one for home? That sort of thing. I like somewhere in the middle where its big enough for  batteries but small enough to carry around. Finally do you want a kit or to buy the components seperately. Kits usually have everything you need besides batteriesinternal battery mods do come with battery obviously and juice but you are limited to whatever the kit comes with. Buying a mod and atomizer seperate lets you decide on an atomizer and mod combo that you like but requires more knowledgeresearch.Ultimately its up to you. I think the vaporesso tarot pro or tarot nano if you want small the pioneerforyou ipv or eleaf istick pico are a great place to start. If you want to use for cannabisoil youll need to buy a seperate atomizer at the very least ask rvaporents for recommendations unless you are making ejuice with thc in it. If you have any questions feel free to ask me   ,Vaping,dfx1mdg,1,t5_2rg4n
