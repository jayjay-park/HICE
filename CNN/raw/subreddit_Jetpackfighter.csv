7370334,0,t3_4fss9l,Hi there!Sorry for the delayed reply. I havent checked the subreddit this weekend so thats my bad.The plan is still to have the Android beta out by the end of this week! We want all players to have access to the game and JPF promotions like the Nemesis skin Smosh Games voice packs etcetera. Were also submitting an update this week so it may be tight but you guys have been so patient and waited a long time to play so youre our first priority! I cant thank you enough for your understanding and support for JPF. It really means a lot to us!,Jetpackfighter,d2fyfer,17,t5_394v2
