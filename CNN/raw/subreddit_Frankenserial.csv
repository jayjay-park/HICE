7142697,0,t1_d1px6df,gt Hah. I think you literally just witnessed me being a bit of a dickWhat because youre quoting something I edited out? Thats not a dick move. I had several moments during which I reconsidered my post before I edited it  I knew you might have already seen it and started your reply. Thats fine with me. Youre keeping me honest. For posterity I want my edited comment to stand. But between you and me and now anyone else who wants to do some basic guessing my original less filtered expression is up for consumption. I dont want to take it back but I definitely found a better way to say what I wanted to say.,Frankenserial,d1q1rm8,3,t5_3bkgh

7321595,0,t1_d20byh5,I havent been keeping up all that much lately either due to lots of doc releases for Making A Murderer so I have a few questionsDo you mean the newest PCR transcripts got released or the prior one? What in your opinion in the police docs is the most damning evidence against Adnan that wasnt presented in Serial? Thanks in advance! ,Frankenserial,d2aey8m,1,t5_3bkgh

7375415,0,t3_4fyji1,Let me put my mod hat on for a moment  I dont think weve ever addressed this publicly yet so we should clarify our position on socks.  I think to some it may seem contradictory.  While normally we might use these terms interchangeably there is a difference between socks and altsUsing socks to break reddit is a violation of sitewide rules.  Obviously vote manipulation will get you shadowbanned by the Admins.  But even using a sock to respond to your own posts as a way to give your post credibility and attention it otherwise would not have is also against Reddit policy.  So just dont do it.  Like any other sub we take a hard line against the use of socks.  The use of alts or alternate accounts is NOT against Reddit policy.  There are plenty of good reasons for people to do this.  Many Serial fans keep a separate account for when they participate in nonSerial forums.  There is nothing wrong with that.  We even encourage coming in costume here.  Just be mindful to not vote on the same postcomment twice.  If you post under an alt do what you can to avoid participating in the conversation from the other account.  ,Frankenserial,d2gj7jt,1,t5_3bkgh
7604115,0,t3_4jevwl,It always amazes me but there have been many documented cases of those who have been kidnapped not leaving their captors even when they had the chance to do so. I suppose that is what conquering the will of another individual produces.,Frankenserial,d36jr7n,0,t5_3bkgh
