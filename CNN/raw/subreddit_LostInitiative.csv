9504616,0,t1_d9kmqas,For sure! Im confident the more Daelric is in front of a camera and doing this live the more comfortable hell get. I used to be particularly bad with um when I first started too. Saying um or ah or uh is an easy catch to keep your mind on target when youre new to this sort of thing! Will pass this info forward!,LostInitiative,d9kna4q,5,t5_3h8rn
9532052,0,t3_5azjrf,Two minor suggestions  When you guys introduced your characters there was a lot of empty space next to the character portraits  you can fill that space with known stats character name race equipment etc. Would make the portrait shots a lot more informative. It would also be useful to then show these portraits again at the beginning of the streams and perhaps after the breaks too so viewers just tuning can get up to speed on the characters.Thanks for the effort you all put in Lost Initiative has been super enjoyable so far! ,LostInitiative,d9o0xja,1,t5_3h8rn

11103552,0,t3_5yh30h,Would Daelric be interested in releasing a YouTube tutorial series on how to prepare and run a DampD campaign? Ive never played before but would love to organize a short game with a few friends. Also are there any Lovecraftian or horrorscifi DampD variants that youve enjoyed? ,LostInitiative,deqktm7,2,t5_3h8rn
