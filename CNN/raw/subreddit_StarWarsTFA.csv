5991298,0,t3_3xigh2,how do people figure out rey was at lukes academy previously? is it from the vision she had when she touched the light saber. To me that scene was moving too quickly for me to register everything when i watched on the cinema!,StarWarsTFA,cy4znlj,1,t5_34f1g
6009610,0,t1_cy5i05p,We also saw Rey resist Rens mind control... let alone wasnt even able to pull a lightsaber out of the snow...,StarWarsTFA,cy7e2zc,1,t5_34f1g
6031356,0,t3_3y3n5g, Maybe they were still making a round for the next series of attacks?   I dont know how Finn kept up with Ren at all honestly stormtrooper melee training is doubtful to hang with someone trained by a Jedi in lightsaber combat but since he didnt just go ahead and force stasis him maybe he was just relishing what he viewed as an inevitable victory. Rey maymay not have repressed training we dont know about but since we cant operate off that assumption we have a dark Jedi that abandoned his training taking on someone who has been fighting with a weapon her entire life to survive on Jakku. And yeah he took a blast to the gut. Our mistake may be considering Ren as some sort of Vader equivalent but just because he can terrify everyone with his lightsaber skills and force powers doesnt mean hes prepared for someone else that also has melee experience and force powers. A college basketball player is going to embarrass me but when he goes against Michael Jordan hes gonna have a rough time.  Perhaps Rey is just that gifted for reasons we may understand later. Well they didnt abandon Yavin  in New Hope either. A mass evacuation may have just been unfeasible although everyone got the hell out of Hoth quickly enough. Perhaps it was another last stand situation where if they lost that planet they lost anyway.,StarWarsTFA,cya88d7,4,t5_34f1g

6046247,0,t1_cyc0vvw,Does he like the OT?  Does he simply just not like Star Wars?  If you never watched nor cared for Star Wars previously I would say that TFA would be a tough place to start.  I loved it  have seen it numerous times and cant wait to own a Blu Ray copy all my own to enjoy as often as I see fit.. BUT  it fits into a groove that is created completely by the OT.  If you do not prefer Star Wars I do not see this film as something that will change your mind.  Maybe.  But not likely.  I will say that the acting and emotional character arcs in this are so far better than maybe every movie previous besides Empire and it could be the element to swing someone to be a fan.  All that being said  My girlfriend had ZERO interest in Star Wars up until last week after I took her to see it and now she is genuinely interested.  She loved Reys story that was her hook into the Star Wars world.,StarWarsTFA,cyc63d3,1,t5_34f1g
6128640,0,t1_cylc7sg,Yes though I got the impression he was happy to take a side role rather than leading directly. There werent really any clear leaders in the film now that Hans gone but I think if theres going to be one Group Leader theyve all got a good shot at it. Reys going to be the new captain of the Falcon Finns the best at groundbased fighting and Poes the best pilot though Reys not too bad either. They all have their areas where they can take charge.,StarWarsTFA,cym9gy5,1,t5_34f1g
6135286,0,t3_3zj5so,Ive wondered that or the more obvious possibility that Rey is Lukes daughter and is growing up under similar circumstances.,StarWarsTFA,cyn0n0a,1,t5_34f1g
