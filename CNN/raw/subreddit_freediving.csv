656914,0,t3_21o5tf,The buoys with a net in the middle of the donut are handy for keeping your bits and pieces in when out on the water. You want something that works well and is totally reliable. Something which is a bit dodgy will be a pain and will stress you out which is no good when you are trying to stay relaxed. well spent on something proper I reckon.,freediving,cgexvr0,1,t5_2s78j

1570343,0,t1_cjcx49k,Im gonna piggyback on this since I dont want to start a whole new thread  Im cm but I have the limb lengths of a normal cm man. I weigh kg and am quite lean. I am definitely a sprinter and before grad school I was a competing powerlifter Class I singleply by USPA strength standards  for reference Class II is the cutoff to qualify for nationals. No hip knee or ankle injuries no contraindications for diving. Mental disposition...? Im a crazy person who thinks putting lbs on his back is a fun Saturday morning.For now Im using the same fins I use for SCUBA  Mares Avanti Xs. My backup mask is a lowvolume frameless type so I can definitely use that for freediving. When I go to take a freediving class would I be better served by getting another pair of fins or can I make do with my current fins for a little while?,freediving,cjd46se,0,t5_2s78j
1574737,0,t1_cjdna4d,But its such a common sentiment! It took me a month to convince a friend of mine that he was slow as shit with standard scuba finds and those would make him slower.

That was certainly an interesting read I did not realize it was so common.The technique is called Frenzel Manoeuvre more accurately from not using air its not using any air from your lungsthus reducing your breath hold capacity.

6350855,0,t3_42n04y,I actually just brought mine on as a carryon. I keep them in their original plastic bag which keeps the thickness down. Because theyre quite thin they fit right on top of all the luggage in a full bin. I always politely ask the flight attendants if they would mind me doing so.

7874140,0,t1_d411uef,I was with a buddy. If I had to use a dive center Id probably stick with Apneista. I have a friend working there as instructor and I know the owner is a pretty nice guy.Ive arrived in the end of rain season end of February and there was too much current every time weve tried deeper diving in Amed. So we ended up doing shallow dives there most of the time on the first bouy  m and went to Tulamben on weekends. At least I went for a  there once so it wasnt a complete waste of time.I was told that the currents were anomally strong this year but I guess its probably ok by now. Also lots of trash was gathering in Jemeluk especially after it rained. Sometimes it was literally covered with plastic bags and garbage was floating up to  meters below surface.Tulamben had some currents too but not that often. And almost no floating trash.,freediving,d414jjb,1,t5_2s78j

8743857,0,t3_4zsix5,I train in a pool once a week. Lately the routine has been that we always start with a table before doing anything else as a warmup. It goes as follows.Jump in the water by the poolside.Breathe for two minutes.Swim one length of the pool.Breathe for  secs.Swim one length.Breathe for  secs.Keep going like this reducing the surface time by  secs every length swum until you hit  seconds surface time. On the  sec breather you exhale as you surface breath in once over  secs and then swim back. Then you are done.I like it as a warmup.,freediving,d6ymvlo,2,t5_2s78j
