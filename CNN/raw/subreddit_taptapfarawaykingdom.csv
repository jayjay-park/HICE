I have  accessories left to buy the ones which affect autotapper.    My spirits are maxed.    To reach  meters I can do it with  medals or  medals it doesnt really matter it will affect the amount of tickets needed by  at max.  Ive done it with  tickets with  medals and Ive done it with  tickets with  medals.  No matter what your damage is you can not exceed meters per ticket once you have reached monsters which take more than  seconds to kill.  That usually happens after  visits for me.  I reach meters during the th ticket so I have  tickets left after reaching it.  By that point I have obtained Fury Mode enough times for all three quests I have traveled enough distance for two quests and I have killed enough monsters for all three quests  monsters.  After the first  visits Im almost at meters.  You should never get under meters per ticket.  Assuming meters per visit thats  visits total to get to .    Heres my equipment that I use on a normal basis I dont switch for Conquest  Head  Crit Chance . || Crit Mult  || Tap DMG   Weap  Tap DMG  || Merc DPS  || Crit Chance .
