9521327,0,t1_d9mpcwe,Thedonald built their subreddit from the ground up. They didnt take an existing subreddit which used to be a default of over  million people and start manipulating it. Also CTR are paid shills while Thedonald doesnt appear to be paid by the Trump campaign. I hate both subreddits but you are lying if you cant see the differences.,IDontLikeRPolitics,d9mpew6,32,t5_3hdxb
9522451,0,t1_d9mu7iq,thanks. now if we take a look at that link it was one guy throwing a tantrum with the comments mostly saying what a shit postidea it is. i fail to see how this is evidence that rthedonald is a racist subreddit.and further into context... this was from the hilarious meatball vs spraytan meme war.and that mods idea of removing the racism rule wasnt to allow racism... it was a way to blanket ban users of reuropean. maybe actually read the post?,IDontLikeRPolitics,d9mue9x,11,t5_3hdxb

9523326,0,t1_d9mxotu,Delusional about what?  Im voting for Johnson btw registered independent and supported Webb before he withdrew.So tell me Im delusional because I dont support your worldview?   But Im a typical moron voter right?  Therefore the only reason your particular opinions dont prevail is because others are stupid.That is the essence of delusional.,IDontLikeRPolitics,d9my9xy,6,t5_3hdxb
9523388,0,t1_d9mxykf,Oh my bad I though racism was saying person x is y because the color of their skin is z.Also I cant prove its not bullshit and you cant prove it is but it definitely doesnt describe every trump supporter. Which is why I replied to him in the first place. They dont represent the trump voters as a whole just like you dont represent all of hillarys voters.,IDontLikeRPolitics,d9myjtm,4,t5_3hdxb

9524545,0,t1_d9mv27c,Oh man I cant wait for election night. My prediction is that rall is going to be nothing but threads from brand new subs named FUCKHILLARY and RIGGEDELECTION. The posts will have  up votes and  comments. ,IDontLikeRPolitics,d9n3oaq,22,t5_3hdxb

9525914,0,t1_d9mvtiu,The people that dont like trump were always in rpolitics.  They just also disliked clinton too and had the attitude of Well I dont like her but I have to vote for her to defeat trump.Whereas in the past couple of months that attitude has become Clinton is a super qualified and highly experienced candidate who I fully trust to at least try to do everything she says and Im super excited for her presidency.  Despite being the nd most unpopular candidate in US history and the aforementioned opinion being the most uncommon opinion found amongst millenials.  Id be surprised if they really were paid shills though.  I think theyre just plain ol clinton supporters that somehow got into moderator positions to take over the subreddit.  They started enacting biased rules that pissed off all the majority of normal human beings on reddit who left rpolitics leaving only the Clinton supporters.  Much more likely than an army of paid shills.  If they were paid shills they need to be fired because theyre fucking bad at convincing people of anything.Im quite confident that if you took a poll of all of Reddit youd find most of the people here are not Trump supporters and are not Clinton supporters either.  But if you took a poll of just rpolitics youd find most of the recent regular posters are excited Clinton supporters.,IDontLikeRPolitics,d9n9qow,2,t5_3hdxb
