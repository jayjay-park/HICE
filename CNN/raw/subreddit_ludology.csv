77140,0,t1_cen5pnp,I think youre wrong about just about everything you said but the most diplomatic response here would be that my talk is not for you at all.,ludology,cen7lv3,0,t5_2s9y2
441158,0,t1_cfqgf7n,Thank you for the detailed comment.So I have seen a lot of negativity especially since Ive been sticking up for it. Interesting you mention Super Hexagon. Terry Cavanagh has been one of Dong Nguyens biggest cheerleaders. Check out his Maverick Bird from Flappy Jam. But I think you nailed it with anyone being honest with themselves can declare it an objectively bad game. I think most people arent stopping to reason about. Ive seen that most people dont distinguish between a Candy Crush type game and Flappy Bird which means they arent thinking about it.As for addicting I have some other thoughts about that. Im wondering if its all relative and if people are overblowing the time they spend on it. For example you can spend  hours on Super Metroid  hours on GTA hundreds of hours on World of Warcraft and monthsyears on cow clicking games which are time destroying as they make you think about the game when you arent playing them. If a person spent  hours on Flappy Bird or even  did Flappy Bird get unfairly maligned for addictiveness? Or consider if I spent that much time on Moon Patrol would there still be the same kind of outrage?I also agree there are a lot of different interesting stories about Flappy Bird. I did this one because it was the least talked about in the media and most of them were very negative on the game. You saw only a few headlines in my video.,ludology,cfqhoe8,3,t5_2s9y2
1544688,0,t1_cj9wcm2,Good points.  So  as a game designer  should effort and focus be placed on the top percentile of players  or a wider base of casuals? From a strictly business standpoint I kinda see how support for casuals rears is head when player populations  paycheck.  eg WoW welfare epics  achievements for basic actions  etc ,ludology,cj9wezs,1,t5_2s9y2

2447377,0,t3_2nil5n,On second though as a denizen of rludology I think the most responsible thing I could say to you is do not make an RPG. The genres staple mechanics are fundamentally antithetical to strategic confrontation of interesting challenges and they make it effectively impossible to balance the difficulty of the game.An RPG is a game centered around character development choices that must be rendered meaningless to preserve the difficulty and spontaneity of the experience. How can a player make meaningful choices on where to assign their skill points if without knowing whats going to happen to them five hours in advance? For new players its a straight up fuck you for not having already finished the game for repeat players its hah hah now youve memorized the game its going to so easy that winning will grant you know satisfaction at all. And how are you supposed to balance the difficulty of the game without nullifying the result of a skill increase thus negating the players choice?If you want to make a game with character development without ending up with completely broken gameplay youre going to have to introduce a lot of very clever innovations. But yeah Id love to see you do it and I think a setting where player characters live and die as instruments to a larger overarching story is a good place to start work.,ludology,cme77x8,2,t5_2s9y2
3084543,0,t1_cohkqie,No this works no matter what outer location the second player selects. Its a lot more obvious when explained visually which I cant do at the moment as I am on mobile. ,ludology,cohpmez,2,t5_2s9y2
3311620,0,t3_2y0vev,I think your use of the word need is misleading. Strictly speaking we dont need any specific game. Now can the market bear it? I think so. Its been a while most of the college kids have graduated and a new batch have moved in so I think they can afford to at least dip a toe in the water and see how it goes. I doubt well have the same oversaturation issue we had last time thankfully.And honestly Id rather see DDR make a return than Rock Band.,ludology,cp5r3er,7,t5_2s9y2

3354774,0,t3_2ylalh,Well there are many types of power fantasies.  People consider the average implementation in games and film to be sexist because the protagonists are all male and female characters are delegated to support roles or merely serve to underscore the sexuality of the protagonists.However this is not ubiquitous in power fantasies and it is also possible to design power fantasies in which sex is irrelevant.  The first  Alien films stand out as an example of this and first person games such as Metroid Prime are game equivalents entirely eschewing the protagonists sexuality from the first person perspective.A power fantasy is fundamentally just a relatable character that is able to transgress average human limitations to survive or even thrive in a hostile environment.  Indeed Alien is the inspiration for a lot of videogames that would be considered power fantasies notably Doom.I think that creating prosocial power fantasies could be feasible.  It would require accessible characters that the player can project into role playing games such as the Elder Scrolls series already offer this and then it would confront the characters with behavioral and moral dilemmas in a context designed to cause the player to associate success with confidence.  Finding a gameplay genre and medium to obfuscate this in would be tricky but RPGs seem well suited.Off the top of my head I think a game with mechanisms similar to Pokemon that promoted cooperation leadership and interdisciplinary respect could train people to work together while appreciating their own skills and give them the confidence to take leadership in fields that they are skilled in while also respecting the authority of people in fields that they are poorly developed in.Of course publishing a game like this would be a nightmare because it would have to deviate from several norms and could be mistook for edutainment which has done notoriously poorly.  Hiding these qualities deep within the gameplay would be necessary which would be a creative challenge indeed.,ludology,cpao3ce,4,t5_2s9y2
3637577,0,t1_cp4k1r6,yeah id have to agree with you but one thing comes to mind if this new layout and game mechanic isnt as good as the one before it then it will simply become frustrating. if you have two sides to a game and one side isnt played then your game isnt being played at all. this is especcially true in asymetrical hard asymmetry like big commander vs four little men games. the execution with this feature relies on everything else falling perfectly and pristinely into place. but it sounds like it could have huge potential if done right.,ludology,cq6wt68,1,t5_2s9y2
4297665,0,t1_csa0hr4,I agree with you that if this was a multiplayer game it would surely collapse upon to itself. The concept would work on a much smaller scale one village one colony to make it manageable for a development team. And the village could semirandomized with sets of villagers set of villages set of environments.But I disagree the main objective does not have to be about the doing same job over and over again. Instead the job could be just be really a class that opens options and objectives for the player.I.E. Priests job would not just be about giving sermons and the like. There could be events like converting natives debating with your fellow priests sending letters back to the Church for funding. Indeed jobs could only be boring as the game designer makes it. As for economics? I think would not be the focus of the game. The economics would mostly be basic script and formulas. ,ludology,csa2j4r,2,t5_2s9y2

6602204,0,t3_45kmyt,Hmm. So two errors youre saying game often make Letting you make random guesses rather than making you think through the decision. Putting you on the spot rather than letting you decide for yourself when youve made the deduction.An unspoken part of this I think is the games are trying to give a sense of progression. The two games you gave as good examples what they have in common is the unrestricted access to a large quantity of information. Any feeling of progression comes from deciding which information is relevant and why. A lot of the mystery games when they make these mistakes I think it happens when theyre adding their own gates for progression in the game. You have to solve step  before it grants you access to the information for step  that sort of thing. ,ludology,d0280ie,1,t5_2s9y2
6887205,0,t1_d0wje67,gt You cant just state that a story cant be told through game mechanics and it becomes true. Your reply was essentially just the ludologist mantra True but I dont want to write an answers that fits academic standards either. gt  When I first attempted to take an enemy on with Ellie facetoface and was brutally beaten down I thought Of course she cant attack directly shes so weak compared to Joel! And when I saw that she couldnt craft I thought Thats because Joel is a bad ass smuggler and shes just a kid. But you werent told this clearly  youve just drawn connections where it seems to fit. And thats one of the gaps Im talking about. Another would be the players freedom vs. the narrow borders of the story  so even when you were told that she is small so she cant carry that much the player can play her aggressively if she has the skill to do so.gtSurely other people make these connections too?I for myself never think of anything more than oh thats a nice  bad mechanic. I never assume she is a weak girl so she has to sneak. Nor do f.e. my little nephews while playing age appropriate!! games. The only thing where I see a link is the theme but thats not storyrelevant.gt Expression simply means the conveying of feeling and since anything can convey anything within the context of the situationI doubt that. An expression can used as abbreviation yes like if I make this facial expression it means Im cold please close the window. But that means that there has to be some sort of deeper exchange between speaker and listener. But thats not the case in games devs dont negotiate with their audiences what meaning is behind this or that specific mechanic.gt ludic elements can convey story just like interpretive dance can convey a story.I dont think that is possible.gt Please excuse the formatting of this post as Im not very adept at using Reddit quite yet. And please excuse the roughness of my argument but as I said many parts arent written yet only the background reading has been done. This discussion is making me think which is only going to make my dissertation tighter so thank you!No problem. This isnt an academic circle so dont sweat it ... and Im glad to be of any help for you.,ludology,d0wzcp5,1,t5_2s9y2
7369514,0,t3_4g95pp,You know I really didnt care much about second life when it first came out. Everyone had some fucking article on it and how it was greatterribleweirdetc. but I just never gave a shit. Now? Fascinating. The people who remain have made a world that is flatly postmodern. It is a goddamn experience just to see the shit going on in that game. There are whole buildings dedicated to porn memes. Dunkey famously referenced one in his video.EVE. Strong opinions on this game. Never played it. But the people who do play it  may be the most dedicated fanbase ever.,ludology,d2fv2fa,3,t5_2s9y2
8143127,0,t1_d4sbgha,I have only played the start of RE not too long ago and not any others and I had a really odd response to it. A lot about it felt..Off. Like things that belonged in a bad game. But then if Id remove those bad aspects it would suck out all the appeal the game had. Its a great action game I should finish it. I heard it gets some great setpieces later on.The vid above us makes me want to play remake it sounds like a very very clever horror game. ,ludology,d4vfqap,1,t5_2s9y2

8717936,0,t1_d6v8bup,I love it when people act like they know how effective torture is. Read stories of people who have been tortured and realize that when youve been in pain for days you just want it to stop and everything else stops being important.  Sure professionals who have top secret information may have been hard trained at it but thats a very small percentage of population. If the information happens to go into the wrong hands ie. someone whos not as trained you may be able to torture them to get the info out.  Not that Im protorture but Im not a fan of misinformation. The reality is simply that theres simply too little information about torture to definitively assess whether its effective or not.,ludology,d6vdqnq,1,t5_2s9y2

9925939,0,t1_db16ige,I have had quite a few comments about the speed of the talking so that is definitely something I will be working on for future content. The written essay over gameplay is exactly the feel I was going for. I tried my best to show gameplay that was relevant to info but Downwell might not have been a great candidate for a first attempt as it has a pretty tight gameplay loop without any frills  aka most footage looks identical. And as for the the lack of direction I can kind of see that. Ive become quite adjusted to having an editor for my text works so doing this without was a little unusual as it placed the editing work on well...me. Editing is definitely one of my weaker skills and is something I will focus on more heavily to get it up to par with everything else. Thanks a ton for the feedback. It is exactly what I need to know to continue progressing in this field. ,ludology,db1di8e,1,t5_2s9y2
