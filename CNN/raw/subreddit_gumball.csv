6065134,0,t3_3ym19s,Id have to say my favorite bit was Gumball tar and feathering Billie which was topped with Gumball throwing Darwin out of the theater.Good episode overall.,gumball,cyemqsx,2,t5_2sgu4

9344360,0,t3_58fql3,Cool job very well done. Some pointers.Rob looks too smooth to his current appearence.The black on Darwin should be thicker. It seems pretty thin.The rain looks too much like a Season  style.And the lighting on the characters needs some work.Other than that amazing!,gumball,d90gqdj,5,t5_2sgu4
9379604,0,t1_d8tq6zy,well they have to show a little restraint Phow much do you wanna bet that plastic surgery nicole originally had GIANT gazongas considering thats the only part of her thats not got plastic surgery on it yet is the most common kind but the censors were either like nah or they were like we would get in trouble if we did that.still i personally think they could have gotten away with it. nicole is traditionally flat as a board even just adding a hint of bumps would have been a hilarious but subtle joke P,gumball,d94xjnj,1,t5_2sgu4
9436557,0,t3_59s3vw,I have no freaking clue. Its odd because its so against his current characterization. He can usually see right through stuff like that like how he was the only kid on the bus who could see that the criminals were just their parents. And Mr. Robinson made it no secret that he hates them. ,gumball,d9c5e97,6,t5_2sgu4
9455435,0,t3_5a6kur,Oh god theres so many.Besides what other people have recommended here are some suggestionsThe Shell  Loads of great jokes beautiful visuals and great storytelling.The Vision  Political satire at its finest.The Void The Nobody The Nemesis The Bus The Disaster and The Rerun  All are integral to the shows current arc. The later three really prove how great the animation is but it is worth noting that the last two are pretty lacking in comedy with the exception of a few jokes.,gumball,d9ejktv,6,t5_2sgu4

9745113,0,t1_dac6jts,Why not? Everyone else seems to be ignoring how ridiculously dark and violent the episode was from Miss Simian setting up a complaint box in the desert with two skeletons who may or may not be former students of hers who died trying to file a complaint against her next to a rusted mailbox to Bobert annihilating humanity because of how destructive it is though thats pretty much become par for the course for this show.,gumball,daeapro,3,t5_2sgu4
10106177,0,t1_dbmic00,Wait a second...Sporticus wears a blue costume...Gumball is blue...Robbie Rotten is the main villain in Lazytown..Rob is the main villain on TAWOG...Stephanie and Darwin share similar personalities....We all know what this means...TAWOG IS A REINCARNATION OF LAZYTOWN CONFIRMED,gumball,dbouh9e,1,t5_2sgu4
