1764212,0,t1_ck1fsik,OK thats all good to know. Im working on a little Arduino project to fire some MIDI at a keyboard that mostly gets used for B sounds. Ive got it just about sorted but wanted to get the timing right. Maybe Ill add a switch for faster or slower response so the player can have his pick.,hammondorgan,ck1ja8n,2,t5_2ub0n
10632789,0,t3_571nmn,Can you post pics of your chop? We were able to eliminate weight by removing internal speakers and going into a Leslie.  We also went with a trichop.  pieces that stack on each other bottom is ampspower middle is tonewheel top is manuals  all connected by military grade connectors. My buddy did it over the course of  weeks and only got a couple things wrong  he labeled all the wires but   can look super similar depending on your handwriting. After letting loose a few brown notes during a show he spent the next evening fixing it up.Asking for pics to estimate weight. If you havent added much I would assume its close to the stock weight which Blue Book says is lbs.,hammondorgan,ddcowh7,1,t5_2ub0n
