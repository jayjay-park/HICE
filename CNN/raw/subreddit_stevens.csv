1946590,0,t3_2gyaco,I am not sure about now but there were a lot of Melee players at CGS when I went to Stevens  years ago. You could check there and maybe see about bringing a setup to one of their Saturday LANs when they have them.,stevens,cknrllq,2,t5_2roxj

3834934,0,t3_33y1bv,Hey man same exact situation. I wound up choosing Stevens because while its coop isnt as good its still really good plus its near NYC and Ive always wanted to live there. Also Stevens projects are more interesting than the ones kids do at RIT but it was the hardest decision of my life so I wish you luck.,stevens,cqteze7,1,t5_2roxj

6599197,0,t3_3ztmtd,Not sure if this is necroing this thread but it may help you. I got in and I am in no clubs. But I was in contact with the track coach so maybe if you like soccer and are good enough you can send your film early on Id start now I did so this time last year actually earlier. If you really want to go to Stevens Id recommend doing ED because it greatly increases the likelihood you will get in and get money. You will have the option to decline if you want to it isnt binding. The only downfall is you wont be able to weigh your options for other schools but if you have the money to go and are committed to it its the best choice. My friend who also does track and spoke with the coach got in with a pretty low standard GPA for this school and a part in the mid to upper percentile. ,stevens,d01wsqb,1,t5_2roxj

10792334,0,t3_5ucunb,Yeah you can do it for sure. If you do nothing you actually have a lot of free time. Realize people usually say they have no free time after they account for the time they spend surfing the web or hanging out for a couple hours. If youre doing work study you literally can do what the phrase implies work and studydo homework at the same time.,stevens,ddt5irp,4,t5_2roxj
