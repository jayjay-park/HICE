752224,0,t3_22r3dn,Theres no precedent for any evidence from the Inheritance Cycle to support any certain claim. What we do know about her doesnt help too much either. Thats one of the frustrating things about it Paolini. Not much can be discussed further beyond that.Heres a list of what who she likely is or what she might be. This ideas having merit in the text yet no supporting evidence to rule one out over another. All are possible and none areShes the Soothsayer that Galbatorix spoke of.A member or roots in her genealogy of the ancientmysterious species known as the GreyFolk.Shes an Inare. Whatever that happens to be. This is taken from Jeod speculation in his letter at the end of deluxe edition of Inheritance.Unlikely though Id be remissed not to mention it shes a Time Lord from Gallifrey who happened to the universe of the Inheritance Cycle through her T.A.R.D.I.S.Shes none of these and well find out whenever Christopher Paolini decides to write about her mysteries.,Eragon,cgps8sl,6,t5_2qyfi

1428785,0,t3_2ahtkj,Probably any number of reasons not least of all being that it was probably far easier to cure eragon. Glaedr was missing a leg and Oromis was physically cut off from most of the magic energy around him so the simple truth is that they simply might not have been able to cure them much less at such a huge distance. Eragon only had a scar from a shade and it was relatively new.Asode from that Oromis was old and Eragon was the beginning of the next generation of riders so to speak and so it would be important to make sure he and saphira were well taken care of since without Saphira the entire dragon species would become extinct.,Eragon,civditz,19,t5_2qyfi

2159450,0,t1_cleates,This is true. I actually kinda forgot about it myself to be honest. It seems so odd to that he wouldnt use it after he lost zaroc and chose to use a staff against the razac. I mean he goes out to kill the razoc with roran which is a huge deal for both of them and decides to use a big stick instead of this super amazing magical bow... and it would have been fitting considering in the first book he was imagining how the razoc would look filled with arrows.

Like others have said here though these theroies have been shot down. Im sure searching the sub for Angela theories will bring up a thread full of old ideas.I dont remember every theory that was shot down by CP but in my own opinion maybe she could be of some different species on the planet and for some reasone travelled to Alegeisia. Or she may have even come from some other world. Well just have to wait and see whenever she gets her own book If its even in that book.,Eragon,d3f8ov9,5,t5_2qyfi

I cant recall Oromis and Eragon teleporting but internet seems to prove you right so far. Help me out?Youre right about the fold being new and it opening new possibilities but I do assume opening doors to a place in space with more doors to somewhere else might be a bit much. The most insane magic weve seen used by dragons or by dragons through Elveshumansetc was the adjusting of Eragons body restoring the Isidar Mithrim and the likes..I think its too much of a Grey heh area to really just throw it out there that this should be possible but it just might be?,Eragon,d5jibfs,1,t5_2qyfi

9387110,0,t1_d95e7f0,I agree with you here. My title isnt very good for this post but I think I should have said the name is equally as dangerous to its user as it is powerful. As far as knowledge is concerned you can read the names of the Banished Dragons just as you can read the name of the Rock however you forget it soon afterwards. I had thought that perhaps Galbatorix found the name written somewhere and spoke it thus using the word and removing the memory blocks around it. To my knowledge he found it by searching through the riders vast stores of information. Therefore the word had been found before and must have subsequently been lost. ,Eragon,d95vs1i,1,t5_2qyfi

9878030,0,t1_dats20o,I dont necessarily agree that Aryas interest in him was out of character. She always kinda liked him and never really punished him for his awkward attempts to hit on her. In fact her trying several times to bring some distance between them showed that she felt something for him. Her main issue was the fact that he was basically a child from her perspective and unlike you I think that his character development changed that in a fairly believable way IMO.Her adventures together in general him seeing her while training with her healing the baby of that one guy from his town finding out who he is by finding out his real name creating the image I forgot the name to of her in a realistic way opposing to last time he did that... All these things were signs that he grew up and developed as a person.The problem that I see is that all of this happened in a very short time especially when compared to Aryas age and I understand that you might not be convinced by it. But keep in mind that Eragon is immortal as well so he would outlive any partner thats not an elf which makes him ending up with a human way more unrealistic than Arya making up her mind. Also shes not too horribly old for an elf either.The NasudaMurthagh relationship felt way more forced to me.edit well that reply turned out to be longer than expected. Please excuse possible grammar mistakes Im not a native speaker,Eragon,dav4pal,1,t5_2qyfi
9942198,0,t1_db3h4uy,Im actually planning to take a similar route. I havent decided whowhat the new enemy will be but hell be stupid strong and he will attack Alagaesia. Nasuda will underestimate him and ask Eragon for one of the riders thinking that this would be enough to deal with the situation. Eragon sends out the youngest of the two new riders who gets beaten in an extremely horrifying way which forces Eragon to take care of things himself. He still is my main character though. ,Eragon,db3hqwy,1,t5_2qyfi

10375746,0,t3_5oimmz,You can always get the Yawe or the Gedway Ignasia for basic tattoos. If you are looking for something more complex maybe something that ties in with one of your favorite scenes. Perhaps a visual representation of Angelas fortune or a sparkling egg cracking open.There are crazy amounts of combinations for phrases since we are provided with a style of dictionary for the ancient language. So you can make up your own phrase that can be tied into the series but can also carry a more personal meaning. I cant remember perfectly but your tattoo means May the Stars watch over you if I recall correctly so you could add the other lines to the traditional elf greeting or modify it to make it your own unique phrase.Otherwise I would personally love the words Domia abr Wyrda with the book underneath of it opened to the scene of Eragon touching the newly Hatched Sapphira or the ending visual with the boat going down river with two dragons flying around it.I have also played around with the idea of a Fairth depicting a scene or even tying your own memories Like a beloved pet family member or possession into Alagasia.If it wouldnt cost a fortune and I knew it would come out well I would love to have the scene of Eragon and Sapphira watching the sun rise on the wall of Fienster at the end of the third book. Whenever I reread that portion I always shiver a bit. ,Eragon,dck5jup,3,t5_2qyfi

10720552,0,t3_5supx0,I know this is probably the cop out answer but Galbatorix had the true name which pretty much gives him the power to do anything and have it logically plausible. He was probably just sitting there in his castle through all of book  just watching the inner circle of the Varden. He would have been able to remove all of their protective wards without them knowing it. In the final battle he even says to Vraels Dragon his name is escaping me that he knew there must have been more eldunari hidden. He probably watched Eragon during the entire journey with the exception of when he actually entered the Vault of Souls. That being because the dragons power doesnt stem from the ancient language it would be reasonable to assume that the true name has now power over it. ,Eragon,ddlquqi,2,t5_2qyfi

11662515,0,t1_dgh86uw,The spellcasters sent to protect Eragon and Arya all had elven swords that were enchanted. They are not near the level of Zarroc and Brisingr but they are well beyond the average dwarf sword. We know that Rhunn swore an oath never to make another sword but we dont know the exact details of the oath. It is unknown if it is limited to all swords or just rider swords or just weapons in general. There were the Dauthdaertya which the elves created but forgot how to make over the ages. ,Eragon,dghyltt,2,t5_2qyfi
11667681,0,t3_66hnzg,This question has been asked before and there seems to be a simple answer but IL through some other options out there as well. Brom would never take energy from Eragon or Saphira. He knew how much they needed it and would never do such a thing especially so early in their training before they even knew about the idea. The time between him getting hurt and being able to safely heal himself properly was too great and the damage was already done. The most likely reason is also the least satisfying in this case. Healing himself woild take a large amount of energy especially due to severity doing it hinself healing internals properly. Why not use arwen and the energy within it then? The same reason he didnt have years worth of wards placed on himself. These ideas werent thought of until later in the series. So unfortunately the most likely reason is thats its just a plot hole. The idea of taking energy from something else as well as wards dont appear until later in the series.These are what I have come up with although another case could be argued that Brom simply didnt know the proper way to heal a wound like the one he sustained or had forgotten how to over the years.
