556465,0,t3_20hkdc,One good reward is signed merch from Tommy. Maybe a poster of one of his famous headshots maybe for a higher amount a copy of the Room DVD or Blu Ray.,theroom,cg3iys5,3,t5_2s4wn
562750,0,t3_20k156,I purchased the Blu Ray through The Rooms official website and got my copy signed for free. Its really nice quality. The behindthescenes video was pretty awesome. Youll learn some cool things like at one point Mark was being played by a black guy. Its a novelty item really.,theroom,cg48o4u,2,t5_2s4wn

8610657,0,t1_d6hbrpn,I guess I mean...as you can see from this thread some of us wonder  was Tommy totally unprofessional on set? Was he just endearingly eccentric  or did you observe behavior that was cruelcrazy? Any specific examples? Gregs book is fascinating but it still leaves some of us or maybe just me wondering about the way Tommy treated people.  Just curious. Thanks in advance ,theroom,d6hxfxq,1,t5_2s4wn

11310437,0,t1_dfdj65m,Claudette betrayed him by demanding ridiculous amounts of money for a down payment on her friends house going so far as to hint he wasnt generous because he wouldnt slap down the cash. This clearly demonstrates Claudette views Johnny as a cash cow and baby sitter for her stupid daughter and as little else.,theroom,dfe0r5u,7,t5_2s4wn
