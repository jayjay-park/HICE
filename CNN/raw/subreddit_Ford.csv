Could have been any sort of intermittent malfunction until the light stays on steady it will be difficult to diagnose. I wouldnt worry too much about it if it was just a one time thing. If the abs control module stores trouble codes the dealer may be able to tell you more about the fault. But I personally dont think its worth the money unless it happens more frequently.

1661979,0,t3_2dcvqx,I bought a fusion energi last month but in SC which also has generous credits.  Im almost positive the rebates youre talking about are actually credits  both state and federal.  If I leased I could not get any credits. The dealer ship said they dont deal with that at least when when I purchase the car. If you lease  you dont technically own the car so the actual owner may claim the credits. Its a little weird the dealership is being sketchy about that as theyd most likely claim it.  Otherwise  you have to make sure you make enough money a year to receive the full credit when you file your taxes and if youre the one receive the credit. I would need to make k a year to get the full credit which isnt gonna happen since Im a college student and dont make nearly that. Go online to your state website to find out how the credits work and even talk to a tax specialist about it. Good luck! Edited like ten times for spelling and clarification.

TDCi is a good  enough engine just make sure its had the cam belt done and has a full service history. If youre looking at petrols stay clear of the PS . I ran one for a year and it was horrible. On this shape check that the dials work properly a delay in the needles coming up on start up could mean the gauge cluster is on its way out check that the clutch is smooth throughout its entire travel make sure all the gears engage smoothly with no grinding  rd is usually the first to go check around where the sills wings and doors meet for rust and check that the bonnet key mechanism is in good condition.

6494835,0,t3_44k8xa,Yes the car should still have warranty. As long as the title hasnt been branded salvage you should have no problem receiving warrantied repairs as long as they cannot be attributed to the accident itself. So no Ford will not replace the airbag under warranty because it was due to the accident but anything else that fails NOT due to the accident should be covered. If you are unsure about the status of the warranty just take the VIN to your local Ford dealers service department and they should be able to check on the status of the warranty and they can also give you the start and end date for the warranty.

8621522,0,t1_d6iwqxc,Agreed the FoST is a bit roomier more comfortable better appointed and has more cargo capacity. But the FiST is a little monster. Wicked fun little car and it has better handling and dampening. The FiST is a much better drivers car IMO but the FoST may be a bit more practical as a daily if itll be the only car since it can more comfirtably haul more peoplecargo and has a nicer interior. So it would really come down to what OP wants more fun or more practical. Both would be excellent options and very fun. The Fiesta is more fun though. ,Ford,d6jai25,2,t5_2qutc

9372169,0,t1_d93ywzs,So wiki says  is the end of th gen.  So something akin to this?  s s and W were all the traditional Small Block Ford or Windsor small block.  The  is essentially a slightly stroked  and the  has a slightly taller deck height the s to get the extra cubes.  Most anything you can fit a  into will fit a  but some cars might need a lil extra maneuvering to squeeze it in.  There is the smog era  from like  which had a slightly taller deck height over the other s to lower the compression ratio.  If youre doing a build on an engine this is something you could work around in several ways but since Im guessing youll probably end up looking at ss s this shouldnt be an issue.  All should have the same bolt points for the engine mounts.  I believe the bellhousing pattern is the same too.  However keep in mind the bellhousing pattern on s changed in late  so theres a chance your current tranny might have that initial pattern instead of the more universal later pattern.  The . by this time was used in explorers up until like  and imho if you were doing a swap thatd be a good candidate as it had a better intake and good heads if you found a running engine in one Id drop it in easy  hp or some nonsense.  Theyre everywhere and usually people are parting them out for something other than the engine.  Something that caught my interest while reading is Ford had some special Thunderbolt package in  where they crammed the  into the engine bay for hot rodding.  I dont think itd be an easy engine to track down but Im betting thats a mount that has been replicated in the aftermarket if you ever wanted to go that way  definitely a more involved project though. edit  Also keep in mind that if youre running a i then most likely youll need to upgrade the front and rear suspension and drive train to handle the v.  ,Ford,d93zm9j,1,t5_2qutc

The codes were BOccupant Classification System passenger airbag P Cooling fan  control malfunction and U switch pack. Is it possible that these three issues are being triggered by the battery dying or should I have someone else take a look at the car? These seem like pretty significant issues.

For example almost all of the Wranglers competition has gone soft  historically every SUV had at least a solid rear axle and a low range transfer case and a locked x mode.     Some like Montero even had air locking rear diff  etc.    Now Wranglers basically the only show in town  so the  door Montero buyer or  door Grand Cherokee buyer who wants a vehicle that can still get them to their outdoors destinations really has no choice.
