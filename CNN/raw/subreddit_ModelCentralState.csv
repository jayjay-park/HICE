7232073,0,t1_d204sjs,gtgovernment run education as it exists now does not workMy emphasis added.gtyour solution is for the government who have been unable to curtail bureaucracy and corruption to change how they run it. Let the all knowing all intelligent people in government fix it. Ill clarify that I believe my suggestions should be part of a solution not a solution in and of themselves.  And yeah I get the trope that governmentevil. Lets not forget that government as far as education is concerned is extremely hierarchical and political.  In my state the Superintendent of Instruction is the executive officer of the Department of Education which is the administrative agency for the public schools.  This is an appointed position not an elected one and can change as often as governors do.  I would prefer that this position be independent of gubernatorial baggage and transformed into an elected one with all public teachers required to vote.  Also the Board of Education members are appointed which just like the superintendent ends up being an insiders club who make decisions about learning standards for the entire state.  Citizens are all but left out of the decision making process but are of course required to foot the bill.  Does this make me pro or antigovernment?  Eh. I dont particularly care.  I think it makes me propowerinthehandsofthepeople whatever form that may take.,ModelCentralState,d208f5b,1,t5_37x1t

7743490,0,t1_d3mbrv9,Thats actually a good point. I meant it along the lines of the state creating deals between welfare recipients and corporations in exchange for fair market value for their work. Its up to each welfare recipient if they would like to work.I actually have a good idea. Instead of doing this we could offer stipends to each welfare recipient of some amount of money I will do the calculations later tonight so that they can find meaningful employment. ,ModelCentralState,d3mdn0x,1,t5_37x1t
