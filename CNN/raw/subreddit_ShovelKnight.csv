1696705,0,t1_cjsscup, Plague Knight can be good to repeatedly shovel drop when he stands in the corner to throw a bunch of fireballs at once.   I find Tinker Knights second phase is easier if you stand on his spinning lance and hit his little red missiles back at him.  I also found Propeller Knight is a good choice to use magic on since you cant reach him while hes hovering above you but if you throw a ton of anchors at him you can knock down his remaining health pretty quickly.  If you dont want to do that once he starts dropping his bombs stand to one edge of the screen and wait for him to come to you and start doing his backandforth lunging attacks.  You should be able to keep him off to side while hes doing it and get a bunch of hits in.,ShovelKnight,cjt172v,2,t5_2wxiy

4959073,0,t1_cujkffq, Is most likely the arcana Fleet Flask   is Whirl Casing  You have to complete the main game before you can start PoS. YCG has confirmed theres another way most likely a cheat you can use to get it from the beginning though.  I also think its worth mentioning that the Troupple King looks different in the trailer.    I could go on but tbh I dont feel like it so I implore you to fact check this against the official manual    Edit The chest in  gives you tonics,ShovelKnight,cujmpox,2,t5_2wxiy

5194937,0,t1_cvbxaah,In that sense I guess it was just too powerful. Usually Yacht Club are good with leaving this stuff alone but perhaps they saw this glitch and felt it was too powerful and basically made most of their level design redundant. In the hands of an incredible player this glitch could let you fly over every single obstacle in the level or attack bosses from the safest distance possible. Plague Knight already bypasses a lot of this design but this just destroys it all. The only other alternative would be for lower ceilings or more invisible walls to counter the sheer power of this glitch but that would be less fun. ,ShovelKnight,cvc6mra,1,t5_2wxiy

7585084,0,t1_d2ze4hi,That recovering gauge is something they do with Plague Knight... but I think its a bit disingenuous to say that most of the items were pointless.  You didnt even mention Propeller Dagger or Phase Locket those two are incredibly useful.  Chaos Orb is great for quickkilling some bosses and the Anchor is good for hitting aerial enemies.  Dust Knuckles and Mobile Gear can be used to skip large portions of levels and make your mobility awesome... really the only item Id say isnt very useful is the Horn.,ShovelKnight,d34dxy3,1,t5_2wxiy

9266219,0,t3_57bcc4,I would love a sequel with new Knights but I also hope they dont just forget about the Order. It would be nice to see the original eight Knights appearing in your journey maybe even helping you out. On the other hand a sequel with the exact same cast would probably get to be stale after a while. So something with a good balance of old and new characters would be nice.,ShovelKnight,d8qk537,9,t5_2wxiy
9267759,0,t3_57bcc4,I think another entry in the Shovel Knight IP would if successful make Yacht Club even more popular and give people more confidence in them as developers.

10135371,0,t1_dbs6xio,gtCalm your God damn tits dude. The reason youre being down voted is because you come across as an ass. Yet its okay for the majority of the comments here to be an ass to me because I criticized a videogame. Okay.gtYou  set me up for the joke thats on you.What joke?gtThe game is great for a lot of the reasons. The controls are simplistic which allows you to focus on the actual platforming rather than performing complex controls. My problem is with Shovel Knights movement speeds. The jumping is fine but his run speed is awfully slow and it makes platforming awkward.gtThe checkpoint system is forgiving and fair making the game enjoyable to progress through. The bosses are refreshing as well. I like the bosses they are challenging without any attached bullshit. While the checkpoints are forgiving I usually spend  or so minutes just trying to retrieve the cash bags that I dropped when I died.gtThe game is paced well as the levels get more difficult with new concepts coming constantly but with a lot of help. Again the pacing falls apart when Im spending a couple of minutes trying to retrieve my cash every time I die.gtThe relic system is fun and interesting. The npcs and dialogue is just so clever and fun to see in a game of this kind. The expansions continue to come out for free that lets the player face similar challenges with different play styles. I agree.,ShovelKnight,dbsn5t1,0,t5_2wxiy
