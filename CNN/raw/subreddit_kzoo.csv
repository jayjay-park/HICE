764361,0,t3_22w30x,Im interested to hear about more eyewitness accounts especially from anyone who was physically at the scene near the police when this happened. Ive heard accounts from a couple of people who were there claiming that the police were recklessly pepper spraying people sitting on the ground not even taking part in anything violent.Perhaps most importantly I was also informed that the situation with people trying to overturn the ice cream truck happened AFTER the police were on the scene and started intervening.I have no idea if this is true or not but Id like to try to hear from as many people as possible to get a better picture of the true sequence of events. Obviously if the most violent acts of aggression were happening after the police arrived it changes the overall picture of the whole event. The general overview I was getting from those present was that the vast majority of people werent behaving violently and that it was a small minority that perhaps provoked the police response. Obviously the greater majority were definitely trashing the streets and causing a huge mess which is entirely a bad thing and very much illegal but using tear gas in such a situation seems not only overkill but also incredibly dangerous.If you or someone you know was there and saw the events go down and especially if you know someone injured Id really like to hear from them.

3371908,0,t3_2yr2a9,I think my friend summed it up best  Bells likely doesnt have an issue with Innovation but is instead creating a history of defending its name and slogans in the legal system by objecting to Innovations trademark application. That way if someone else down the road creates something that actually infringes on the Bells brand when they take that entity to court they can prove that theyve objected to such actions in the past and stand a better chance of winning. It sounds super douchey at first glance but Innovation will likely be awarded its trademark application and Bells will be able to say they pay attention to such things for future reference which is what both parties actually want.actual response from Bells  To our Bells customers and the passionate craft beer communityWe want to clear up a few things regarding our federal trademark dispute with Innovation Brewing.We have not and are not asking them to change their name or their logo. There is no lawsuit. We are not suing them. We have not asked them for money. We have not asked them to stop selling their beer. We are asking them to withdraw their federal trademark application.Our concern is with their United States trademark application and potential impact on our brand which we have spent  years building.I personally reached out to Innovation Brewing to try to settle this matter in February  and attempted to talk about this brewer to brewer instead of involving lawyers. Our efforts were rebuffed and Innovation Brewing choose to pursue this in the legal system.Over the last year we have offered coexistence agreements and have offered to pay for their legal fees. We tried to find solutions that would work for both of us. Their response was to ask for an exorbitant amount of money and we did not feel that was a collaborative solution.All offers that we proposed were rejected and after more than a year of discussion regrettably this matter has moved to the federal trademark office.We have the utmost respect for Innovation Brewing and we are going to keep any comments we have regarding this matter positive honest and collaborative. We want them to continue to brew and do the good work theyre doing under their own name.We hope to resolve this as swiftly as the system will allow.The passion that we have seen over the past few days is a testament to how much the beer industry means to those who support it and why we are proud to be a part of it. We always appreciate further feedback and invite everyone to continue to share their concerns with us directly ,kzoo,cpcmewe,14,t5_2ryk4

4304813,0,t3_3a7jxi,Ugh. I sympathize with this. Id like to share a story of my own.  In  I had a sales job working for a really cool company.  However I was depressed and I was living alone which caused me to feel isolated and i spiraled deeper into depression. My own self deprication caused me to fail at my job and I lost it. I decided it was time for a major change. I sold most of my belongings. The only thing of value that I kept was my moped. Shortly after my unemployment I spontaneously decided to ride my moped to visit Mammoth Caves in Kentucky. The journey took  and  days and  hours of riding. I rode alone but I met some interesting people along the way and I fell completely in love with my moped. That summer I found a part time minimum wage job and some generous people who gave me a great deal on a bedroom to rent.  and I learned everything about how to work on that moped. It was the only thing that gave me happiness that summer.  One morning in August I awoke to find that my moped the only thing of value that I owned and the only thing that I cared about had been stolen.It doesnt seem like that big of a deal from an outside perspective.  The person who took it had no idea what that machine meant to me.  It wasnt a spiteful insult against me it was just thoughtless thievery.  I guess I dont know where Im going with this haha but I just wanted to share my experience and thoughts. Being stolen from sucks!,kzoo,csavlr3,3,t5_2ryk4

6899174,0,t3_4a5bfr,Wait since when are city outlets or even light pole outlets fair game?no pun intended If they are I have an easy solution for that Kalamazoo wants citizen suggestions on how to improve...If I knew this Id be setting up a tent and outdoor LAN party by June. Speaking of IIRC the city of KZOO was looking for great activities and plans for morale boosting and general good times why not just have a version of this downtown like a library but exclusively for power supply? Just a bunch of free energy rooms to do stuff in like LAN N Goldeneye Small business etc studio recording interviews. Just a series of small rooms that you can do stuff in for a set period of time. Am I describing hotels? Who knows.... I mean its either this or potholes and potholes are a lost cause until the entire state finally bites the bullet and goes for that nearracetrack quality jetblack asphalt you see everywhere in the western statesno seriously even undeveloped land with empty roadways had the good stuff Like exit  everywhere it was so good I could feel my car getting younger. Then again I bet we go with plain concrete because its impossible to grip that quality asphalt in snowice or some other variable not considered. ,kzoo,d0yc8t2,0,t5_2ryk4

The people who worked there were so friendly it was clean when I moved in and it was very wellmaintained.  It was a nice mix of people some students some not and I never had an issue with noise.  I know that when I lived there  years ago they wouldnt raise the rent for current tenants who wanted to continue living there after one year.Overall it was a really great place to live and the only reason why I moved was because I wanted to adopt a cat and they had a strict no pets policy.,kzoo,d7v5iei,2,t5_2ryk4
