8212,0,t1_cefch6r,The typical player will be busting out  combos routinely CPU tends to drop longer combos. CPU can be frameperfect on block and whiff punishes though.

444716,0,t3_1z65uw,I was just wondering if there are some people who has this fighting game or at least heard of it. Its a fighting game made based from Baki the Grappler manga author Keisuke Itagakis version of Baku Yumemakuras Garouden novels developed by ESP Software who made the Hajime no IppoVictorious Boxers games. Those who follow a lot of martial arts manga may already be familiar with the Garouden series.Its my favorite fighting game of all time and it kind of ruined other fighting games for me  its surprisingly realistic even though its not trying to be a huge plus for a martial artsMMA fan like me. And I implore hardcore D fighting game fans to at least explore the game since its surprisingly very deep and balanced for a lesserknown fighting game. More into the balance Ive been mostly looking into translations of Japanese sources in regards to information about the game mechanics and the most recent tier list I came across found here   has nearly every character being within the same tier ranking. The only exceptions are the  obvious boss characters and a few characters that were meant to be weak.Heres hoping that this post at least catches the eyes of a few people since having a scene for this particular fighting game outside Japan would be more than welcome! Advanced matches for this game is a thing to behold!Anyway the link I posted leads to my old YT account where I uploaded Garouden videos I got from Nicovideo.jp. It would be better to seek out the source of those videos from that website by searching the tag  there.,fightinggames,cfquyrl,1,t5_2rxim
