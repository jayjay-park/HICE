1714328,0,t1_cjv8pha,Just delivering a stack of books Prez. And stop looking at me like that. Youre making me feel like I did something nasty. Kento toted what he could under one arm and sandwiched the stack with his chin just to keep it from falling apart.,HikarizakaHigh,cjv94gq,1,t5_32wyz

Well I dont really know if this is decentish enough material but still. Oh yeah expect popculture references slang and other things that you wont know.
