21453,0,t1_ceglrjk,TBH i dont feel like you would get your moneys worth with the oculus rift in this game. I feel like It would be more suited for Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous but thats just my opinion sooo. ,LimitTheory,cegvj5a,1,t5_2vlvw

3209004,0,t3_2wrnkj,The last  of designing a game is as difficult as the first  was. When we add to that the possible fact that this is the most ambitious game ever to be undertaken by a sole person I cant think of many others with the same scope then to be concerned is pretty normal. Having to stop what he is doing periodically and write updates for the community on top of everything else is an insane work load. I honestly wouldnt mind if he crowd funded for extra money to hire in a small team to help finish the game at this point. I guess we will see what happens. ,LimitTheory,coum1wd,2,t5_2vlvw

5692346,0,t1_cx2ftk9,To be fair this is entirely good news.The modularity he is stating here means a very stable engine is going to come out of LT.It also means modding in anything will be possible...Multiplayer Mods are close than ever now. D,LimitTheory,cx2ovv3,1,t5_2vlvw
8226316,0,t3_4rwpi5,Im looking forward to it but it does different things than LT more focus on exploration and FP controls and planets no strategicorganistational component no RTS parts no moddability no offline singleplayer no simulated economy and AI and stuff as far as I now,LimitTheory,d55ugkp,1,t5_2vlvw
8925929,0,t1_d764sh3,Stalk? You cant blame him for wanting answers and something to show for all the money... Do you really think a sick person has any ability to finish something like this?,LimitTheory,d7krkj4,2,t5_2vlvw
