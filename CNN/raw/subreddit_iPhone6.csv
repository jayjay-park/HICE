1869873,0,t1_cke1207,I will have to respectfully disagree. It is a more superior product. Why? Youll probably go into the whole hardware side of things how your device has a faster this that and whatever. But the iPhone works seamlessly. How the software interacts with the hardware and vice versa makes the whole experience much better than any other device.Source I owned multiple Android phones before.,iPhone6,ckeihcu,0,t5_2tbz3

2048300,0,t1_cl05wxd,looking at it I think they are about the same really.  The only difference is the square trade replacement phones may not be apple certified  I think theyre about even in my research  I think it may just depend...if youre not in an area where theres an apple store near squaretrade may be a good alternative plus if youre hard on the phone they give you the  replacements.  I think they are both viable options. ,iPhone6,cl06mq4,1,t5_2tbz3

7143961,0,t1_d1f2wk7,Mine did the same thing. I update through iTunes and still wont download new apps or update any. Also the phone seems to be running very slow. ,iPhone6,d1q6ycb,1,t5_2tbz3
8430003,0,t3_4uym9x,I own both an iPhone  and an HTC One and whilst both are completely bullet proof and I use them for different things the iPhone just seems to work faster and smoother than the Android phone.I had a series of Samsung devices and many people told me to root them to get the best user experience and although that was something I did I couldnt help feeling that if I have to root a phone to get the best user experience from it something fundamental is wrong somewhere.,iPhone6,d5vahxx,2,t5_2tbz3
10042282,0,t1_dayac8z,Ah ah that s funny. Simple troubleshooting that reminds of Windows days. Thank god Apple changed my life with better software that does not require constant updates and re installs from scratch. Errrr maybe this has changed over the past few years. I noticed a big change with iOS  or  when apps started to crash which was never happening before. Flipnkraut may I address you an advice how about Stopping patronising others?,iPhone6,dbgjabs,0,t5_2tbz3
