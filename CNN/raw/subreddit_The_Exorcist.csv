9220851,0,t1_d8jqj8b,I understand the entire scene was disturbing on many levels. The guy harassing her  the train filled of people were oblivious to it not willing to do anything to help. I cant help but wonder if it was a setup by the demon or if he at least escalated the situation putting everyone on the train in a trance of indifference. I cant believe one person wouldnt step forward to help her.,The_Exorcist,d8kt6ro,3,t5_3gbul

Especially since he was invited to that very important dinner to make friends and they then questioned his absence. In my opinion they takeharm her to get to him and force him into doing their wishes. ,The_Exorcist,d9mvhm5,5,t5_3gbul

9729107,0,t3_5ef2d2,Its been a long time since I saw it but I def liked it more than the other sequels. It might as well be a stand alone movie because it works so well. I love that they show different kinds of exorcisms from other beliefs and how they noticed the spears from the statues were upside down.,The_Exorcist,dacbpug,2,t5_3gbul
9846106,0,t3_5dqj8r,Most of the recaps are just ASSUMING Bennett is dead. To me this is the type of show where if you dont see the body then not dead yet  and even then. Im really hoping hes not dead. Also before they put the bag on him they wanted to know the name of his contacts so maybe the idea wasnt too kill him yet? Any one else have similar thoughts. As for Marcus at the bar can we cut him a break? Hes excommunicated. Hes not a priest at the moment so if he finds love lets let him. Hes had a pretty miserable existence and at the moment he and the church are on a break. Ive got a couple of speculative thoughts I think Jessica is either under the influence of the conspiracy or part of it. There were a few lines from Maria and the Jaffey that seemed to indicate they were setting temptation in his way and Maria definitely seemed to know something was going on when she saw Jessica. I also wonder whether or not the pope is ALREADY compromised. The poster of his back is super creepy. Maybe his visit if for an as yet unrevealed purpose? What is that purpose? I dunno but Im thinking about the Mayors asencion on BTVS.,The_Exorcist,daqyy46,1,t5_3gbul
