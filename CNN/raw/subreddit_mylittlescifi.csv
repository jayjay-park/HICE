164685,0,t3_1vz805,Hmm this is something Ive tried to figure out.Considering Nightmare Moon was able to postpone the sun rising in Friendship is Magic and the more recent endless twilight in Princess Twilight I think that the planet is probably stationary with orbiting celestial bodies.Id say that since Equestria the planet is such a magic heavy world that they are probably an anomaly and other planets in other solar systems probably function like our own.,mylittlescifi,cex6us7,2,t5_2yyc9
