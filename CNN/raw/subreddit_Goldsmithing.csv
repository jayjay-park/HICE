75365,0,t3_1uyoh9,My favorite method is to send it to a lab with k in inert atmosphere digital programmable equipment that casts every day. Sorry just trying to be funny.I think what you are really asking is for a preference between vacuum and centrifuge. ?  In which case I would say centrifuge. I think it generally results in a slightly denser casting and requires less sprue which equals less metal which means lower metal cost. I only use vacuum for large flasks when I dont feel like spinning large quantities of molten metal. But the truth in the first statement is that as long as you are torch melting perfection will be elusive. ,Goldsmithing,cen0c8h,5,t5_2thau
84281,0,t1_cenyygm,Medium solder  probably   thats a good question considering hard solder is also   same as coin silver. There is a visible line in the ring where it was joined. This ring was made as a replacement  standin for a family member until hopefully their finger fits into their original ring. The line will be positioned to the bottom or the side in relation to the engraving so that its just a little less noticeable. I wonder how visible it would be if I had used  or if I would have been able to pull it off with hard solder without the ring slumping. I dont know I just decided to play it safe using medium solder. ,Goldsmithing,ceo0vq5,2,t5_2thau

The color in the head and the round are primarily the result of copper inclusions in the mineral feldspar that is Oregon Sunstone. The body is a one of a kind gem. Note that the color is different in the various images thats partly the result of lighting variations florescent or K? photo bulbs but its also because this stone has red and green zones and is a bit dichroic meaning the color changes based on viewing angle. You can see that the head color remains relatively consistent in all the pictures. It also has shimmering veils of copper inclusion floating in it. The metal is k gold all yellow except for the bail all hand fabricated. ,Goldsmithing,chwqm0r,1,t5_2thau
