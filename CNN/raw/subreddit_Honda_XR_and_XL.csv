5958017,0,t1_cy0m3b2,You have two options. If you really want to get the upgraded stator just do that. Its already wired with a floated ground. Either way youll  have to pull the cover to modify the old one or to replace it.  Means an oil change and new gasket. So if you just do the mod and still wanna upgrade youre out oilgasket. Know what Im saying?Buuuuut if you wanna do the mod just follow my old guide I posted or riomxs. Its pretty simple. You just clip the grounded wire.  Solder a new lead to that then run that wire out so you have an extra lead to your RR. Then your grounds for your lighting circuit should only be spliced off the black wire from RR. ,Honda_XR_and_XL,cy0mksa,3,t5_39akj

6700660,0,t1_d0c30te,Cheers for the reply Ill probably pull the motor and replace all gaskets if its in ok condition so head cracks shouldnt be an issue. Parting it out is my last resort i guess as the bike only cost me  dollars originally. ,Honda_XR_and_XL,d0cemxr,2,t5_39akj

7509199,0,t1_d2v58rx,gt atOk. Ill look into the Dunlop AT and Maxxis tires as Im always on the look out for a better tire. But I suspect we may just be of different riding styles. I like to get where Im going not necessarily quickly and my tire needs to be able to last a  mile trip. I feel like the hard core knobbies people dont even get  miles out them. On my KLR i can do that amount of mileage in a day and the grip is just not something I need to get through the occasional loose sand or packed dirt I ride on.Thanks man!,Honda_XR_and_XL,d2vrb0p,1,t5_39akj
7512449,0,t1_d2sch85,Just finished lapping the valves. The cylinder head now holds gas but it looks like it could be leaking super slow. If it is it is a small enough leak to have me unsure. Is that ok?Will post cam pictures tomorrow,Honda_XR_and_XL,d2w4mfm,1,t5_39akj
