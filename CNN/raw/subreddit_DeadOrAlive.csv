3265812,0,t3_2xhqe6,Its a little difficult to give you specific advice without seeing you play but here are a few things I notice newbies have a tendency to do Mashing strikes. This is easy to predict as the strings are telegraphed and they leave you at significant frame disadvantage when blocked leading to guaranteed punishment. Dont just press buttons. Recognize that blocked attacks will generally leave you at disadvantage. Focus on only using one or twohit attacks and moving on to your next action based on the outcome of your previous attack. Mashing holds. Newbies have a tendency to throw out random holds as soon as they are stunned. You can easily bait these players to hold and punish them with a  frame throw leading to hicounter damage. Knowing when and how to hold will come with time as you begin to recognize and learn characters move sets as well as reading your opponent. While guessing is a part of ityou dont want to be holding randomly. Holding and slow escaping are your only options once you are stunned. First you should examine why are you getting into that position in the first place. Are you attacking from disadvantage and getting counter hit? Are you whiffing attacks and getting punished? ,DeadOrAlive,cp0j2gi,2,t5_2tfjy

3478486,0,t3_303ft0,a friend of mine is good with momiji. i tell ya her kick attacks where she flips into the air is pretty aggravating sometimes. but she seems to be one of the better ninjas imo. see ninjas like hayabusa or ayane seem to rely heavily on gimmicks at least thats how ive mostly seen people play them. momiji other than the attack i mentioned previously doesnt seem to have any other really cheap moves. personally i dont know much about playing her. i know enough of every character to at least survive against a hard level bot. but besides her fundamentals i dont really have much more to add. on a strictly subjective note i like her personality the best of all the ninjas.,DeadOrAlive,cporu5y,2,t5_2tfjy

3594237,0,t1_cq1xh6y,Theres really no way to know. People guesstimate that the DLC will go on sale at a later time due to TN being money hungry.But theres no guarantee. I dont see why they wouldnt though since Pre Order DLC was simply an incentive to get players to purchase. Not some Donate to our cause and get EXCLUSIVE CONTENT kind of thing.We didnt pay EXTRA for the DLC we just purchased it at the regular price.However it can be said that upon Steam Sale for  new players will be able to buy the game for  dollars and if the Pre Order content is indeed buyable they will get the better deal. dollars  probably  dollars pack   dollars total as opposed to  dollars.Only time will tell.Im more concerned about whether the costumes will be sold individually or these huge mega packs.I do not like these mega packs. I dont care for Gangster Bass or whatever else comes in that.,DeadOrAlive,cq1yxek,2,t5_2tfjy

5384210,0,t1_cvzvfln,Its really shocking and a little depressing to me since theyre so iconic. Its a new age I guess? I assume DOAULR and new pandery characters brought in a new generation of DOA players though it could just be a change of heart in the fandom itself lol,DeadOrAlive,cvzw6ak,2,t5_2tfjy
5394164,0,t1_cw0b5gj,This is how I feel too. For the game to have a release date this early they definitely reused the DOA character models and rehashed DOAX environment and gameplay. Only thing they added was an improved Soft Engine for realistic skin and jiggle physics. It was also said that males will be in the game and we havent even seen a single male face. That means they will be DLC. If the males are DLC then its easy to assume the rest of the girls could be DLC as well. It will be such easy money for Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja. Seeing how well their costumeoutfits DLCs have sold in DOA we can expect DLC swimsuits. Which means a smaller catalog of swimsuits available in game. If the DLC swimsuits are character specific its going to royally suck ass. Itll be worse than trying to gift your partner a swimsuit in DOAX.   Also mentioned was that they want you to have a deeper character relationship so there will be more dialogue. As you mentioned below there is no way this is the reason to omit  of the girls if they are reskinning everything.  All my favorite girls Tina Lisa Christie and Rachael arent even in the game. It will be DLC galore. Maybe they will release a Ultimate version.,DeadOrAlive,cw15xql,1,t5_2tfjy

7083176,0,t1_d1j3oy4,Still havent talked about living in a fascist regime. Ive talked about their policies but thats about it.Again I still didnt say only fascist regimes do this. But a signature trait of fascist regimes is that they limit artistic expression which is the topic were discussing in this thread. I feel like youre not reading anything throughly. You also used normative as a verb when I used it as an adjective which is very confusing so Im not sure how to respond to the rest of what you said in that paragraph as I dont know what youre disagreeing with.As far as your third point Im not sure what distinction youre trying to draw so Ill leave that on hold for now. I cant parse any further meaning from what youve written.For your fourth point no you still havent given any tactile reasons besides that she simply looks young. You still didnt show why my earlier reasoning was false so Im not sure how youd like to proceed here.As for playing dumb I feel some personal angst here on your part and Im not sure how to assuage it. You keep attacking me personally instead of my reasoning and saying certain things are obvious a priori which you cant even prove a posteriori. They clearly arent obvious if you cant even explain them. Really playing dumb would be dumbing down my speech to a simpler level for you. Thats patronizing and disrespectful. Im taking what you say seriously and thus Ill respond seriously and with as much clarity as Im able. You may attack language all you wish but I dont see how it helps you other than fuel negative emotions which are irrelevant to our discussion. Watching you continue to do it over and over despite me asking you to focus on the conversation at hand is like watching a ram charge a wall continuously while failing to notice the door located just next to its point of impact. But yes I suppose Ill engage your ad hominem and wet that disrespectful appetite of yours I do use such words every day. Even if I didnt I would still use them here this is not day to day life this is a written internet conversation in which Im trying to divine your views on something. Clarity is essential in writing if you seek to be understood. Obfuscation and rhetoric which you keep using are heavily impeding this end. ,DeadOrAlive,d1j8shc,2,t5_2tfjy
7083612,0,t1_d1j93az,The thing is though is that you are wrong that she looks too young. She looks like an average  year old. When I was  I dated a  year old who according to your definition of what a woman should look like only looked about . Does this mean Im some perv for being with someone who doesnt look like a chain smoking porn star? If you think real women all look like Kim kardashian but ten years older then you watch too much porn. My point is people need to stop making this stupid argument. If you dont like the game thats fine but your opinions and tastes shouldnt dictate what the rest of us get to do. The only real reason I even have a problem with this is because it seems a lot of things are being censored lately and the ones causing it are prudes who dont even consume the products and so shouldnt have a say ruining it for the rest of us normal well balanced people who dont get so hung up on sexuality like its somehow the worst thing in the world,DeadOrAlive,d1jakpp,2,t5_2tfjy

7192594,0,t3_4d3iam,Here is my take on it. So far Lack of Jet Ski  Slide Mini Game Lack of Opening and Ending scenes  Lack of Music  Custom Music  Characters is pretty cheesy Reuses ShopZack Trading Shop Zero Slot Machines in the Casino Lack of improved AI No Sweat feature utilized in their engineI feel there were huge budget issues and it was used as a gauge to cash in and see the demand. Now that DOAX is showing huge demand the hope is DOAX only gets better. To note Tomonobu Itagaki wasnt involved with DOAX and could attest to its half ass quality.,DeadOrAlive,d1vql4r,3,t5_2tfjy
