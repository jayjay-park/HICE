Theyre a cool duo on their own and Marks obviously great but for some reason I love what happens whenever all three of them get together and make stuff. I almost feel guilty for saying it but the outtakes and bloopers are honestly my favorite videos!

5072569,0,t1_cuxe2ma,Youre both welcome. Doing portraits of actual people is one of the most difficult artistic undertakings. And hands. I hate drawing hands with a passion. Id agree the nose is a bit wide and the eyes arent quite Asian enough for lack of a better way to say it but that doesnt change the fact this is very well done. She has a great eye for color and shading. People dont realize a huge part of realistic drawing is simply understanding how light falls on your subject. It sounds simple but its so easy to screw up and she has a good eye for it. And part of developing your own artistic style is putting your own spin on things showing the world the way your subject looks to you. Everyone mocked Van Goghs style and now hes one of the most well known artists in all of history. For example she made his hair much lighter than it actually is so its technically wrong but its one of my favorite elements. If she loves art she should continue making it and the hell with people who dont like it. You cant make everyone happy.

Theres also people who will go back to the Cyndago channel and watch and rewatch their channels youd want to focus on the good times and the funny stuff they did it provides a relief from the anxiety were in right now. Also remember Mark has an excellent track record of uploading like  videos a day every day. Add that to his work with other gaming channels his appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel show...his channel traffic is NOT going to go down. Theres still MANY more people who find his channel and theres plenty to explore as far as his channel is concerned. TLdr he worked so hard and did so much.

I did get a laugh out of Wades faces and when Mark and Bob fooled Jack or when Mark got stuck in the hole but that was about it. Huniepop and Sims are pretty funny too but I used to show his videos to my family and he hasnt exactly made anything that would appeal to my family lately. I cant help but miss the tradition.Maybe hes buying time for another game to come out that hes really looking forward to? Maybe hes feeling a little burnt out? I dont know. Hes stated before that his style has changed a bit since he started and he is trying out new styles of commentary. Maybe this is him trying something new to see how it fits?Edit Oh! That one! I forgot about that sentry station. For some reason I thought of the one with the hot dog condiments.,Markiplier,cxol7y3,3,t5_2u49m

Like I said in another post I cant imagine trying to please M subs as well as many who say he saved their life or changed them in some way. But theres still something the way he presents himself especially in impromptu vlogs when hes just outandabout... I think to myself how hard is he trying right now? and I wonder just how much of it is natural. Certainly not a criticism of Mark we all do that to a point.

His adventurous spirit was really rewarded while exploring the environment. His bit with Forrest Byrnes at the end really detracted from the ending of the game though.

8971797,0,t3_5359ym,gtWhy is the schedule always so weird?Is it though? He seems to put out  sometimes  videos a day.gtWhy do you play low quality games because every lets player plays it? Who the heck wants to watch ragdoll runners?Youd be surprised. He got nearly  million views on that video whereas his latest AAA related video RE teaser got .milgtWhy do you not just play games until you finish them and move on? Instead of playing fifteen series at once?Say he was playing a No Mans Sky series but I didnt much care for watching it. As did apparently . million people that dropped off after the first episode of the series If he were to keep playing it and that was all that was showing up in my subscription feed he runs the risk of alienating certain fans and losing subscribers.gtWatching you get angry isnt fun when you keep doing it.Some people would agree with you some would disagree but the fact is that there is an audience for it. gtWhy do you not ever answer your fans questions that you can easily answer that are important to your channel?He has a huge fan base and I would imagine it would be quite difficult for him to sift through all the questions that he gets and decide who to answer and when.gtWhy is an animation your second video when you didnt make it?I only get bothered by this when Im waiting for him to release a video in a series Im following but ultimately its his channel and if a user submits it to him to post then I see nothing wrong with him using it as a buffer video to give himself a little break.gtWhy do you film and release videos on the same day?Why not? I listen to live radio and same day recorded podcasts as well as watching livestreams so why not watch same day videos. It keeps things very current so if there is anything going on with the community that he would comment on it would be that much more relevant.gtWhy do you never read real feedback and post on your twitter so little to update your fans?He seems very recluse on social media. He has no obligation to put himself in the focus all the time. He posts his videos and updates the community as needed through them.gtWhy are all your jokes Im worthless Im unfunny Im stupid these days? You literally just say unlike me whos stupid and dumb an cut to the actual game.Self deprecating humor seems to be his style not to mention the fact that its the type of humor that resonates well with his audience for a number of reasons.gtWhy do you have to pretend to be stupid to be funny? It honestly feels like youre holding a string. You dying your hair and making dick jokes has NOTHING to do with it its calling yourself markimoo and a bunch of other nick names making that Im dumb voice for this long man.Theres an old saying comedians say funny things comics say things funny.Markiplier is more the latter.

10822009,0,t1_ddw6ghh,how is pewdipie saying kill jews even remotely close to to kill a mockingbird. theres a simple logical error here  theres a difference between discomfort and offense. and furthermore theres a distinct difference between discomfort that comes from perhaps my view of the world is wrong...perhaps im part of the problem as you could say to kill a mockingbird might put in someone or maybe from wow there really are a lot of ugly things in the world adn ive never appreciated how ugly they really are that... well also from to kill a mockingbird. this is completely different from seeing youtubes most popular user say with no context no buildup no reason death to all jews and etc all the time. how does that remotely compare to the other kinds of more serious artistic discomforts you cited?citing game of thrones is a bad one  some of these boutique tv shows are just pointlessly gory for no reason pointlessly ugly etc. and it still has no possible relation to an actual hey what about kill jews joke.its telling that the daily stormer and other nazi sites have gone full pewdiepie with quotes that say directly even if hes probably not one of us hes normalizing the idea of saying death to all jews or jewish genocide to a very wide audience so we give him a big thumbs up. ironically saying this kind of thing on mainstream platforms after recent hate crimes in areas like synagogues and the like doesnt work. its not the same kind of discomfort or whatever. its not even just personal offense its disgust that he could be so tone deaf to just sort of do that at random and in some cases of jewish people a much more personal kind of dread and hard to describe feeling.the idea of comedy is to be funny,Markiplier,ddw7pke,12,t5_2u49m
