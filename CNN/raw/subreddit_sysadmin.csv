The data that we administer is often proprietary or covered under HIPPA or FRPA and part of our job is to be blind to what we are working with.I am aware of the type of data that I administer I work for a public school but I dont even look up my own grandkiddos information.  The ethics of my job says that I dont snoop.  I protect that data and make sure that is is accessible by the correct people and hidden to everyone else.And Im in the same boat as the rest of us  who has the time and theres a lot more interesting things to do than dig through data. ,sysadmin,ceefwkw,0,t5_2qnp7

45423,0,t3_1umnri,Copypasta from another of these threadsPersonally I think the best way to learn Linux is to use it youll learn more and faster when youre using it as a desktop system than you will firing up putty and remoting in to setup a LAMP server. Get friendly with vim and emacs pick the one you prefer then learn it well they are extremely powerful and can make you life much easier.Id suggest sticking Debian or Ubuntu on a laptop and start using it for all your computing day to day out of work obviously then once youre a bit more comfortable with using Linux the filesystem package management playing with window managers and desktop environments fire up a VM and get a LAMP server running as others have suggested.Once youve got that down make another VM and make it into your git server I like gitolite for management personally Once you have Git working and have a rough idea of how it works get the LAMP server config in git.Now for the fun stuff learn how to provision a LAMP server using a config management system Puppet and Chef are the big names personally I really like SaltStack This is the direction Linux administration is going infrastructure as code is a wonderful thing.Once youve got you LAMP server setup via whatever CM system you use you can now setup a LAMP server in a few minutes pretty sweet. But what does every server need? Monitoring Nagios is the old warhorse  youll find it everywhere  but it is dying a death its tedious to setup and doesnt really scale well. There are a few forks of Nagios Icinga is pretty nice but being based on Nagios it has a lot of the same limitations.So what should you try after youve grown to hate Nagios in the week you have been using it? There are some awesome new monitoring systems coming out two of my favorites are Sensu and Riemann Once youve chosen one and got the master setup under CM of course! adding it to your config management system for all servers you provision is pretty simple.Now you have machines being setup under config management and added to monitoring as soon as they are spun up you can do some awesome things with Vagrant with a nicely made config you can have an entire dev environment that mirrors production up and running in the time it takes you to make a cup of tea ripe to abuse to your hearts desire and when youre done you can destroy it with a single command.takes a breathWell that was a bit longer than I expected... This is roughly what Ive done in the last  months I went from having a minimal experience of running a handful of linux game servers sshing in from Windows to having the ability to create whatever environment I need to test something within a few minutes its a huge amount of work but totally worth it.I mention DebianUbuntu because these are the systems I use the differences between them are small you could just as easily do everything mentioned using CentRHEL if you wanted.  of what youll learn is just the Linux way of doing things file paths will change init systems will vary but deep down its pretty much the same.,sysadmin,cejloyy,9,t5_2qnp7

Cold isle separation is a must and a very cheap way to boost how efficient that is is by using the plastic that grocery stores use to cold in the cold in their backroom refrigeration units. We use it at our data center to isolate cold isles and it works like a charm helps that it is pretty cheap and sold by the roll. However I can say that there are a few things that need to be covered if you havent thought of them. humidity you will be much MUCH more efficient with cooling if you are in the  to  range. I am not sure that a coil fan would be able to maintain those levels. . Metal Box A shipping container is a big oven make sure that thing gets put in the shade or is somehow blocked from the sun. If that thing is sitting in the hot sun it will be impossible to cool without an industrial leibert system... . Cooling normally you would need  large or  medium size leiberts for this kind of setup with no backup if one has to be brought down I hope that the coil fans will be able to keep up with that kind of heat because it will be blisteringly hot in there.

95421,0,t3_1v6vo4,If we assume that everyone is miss communicating then I have a few theories. Someone is referring to internet explorer as windows explorer. So just ignore that whole part of the issue. Explorer is Explorer. But for the sake of troubleshooting use My Computer or WinE.My next question is how are you moving these files? Are you using a UNC path or a mapped drive? Here is why this is important.If you drag and drop a file from one location to another sometimes Windows makes it a copy action and sometimes it becomes a move action. If you dragdrop to a different drive letter or UNC share then it becomes a copy. If you are working within one share or within one drive letter it becomes a move. Here is why this is important.A file copy will inherit the permissions of the folder where a move will keep the permissions the file had. So a file copied is one that gets the right permissions. A file moved keeps whatever restrictions that file had into the new location. This is the issue that you are facing in your environment. Permissions are going with the file. If you copy a file then delete the original then your problem will go away. I have this issue in my environment. So now I ask the other sysadmins what do I have configured wrong for this to happen? I suspect it is the use of full control instead of readwrite permissions. But I have yet to test that theory.,sysadmin,cepal1q,8,t5_2qnp7

You just need to make some registry changes that take hold on reboot in order to do it. Just be warned that your alignment will slip a bit towards Neutral and Chaotic if you do this in production.Edit apparently I have to explicitly state when something is not supposed to be taken seriously.

216285,0,t1_cf32jxg,gtThe idea that you would simply favor user morale in exchange for a more lax security net is a little disconcerting but thats OK. But again thats the thing. Using letters instead of numbers for a user login is not more lax security. Have you ever heard of passing the hash? Did you know there are tools out there that can steal user credentials from running processes?Do yourself a favor and do a google search of your company website for any email addresses. Surely youll have a least one publicly known email address. Thats enough to get someone to click a link and inadvertently download malware that installs itself and calls me back. Then I command the malware to steal that users credentials and let me operate as if I were them.Just one scenario of many. Your processes sound great but you may be underestimating the technical ease of getting around them. I cant remember the last time I had to guess what a users login username is. At  of companies their login name is the same as their email address. Using ID numbers adds more hassle for the sysadmins than it does to the bad guys.

Here is some random mysql advice Grabbing a my.cnf and increasing random values can be extremely harmful dont do this. percona has a online tool that is decent for lowmedium busy servers. complex joins are slow shard instead OR go all ssd IO and not worry about the joins.  memcached is your friend. use it. If your developers are stubborn and wont use it get mysql . and tie in memcached directly to mysql. use percona or maria instead of oracles community edition a typical setup should look something like this master gt read only slave gt backup server gt disaster recovery  you may want a retention server in there as well.  semisynchronous replication works pretty good req mysql . master master replication works but dont use mmm use mysql master master or tungsten or galera. ram is cheap buy lots! dont use  large buffer pool split into  gig or less. ie  gigs of ram   buffer pools at least tho this varies on your db. use innodb and turn on file per table. myisam is old and busted. setup extensive monitoring of mysql. I use collectd and my modification to the mysql plugin and gather  metrics every  seconds per mysql instance. Doing something like this is necessary to understand your bottlenecks. dont be afraid to hire a consultant. there are many companies that have spent a lot of time tuning mysql and can do it rather fast. whats better you spending a month or a consultant spending  hours?Good luck.Shawn,sysadmin,cfaob9a,3,t5_2qnp7

To me not writing a cover letter is lazy and the equivalent of showing up to an interview in khakis and an untucked polo shirt it might work for a student help desk position but not a sysadmin in my world. Im going to disagree with everyone else. I personally think a good cover letter is a good thing. Dont bother if youre writing is shit and you cant be bothered to fix spelling errors and use proper grammar. Learn to write a decent resume and cover letter. I cannot tell you the amount of resumes and letters that end up in the bin because they are just terrible. I dont know you all I know is these two pieces of paper you give me. The cover letter is a chance for you tell me in a short narrative why I should hire YOU instead of the other schlub. If youre a decent communicator which a lot of technical people are NOT you have a leg up.Also customize your cover letter and resume to MY job description. Look at the dutiesresponsibilities and requirements and make your resume match those. I dont read those keyword experience with XYZ sections. Those are for machines. If you want to tell me you have an excellent knowledge of Active Directory it should show through in your positions descriptions.If you are employed you should be selective enough about applying for jobs that you can take  minutes to put together a proper application. Small pet peeve I work for a public university when we get cover letters that say I would be a valuable asset to your company it looks lazy. It looks to us like you did not bother to look at who you were applying to. If you had sad organization or team ok. But never company for us. Culture is a very real thing.

334296,0,t1_cffewen,So heres my little story about the VMware clock. So we have HP switches and up until the last quarter of last year the switches only supported NTP v which is super obscure. Ive worked IT for quite sometime and I cant remember a single device Ive ever used that didnt support NTP v... Anyway moving on. So our switches were pulling NTP from our ISP and serving as our stratum . So naturally I wanted our VMware hosts to pull from stratum  and essentially be stratum  so that the DCs could pull from stratum . Low and behold I found out that the ntpd.conf in ESXi had to be edited to account for using NTP v. So I went to work and changed the configs by hand using ssh and VI across like  ESXi hosts. Fast forward a few weeks later I noticed some crazy drift on the scale of like  minutes between stratum  and stratum . So whats going on? I looked around and apparently my ESXi hosts were no longer receiving NTP from the core switches... I dug around for a few days and I found out when the servers restart for whatever reason they overwrite the ntpd.conf with whatever is listed in the GUI. So all of my modifications to the ntpd.confs to account for having to use NTP v versus NTP v the default got trashed and I had to set them back up again. Finally HP updated their switches to use NTP v Q  which took care of a lot of the issue. So just a heads up NTP settings in the ESXi GUI overwrite any customization youve made t othe ntpd.conf file... Fun eh?,sysadmin,cfff4uu,2,t5_2qnp7

355888,0,t1_cfhng4s,Ok thanks for the clarification.Im willing to bet youd just need to set up the local accounts on those machines to allow remote access to your specific public IP rather than the entire world. Then when you disjoin from the domain you RDP to the local administrative account and rejoin to the domain. What youre seeing here is the fact that when youre on a domain its policy applies and when you disjoin the local policy applies. If the local policy is not set to allow remote access via the firewall being on without  allowed in and RDP turned on then you will not be allowed remote access. Either way if you have to call your MSP anyway because you absolutely need to access the computers and cant then you may as well get on the horn with them and when they arrive have them set this up for you and test it out on a PC and if its gravy get them to set up the rest.Then you wont need to call them anymore.Edit I agree with Tymanthius about TeamViewer in the interim until you can get the MSP out there.

579848,0,t3_20qz5y,    What do I look for Depth of sensorMIB access. I want a monitoring package which makes it easy to import vendorspecific MIBs so I can monitor non standard devices for example my boss wants me to monitor lowlevel SAN status via SNMP which can be done with a custom MIB that I need to munge into the monitoring program. Options for multiple alert methods with smart escalation as uTheFatHobbits said below parentchild alerts so if the parent goes down I dont get a dozen or more alerts about the child  email amp SMS for starters CACTIstyle graphing for network devicesinterfaces  I use Cacti because I need to be able to look at a given interface on a network device and say Thats run XXX gigabytes of traffic in the last dayweekmonth for capacity and billing management. However Cacti has no alerting and doesnt really play well with some devices see point  so I currently have to run multiple monitoring boxes to get what I need Easy intuitive management. Im leaning to buying PRTG because you just plug in your credentials and it goes off to discover everything  but I run into the MIB situation on that too so its not perfect.    Order of use Status Threshold Device stats Email alerts    Number of devicesCouple of hundred at the moment with as many as  monitored instances per device most average  per device.    What do I currently payNothing except computer time  but only because we havent yet decided which paid product to replace Nagios with.    What would you be willing to payDepends how good the product it. As I said were looking at PRTG which is a one off fee based on the number of sensors  Im looking at somewhere between the  and  level  which is a one off fee and an annual maintenance. I dont hold with monthly costs for services  they tend to go up and up and up once they become irreplaceable and end up being a millstone around your figurative neck to keep running.If you have some details of your Beta Im willing to give it a shot.

586254,0,t3_20upkl,To learn networking begin looking to a network book. Its been a long time since Ive done that so I cant be too much help but this will give you understanding of networking topologies and standards.As far as windows go get yourself a trial version of server  r or  r. Build a virtual environment and create and AD environment from scratch. Create users groups computer printers and a file structure. Create a company share and begin locking folders down using NTFS permissions. Search for NTFS permissions and use that knowledge to lock down your file structure. Accounting needs access to accounting and operations HR needs access to HR but not operations etc. Create scenarios in your head and challenge yourself but never use deny! Now your users need access to those shares do you want to create them for each user? Probably not so learn how to create drive mappings with GPO. Browse through it the group policy editor. You can do absolutely amazing things with it! Automation is key to make your job easier.edit Create a VM running windows  pro and join it to the domain to test your users and GPO policies.For a  user environment this may be overkill unless they are security conscience but it will never hurt to learn. Everything regarding windows can be googled. If you really want to learn grab a book I recommend a training guide They are aimed at experienced users but they have step by step guides.,sysadmin,cg6wt9z,3,t5_2qnp7

590870,0,t3_20wprk,I think this is a question that no one really wants to know the answer to. If your DC is recoverable you should recover it ASAP. If its not recoverable you should go ahead and seize the roles do your metadata clean up and bring the DC back as a  fresh installation.If youre contemplating taking the DC down for a prolonged period of time I would go ahead and transfer the roles to a DC that isnt going to go down just to keep the gremlins at bay.All that said you probably could run for quite some time assuming major changes dont happen all that often on your network. Schema updates are rare usually done when youre upgrading AD or you install an application that adds an attribute to users. No Schema master is not a huge deal on a day to day basis. Lack of a Domain Naming Master is going to be a problem when you try to bring a new DC online or otherwise making major changes to your domainforest infrastructure. Again day to day probably not an issue. PDC Emulator role isnt as important assuming youre on XP or newer everywhere and running your domain in native mode since I believe its really only for NT legacy support. It would probably be more visible in a mixed mode environment. RID Master would probably be your first problem role eventually. Each DC has a pool of RIDs available already but as you create users and groups that pool would eventually dry up and without a RID master to replenish it youd have some real problems. Infrastructure master I believe really only comes into play when youve got a multidomain environment. If youve only got a single domain it doesnt do anything.,sysadmin,cg7fp48,9,t5_2qnp7

As long as it is not at the office it safe and because it is encrypted the risk of loss isnt that big. It is only a backup not the main storage of data. If something happens to the backup no biggie just order some new tapes.  Do you have an entire offsite backup? If you dont bringing a tape home is a good way to ensure you do.  If your company loses all of its data its probably dead. Even if it takes a month to rebuild everything from tapes there at least is a chance it will continue.,sysadmin,cgnvks6,2,t5_2qnp7

If youve got lots of spare time you can do it but for only  per year for the enterprise version of LastPass I dont really see the point.LastPass has features that I absolutely love. The three main things I love about it are that the user doesnt need to remember anything but their windows login I can tell it to let users log into websites and applications without being able to see the password and it makes setting up logins to multiple websites and applications super easy since theres no need to distribute a big list of passwords to new users. Some sites dont require each person to have their own login so we can use the same userpass for everyone. Since they dont need to know the password we never have to worry about changing it. Logins are as simple as clicking a button so theres no need to copypaste either.For sharing credentials outside the company like to consultants and MSPs I can create a shared group and add their LP account to it. It saves the trouble of trying to tell someone a complex password over the phone. I can also link my personal LastPass account to my work account so I have access to all of my logins without having to switch accounts and without anyone at work being able to access my personal sites. Theres also a security check tool. It can tell you if you have duplicate passwords anywhere tell you if any of your logins has ever been on one of those lists that has millions of logins on it and just recently they added a section that checks all of your sites for any that are vulnerable to Heartbleed as well as whether or not theyve updated their certificate.Last it doesnt matter if Im connected to the network or even to the internet. I can still access my logins and can make changes then when I reconnect its all automatically synced back up for me. If you need to carry your passwords or secure notes with you into a secure area you dont have to remember to make a copy of a database. Its all handles automatically for you on your laptop tablet or phone.,sysadmin,cgpk6ef,4,t5_2qnp7

Bearing in mind recruiters are of little help as they see a candidate with limited professional Linux experience and so Im guessing are not very inclined to put these candidates forward given the likelihood of their being hired is low. these people are often senior enough that taking a junior linux role should one ever be advertised is not feasible from an economic point of view i.e. they are leveraged to the point where a pay cut is simply not an option  mortgage kids etc.  that Linux roles advertise for a completely different skillset that many MS admins are familiar with bash scripting some programming i.e pythonperlruby automation tomcat java jboss scaling web apps etc. Given your earlier statements about a resume speaking for itself and the Linux community not caring about certs how would you suggest OP goes about trying to branch out?

940286,0,t1_chb3ldj,Full volume or full disk encryption is actually only relevant when a machine is powered off  once the machine is powered on and encryption PINskeysetc. are passed to unlock the drive encryption is fairly useless if someone has physical access to the machine DMA ports are not disabled in BIOS and can thus attach something to the machine to gather the encryption keys from RAM via attacks like this a BIOS password and DMA ports like firewire being disabled in BIOS protects against this sort of attack for the most part.  Physical access to a running system is actually a scenario that encryption DOESNT protect you from.  It can protect the disks or volumes on said disks if the device is removed and attempted to be used from another location but access to a running system with an encrypted and unlocked volume means its no more protected than if it wasnt encrypted at all if other precautions are not taken.,sysadmin,chb5ztr,1,t5_2qnp7

The token life cycle is rather high understandable as  services auth requests for countless organizations and not just your   of users.  it decreases their processing load.  Therefore any changes at the account level dont propagate the new permissions until the token for that session is renewed.  ukliman i like your idea of emptying the MBX and allowing that to sync.  if someone had outlook installed and running on their home computer it could purge their info!  still alot of coordination time and no guarantee it has the entire desired effect though.From what i am seeing on their azure efforts for device and resource access management i would imagine there is something to address this by the next release.TLDR OPs request does not currently have a solution. ,sysadmin,chc3eda,2,t5_2qnp7

I interviewed and recommended people based on what I was doing at the time and also where I was at when I started there. What they already knew or claimed they could do was less important than how they reacted to scenarios or asking them how they would tackle a problem. Ask some easy questions some medium ones questions related to what they put on the resume and ask them something impossible or very tough to see how they handle it.I did my best to document things in the internal wiki that I felt would be the most time consuming to guesslearn which I had to do coming in and clean up all my notes and stick them in a section on the wiki for the team.I didnt offer any support to management after my last day but my coworkers were friends so they all knew they could contact me if they needed to.

So this is a programmer with a specialty in business as administration.Private Devry University of Phoenix these degrees are related to what we do the most imho. ,sysadmin,chkz32s,1,t5_2qnp7

You then tried to state what my position is but you are wrong on many points.gt your elitist antiintellectual ideologiesWe work in IT which is inherently intellectual. There is absolutely no antiintellectual ideology by any stretch of the imagination. What there is however is antibadeducation ideology and thats the whole concept behind the industry certifications. People would rather see CCNA than Bachelors of Science. Not because CCNA is remarkable. Infact  of the CCNAs I have interviewed so far did not know sh run but rather CCNA accounts for something. Im not sure what right now but something more than a bachelors degree. All the bachelors degree means is that they are stupidly in debt now.What you are seeing as an attack against intellectual is not an attack on intellectuals but an attack on people who are effectively posers.Math? Physics? Nothing has changed in  years really at the bachelors level. If youve memorized some book you probably can teach it. IT? There isnt even a book. The people who wrote the book are often people who cant get a job in IT because they are clueless so the quality of the book is just that much worse. Which is why we see Microsoft and such publishing their own because the alternative is dreadful.Dont get me wrong.

Not only does this person not understand how hard OP is working but this person cant grasp the basics of their native language.gtGrettings Sysadmins.I come to you as someone who has almost no clue about what a system administrator REALLY does and running my own small business this has caused me some headache lately...I need your honest opinions so I can better evaluate if I actually get my moneys worth or if Im being crewed over by my IT guy simply because I lack understanding of the work he does.I run a small business  employees including myself. We use computers for design work editing videos communication research etc. We are very dependent on our computers but none of us is good with computers. So about a year ago I hired an IT guy who is in  days a week. His main tasks areto make sure our computers are working and securemake sure our file server is running and securedo maintenance on our company websitesTake care of backups etc.Find new software we need for specific tasks and teach people to use it.Help with any problems users might have with their computers etc.In the first couple of months everything was fine there was a lot of progress. We moved to a larger office and my IT guy planned the new network ordered and setup a linux server for employees to share files devised a backup strategy and switched all the computers over to use a domain so now people can use whatever desk they want. He also made some improvements to our website introduced some new software that helped organize work better.As said during that time there was a lot of tangible progress and I felt that I definitly got my moneys worth. But for the last couple of months some tasks seem to take forever.One example would be a small website we needed for an event. It tkok him two weeks to set it up and I really wasnt impressed by the way it looked. I took the weekend to read some tutorials about wordpress and managed to setup a website and find a nice looking theme that seems to do pretty much everything I need... Confronted with that he said something about focussing on fuction instead of design first and that he had little time due to his other duties. Which quite frankly sounded like a lame excuse.Another example is fixing email problems. I took over a week until I could use my main address to send out emails again because it was somehow blocked for alledgedly sending spam. My IT guy basically said that it was in the hands of the provider that hosts our email and webspace and he couldnt really do much besides pestering them every  days. I have the feeling that whenever there is a problem with our websites or emails he always shifts the blame over to the hosting company so he wont have to deal with it right away...He always looks to be busy typing stuff in his black linux box reading code i guess? surfing on website that appear to deal with IT stuff... but is he really working or just slacking off? How long does maintenance amp security stuff actually take? And shouldnt most of it be automated anyway? Why would there even be a need to check if there were problems with the backup check for explodes that need fixing etc.?Any hints on how I can evaluate my system administrators work are highly appreciated! Having an employee who only deals with the IT stuff is kind of a luxury given the size of the company. I do realize that we are very dependend on our computers working but I hope you can understand that I dont want to pay someone just for the vague feeling my IT is being taken care of...,sysadmin,chp31oc,5,t5_2qnp7

1069575,0,t1_chpuoez,NIST was kind enough to introduce these terms data in motion data in use data at rest etc as guidelines to give everyone a common language to talk about these issues with but there are no universal requirements to secure any of these categories.It depends on the threatrisk you are mitigating against.  If youre worried about an attacker breaking into your colo unplugging the server taking it home and trying to get the data off the drives FDE would do the trick which is why it is so popular in laptops that is a common concern for them.  If you are worried about an attacker gaining virtual access to the server and reading sensitive files it benefits you none.  Actually it has a negative value there just think about what is going to happen the next time that server reboots.It also depends on the use you will have for the data you are protecting.  If this is a password database you can salt and hash them while they are still in use then only rest them as those hashes.  An attacker gaining access to those hashes assuming the salt isnt stored on the same server and youve iterated the hash enough times could be mitigated long enough for you to notice the breach and reset them all.  Data that has to be unencrypted would have to be protected differently of course.Sorry I cant give you an easy answer but if youre legitimately trying to improve security you need to spend a lot of time thinking about the risks you are protecting against before you implement technological solutions to mitigate them.  If however you are just trying to check a box on an audit or comply with a firedandforgotten policy directive the easy shortcut solution is to define all data on the server while it is poweredon as in use and all data on poweredoff servers as at rest.  Then FDE will comply with the data at rest policy.,sysadmin,chpv5pg,7,t5_2qnp7

1076397,0,t3_26ekz4,I started studying for the MCSA probably in late Februaryearly March. I took the  in the beginning of April and I just took the  last week.My experience is this as far as what Ive used and can tell I would stay away from the Trainsignal videos. I dont know if there are updated R videos from Pluralsight that are better but I found them entirely too general to help. The exams are very specific and go in much more depth. I found the CBT Nuggets videos on youtube for the  and  not sure about  as I havent started studying yet and I found these videos were an excellent resource. James Conrad breaks down things very well and provides more text and details than just going through the OS and hitting next to install some roles.I used the Sybex MCSA book.Its got a lot of great details and is a great start in getting everything introduced if you havent experienced it before. There are screenshots and details that are helpful to be able to go deeper into. There are practice questions and a practice testexam provided and while I dont find they quite match up to the test its a good basis on how well youve been doing. The only problem with this I found is that the book covers all three tests so the chapters may contain info for only one of the tests or for all three of the tests. If youre studying test by test you may run into material you wont need at all. Pay attention to the information at the top of each chapter where it breaks down the sections by what applies to which test.Obviously if possible while going through the book set up a virtual lab in hyperv. The reason I recommend hyperv is because youll have to learn it anyway. For those you dont want to configure or maybe dont have the resources check out the technet virtual labs. I found them missing important complex labs I would have liked such as Network Access Protection or Network Policy Server in general but its a good place to go. I personally did not end up using any of the virtual labs yet.I recommend the BornToLearn wikis for each test There is a trove of information here. Also usually a good place to start to see what may have changed since R since these have been updated before many books have been published honestly in my two tests despite spending the last two days before  reading all the whats new in R articles and diligently studying things like gen  VMs I didnt find much if any R specific material.While Im doing this I keep a OneNote notebook that I can keep notes in from all these different resources and keep a page of little phrases or commands Id like to get more information on. The last week before the test I spend most of my time on Technet getting things like usage syntax optional switches and detailed explanations of functions. Its helpful to go through and list certain powershell commands related to roles or be familiar with all the commands you can use with netsh or ntdsutil etc. If youre going to use braindumps thats the step Id recommend using them. Not necessarily to gather answers but to gather the areas youre not familiar with or comfortable with. The answers in braindumps are a mess and some claim to give you explanations of the right answers but the few I looked through had explanations that were blatantly wrong or missed the point of the question. Go through and brush up on things you dont know with technet. I think when properly used together all these tools create a very wellrounded knowledge of the material while allowing you to skip things you know for example if youre already a networking guru you dont need to spend that much time learning IPv for  and understanding how DNS works and learn things you know virtually nothing about from scratch. I believe any one resource alone wouldnt be enough to pass. I looked at some of the training guides and exam refs from Microsoft and found them to be pretty subpar. Technet is the best resource but its so incredibly vastthats why I like the BornToLearn wikis most of the footwork has been done and you can use it to get other information.Lastly you really want to focus on networking. There is a lot about DNS DHCP and IPv on the first test. I found there was a good deal of HyperV on . Youll want to know Active Directory very well and youll want to know Group Policy maybe even better for the first two for sure.  has a ton more networking info with Routing and Remote Access Network Access Protection different authentication methods like knowing when you would use EAPTLS vs MSCHAP v.tldr The tests are honestly a bitch. Use any resource you can get your hands on to supplement your knowledge. Practice and use what youve learned in virtual labs. Get familiar with the right click context menus for EVERYTHING and every wizard you can access. Read the questions on the test itself VERY carefully and go back and review all your answers once youre done. They WILL trick you if youre not careful. And finally if you dont know much about powershell start learning. Not only is it a very useful tool to have in your arsenal anyways learning the verbnoun format and getting familiar with how its typically set up will help you extrapolate correct answers and rule out wrong ones on the test when you do get powershell questions that pop up. Get comfortable with it and the test wont be as bad.EDIT Also wanted to mention they have the  Days to MCSA program at Microsoft that has study and training materials. I found the MVA courses Like this  to be much more of a time sink than helpful. Dont waste your time watching  hours of material here.,sysadmin,chqn1om,13,t5_2qnp7

You can automate this process and have it recover boot and test your backups and email you screenshots of the recovered VM so you can confirm working backups.

The rDNS entry is a solid building block for sure but we need to continue leveraging DNS to plant hints out on the Internet that will afford those machines the ability to strongly disambiguate your legitimate traffic from the noise.  Lets dive into the wonderful world of SPF records and well proactively prevent it from biting you down the line. GMTSPF the Sender Policy Framework is a way to leverage DNS to provide recipient servers with a way to reach out and help them determine whether or not email claiming to be from any domain is legit.  The system is designed to softfail but it is authoritative enough to allow for a hardfail should the receiving end support it.  And today all the ones worth talking to do.By querying DNS we can see that your rdo.co.uk domain appears to have external DNS hosting performed by a set of servers identified as Phase  Light googling comes up with a domain registrarhosting company Namesco.

The overall design and syntax of SPF is pretty good in that it allows extreme flexibility without becoming too ambiguous from a computers standpoint.

The perspective is that of me making a statement to the receiving email server.gtWhen an email comes in to your SMTP connector and the headers of that email indicate that the senders address ends with rdo.co.uk perform a DNS A record lookup of the domain names present in the rdo.co.uk MX record.So the first operation performed by the mail server when it evaluates this operator is to check where an email bound for an rdo.co.uk mailbox would be sent and were saying here that our outbound email and inbound email can originate and terminate at the same IP.So what if I was sending an email to userrdo.co.uk?gt Look up the MX record.      We see that the mail exchangers domain name is exchange.rdo.co.uk So lets see what the IP address is for exchange.rdo.co.uk.     Looks like the IP is ...Then we ask the rather elementary questiongt Did this email that claims to be from an rdo.co.uk mailbox originate from ...? ip...The IP range specified by the CIDR formatted string ... is a valid set of IPs from which rdo.co.uk email will originate. aexchange.rdo.co.ukThe IP address that exchange.rdo.co.uk resolves to is a valid source for email that is from an rdo.co.uk address.        Time for a quick side note    Normally after you affirmatively state the same thing three times to someone who already comprehends your intent youd probably be due a good solid smack for being that annoying.  But in the world of email and the mind of a programmer repetitive reinforcement is a good thing.This comes into play as part of both a reassurance of longevity for you and reassurance to a receiving server.  For example if you change your MX record to split off inbound and outbound email to different servers or services you can still maintain uninterrupted delivery from your existing server.  We facilitate future changes here without having to specifically state that such changes are planned or coming.Such flexibility is our requisite sysadminly solace!        ...and back to your record.     includespf.google.comNow were also saying the followinggtIn addition to the servers listed here email claiming to be from an rdo.co.uk mailbox can also originate from the servers specified in the SPF record of the domain spf.google.comSo you might be thinking heregtWhy?  I dont use Google Apps for Business.  Ive got Exchange.Ever done something like this?The emails that go out from those sharing invitations show up as having been sent from your Google accounts email address.  And a Google account can be bound to any valid email address including an rdo.co.uk one.  Presuming that you trust Google not to impersonate you or your users you facilitate the use of popular web apps in your organization and simultaneously avoid phone calls from users.  Winwin.For some history on thisgtIt turns out that restricting the source of any domains email really gets in the way of how email was designed to work.  The reason that the SPF record is required and half of these extremely obvious DNS lookups are necessary is because the relay of email from your users email client apps through something like your exchange server is supposed to be optional.  The reason that doing it any other way seems rather bizarre is because we like to hold on to emails that weve sent and we like to see a consistent view of a mailbox on every device forever.  But its perfectly within the spec for me to send an email from some other locationbypassing my inboxs server entirelyand for it to arrive in the recipients inbox without my server ever knowing.gtStoreandforward was the intention and is still the architecture of how email delivery works even today.  But thats just not how we use it anymore.  We expect a consistent stateful experience with email and retention times that approach eternity.gtSo thats what we did.  And we built it on top of a system that operates in a completely paradoxical fashion. allAnd finally the coup de gracegt If an email says that its from an rdo.co.uk address but did NOT originate from ANY of the servers listed in this record then the emails sender is a lying sack of sht and you should mark it as spam.You could change this from all to all which changes the above statement togt...then the emails sender might be lying so use your best judgment.I suggest all because Ive never known a computer to make a rational decision.  Theyre really good at doing precisely what we tell them so if you think that such precision is reasonable in your scenario then I heartily recommend it.This may flow over into tomorrow because Im gonna take another break.

With the example I posted it is possible to get an order of magnidute more ram gb and gb disk space for the same cost.I agree bandwidth can be a problem as well as CPU. A potential solution could be to just have a limit on bandwidth but I would prefer to just try and email anyone using too much to see if they can cooperate.As far as administration goes I am assuming it would take about a day or something to set up all the VMs and maybe provide an API for a user to be able to force restart their VM or delete their VM and start a new one.Trust is an issue for sure. But trust is also an issue for basically every single kickstarter project but people still seem to be pledging although the pledges do go to stuff way more interesting than a cheap server.

I actually called Microsoft and had one of their techs walk me through the entire process for free. The migration is one of the simplest things you can do and as long as you have a couple of days for the data to push you can actually deploy the Exchange  server and the O server side by side in a hybrid configuration. This enables you to be able to perform the migration live and keeps the Exchange server up. All users continue to get email and you dont have to dick around with MX record changes while everything is migrating.Super easy free and reliable. There are a couple of prereqs though. Exchange  needs to be updated to SP and you have to have an SSL cert to cover the domain plus the autodiscover.domain.com URLs.

1254025,0,t1_ciafuml,I take issue with your list of consgtWhitelisting software is technically hard. You have to whitelist not only the programs but helper programs as well as updates to said programs.Its not hard at all. Its actually easier to implement and maintain than the blacklist in this instance.gtApplication developers dont support it so if youre maintaining a software whitelist it will automatically be blamed for any and all application crashes and youll find it nearly impossible to get support from any of your vendors.This isnt at all true. Its incredibly easy to see where the SRP blocks a file from executing. It takes  minutes to identify and whitelist an application.gtYoure going to get pushback from the organization if you become the gatekeeper of what programs they can and cant run even if thats supposed to be your role. Unless you work for a company that sells security services youll find it difficult if not impossible to advance in role and responsibility and youll constantly be the victim of career assassination attempts by powerful people who dont like the restrictions youve imposed.Unless you are required to meet regulatory requirements then its an easy sell. Additionally your vision of the actual execution is flawed. Its mostly transparent to users who typically dont have administrative rights anyway.gtYou wont receive the resources you need to maintain a whitelist. Its a fulltime job in all but the smallest organizations and while management will always pay lip service to security it drops in priority very quickly when they have to spend a nontrivial amount of money on it.I might spend  minutes per month on this and Im the only one doing it. I have  end points.gtEven if you somehow manage to implement and maintain a whitelist enough programs allow arbitrary code execution by accident and design that malware like Cryptolocker can still get through so you still need to run your typical suite of security programs antimalware file integrity monitoring intrusion detection security event logging etc..Ive somehow managed to do it for years without issue. Ive also repeated MANY TIMES ALREADY that this is just one piece of security. Its also VERY effective protection against malware because of the way malware is typically executed.gtIf malware slips through the whitelist youll be raked over the coals for not defending against a security breach. Sure if all youre doing for security is an application whitelist. Who does that?gtIf the whitelist successfully defends against malware intrusions youll be raked over the coals for wasting company time and resources for something that doesnt appear to do anything at all. LOL no you wont. Most of our jobs are transparent to the company.gtYou will constantly have to spend time and energy justifying the usefulness of your own job....and this is new to our jobs how?You dont have a problem whitelisting in the firewall or maybe you do? whats the difference here?,sysadmin,ciaoygb,4,t5_2qnp7

1259000,0,t1_cianrl0,In my organization I found that most sysadmin operations were very transactional that is they were all tickets. This doesnt fit scrum at all. Tickets are a completely different form of project management.No one is going to wait until the end of the next sprint. Yes you can add PBIs mid sprint.Yes PBIs can be delivered before the end of the sprint. But both of these are exceptions to the rule. For sysadmin delivering before the end of next sprint is standard operating procedure.Sysadmin kinda fits a more generic kanban model.However there is an aspect of SysAdmin that is more big picture researching new products integrating new products souptonuts into ones infrastructure replacing infrastructure. These arent transactional. This stuff fits more into the traditional scrum model.Recognizing this distinction has been critical in my organization to prioritize tasks and make agile work for us.As a sidenote I avoid burndown charts like the devil. I rally my stakeholders behind achieving certain milestones in a certain time frame. Yes I know this isnt scrum. I argue that driving a team based on a relative number isnt scrum either.

1264213,0,t1_ciarwju,Can confirm ... when I was  following an IT oriented high school program there were  of us ... and we were all little IT crowd hooligans. Sure ... learning how to properly code C is fun but writing  lines of codes that will fill your computers memory in a couple of seconds and then blue screen the machine seemed way more fun. This is what I remember we did on that school. Poor sysadmins of that school... but they did a fairly decent job. during the exams half the school was taking them on computers. It was done using a intranet website with internet being disabled on the exam computer. We scheduled every computer we had access to so it would start a bat script that would just ping some network servers using all different kind of options and ping sizes. Then the script would open itself    times based on how powerful the hardware was. It completely disrupted the exams.  I was not responsible for the plan nor the execution but I did help to write these simple stupid scripts and schedule them properly we scheduled other scripts that would try to access other computers remotely ... so when somebody removed a schedule ... if we had the right credentials it would put the scheduled bat scripts back in there ... quite advanced . I am not proud for it .... but it felt .... I dont know ...  little computer hooligans making half the school have to reschedule all the exams ... finally giving up and doing them on paper. We felt like we had some destructive power. I only did  weeks suspension. Some of my class mates got criminal charges. Then it wasnt really fun anymore Some teacher forgot to logout ... having an excel spreadsheet open with all the usernames and passwords of the student windows domain accounts in it. Even a lot of other teachers accounts were in there. A guy from my class one of the  hooligans saw it and tried to mail the file to himself. He was busted big time. we have never found out if it was not a setup with the school sysadmin on remote desktop or something ... plugged or own router from home in between the switch and the uplink and then fool around just to see what would happen. mainly a very pissed sysadmin charging the room ripping the router from its power fixing the connection and leaving with the router without saying a single word  plugged or own routers in to the wifi AP socket ... disconnecting the AP but giving us access to the WAN bandwith  mbit back in  without having the wireless bottleneck. I never forget that one linux iso I downloaded on my laptop with  MBs when my connection at home only did  kbs at max. I still wonder if I hit the harddrive bottleneck on my  laptop hard drive that day ... Locked ourselves in after a school day. At night we installed a barebone pc in a locker .... drilled holes in the back of the locker ... connect power cable camouflaged extension cord and lan cable. We found a lost socket that was not being used. So we disconnected a nearby AP .. connected the socket to a router that we put in the locker and plugged the AP back in the router. This way if the sysadmins saw a lot of traffic it would be a little harder for them to troubleshoot. Then we leeched the shit out of the schools connection and when the hard drive was full we would take it out the barebone and pass it around the school. It worked flawlessly for  months until one asshole was like Hey I can ask money for these movies ... then it was over a couple of week later. Nobody ever got in trouble for it to ... accept for the guys that now where missing a lot of their own hardware  hard drives ... an expensive barebone .... and some routers and switches. At the end of the  months we had  barebone PCs with two external harddrives a switch and a router and a powerbar in a tiny ass locker .... the whole locker rack actually felt a little bit warmer then the other locker rack  Fooled around with ARP spoofing until one day the entire WAN traffic of the school was being forwarded to one idiots laptop over WIFI I was that idiot using CainampAble. It was fixed  hours later and never worked anymore.  That day that somebody hacked the domain controller or sysadmins did a whoopsie ... who will ever know and enabled net send again on  computers and three hours later when OUR class found out we could have messages pop up on EVERY one of those  computers. I will never forget that day. That was a good day. ,sysadmin,cibu8xc,1,t5_2qnp7

Unless your current employer is OK with you borrowing equipmenttools you will need to purchase your own.  One of the reasons my customers pay my rate instead of a competitors or wannabes sometimes lower rate is the tools I can bring to bear making my team more efficient faster and ultimately more economical.  Using a Fluke Digital Toner to trace cables quickly even under challenging circumstances around fluorescent lighting  feet above a suspended ceiling through masonry or extremely thick sheetrock etc. is a huge advantage.  Not cheap either.  Every cable my team installs is verified with a Fluke Cable Qualifier with a traceable certification.  Any tool you can use to more quickly troubleshoot an Enterprise Down situation will allow you to inflate your rate.  A laptop and a serial cable wont cut it.  Invest all the money you can afford in good tools or better tools.  Use the best quality punchdown tool you can afford there is a difference between a monoprice brand tool and a better tool.  You may not be able to tell the difference on the first punch but after punching down several patch panel your hand and wrist can tell.  If you do any cabling install work get the right tools fish sticks telepoles stepladder etc.  Being able to assume a task that the other guy was unable to complete will be your calling card.

1290114,0,t1_cieqnii,We had one guy who and I can only assume this is because I am fat tried to bribe me with cake.  He was so jovial and whimsical until he realized I was borderline diabetic and was on a low carb low sugar diet.  My smile of no thank you completely dumbfounded him.  He had never seen someone refuse cake before.  This actually made him nervous and upset.Part of the problem was until I came along a previous set of managers had hired these insane contracts with for the most part terrible workers.  While this was not the MAJORITY thankfully a lot of these contracted developers blamed everything on typical Linux problems.  Linux was hard.  Linux was temperamental.   Linux was fussy and confusing.  Yet they needed Linux for all their applications so what can you do?So I was hired to fix all the Linux issues.  I was the first Linux admin the company ever had and at first I was quite the novelty.  But some of the less skilled and less motivated developers again mostly from these bad contracts felt threatened.  Mostly because I started to call out all their bullshit under request of the IT Director.  A few of these contracts had unethical program managers who did a lot of busy work that was doing nothing.  So the IT director and I worked in tandem.  He is a very stern man who knows how to get results and just asked me to bother the PMs every day for progress reports and soon it became apparent who was actually doing productive work.So a few resorted to bribery.  One offered me gift baskets from his country.  Another offered me liquor I dont drink either which stymied the American stereotype they were dependent on.  None of this was legal and I reported it which then led to the threats in one case.  The cake guy was strange though.  He treated his developers like children and gave them noogies and kiss them on the tops of their heads I am not kidding.  He was very touchyfeely notably with younger guys like massaging their shoulders and stuff.  His big thing was he told everyone he couldnt do their project because he was working on another project.  And he told THOSE people he was working on another project.  And so on.  So basically he was always too busy doing someone elses project to do any project.This was the guy who in the end threatened me.  And his contract was not renewed.,sysadmin,cier5v9,3,t5_2qnp7

Second what you propose might lead to more offshoring but I dont think itd increase it as rapidly as unionizing likely would. A lot of companies hate the idea of their employees unionizing. I think just the word union would have them chomping at the bit to get jobs to India China etc. Getting rid of exempt status might be a slower burn wont have the kneejerk reaction from the Clevels that unionizing would spark if it causes offshoring at all.Unfortunately that requires legislation and legislation takes forever to get pushed through unless youve got the dough to push it through. So from where Im standing were in a catch situation. Cant unionize or companies would try to dump us as quickly as possible. But the people worried about overtime pay dont likely have the money to lobby for legislation change without some sort of union.BTW for whoever downvoted listen  Im not opposed to the idea of unions. However given how so many companies today are shortsighted these days and given the reactions they have to the word union practically speaking now isnt the time for that.

1350360,0,t1_ciksn71,I think your idea of the system is lacking in a lot of facts but not in FUD.. Many Canadian businesses use email databases not obtained legitimately. Ive had to actively prevent a marketing manager from using an email list without any kind of confirmation. The line theres an unsubscribe button at the bottom if they dont want it theyll just click that was uttered. The mentality was we only have  addresses collected by our website we need to send this mailer out to at least  and hope for at least  impressions. Even now I personally in the past  weeks have received  emails from businesses asking to provide my consent to receive their newsletter. Companies I never once dealt with. For example a dealership sent me such an email. I dont drive and have never owned a car. Never stepped foot on the premise of that dealership nor visited their website. My email wasnt obtained legitimately.. No verification? The process isnt allegationfine as you indicate. An investigation is done to first gather evidence if sufficient evidence is found and the company in question isnt be cooperative with the investigation then the civil case is brought before a justice the allegation and evidence can then be challenged in court. In your example it would be easily proven that the email didnt originate from your competitors email servers its highly unlikely that the investigation would even lead to a day in court in your scenario. This is all well documented and publicly available information.. Saying that spam regulation wont have any effect on spam and only punish legitimate businesses is like saying distracted driving laws dont have any effect on collision rates and drivers are just being punished. This is a bit hyperbolic but the point is it will have an effect on spam that you may receive from legitimate Canadian businesses it puts the onus on the business to think twice about how they use your personal information. It forces those shady locals to reconsider their unethical behaviour.What ill effects are you referring to? We know that the monetary fine isnt an automatic so legitimate businesses that a following the rules will be unaffected. Its not exactly difficult to be compliant with CASL you document the policy implement the procedures and audit it all annually. Sure some businesses will be inconvenienced but it wont impact their business greatly.CASL is consumer protection just like the truth in advertising laws I dont know about you but I enjoy the fact that the Canadian government protects me as a consumer.,sysadmin,cilk4zq,0,t5_2qnp7

I regularly talk to numerous people in multiple industries and this is more or less how it works. Im painfully aware of how raises are granted at companies ranging from Microsoft to office supply companies you havent heard of that are actually quite large and you probably get everything from without realizing it to smaller businesses. People like to say you have to negotiate but that isnt how it works. When you have ten thousand employees nobody is more important than anyone else. Our guy who did  huge projects on his own deserves to be rewarded but hes also a blip on the radar in the scheme of things even though he matters to our division on a daily basis.If you work for a smaller company and think you can personally press the CEO you go ahead and do that. But when theres a budget for raises if one group or person gets more it means someone else somewhere gets less.Even in the nonIT industry if unions really push hard for a big pay increase say  vs the  that the company wants to give it means ultimately that union is going to agree to lay off a certain number of their people to fund that  raise.

1421996,1,t3_2afdr0,Is there a reason you want to do this? Trying to run this kind of business as a one man shop with the limited amount of experience you have is going to severely limit your career growth.Your customers will be forever stuck at your th level experience.The really lucrative consulting stuff comes in with highly specific knowledge like advanced vmware storage networking etc where even large companies might hire you to do this kind of work for oneoff projects and the like. But itll take you a while to get your skill level to that point.So if you go this route youll be stuck with mostly small businesses who dont have their own IT people. Youll end up working on stuff thats smaller than even what a shop with a lone IT guy would do.A lot of this kind of stuff is going to be slowly phased out by cloud services and the like over the next decade. For example an office might have  Windows PCs domain controllers an app server and a file server right now.In the new world it could be  employee personal owned MacBooks and iPads the app server gets replaced by a cloud based web application and the file server gets replaced by dropbox and they need no IT support.What is your motivation behind this career move? Are you unhappy in your current job?It just seems like youre moving in the opposite direction of the industry if you do this. Its not really consulting but more along the lines of PC repair. You dont yet have the skills the big name consultants make and as cloud services and places like the apple store and microsoft store pop up to help users repair their devices I cant see why youd want to be going in this direction.You should be trying to move in the opposite direction and get behind the cloud services and figure out how to combine multiple solutions from different vendors.

Even if it works after rebooting youve wiped out all evidence that you could have used to gain an understanding of the root cause.

1437173,0,t3_2aleb5,gt Might it be wise to spin up a second DC VM to handle DNS and AD services when the primary DC is down for maintenance or otherwise unavailable? I understand running two virtual DCs on a single box isnt ideal.People recommend against using two DC VMs on the same host because it provides incomplete redundancy that can defeat the purpose of having two DCs You want two DCs for a few reasons. First to share the load of the AD roles. And secondly so that if one of them goes down the domain continues to function but what is actually likely to take your DC down?  Network outage  Hardware failure  Operating system failure or human error  Scheduled maintenance that requires downtimeHaving your DC as a second VM on the same host will only protect you from SOME of these things and you get zero load balancing benefits in fact having the second DC on your host just chews up additional resources that would have been better utilized by the first DC.Basically having the DC on a second VM only protects you from human error guest OS issues and scheduled maintenance that only affects the single guest and comes at a cost in resources.It is for this reason that people suggest your second DC should be on a separate physical host if that is feasble for you....But certainly it is not strictly necessary so long as you know what youre giving up.,sysadmin,ciwfcn5,2,t5_2qnp7

1445406,0,t1_cixav3f,It all depends on how youve configured your Guests but if youve over allocated your memory or CPU this can cause an issue as the machines are rebooted.VMWare dedupes memory which allows you to easily over allocate the memory on a physical host while getting great performance from your guests.  However this becomes a major issue after the host is rebooted since all VMs will boot up and start thrashing the memory.  It takes awhile for VMWare to catch up dedupe the memory and performance to return to normal.  Maybe youre rebooting too frequently without giving VMWare a good amount of time to catch up.  Can you pause or shut down VM Guests and see if the same behavior is on a single VM Guest?  If thats the case Id suspect the hardware.  If one Guest works fine then Id look at how memoryCPU are allocated to the VM Guests and trim back as required.  Give them one vCPU for now and see if performance improves.,sysadmin,cixghvl,1,t5_2qnp7

1530754,0,t1_cj851pg,gt TLDR quit fucking bitching and pay attention to the SOW you give a consultant    Here is your double edged sword though.  If a company is expected to outsource their IT department what level of quality do you expect your SOW to come in as written by a nontechnical person at the company hiring you?  Its a bit chicken or the egg Ill admit the company wants to outsource their technical team but doenst have enough knowhow to pass proper requirements to any outsiders.  You as a consultant will never going to get a quality SOW from nontechnical people it will always go back and forth eating up any time savings hiring an outside firm gains.  If the company has any internal tech resources it makes more work for them clarifying basic SOW items.    As for you never hear from your customers complaining from my experience personally  but Ive worked for a lot of companys that hire outside resources  there is a lot of complaining and cleanup internally after the work is done.  It rarely filters back to the consultants because it muddys any future relationships.  Why would we rehire people we know perform subpar should be your next logical question?  Its comes down to the devil you know vs the devil you dont know.  We often rehire people we see has  useful because it gets us close enough using them as staff augmentation VS hiring a new contractor and rinseandrepeating the same process over again.    I think generally consultants can be worse at what they do than full time staff.  The reason is they are only onsite or working remotely for a few months and then leave.  They never have to deal with the aftermath of what they have created or implemented they go on with life thinking they have done well.  This is definitely not the case of everyone Im generalizing a bit but Id confidently say that  of consultants even onsite staff are not good at what they do.  SOW or no SOW doesnt mean you know what you are doing.     PS Its super late here and there are probably a million typos.  Ill check in tomorrow and try to clean this up and reply if needed.,sysadmin,cj85npg,2,t5_2qnp7

1614005,0,t1_cjijwuk,You do not want to do any wiring or mounting of things yourself.  Always either go through building maintenance or hire an outside contractor to make sure you dont cause any issues.  Also check and make sure you will have access to everything you need.  Does the building have a central wiring closet where your external connections will come in?  Who has access to that shared space?  As far as connections go you said that your connection may be provided as part of your lease.  Does that mean that the lines are shared and parceled out piecemeal or do they bring in a dedicated line just for you?  Neither of those options are optimal and you should really see if you can bring in your own.  Along these same lines do any of your equipment closets share space with any of the other tenants?  They probably dont want you in their wiringserver closets and you definitely dont want them in yours.  Find out if the building provides prox card or combination locks for the doors for your closets.  If not that may be an added expense you could be looking at.  What is the policy on power and cooling?  Is there already adequate cooling and power?  If not does the building have electricians to run power connections for you?  Make sure you get this written into your lease.  My guess is that you are going to reconfigure the space to meet your needs.  Make sure to run at least  network drops per officecube as well as adequate power.  Are you going to be running wireless?  If so it may not be a bad idea to bring a spare AP in with you when you do the walk through to see what the wireless congestion is like there as well as how well your signal will travel through the building.

It does however increase the cost of equipment because it is one additional software module that they have to createtestimplementmaintain and it takes up router resources so they have to size router processormemory slightly higher more expensive to account for NAT.IPv actually does put a huge dent in the global routing table size issue because it is being handed out in huge aggregated blocks. My problem at a smallish ISP is that we were assigned IP blocks in stages and we ended up with a bunch of small allocations like s s and s. I would love to be able to aggregate and announce one big prefix like a  or something but we cant really get an aggregated block due to the exhaustion of IPv addresses.IPv is specifically being handed out in huge blocks with adjacent blocks reserved for future assignments so that companies arent forced to announce multiple prefixes just because they have discontinuous IP space.,sysadmin,cjodixy,9,t5_2qnp7

1672116,0,t1_cjpecjb,This is the basics of it. You make a GPO that uses the Restricted Groups feature. This will allow you to add groups and users to local groups on the computers in question. I do suggest using groups to limit who gets the policy. We wanted a way to pull this back for specific peoplegroups who were either problematic or just did not need admin rights. The Interactive user is a special token that is added to the user who logs in interactively on the system. Basically when you login directly via the keyboardmouse or via Remote Desktop. When you try to connect to a network share you are not granted this token and thus are not an administrator.Id say a good  of my users are local admins. It has not really changed our workload in any practical way. Users get the same malware with and without admin rights.

Instead he would write all the user calls on a whiteboard in his office like it was Homicide Life on the Street. Didnt understand that he was part of a TEAM which included another full time a guy on his site plus people rotated in from other sites plus the manager who was in another state. Didnt understand that other people needed to be able to reference calls and driving an hour in from another site to read his whiteboard was a nonstarter.

So when i got access to our metrics i looked at how many tickets these people are doing  Of the  tickets we had that month  people accounted for  of all calls and tickets.   of the rest of the members just sat around on facebook and yahoochat all fucking day long every day for months and months and months one person was coming up on a year of having not done a single ticket.  They just sat in the cubicle and did nothing all day.  It was amazing.So i try to fix this issue maybe they just dont know what they are doing.  So we setup a huge step by step allday training session.  After some basic things i ask one of the members how to do X.  She has no clue.  I said have you been listening at all?  She stands up and says NONE OF US CARE ABOUT ANY OF THIS DONT YOU GET THAT BY NOW?  They all nodded in agreement.  That was the end of the training session.Me and the two other competent people continued to make up  of all tickets while the other  sat around on yahoo and facebook for another year absolutely doing nothing.  Ohhh yea at the end of the contract this guy comes in and says its the last day and he appreciates the work weve all done.  We have no idea who the fuck this guy is.  Who is he?

I have clients with  or more ADDNS servers and I just keep adding them to the list advanced config with itself being at the end.From what I understandremember when I learned about it the entire reason boils down to startup.

For hardware recovery think FBI  where they use fancy magnet things Im not familiar with that in depth forensic data recovery they are working with the actual magnetic resonance of the media. Theory being that if you knew the overwrite pattern you could sift through it and reconstruct what was below the s and s initially written. The idea behind gutmanns  pass was to completely change the magnetic resonance of the data. But now we have SO much space on there crammed onto small platters the magnetic resonance is easier disrupted. Its a lot of stuff I havent kept up with either. Is it necessary to wipe a hard drive  times? I dont know for certain. But depending on what data I had to remove if I physically couldnt destroy the drive or degauss the drive you bet I would. Is  pass enough? Probably. But the risk isnt worth it to me.

Think about how you will provide high availability and scalability. If you plan it this way right from the get go it will be very easy versus just building some shitty thing now and having to rebuild it later to make it work properly.Whatever you do you must go with at least two providers. The recent cloud server outage at rack space caused a lot of grief for cloud based solutions that didnt have the foresight to have redundancy at the provider level ,sysadmin,cl0wryc,8,t5_2qnp7
2054049,0,t1_cl0cia1, to this comment because users. Im currently hitting a brick wall at work because after documenting everything for users in dokuwiki now people just wont read it. Or worse they print it out and get mad when their printouts are outdated. They are accustomed to just asking people about the issue rather than looking at documentation. Very little in the way of logical thinking. So documentation is a blessing and a curse. If your first problem is that your users are inattentive and dont follow instructions writing documentation becomes problem number two because now not only do you have inattentive users who dont pay attention but you also have to maintain the documentation now too.,sysadmin,cl0wy1h,1,t5_2qnp7

Determine which binaries you want to run. An event will be logged to the Application log each time SRP prevents a binary from running and it will contain the full path to the binary.   Determine whether the binary you want to run from USERPROFILE is signed. Check the executable files Properties and if a Digital Signatures tab is present its signed and may be allowed with a certificate rule. If its not thats outside the scope of this document.   Extract the certificate from the binary through Details on the Digital Signatures tab. In View Certificate under Details again you have the option to Copy to File. I typically save mine as Baseencoded but thats personal preference.   Copy the certificate to some central location. It doesnt have to stay there for SRP to work as far as I know but its nice to keep it in a central location for future reference.   In the SRP Protection Group Policy open up Additional Rules Computer  Policies  Windows Settings  Security Settings  Software Restriction Policies.

Youre an IT manager now not a low level tech mumbling about shit your supporting to other low level techs. You really shouldnt have to watch what you say because everything should be positive. Develop options.  year full refresh  year  refresh cycles  year  refresh cycles. Then recommend the desktops stay on a  year refresh cycle. So in  years you refresh the first group you did. Now you have a yearly budget. If you replace the initial batch in  every  years and stick to a  year cycle for desktops. Every th year you can do big projects like new voip systems or servers or run fiber and pay a vendor to pull cables. Come up case  case  and case . Present these to the approvers and expect them to come up with their own case. Then work with what they approve. Act like an IT manager.

Its only purpose is to replicate contents of an SMB namespace to a separate server or cluster of servers usually in a remote location. This allows the remote location to access any data in the namespace even when the link between servers or sites goes down.Another example of where DFSR is useful is storing a geoclustered applications configuration files in an SMB share Active Directory IIS etc. For example having IIS servers spread across North America that either need to serve the exact same content or have the exact same configuration or both.,sysadmin,cligwhc,2,t5_2qnp7

Install Windows over the network.This procedure does not revert the computer every time its turned on like Deep Freeze does.

2275662,0,t1_clsz17v,We use Commvault for backups.  Part of how it works is it creates an index of the data that was backed up.  This is written to the backup tape and stored locally for some finite period of time.  If someone asks me to restore a file from a server from last week I can likely browse the server for contents that were backed up last week and Commvault will show me which tapes contain the requested files.Once data has aged a bit the index of what was backed up is no longer available locally.  If someone wants a file from last year I say I need to restore data from this server for this time frame and Commvault says To see what data is available I need tapes X Y and Z.This is all handled for us through Commvault.  I know that BackupExec has a similar process.  For us if we know we are restoring a file from last year when we recall the tape Commvault wants to retrieve the index well retrieve all of the tapes from that backup set that we sent out for storage at the same time.  Otherwise once the index is read Commvault will just tell us which of those tapes we need to recall to get the actual data back and it saves us a day of waiting for Iron Mountain.,sysadmin,clszo6y,2,t5_2qnp7

Really you just want to help but not take over.  You should be a resource for them to reach out to but not a peer to dump on.  The other thing that is tough is that I find if you are incredibly easy to get to and answer questions very readily people tend to use you as a crutch.So up front I would document what I could as you have already done.  Then as issues come up I would answer questions but not take over the resolution.  Force them to think a bit so that when they do ask a question the answer will be more meaningful.  Lead them in the right direction but dont provide all of the answers.  Then as time goes on make yourself less and less available.  Reply to emails a bit less slower.  Let people go to voicemail and call them back.At the same time work something out with your new boss where there is a method to short circuit all of this and they get right to you if there is a critical time sensitive issue.The goal as painful as it can be at times is to strengthen the team you left behind so that they can stand on their own and need you less and less in your old role.

Trying to kludge a way to make them more reliable is not a worthwhile use of someones time in my opinion. Putting some kind of softraid on a USB flash drive would also make it look like it wasnt formatted correctly and may be overwritten by someone who doesnt know the drives purpose. The closest I would come to using any sort of raid with flash drives would be to use ZFS with copies or something. This is not even using ZFSs raid engine its just storing multiple copies of the data on the same physical device.

Identical product means the license acquired via OEM Retail or other Microsoft Agreement is for the same version and edition contains the same components and is the same language as the products contained on the image.  For example Windows . Professional licensed via a VL program is identical to Windows . Professional licensed via the OEM channel and you would be able to reimage the OEM licensed devices with the VL media and key. sourceThe only slight gotcha is that you have to purchase  total items to start a volume licesning agreement.So that could be Win Pro and  R CALs and youd be good to go as a cheap way.,sysadmin,cm923cx,2,t5_2qnp7

2492401,0,t3_2o5jf1,I argued that battle for a long time with management where I am at. We originally did MB. Our company spun off another company to deal with engineering fiber routes but they still used our mail system. Management initially wanted a MB limit so they could send their engineering plans with maps cad drawings raw photoshop files and even the odd video here and there. I said You know there is this thing called FTP and we could always build a dropbox kind of setup. They did not want to deal with that oh so hard extra step.In the end I held my stance and said if the limit was raised to MB I would refuse to support the system. We settled on MB which I think is still too big but that is as far as I could go and I shit you not management said MB would work because MB was evenly divisible by MB. Since then we have only had  engineering emails bounce because they were too big and they were nowhere near MB more like MB.This was sort of a reverse answer to the original question explaining why they wanted it bigger and in the end it did not need to be as big as they wanted.Crazy Management People.,sysadmin,cmjw7vd,3,t5_2qnp7
2492403,0,t3_2o4pql,Im a mostly Linux and Solaris admin. Im  and Ive done something that looks vaguely like systems administration since about .My resume is a mile wide but only six inches deep. Ive done a little bit of everything throughout my career because I learned early on that you can be useful to an employer by being that guy the one who takes on the projects nobody wants. I am a utility infielder the proverbial Player to be named later. Shit rolls downhill but it stops at my cube.This is good and bad. My resume doesnt always get me interviews because none of it screams Oh my god look at this guy hes an expert in this one narrow focus. In the middle of my career this was tough. Recently however my last two jobs have been very senior roles where I was hired specifically for the breadth of my experience. My last employer is sad they cant find the budget to pay me enough to bring me back and my current employer admitted theyd decided to hire me before I even interviewed that my interview was just to make sure I wasnt a toxic hellbeast.Let me be clear Im not a sysadmin superman by any stretch. What does happen is when something pops up Ive likely seen it before.My recommendation to you is to enjoy technology learn things even if you dont need them. Being a generalist may cause some bumps along the way but eventually youll become the wizened old graybeard that people need to keep on staff to deal with the bizarre problems that nobody sees coming.That said Ill give a counterpoint.How do I know what I like? I like money. There isnt a career out there that I could do and make half as much money as I do today. Child support is expensive. I tried to do my last job which I loved dearly at about  below market salary I ended up having to leave because I enjoyed sleeping indoors too much.I dont want to discourage you and I realize Im just a bitter old man but given the option to do what I Like it wouldnt be this. Id own a small cinder block building on the beach in the caribbean somewhere selling jerk chicken and spiny lobster and Red Stripe to sunburnt tourists under a big sign reading Fat Mans Shrimp Shack.The reason is simple when I started in IT the job was about technology and building and maintaining it was about boxes and software and creating infrastructures.Today in any reasonably sized enterprise IT is about  workflow documentation and audit. My days are spent in Microsoft Word and other apps making sure weve dotted every single i and crossed every last t to make sure we pass PCI Sarbox and other audits. of my time at best is spent doing my actual job.Dont sweat the tech or the certifications just try and learn everything you can.

It gives a value created from the shared secret and the current time stamp which can be verified by the server who also knows the shared secret and the current time stamp.Yours is just a two part password or just one whole password.

But when it comes to certain protocols its a pain in the ass and avoiding it saves countless headaches.Using public IPs on enddevices was a thing of the past until people ran out of IPs and had to resort to NAT though big organizations that obtained huge network allocations like a  of public space often still do like universities where every student has a public IP. Keep in mind that you can have public IPs on devices without them being directly on the internet you can still have firewallsfilteringetc in between.All that being said if your company doesnt really own the public space as in youd lose it if you changed ISPs  then yes you should abandon that scheme as youd be locked in with that ISP or have to change everything when changing ISPs.,sysadmin,cmkpl97,1,t5_2qnp7

Our original plan was to replaceupgrade the traffic shapers and the IPS.  The firewalls were recently replaced we went from doing all Cisco equipment to Juniper and even now we still havent finished adapting all our databases and management sites to Juniper.While the IPSs upgrade cost isnt crazy high the traffic shapers are both VERY expensive both to upgrade or to replace.After yesterdays meting with Fortinet the features they included at the cost they had was enough to make my boss reconsider his original plan.  By chance I had scheduled a conference call with Palo Alto a while back and now my boss is taking that opportunity to see if there are other things out there that we might be missing out.  I think at this point hed be willing to consider a NGFW that does IPS and traffic shaping as good or better than our current setup that also allows us to expand over time we have two Gb lines currently and in the shortmedium future upgrade to about Gb lines and longterm going to Gb each.,sysadmin,cml6zf6,1,t5_2qnp7

And then I thanked everything I started.  Id been in IT for  years even took project management classes in school but.. yeah.  I suggest doing it yourself.  Base it on past experience just sit down and hash it down on the keyboard then go from there.  I generally start with vim google docs or whatevers in front of me and just type out the problem or project and my ideas for how to do it. Then break it down. Then detail the broken down spots. When Im done I put the final together in Word and share it with everyone start a tracking ticket in our ticket system Im using RT love it and then finally put the bullet points into Evernote for myself.  During the project Im constantly adding little stuff to evernote and big stuff as comments to the ticket.   When Im done I merge it all into word post it up and open the ticket up for comment.  Its great.   It will all come together.  And youll thank yourself when magically things start going buttah smooth.

2695248,0,t3_2qx9vu,You have to just be realistic with security compared to the size of your company. There are best practices but people dont always necessarily follow them and if those in charge are happy what are you going to do?For instance there are principles for handling cash that the auditing industry wants people to follow. A company subject to regulatory compliance is going to be forced to follow them. A company owned by your next door neighbor that has a small number of employees is under no obligation to do so if he doesnt want to. Maybe one of his employees would have an easier time stealing his cash with fewer controls in place but if he trusts everyone and nobody is stealing money whats the point from his perspective?Same deal with your company. Does this actually matter? I have no idea since I know nothing about your company. If you essentially work for DunderMifflin and the system which keeps track of the types and quantities of paper ordered uses passwords and everyone is sitting in one room does it really matter that Jim and Pam and Merediths passwords are stored in clear text on some server? It doesnt follow best practices but no it doesnt matter in the scheme of things.if you have a thousand employees all over the country and the system handles money or extremely critical customer information and people transmit the passwords over the internet from other countries and wireless access points at hotels then you start to open yourself up to a lot of issues and security matters more.If your business is so small or security just doesnt matter that much then youre just going to alienate everyone by worrying about security.Security isnt black and white. it comes in shades of gray and depends on the place you work. Without knowing where you work its up to you to decide if this matters or not. ,sysadmin,cnadyy4,6,t5_2qnp7

I have several others running for specific inputs they also filter tweak etc then throw it into redis.  I have some web servers running beaver that parses the apache logs really didnt want to eat up the amount of memory logstash does on each web server and sends them directly to redis.Then I have my backend logstash.. it just checks redis for multiple keys each of those frontends uses a different key and pipes them into elasticsearch.that way if my elasticsearch goes down maybe im upgrading no worries it buffers.  if I need to update logstash agents no worries I do them one at a time.. etc.  Also if the load becomes too great I could split these out so they are no longer running on the same server..

2716246,0,t3_2r4tws,Ive been working at a fulfillment center in California for less than a year and this is what I can say you can expect so far. Minimal IT background is actually required to do the job. You could get by with very limited knowledge however you would never go anywhere probably. You would be stuck at the position indefinitely if you dont know the server side stuff. While I have not see any promotionsas in anyone getting promoted to an engineer position so far I have been told that Amazon doesnt like you being in the same position for an extended period of time. At some point you will need to put on your big boy shoes and move up. . If you think you can get by with the knowledge you use to repair your grandmas old Dell desktop running XP Home you will not make it past the phone interview. Ive been approached by regular associates that have said Im thinking of building my own computer. and then in the same breath say I am really good with IT stuff and think Id be a good fit. I explain that if they dont know about Cisco Linux and a lot of Windows clientserver systems then they probably should wait until they do. It does not say this directly on the job description because sometimes it is not a prerequisite. If you can show that you have the mind of a problem solver there might be hope for you.. The pay is decent. The hours are fairamount. The benefits are pretty nice. . This is the big one the job itself. Note that this varies from building to building but this is my experience so far I start my day by getting in  minutes early. Most techs get in at least  minutes early because they want that buffer to get ready to start their day. Sometimes I just go to the break room and grab a snack. This is significant because of the type of personality you need to have. You shouldnt be there because you feel obligated to be there but more that you want to. Taking some time to mentally prepare yourself for the next  hours and figure out what you want to accomplish. Most techs have a lot of autonomy to what they work on. Occasionally the manager will step in and pull people to work on certain tasks. The bit about having autonomy is under the assumption that everyone is working on their daily tasks.Do not expect to be sitting behind some plushy desk with pictures of your kids and pets on your cubical. This is not that type of job. Expect to be on your feet at least  of the time you are on the clock. The other  you will need to have a good reason not to be. Some people have now issue with this at all but if you are like me and seem to put on your thinking cap when you are sitting in a quiet office you  may have some problems adjusting. You will be interacting with several people each day. The associates managers and service departments all rely on IT to keep their shit working. Sometimes you will be asked to work on something that is not IT related. You will have a walkie talkie with you the entire time and if you dont it will almost always go noticed. Walkies are used more frequently than cell phones and internal chat systems combined. You will get your own company laptop. May not seem significant but the laptop is probably one of the most important pieces of equipment for a support tech and other workers in the FC drool over the idea of having their own personal laptop as  of the people that work there are not even allowed cell phones.You will need to learn how to use technology that you never thought you would. Some of the tasks will seem remedial. I use this term quite a lot to describe a lot of my work through out the day. You will become intimately familiar with handheld bar code scanners and physically repairing printers mostly label printers. If you have ever seen IT crowd then the recurring resolution of turning it off and on again is not far from the truth. I have spent  minutes walking from one side of the building to the other just to turn on someones power or plugging the printer in. I had one person in particular not have it plugged in not have it powered on and did not have any paper and did not make any effort to remedy it before calling for help. You will get these type of calls a lot. What I just outlined here is about  of your day at an Amazon Fulfillment Center. Fortunately it isnt all grim. On occasion you will be asked to make server side changes make minor configuration changes to the switches and even use your brain to figure out some way to improve a process that everyone just accepted as the only way to do it. You will have access to ever system on the building which is a lot more than almost everyone else even security. It does sometimes make you feel a little special. This is about the end of my experience. I have had no indication yet that I will be moving up to a better position anytime soon despite  having a Bachelors in Network Communication  CCNA and prior work experience.  This is a foot in the door job. You start here and there is a good chance that you can continue up or even make a lateral move to something like AWS. There are also a few other positions that you wont really see because they are new or internal only plus they require you to move. I could go on as the position is quite elaborate. One day you will feel like you are a maid just cleaning up IT equipment in the storage area and the next day you find yourself making configuration changes to the network settings on several ports in the building and actually feeling like an administrator of some kind. ,sysadmin,cnctrb7,13,t5_2qnp7

Id argue having level headed intelligent people working there helps keep them in check. Id hate to see a black box world where these agencies operate off the radar completely. Keep your enemies close... Believe me the government is incompetent beyond all logic. Sure the NSA may be collecting data which Im against but theyre more likely to lose it or not be able to competently use it than they are blackmail citizens. Maybe in the future that will change but today? Ask them how many brown outs and explosions theyve had at their DC in Utah. Ask them how the  guys all made it past no fly lists and other checkpoints. Is your gov dangerous? Absolutely. But  out of  times its because of their unlimited budgets and not because theyre skilled. The monkeysShakespeare theory in action.Id argue if youre skilled smart and passionate about your freedom you SHOULD work for these agencies. Your government runs not on its own but primarily by contracting. Fill the ranks with likeminded individuals and when the big shit happens waves of people shut them down. Dont kid yourself.

2763668,0,t1_cnhvfyq,gt We split the  into a  for each VLAN matching the VLAN ID.This only gives you  networks out of possibly . In a real enterprise environment this is not feasible anyway as there might be two different layer  domainsfabrics with colliding VLAN IDs.gt For simplicities sake we matched the last octet of the IPv address to the last nibble of the IPv address.Please do not think about doing this in big routed environments. This just seems nice on the first glimpse but will mess up IPv routing completely. Say we have e.g. ... as IPv prefix for a single server hosting POD and you route this network to the firewall for that POD  fine  route for the prefix. Now for IPv we have following  networks used    dbc    dbc    ...    dbc    dbc    dbc    ...    dbc    dbc    dbc    ...    dbc    dbc    dbc    ...    dbcEven if you say OK I wont use hex notation anyway those networks like ca cb ... may also match in the routing entries you end up with following routing entries in IPv    dbc    dbc    dbc    dbc    dbc    dbcHey the s called they want there broken subnetting back! So it will mess up the future for the sake of matching information from the legacy IPv network  the server administrators will happily type in any IP you give them and from my experience most dont even have a feeling for nice IP address schemes anyway e.g. a hostname hostname gets IP address . whereas hostname gets IP address . etc.. So why bother if the rd IPv octet is anywhere hidden in the IPv network. Same applies for the naming tricks dc for domain controllers db for databases .... From my perspective the best thing to do for IPv deployments is green field from a layer  perspective  perhaps some day IPv will really be the legacy protocol and you probably wont want to still have kludges from the past in the network of the future.,sysadmin,cni7v9s,1,t5_2qnp7

2841100,0,t1_cnqyvd6,gt According to Project Zero Microsoft was notified of the vulnerability on Oct.  and initially planned to fix it during its January Patch Tuesday three days ago. However the fix had to be postponed because of compatibility issuesThey had a fix but delayed it until the next patch Tuesday for compatibility reasons that would have been revealed in testing.  Thats a valid reason.  This bug had been there for years delaying the disclosure for  days is not going to hurt anyone.  On the other hand if MS releases patches that break things the result is people stop installing patches at all and the situation is worse for everyone.Google is just being a dick to make MS look bad and hiding behind their day policy to do it.  The idea behind a deadline on disclosures is so vendors cant just sit on a vulnerability.  When the vendor has acknowledged the vulnerability developed a patch and asked for a perfectly reasonable extension so they can make sure the patch works properly is just being a jerk. days is not a lot of time to develop a patch.  Think of everything that has to go into it.  This isnt pushing a new revision of your website.  The steps are something likeVerify the vulnerability as reported is accurate.Identify the code behind it.Identify everywhere that code is used.Identify everything that interfaces with the code you are changing.Come up with a fix that corrects the vulnerability but doesnt break everything else.Verify the fix to make sure you are not creating new vulnerabilities.Apply the fix to a dozen different versions of the OS and architectures.Test the completed fix to make sure it doesnt break the OS.Test the completed fix against thousands of third party applications that it might break.  If it breaks them you might not care but the users will and they will not install the patch.Package the fix into an installer that will work on thousands of different configurations.Test the installer to make sure it doesnt break anything.Prepare the necessary documentation in dozens of languages on it and release it to a halfdozen different distribution channels.At any point in that process you can find a problem and have to go back to the start.  If you think MS released the patch and it broke . of windows PCs which is still like  computers people would say Oh thats ok they only had  days.  Its better they released it early.  They will be pissed.  This board would be full of posts not to install the patch.  ,sysadmin,cnr13rm,4,t5_2qnp7

If your product takes a long time to build then you can look at running both clean and deponly builds to give both rapid feedback and comfort of reliability. Eg MozillaFirefox does or at least used to do this If its test cases then maybe run the simple tests every build and the more complex ones separatlyIf youre using cc on Unix you can look into something like ccache to speed up builds.You can also look into splitting your app up into components each of this which is a separate build job so that only the changed component is rebuilt.If your build is on modern hardware and taking gt an hour to build then some componentisation is that even a word? would probably be a good idea anyway. Take a look at the Mozilla release blogs too  they have done a bunch of stuff to improve performance.

Without that youre just guessing and will either under power your systems and regret it or youll over power them and waste resources.BUT there are a lot of things on here that dont really make sense or compare. If youre truly peaking at k IOPS then remove the SSDs from the EMC as theyre obviously not needed and will jack your price. Whats the RAID on these? Importantly how is the EMC only TB more but  more disks? You need to compare like RAIDs Why are the servers on the EMC side booting off of SD cards but the Dell side has HDDs? Make them the same Use Veeam on both solutions. First its your better option and second again youll have like items to compare Put the same amount of RAM in each server Put the same processors in each server I find it hard to believe that the EMC servers only have  NIC port but if that is honestly the case is that going to be adequate? Probably not. How many switch ports do you need? The EMC side has  while the Dell side only has . If you need  cut the EMC in half. Instantly cut k off the bottom line Backup devices. Again the NIC port question. Im not sure what disk config youre planning on using here but is that going to be enough backup space? Considering you have TB of possible live storage? What about historicals? How far back do you need to keep? Are you replicating off site? If so wherehow? Backup devices again make them like storage capacities What software support is included? What does the installation entail? Just unboxing and racking? What exactly is in that migration estimate on both sides? Theyre likely not the same services with that big of a price difference.These are just my initial questions without even knowing a thing about your current systems or your needs.

I dont know exactly why but I think it has a lot to do with being confident and always on their side. Its the tone I take with them that usually makes them root for me instead of being nasty towards me. Now I can tell if someone is having a bad day and  I always make them laugh a bit and feel better. Im not sure how I do it but I do and it really makes for a good working environment. When I have a new client that came from a really bad MSP It takes a few weeks or months for them to realize that Im not what they are used to. I do this by killing them with kindness and placating them to the extreme. Most of them dont pickup on it and are improved quickly. The rest just stop talking to me entirely and eventually forgive and forget. Its a win win for me. The big key though is that I leave me ego at the door and I dont allow people to get under my skin. I also dont allow people to run me over. If someone is attacking me I shut them down REAL fast with strong verbiage explaining that they will get no help and that this will be taken to their boss. I dont care if they are the VP of the company. And yes Ive done it.

You dont learn shit.Not everyone goes to a cookie cutter  day brain dump course. The people that do are at the top of their game amp are just doing it to get bonuses at their existing job retasking to keep their job because of new requirements or vanity for the sake of itbecause work pays for it.gtBut if the sight of a black and white terminal with a blinking cursor scares the shit out of you dont bother.Okay so were finally at the crux of the issue. Youre a crusty Linux admin who likes to make fun of others. Id move on but you still have quite a few paragraphs up. If youre going to share your opinions about certifications you should try to not make fun of the wide target audience youll be hitting. Some of these people may actually not like the command line for whatever reason or be a hardcore Windows admin. Making fun of them in some slight capacity even though its under the guise of you being a Linux admin doesnt help you.gtAnd Linux classes that teach how to do administration via GUI tools can fuck off and die. If you want to learn Linux running it on your desktop doesnt mean dick.LOL. I learned quite a bit about Linux administration at least before DevOps became some mystical term from running it at home amp standing up a server. That was when I was looking at things like a kid amp before I really learned how to look at things from a Sysadmin perspective. Youll see GUI tools in a genuine environment if they want to foster teaching someone the ropes of Linux or get them familiar with their environment. gtSo you see if youre interviewing and you have a CCNA and I ask what the decimal notation is for a  mask and how many hosts you can have in that subnet you better be able to tell me in under  seconds.I wouldnt want to work with someone who has such a large chip on their shoulder amp puts their employees under such stress anyway. I understand your point that the person should know their knowledge cold but lets be realistic not everyone uses all the skills in the wide array of Sysadmin to know all of them Many hats Master of None. I was asked a subnetting question on a phone interview one I legitimately told them I dont know as my CCNA is over  years oldexpired amp I dont do networking on that level. Nobody does on the day to day. Some of us have other focuses.gtCerts arent the magical path toward a six figure income. ...Okay this Ill agree but this has more to do with IT people as a whole amp has nothing to do with certifications. Id think we both could benefit from learning how to talk to people rather than spouting this or that. Agreed? Agree. Lets go get some grub.gtTheres my take on certs.

3014450,0,t3_2uox1p,The point of having secondary or tertiary dns servers is not for resolving other domains that are not on the primary server but for failoverload balancing if the primary or secondary servers dont respond.What you need to do is have each DNS server have a secondary zone for each others domainsDNS data.For exampleIf you have dns.myco.corp and dns.notmyco.corp you cannot add both dns servers to your clients and expect that your client will say dns.myco.com does not have dns data for notmyco.com lets try the second server  DNS doesnt work that way.  You would need to have a secondary zone on dns.myco.com for the notmyco.com domain and a secondary zone on dns.notmyco.com for the myco.com domain.  Then either domain controller can respond to all requests within your organizationAdding the third external dns resolver for critical failover is great BUT it will not resolve either of the internal domains unless you add secondary zones for those domains to your third failover.

This server ran  was involved in businessimportant some critical applications but couldnt be backed up ancient OS.  days later its back up with no data loss and migrated to a supported version of Windows which means we can actually get it on to our HyperV cluster properly. I had a few thank yous and said some myself. Overall actually not a bad week.gtBottom line is if both IT as a whole and you personally arent respected or listened toI think this is the crux of it. Support has been neglected conventionally so IT is not seen as an enabler in the organisation. People avoid coming to IT if they can possibly avoid it. Hell Id avoid IT if I was receiving the service that the users have been receiving. Tickets sit in queues for weeks and dont get sorted. This isnt my problem directly Im infrastructure not service delivery but it does impact on me when people engage in shadow IT because their needs are not being met.This has a primary source management who just say Yes without saying Well need to figure out the best way to do it. People who should be in meetings are regularly shut out for no particular reason its almost to the point where IT is  reactive. My experience is that users should define their needs and IT figure out how to give them as much of that as possible without any stupid compromises  excessive administrative burden. Users do not know what is best for them. Frequently they will ask for things to do a job in a specific way Because its always been done that way.

You mentioned domain users which is a group and not an OU. unless for some reason your boss made an OU called domain users in the root of the domain. Which is weird hence your confusion.Under the properties of the object go to the member tab. Select the domain users and i bet youll see somehting like this is the primary group. You cant remove an object from its primary group without first changing its primary group to another group. With that said I would not remove a user account from the domain users group unless you have a very good reason to do so.

Continual breaches or refusal to remove software will result in either removal of privileges or in serious cases a locked out computer. We found this works well as it inhibits the staff member to perform their job and managers dont like that. Once it becomes a performance problem it sits with management and HR.

Our apathy is the result of people like you ignoring the obvious.  gtThis sort of thing needs to cause uprise and protest    Yeah like  years ago.  Today protests are not going to make a damn bit of difference. Come to think of it most protests didnt do shit in the last hundred years.  Educate yourself on that next.  If the hippies had really wanted to prevent a war they should have put down the bongs and gotten into government. They should have been the ones making the decisions and dealing with the issues that led to war to begin with.  Ironically if they had pot would probably have never been outlawed.      gtThis is breaking news.    To you it is breaking news. For many of us this is well no shit Sherlock!      gtWe did not KNOW they were doing this.    Who is we. Leave me out of your we. This was obvious thirty years ago when cell phones started becoming ubiquitous. You didnt know because your ass was too ignorant to educate yourself on what you were buying into.      gtThis only goes on because    Dont point fingers at us because you are too ashamed to admit you were duped.  People like you didnt pay attention thirty years ago. Maybe you hadnt been born thirty years ago Ill give you that much.      gtTo merely dismiss these revelations    We arent dismissing them were waiting for your ignoramass to catch up. In case you havent noticed were a bit of a minority here.      gtyou are in IT networking no less. Use your knowledge to try to explainteach people    Have you been over to rtalesfromtechsupport lately? We cant even get people to understand that their monitor is not the important bit.      Heres the thing the best way to solve this is education and involvement.       Now that you know whats going on start getting involved. Again I dont mean protesting. I mean become the next generation of politicians and decision makers. Work yourself into a position where you can be the next political adviser on technology or even better the next head of whatever TLA.  Raise your children and educate them in fields where they can exert influence.     We need a critical mass of the population who understand what is going on and what needs to happen. But we dont need them standing outside chanting and singing. We need them to be inside drafting policies. We need them inside making the decisions that affect us all.  Not sitting on the couch playing farmville.    The best way to get rid of them is to become them.

Level  managers basically supervise desktop and helpdesk people.So if you take this job whats your next thing? You wont become a higher level manager managing infrastructure teams since you probably wont have enough experience in those areas.Its kind of a long term career killer in my opinion. Ive met people who got excited about a management job at that level and they tend to be younger than the other management jobs which pay more and then they get stuck.The next job after that might end up going back to being a senior sysadmin because youre not going to manage senior sysadmin type people when your only management experience is level .,sysadmin,cotwm54,3,t5_2qnp7

Your cluster software on the other hand might be a little more finicky. But to be honest it shouldnt be. Rolling patches is one of the advantages of a clustered setup.Oracles patches come with READMEs that will warn you of complications. In all my years of running Solaris there have been very few patches that you cant just perform the install with and go on.If you want to up your patch game a little you could look into PCA,sysadmin,cowreyt,4,t5_2qnp7

They also have a on premises web server that I would also like to shift as a hosted solution as well.  It does pass data into their sales DB which is also currently on premises but Id ideally like to shift that out into a hosted solution as well.They have a decent UPS but it is time to replace the batteries on it and if I can shift most of the hardware hosted I wouldnt need as powerful of a UPS to just maintain a DC.

So both displays will always be visible.Or does the user not want to have to manually switch the KVM back and forth and wants a more seamless solution like Synergy?  I think your only real bet for that is a software based solution but there you run into the problem of the lack of shared network.  Ill be honest I dont think youre going to really be able to work around this unless you can create some special network that just contains those PCs.

Most people naturally push for more secure best practices designed systems except developers but theyre just crazy so thats an outlier.   Its commonly known that the weakest point in your network is your employees and no matter how much security you have you have problems if your employees touch the network.  Im also a VDI engineer and you cant do much to protect against shared systems not under your control.  VDI touches literally everything in the network because its both its own infrastructure and an enduser gateway to the company.  You have a solid rigid patch and reboot schedule good standard GPOs for booting users locking systems down etc as much as the company allows it.  Based on your description it sounds like that network share hasnt been being rebooted patched and scanned basic things that probably wouldve nailed their little Easter egg.  In this case you evaluate your own security and make recommendations for the findings but at the end of the day no network is secure.  And the ones that think theyre secure just have really quiet Chinese or Russian coworkers overseas that theyre unaware of.  ,sysadmin,cpciwr0,5,t5_2qnp7

3371327,0,t1_cpciwr0,pen testing is a good supplement to common sense and basic hygiene. Theres a tendency for security workers to secure what they understand but theres a good chance that they miss something new or something that has quirky exceptions.Take something like apaches modrewrite. It rewrites URLs... unless it happens to be used outside a ltVirtualHostgt stanza and unless its used outside of an htaccess file and unless the request would happen to result in a  and unless it happens to then map to a matching path from the root of the filesystem. Then it serves up whatever file it points to as a saving throw completely ignoring any restrictions set by ltDirectorygt stanza directives. Youll find people who have been apache admins for  years who dont catch that case because its not where devs usually put rewrite rules.

3405637,0,t3_2z7a95,At the time of the story the building network had recently been upgraded and new edge switches place in various wiring closets around the building. The building was the size of the block with a core datacenter and edge switches in the corners on each floor. Once group of offices kept having random network issues with packet loss or just outright loss of connectivity at random times during the day. This went on for over a month with nobody able to figure out exactly what was happening even going so far as to replace the switch that handled those offices. The problem went away and then came back. It was fixed purely by accident. One of the junior network guys happened to be working in the closet when it happened. In Washington D.C. there is an elevated train track that passed directly beside the building. The Amtrak trains were too light and slow to trigger the issue but when a freight train rolled past the vibrations would jar the rack just enough to jiggle the power cable in the switch and make it powercycle off and on as the train passed.Turns out the same person who originally installed the switch had installed the replacement. spot check of all the other switches showed that the power cords were just slightly loose in almost all to the other installations done by that person. Once the issue was identified the power cords could be easily checked. The root cause listed for the office outages? training,sysadmin,cpgguf9,20,t5_2qnp7

Go find it. Do not waste your energy trying to change the existing system because you most likely cant or you wont because you are not in management. When you apply for a new job and they ask you why you want to leave your current job this is when you tell the new employer I didnt like the direction that the department was going in and that is it. Welcome to your new job. In your exit interview you can tell your boss that you thought they should have went in a different direction and this is why you are leaving. There are not many middle managers or even directors who take criticism kindly. Most are blind to what is going on and many are oblivious to real issues. Most managers get promoted for performance not leadership skills and are not qualified to be in management in the first place. They are not leaders only poor managers. Many will not change anything unless it comes directly from their boss. He probably thinks that everything is great and you bringing something up is a challenge to him and his ego. Many of these guys are passive aggressive and will put you on their shit list the moment you point out that something is wrong especially if you wont let it go. No matter how much you think you have a great working relationship with your boss he will resent you and think that you are challenging him or trying to throw him under a bus if you bring it up  on . Either that or he will just ignore you and tell you to drop it. Rarely will you get someone who actually will listen or be open to objective criticism without getting his panties all in a bunch. Why waste your time and energy? Your arent a process improvementchange management consultant or specialistpmdirector etc and you arent getting paid to evaluate the current direction of the company or the IT dept. You are not responsible for budgeting or roadmaps. You are probably one of the staff responsible for an IT system or several systems. This is how they see you also for the most part as an IT resource not a management consultant. If you really want to bring this up before you do a better way is to gently probe your boss  for his perspective maybe asking some general questions about the current process or direction and asking if he knows about such and such technology or if he heard of such and such providervendor and his thoughts on it wihout presenting you personal agenda. I have been on both sides of the table as a systemsops engineersys adminsupportpm trying to effect change and as a IT managerdirectormanagement consultant hired specifically to make changes or not but having to take control to improve a terrible situation. However that is besides the point. What you want to do is find a better place to call home and you wanting to clear your conscience is just that little voice inside you telling you that you dont like what is going on and you are basically ignoring the real issue and trying to find another way to deal with it where you dont have to leave. You cant have it both ways. You arent a manger you wont change things the way you want to change them. Even if they said yes they would not implement what you want but what they want and it would suprise you how different it would be or incomplete from your perspecitve. The point is that you do not have all the facts and as someone else already said there might be many reasons besides just the IT bosses why things are the way they are and why other technologies are not being pursued. It is not your place to figure this out. I hate to say this because I am like you and I wanted to change things for the better in every place I was at and until I hit management I wasnt able to do it because you cant. If you want to change things then become part of management and then try and at least you will have a shot. I say just go somewhere where they have what you want...dont try to steer this boat if you arent in a position to do it. Its a loselose situation for you. ,sysadmin,cposddk,1,t5_2qnp7

3548030,0,t3_30u02a,Software is where I have seen the most improvement. Most people coding for grid environments unit test on single machines where processing is local. Grids are best used when fed a dataset and instructions to process without needing additional network traffic. I have seen so many grid implementations where the delay is the instruction waiting on some database call to be returned and would have been better suited with a more encompassing database query. The other big piece is nodes in a waiting state while one long process is being performed on a single node and that needs to complete before the scheduler will perform additional operations.That being said disk should have almost no usage in a grid environment other than dataset loading so the majority of activity should be occuring in RAM and CPU. The only way you are going to troubleshoot CPU load is with logging from the application. The application needs to add counters inside the program that can either be accessed with a remote API call or writing out what each function took to process. Once you get that data we are back to software limited issues and the processing that is binding the CPU on a single host needs split to multiple hosts hence grid.,sysadmin,cpwp53c,1,t5_2qnp7

If you are on a different OS or Windows  or if you tried to open it with some other program then it wouldnt work. If you still cant figure it out its even online I can find no claim from Kaspersky that scripts can only be run on one machine. Were you looking at their forums or something? Something posted on a forum intended to help one specific user with one specific problem is something you might not want to run on other computers. But theyre pretty self explanatory  things like StopService are obviously only going to work on one system. Even if it did rely on system info logs you dont need to reboot to get logs. You might be referring to the AVZPM which does boot time monitoring from the system account and AVZGuard which blocks malware from the system account which are drivers that do require a reboot but thats optional. As far as your previous comment about the standard script autorestarting Id have to ask which standard script you chose. By default there is no script selected no default. Scanning drivers arent what makes AVZ technically superior. That would be the fact that it has extensive command line scripting options much more refined scanner controls and its designed to detect new stuff Kaspersky doesnt know about. Automation is going to be dead simple. It was designed for automation. Not sure what you mean by safe manner though.Also the help files last section Control Scripts is massive. gtAs you probably know AVZ was originally intended as an administrator utility. Running AVZ manually or using the dialog mode is convenient for checking an individual computer. Meanwhile automation solutions are indispensible when you need to scan a large number of computers quickly or run a regular check at startup. Introducing the support of commandline keys was the first move in this direction. However although keys make it possible to configure AVZ they do not offer too much flexibility. This is why versions . and later support external control scripts that can be created by the administrator.gtAnother feature of AVZ is multiple heuristic checks that are not based on signaturebased search. These checks include searching for rootkits keyloggers and various backdoor exploits against a database of standard TCPUDP ports. Such search methods make it possible to detect new varieties of malware.gtIn addition to the signaturebased file search capability that is standard for programs in its class AVZ incorporates a database of digital signatures of tens of thousands of system files. This database helps to minimize the number of false positives returned by the heuristics analyzer while also serving a number of other purposes. In particular the file search system has a filter for excluding known files from search results. Trusted processes are colorcoded in the manager of running processes and SPI settings. When files are being quarantined AVZ prevents known files from being added to quarantine.gtA script language for controlling AVZ. Scripts make it possible to use AVZ in a corporate network. In this case AVZ can be launched from a logon script or autorun and run according to an administratordeveloped script. Scripts also make it possible to automate the majority of AVZ operations.gt AVZ contains microprograms that automatically fix common corruptions of Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer settings reset desktop settings and neutralize policy rules set by trojans. Antivirus applications do not normally perform these operations which is why normal system operation is not restored after a trojan or spyware has been removed.,sysadmin,cpydsq7,2,t5_2qnp7

There is no escape from it because its your job!Probably  years ago now I left IT for what I thought was for good after just getting stuck in a good job at a shit company. It wasnt bad enough to leave but it wasnt good enough to last. To explain the job was good lots of interesting project and freedom to act and learn but the company itself was stagnant and getting worse. Bad people at the top meant that any good people they had were leaving which just left the dregs. All the worst kinds of usersmanagers to have to deal with.In the end I just walked away from it went and worked back at the brewery did some electrical work with my brothers even did some labouring as a brickie.In the end though I just realised that I couldnt live without it. Any other job I worked or looked at was SO FUCKING BORING.So I got another Sysadmin position then another one and another one!

This is the way for all certs there could be multiple answers but the most correct answer according to the vendor. Cisco has their ways of doing things and although many questions can have multiple answers it is what Cisco considers their best answer that is important.The A is an entrylevel cert. It is meant for people who do not have experience to prove they have the most fundamental of computer skills and knowledge. It is a valuable cert for what it is meant for. For you obviously it is not valuable but for somebody who wants to get started in IT it certainly is. If i didnt have any experience in IT and i wanted to get in IT i would have gotten the A. I didnt have experience with virtualization and i really wanted to get into a role with that technology so I got the VCPDCV. And guess what I got a role doing just that.

I deal with a couple of applets on a regular basis.  Its a sore point.gt Also this is an issue with education because every school I have met students from has advocated the use of Java.This is a pretty common disconnect.  I suspect schools like Java for a lot of reasons.  Portability being one strong typing and a very rigid structure being two more.  And since schools give exactly zero fucks about security seriously being a security minded sysadmin at a college is like working in the first circle of hell the issues around updating are nonexistent.  As a language Java has a lot to offer as a framework it has a lot of frustration to offer your sysadmins.  gt I am very capable of using a large variety of languages when I program. I want to know what I SHOULD use instead of Java for crossplatform programming. This was one of the reasons I lead with I wouldnt.  Im sure there are a lot of applications out there for which single language cross platform support is a great idea.  I also suspect its a fairly small subset.  Honestly I would argue for just having the basics of program architecture which I would well imagine you have at this point and worry about language choice once youre on a project.

3675578,0,t1_cqb72di,Currently employed candidates you know are taking your offer because they genuinely want to work there as opposed to staying where they are at which is always a plus.  I can see a bias against candidates who have been unemployed for a long period of time making you question how fresh their skills their motivation to work and or their personal health unless the unemployment rate is incredibly high.  When unemployment rates are very low someone who is unemployed for any long period of time probably is unemployed for a reason and hence the caliber of unemployed candidates tends to be pretty low.That being said I have seen companies that seemed biased against employed candidates because they wanted to move quickly on a hire and or werent very flexible on interview times.  Unless you are hiring someone on speculative demand for additional labor your ideal candidate will always be someone who can starter sooner rather than later.  Some companies do that but many either wait for demand to start stretching labor or for somebody to quit where they need to be replaced.

If your fileserver is hosting it then its a standalone DFS namespace.It makes it more complicated because you cant just copy the data and change the folder targets. Youll have to create a new namespace on the new server you can exportimport from the old one if you like but youll probably have to change all the folder targets and youll need to either rename the new server to match the old one when you make the cutover or change everyones network mappings to the new DFS namespace but if youre going to do that then you might as well switch to a domainbased namespace anyway.As for data migration DFSR works fine Robocopy is also an option.

3841533,0,t1_cqtt448,This is the fault of IT Management. A good manager is an evangelist for how information technology can help the company meet its goals and fulfill whatever mission it has even if its just raising stock price. Unfortunately IT Management falls into the trap of promoting technical workers senior admins and such to management because it seems like the next logical step in their career path even if its kicking and screaming. In my experience many tech workers lack the business chops and leadership skills to effectively manage a team. They manage them like routers or servers or sometimes like a project manager which is leagues away from business management. Its hard to find talented people who can straddle the line of knowing what the hell they are doing from a business perspective and know enough of the technical side to lead and not alienate the staff. I hate to say it but this is a good place for middle management as the IT manager can digest the technical side to their Clevel manager CIOCTO who can then digest the toplevel business needs and feed it to the IT manager. ,sysadmin,cqu62vm,10,t5_2qnp7

ELK and Sexilogs if youre using ESXi are some additional tools to help you get a quick glance at possible issues and be proactive.uengeleh is correct I think that they are concerned about the timeworkpresentation of these.

Ive always completed a project and then determined from my own notes how much of it was my learning time if it was a solution I suggested yet didnt know exactly enough about it to implement it quickly. If its something they suggest and want like a specific piece of software then learning time is on them as they are asking me to learn and implement it. I would say they are looking for a semiconsistent way of being able to predict their costs and also looking to maintain a level of quality in your service. How long have you worked for them? If a year or two you should be able to look back at your billing and determine an average number of hours to give you a start. Id be very careful to clearly define the scope of work.

4006977,0,t3_36dj4t,Not a real easy way I mean you could use the Quota File Filters to make it so they cant write certain types of files like VHDVHDXVMDK to certain shares but they of course still need write permissions to the share that the file is already in  so they can always copy it and paste it back with a different name in the same folder.Honestly two things One is you need to have a good company policy written in place and distributed.  HR needs to get involved. Doing something like this is roughly the equivalent of swiping all the office supplies from a shared office supply cabinet keeping it at your desk under lock amp key then wasting the office supplies on stupid  unimportant  pet projects.  If someone does this one time they get a verbal warning a few times they get a written and soon it goes to formal disciplinary action and eventual termination.  Just because we are dealing with what seems like virtual office supplies rather than real office supplies doesnt mean we should change the disciplinary process.It should be treated the same way  with HR involvement.  You put out a policy that users are allowed to have  extra copy of their VHD or whatever makes sense.  People that break the policy get written up and sent to HR for disciplinary action.Second thing you should do is look into total space in use quotas rather than specific file types.  Allocated Developer  group gets Gb of drive space  Developer  gropu gets Gb and so on.  Then setup your file quotas based on that.,sysadmin,crd0xux,3,t5_2qnp7

4062873,0,t1_crjcus2,Blade servers are just like normal servers except that most of their ports are internal and they share PSU and fans. A blade server switch bay will have one internal port connected to each blade bay. You can then put a switch in the bay with an internal port to each blade plus uplink or even passthrough interfaces which will expose all the internal connectors as RJ or SFP. The reason the switch might have  or  external interfaces is for uplink. Having multiple uplinks is convenient for the ASIC design in the switch helps redundancy and throughput and allows you to physically separate the networks to each blade server.The VGA cable mouse keyboard and a virtual drive for each blade is also usually connected to a bay with a KVM switch which allows you to remotely connect to the terminal of each blade server and even control the power. This is quite similar to how you would set up your servers. In theory you should not ever have to go into the server room again once you have set up everything.

4101076,0,t1_crnp3xv,gt This is really understating the amount of work that has gone into Docker and the surrounding tools. Even ignoring the ridiculous amount of things that Docker has done packages like Mesos etcdConsul and Kubernetes among countless others are tools that have sprung from the new Docker ecosystem. Theyre doing a lot of exciting things with infrastructure that have a big impact on how engineering teams actually implement things.Those tools could have easily been designed around other existing systems. The just happened to be put in around docker. gt Well first of all it depends entirely on your usecase. Docker isnt for everything or everyone and thats something that drives me crazy  just because you COULD containerize something doesnt mean you should. That said have you actually looked into Docker at all or are you even uptodate when it comes to LXC? VMs are slow and clunky compared to containers for many things. You can get much higher density with containers and spinup time is almost nonexistent with Docker enabling you to be extremely effective with your scaling strategy.I totally agree and this is part of the problem Im explaining. Just because you can doesnt mean you should. Although I agree VMs are slow and clunky compared to systems like docker theres really not that big of a performance gain unless you have a fringecase system. If you build your VMs right spinup time is laughable.gt This is an organizational issue to some extent. Even with Docker your developers shouldnt be defining your infrastructure... period. I feel like this is why a lot of sysadmins hate  avoid Docker. You control your infrastructure. You control your Dockerfile. Your developers use that Dockerfile.Again  agreed. But this is the point Im making Theyre saying Docker provides a new way to do stuff which isnt true. But it is enabling devs to bring up this old argument.gt I dont know where youre getting this from but if the Dockerculture is pushing anything its DevOps philosophies where the developers and operations teams work together more closely to make everyones lives easier.Part of me wants to cry after reading that part of me wants to laugh... I dont even know what to say about this one. No this has not been the selling point... and Im pretty sure anyone that has implemented Docker in their infrastructure is having a good laugh at this right now. Maybe at some point by a group of developers but this is so off the mark its not funny. Not only do you need to design your infrastructure around Docker but you need to redesign your workflows around it. Its a lot of work to implement Docker in an environment. Once you have everything setup though its extremely powerful. In fact thats usually what the selling point is advertised as  highly flexiblescalablestable infrastructure. Its definitely not easy but its very rewarding provided you have a valid usecase and arent just trying to cram things into containers.here here here just in responses to this article alone. Less than  minutes of research.Im not the only one with this problem. Like I said I dont know if its Docker or just shitty devs pushing this culture but is actually part of the culture.I dont hate Docker. Im neutral to it. I completely agree that Im more frustrated from how Docker is being misusedrepresented. And I agree thats probably where most Opsteams hate comes from. But whether its the right way or not its part of the Dockerculture.,sysadmin,crnqxqk,1,t5_2qnp7

4158389,0,t1_crtkxbd,gt User permissions work fine and AD is LDAP.User permissions suck. OGA is worthless because you cant specify an actual group. That means in reality all you have is Owner and All. More importantly actual packages you install off repos tend to assume theyll be installed under rootsudo and that the app can easily get root permissions. Sure you can lock the app down after install or compile it yourself with better permissions but this is a major PITA. One of the big reasons Ive tended to favor Gentoo is that portage helps solve this problem by allowing you to relatively easily customize the compilation of apps for securitysandboxing. This is why I say everything is root.gt Linux also has ACLs.Nothing honors them and even if they did you have to set them manually which is a PITA. gt However Linux has tools like SELinux which dont have any Windows equivalents as far as I know.Just like Linux Windows has several ways to do this.You can whitelist executables for individual accounts any OU you can think of you can use EMET for applicationspecific lockdown like AppArmor and there are literally dozens of rdparty products that do the same thing. Basically Linux has a few options here and Windows has hundreds most of which are easier to use.  I do lots of security. Linux is in practice easy to secure. But that doesnt mean it has good security. Whats securing Linux? Never run Linux desktops.  Disable everything but SSH and app server. i.e. use a bare install of CentOS or whatever.  Use key exchange on SSH server. Use external firewall to block all ports but SSH port and app ports.   user per server. Use chrootcontainersVMs for multiple users.  Keep server updated.

4179275,0,t3_38oll4,gt Is there any magic coping strategy to not giving a fuck about this?You need to recognize that it is important to work to live not live to work.  By all means bust ass and try to get ahead.  Odds are that you will fail and end up with a life in mediocrity.  After all the greatest predictor for success in the US is being born into wealth so unless your parents were already wealthy and you are using that wealth and their connections to create a profitable business youre probably going to end up a wage monkey for the rest of your life.  That said being a wage monkey living in mediocrity in the US is far from the types of hardships which peasants have faced in the past.  As long as you have a roof over your head enough food to eat and a bit of disposable income to have fun on occasion life is actually pretty good.  Your problem likely lies in the fact that you think that hard work and dedication to an employer will get you recognition and money.  It might to some extent.  But mostly it will just get you ulcers and an early grave from heart failure.  If your goal is real financial success it wont come from busting ass to make someone else rich.  You are going to have to go out and start your own business.  No business is going to pay you fucktons of money to manage their systems.  They might pay you well enough to keep you going but you are a cost center and maybe a value adding resource.  The real money comes from being a profit center or top level exec.  You can also do quite well as an investment manager or the like though that is a very hitormiss career.  So whats the secret?  This is one area where fake it until you make it works pretty well.

Doesnt that demonstrate that the talent for these jobs exists in country? It also seems like a fairly unethical practice to force some one that is to be fired to train their replacement.

By default the account you use to create the group is set as the owner and the box is checked to make the owner a member.  I would uncheck that option otherwise theyll be getting copies of emails sent to you as well.  After the group is created add all the users needed to that group as member.Next go to the mail flow setting and create a new rule and use the recipient is a member of condition and set action to copy message to the managerdirector for that group.  You will need to do a group and corresponding rule for each group you want setup this way.  once it is setup though adding and changing members of the group is all that is needed for maintaining it.  ,sysadmin,crzu8ss,2,t5_2qnp7

However mount up the Isilon over NSFv and performance absolutely plummets. As much as x performance degradation. Observed through ApacheBench ab and a simple dd.I spent a couple days on the phone with EMC support and under the guidance of the support tech he thought the problem was in the network layer going so far as to collect TCP dumps and inquiring whether or not we have any  Gbps link bottlenecks in our data center. NFSv works as expected  its not a network issue. After that investigation bore no fruit the tech threw his hands up in there and admitted he had no idea what the issue is. This is the rd support contact that worked with my organization over NFSv performance. Same result every time.Personally I think this needs to be escalated to the engineering team responsible for OneFS specifically the . release. We keep getting passed around to different clueless support reps. I can operate on NFSv on a commodity Dell R and get respectable results just fine. At this point Im investigating building my own solution through Gluster but Id rather duplicate a service that my team is expected to use organizationallyspeaking. Whats it going to take to get this fixed? Have there been any other commentsissuescomplaintsfeedback about bugs andor performance issues related to OneFS .?

4301081,0,t3_3a8bt2,The sysadmin  IT industry is weird from an HR perspective.  From my experience as a Linux admin and developer for many years now for several companies it seems to consist of a lot of people who dont feel the need or desire to assert or brag about their value or otherwise play the game for their employers.  I dont know why exactly but its very obviously the case.  If it werent we wouldnt cringe at common declarations like If everything is running smoothly why the fuck do I even need you IT people anyway?That would be the equally absurd equivalent of the head of sales being fired because sales are at an alltime high why do we even need him if sales are so solid?Anyway Im sorry to hear about that.  Obviously I dont know why your partner was let go but my suggestion to both of you would be to continue to hack continue to learn and find a job where your employers understand and respect what you bring to the table.  And to be honest again not sure if this applies you do actually have to play the game at least a little bit to make sure they know that you are making them a shitload of money and that its your priority to do so.

From the wording to making the action of accepting the document binding implementing such a solution to satisfaction is a lot more involved than just activating a GPO.Hence why the first course of action should be to push back a little and encourage HR to get involved. Its in their best interest to get involved and they have more experience and expertise.Of course if the man with the money hands out stone tablets from his mountain we grind our teeth and hack together a technical solution.

Here you go CloneZilla Live SE This boots into a DRBL environment with a nice desktop and several useful tools such as GPart clonezilla server and a few others I forget. Anyway you set up a computer how you want it then set it to PXE boot. It will find the Clonezilla server and then you can use it to take an image of that machine and store it on the VM. Once stored on the VM you can boot every computer or any computer in PXE mode and then push out the image. Just be aware of any network bottlenecks you might have.

In Microsofts own words from KBgt We do not guarantee and we do not support the accuracy of the WTime service between nodes on a network.gt gt ....gt gt The WTime service cannot reliably maintain sync time to the range of  to  seconds. Such tolerances are outside the design specification of the WTime service.Windows does do lots of things well and I say that as a  Linux sysadmin but time sync is NOT one of them.On the ESXi host timekeeping front the VMware advice nowadays is to set the host time with NTP but set the client VMs to not use NTP but use sync time with host from VMware Tools.You can use NTP if you prefer especially if your guest is using chrony instead of traditional ntpd since chrony copes much better with modern CPU behaviour such as idle states. Or you can use VMware tools time sync this also works well. Dont use both.TLDR dont use Windows time sync if you care about the time being in sync.DAMHIKT And you really should care about the time being in sync.

4640362,0,t1_ctfepnq,I dont know how much time you have already invested in your PhD program but you may be better off trying to finish that quicker than trying to work on IT certs on the side.  Unless you have some professional IT experience on your resume already you may need to spend at least a few years working near entry level type work to get almost anywhere whereas pay in IT unless you luck out and land a job that really lets you get your hands on a lot of things.  In addition unless you can find a part time IT job to utilize those certs they may expire before you ever use them in which case you burned a bunch of time on a cert you cant really honestly list on your resume.Tenure track faculty positions are hard to come by these days from what I have read but it isnt impossible and those that get them are often paid fairly well with reasonable benefits with usually reasonable worklife balance.The only issue I see is that unless you can somehow get a part time job in IT while you work on your PhD you may still find a hard time breaking into IT as well.  All other things being equal certs help but if you have little or no experience you really need to prove yourself and most companies arent going to let you work on anything to complex until you have proven yourself.  Unless you lie by omission about having a PhD some hiring managers rightfully will suspect you arent in this for the long term and think you are just waiting to land a job with your PhD.  If you did omit that you had a PhD though you would have a pretty big hole in your resume so there isnt really a good way to play it off without potential managers questioning your motivation to IT.Im not saying that brushing up on another set of skills is a bad idea but it may be difficult to get into IT once you have a PhD in an unrelated field.,sysadmin,ctfhgmb,1,t5_2qnp7

In a related note I was running my Windows Backup on my personal Win system prepping for Windows  and it failed due to disk being full  from starting right after checking the files. gt The backup was not successful. The error is Windows Backup skipped backing up system image because one of the critical volumes is not having enough free space. Free up some space by deleting unnecessary files and try again. x.Turns out my System Reserve partition MB was fuller than most with a Windows Recovery Image in there making it have MB free. The logic around VSS is by percentages and so it fails my backup despite the fact that I wasnt backing up system reserve. using easyUS partition manager I expaned it to just under GB to avoid the VSS not enough free space logic and reran the backup. It completed successfully.TLDR Turns out the System Reserve partition was being triggered by VSS to take a snapshot but there wasnt enough space according to the logic so I used EasyUS partition manager to moveresize my partitions C and system reserve to fix that. Backup ran perfect afterwards.,sysadmin,ctldnlb,1,t5_2qnp7

We noticed that these triggered only while we were moving mailboxes from  to . So after reading the link provided in this post we assumed that while Exchange  was moving the mailboxes it was verifying attachments using the OICE to verify that the .doc file didnt have any threats in it be and thus pulling out and inspecting long forgotten and hidden malicious files in users mailboxes. We tired correlating the GUID reference in the temp folder to both the mailbox move GUID and the Exchange Mailbox GUID of the mailboxes being moved but couldnt find a match.

Once thats done formulate a theory and test it until you know the cause and then fix that cause. Im mostly a Windows guy and I do sympathise with how unhelpful Windows logging can be but if youre looking at a nix box then you have no excuse for not working through the error logs and constituent parts of the system every log is human legible and is stored in the same place and every config file is plain text.

What is nice is that I dont have to worry about the type of wim or OS I am deploying it just handles all the sysprep and driver injection on the fly.  It is still hardware independent as it does all the drivers separately from each model and it also handles the software through the same process.I dont know the price of it but Im pretty sure it is cheaper than LANDesk and Altiris... but Im not sure because work bought it.  At any rate I have been extremely happy with it and I recommend it way above MDT or SCCM.

Because what is experience anyway? I could talk to one guy who has been managing linux servers for like  years and hed tell me he has moderate knowledge since he doesnt feel like he knows the inner workings of the kernel.Then you have some guy who is like  and takes the Linux exam and passes and thinks wow Im an expert and tells the interviewer so.But thats why as an interviewer I never ever ask a stupid question like Do you have experience with X? because if someone says yes or someone says no what does that tell me?Instead Id ask someone about a time they worked with a web developer and what they did and hope theyd tell me about what they did.

5132605,0,t3_3lald9,As someone in DevOps who has done and still does a fuckload of development but now holds the sysadmin keys Ill say that a lot of disagreements between the teams comes from a lack of understanding of what one another do. Developers frequently dont understand the complexity of what a sysadmin does they think oh just click Setup LAMP stack and my server should be ready and secure whats taking you so long...? Where sysadmins think developers are lazy and intentionally write shit code with constantly changing requirements for what the servers need to run it.In the end both jobs are complex and loaded with challenges so its best to try to find ways to work with developers instead of fighting with them. Where Im working now the developers used to run the show. They had sudoRDP admin access on the production servers. They could do whatever they wanted.My boss and my manager came in and said fuck this while doing a total reversal on our access rules. Instead of developers having access to servers to fix their stuff they now get vagrant boxes that mirror QAStageProd and all changes are done there. Servers themselves are off limits.While it caused a lot of tension between us DevOps sysadmins and the developers themselves we were eventually able to get them on board. Now its not even a discussion all code is deployed via CI and no dev has access to servers. But were willing to sit down with them and hammer out the requirements for a vagrant box that solves all their problems in a clean secure fashion. This way the developers have a great and easy to use environment that mirrors Prod and we have peace of mind knowing nobody is going in and aptget installing shit because they need another package on the servers.Plus developers get a little excited when you explain to them that youre able to rip down all their servers and rebuild entirely new VMs with their new requirements in a matter of minutes. When you see the gains from automation first hand there really is no argument to be had against doing things this way.,sysadmin,cv4o5at,4,t5_2qnp7

Theres really no need to pay for proprietaryenterprisey stuff  many arge websites use open source forums.For the purpose of trying them you could buy a cheap shared hosting account and use the automatic install scripts to install a few of the common ones so you can try them out. Alternatively could also play with some using Docker by looking for premade images on hub.docker.com. Id suggest going for a forum with less features rather than more and try to assess how easy they are to update ie. do they have upgrade scripts and are their releaseupgrade notes any good?.One thing that you have to consider is antispam. There are plugins and services to help do this but ultimately you need a team of moderators to rule with an iron fist because spammers will always find a way.You definitely want to get familiar with Linux system administration and web development. Fortunately this sort of project is easy to get started and you can always find something interesting to improve in the software your server or the way you operate. You can keep entertained and learning forever.Just get your hands dirty and remember to get a backup solution sorted out early. Encrypted backup to Amazon S is awesome easy enough to do on Linux anyway and quite affordable.Also I think Forums arent as popular as they used to be  consider integrating with social media to help keep relevant.

Both of you are right and both of you are wrong.Kurin BoredITGuy is trying to suggest that a script is a useful subdivision of a program and disagrees with your assertion that the distinction is arbitrary. Hes right! Its a useful distinction in certain circumstances. Its a bit like the difference between an associative array and a hash table. Technically theyre exactly the same thing. In different contexts one might have a connotation that better suits what youre talking about! Like everything else in technology verbiage there is both a denotation and a connotation.BoredITGuy Kurin is correct. While youre used to programs being compiled this is actually just one paradigm.

After a while it became nothing but adding LUNs patching VMware hosts Patching vCenter cloning images and it was just really boring. New storage hardware? So what its basically all the same.From there I got far more interest in the application layer. Virtualization is a commodity. Eventually cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft will take over.

Having worked for a consulting company that deals with small businesses we had to droprefuse plenty of clients because they just werent willing to put any time or money into IT. They expect the earth they want it for free there are some exceptions but you are about to build a server out of a recycled desktop so I dare say your company isnt one of them and if you help them out once then for some reason you owe them support forever after.Get a consultant involved and use Google or O and save yourself a heap of headaches. Play and learn on your own time.EDIT Even if it works perfectly by installing a decent chunk of the companys infrastructure you will become the IT guy. Facebook slow to load? Ask the IT guy.

But make it clear you have your own things to work on and will have to give the ticket back to him if something comes up.  Then when your boss comes knocking show him those.  ,sysadmin,cwmykt8,1,t5_2qnp7

Private bit torrent tracker?  Newsgroup listing site?  Yeah Ill agree with that on most cases.But surely you are aware of the public out in the open warez havens...the ones with millions of download links most of which deliberately fake the rest of with are potentially expired rapidshare or mega links.  Those are the sites Im talking about.Theyre also often packed with ads and they too are lower quality networks.  They use dark design patterns to get people to click on the wrong links.  They have to use lower quality networks because they have hosting bills to pay and because reputable companies dont necessarily want their ads on sites associated with piracy.And while I have a very thorough understanding of how the warez scene operates and how reputation is very important to them I also know that there are people out there who try to take advantage of the leeches.  Even if a warez group puts out a clean release that doesnt stop someone else from crafting an infected version of the files and uploading them to these public sites.  This also happens to torrent sites too.I am not disputing at all that highlyregarded legitimate websites can spread malware inadvertently.  I know it happens.  Ive read the reports.  But I do disagree that there arent classes of websites which are riskier to visit.And lastly just dont visit legallygrey sites on work computers.  If you dont own the box its not yours to endanger.

5663972,0,t3_3sodbi,This is from my current job that Im looking to leave.  Im an IT Manager for a corporate holdings company I get paid decent and am in charge of myself so its going to take a while to find something in my area that Im willing to leave for which bothers me more than anything. For reference I cover  facilities across  states.   users  servers and a whole slew of softwarehardware to support.  The oddities with my job start with a consulting group called Six D being hired after the owner retired and his  kids took over.  My opinion is that the kids are spoiled trust fund kids who are eating all the profits and saying theres not enough money.   The middle kid bought a lamborghini about a year ago and a porsche a few months back...... I cover Net admin Sys admin security training helpdesk and help do PLC work where needed. I also run wireconduit in factories and have licensing for every kind of lift under the sun. I tell them they need to hire a helpdesk guy and give them a list of job duties that this person will take on.  Mainly help desk POs receivers monitoring backups and basic AD user account work.  It was a well written outline that explained the need for another full time employee. They tell me to wait till my review . My review happens  months late just to kick this off.  I write up an overview of IT for my review.  Cover how things where when I started I replaced a bad group of consultants how things are now and what I believe is needed to keep IT moving forward.   No one pays any attention and they dont read my write up that Ive given them.  The CFO made comments during my review about how it was end of day and she wanted to go home which really ticked me off. . After review Im placed directly under the CEO and have to start having biweekly meetings with him.  CEO decides that instead of hiring a second person theyll pull projects from my work load.  He takes away  very important projects and lets them die.  He says its not a problem if they do.  But as they fail the original problems said projects were fixing come back.  Now were back to square  and no one cares enough to try and tackle the problem again.  Over the past month things onsite at several factories have gotten bad morale is low and several key employees all quit without saying where there going and refusing to talk about any offers to stay.  These leaving employees where management and engineers who are integral to completing these projects and there replacements would need to be retrained and taken back through the entire project if we were to redo any of them. I replaced the  projects they took from me with more projects from my back log of work needing done and they complained that I was adding to much work to my plate.   The entire conversation made no sense.  Its like they expect work to just magically dissapear until a perfect time to do it just happens. The general attitude around here is that the kids only care about their businesses and not the holdings company as a whole.  When you talk about issues and legitimate ways to fix them in my case use the ERP system correctly and train better for most problems no one cares.  They push the work onto someone else and say well if it fails then its on them.  That attitude has really killed it for me and I need a proper environment  to work in before the stress gets to me.  Oddly enough since I decided to look for a new job I feel like the guy from Office Space coming to work every day.  My only goal is to get my work done as good as possible and to leave quietly when I get another job offer.  If you made it through this thank you for reading my rant. tldr  It only takes a few bad managersowners to destroy morale and mismanage employees into leaving for greener pastures. ,sysadmin,cwz65rs,24,t5_2qnp7

Big corporations have deep pockets which means that everyone is looking to sue them over compliance issues.  They also do a lot of whatever it is that they do so one violation turns into a thousand very quickly which jacks up the penalties that much more.  Big corporations need lots of employees so theyve got that many more potential whistleblowers that arent willing to risk their neck for the profits of some absent shareholder.Small businesses on the other hand are often too small to sue and recover any real amount of money only have a few employees some of whom might actually own part of the company and be making money from their illegal activities and usually dont break the law often enough to attract a lot of attention. On top of all that corporations can afford to employ an entire legal staff whose entire purpose is to be knowledgeable about the law and legal risks.  On the other hand Ive never seen a small business employ a lawyer and they usually only contract with one after something goes horribly wrong.  The average person knows next to nothing about the law aside from what they hear on the news so its no surprise that you see tons of small businesses getting sued for things that the average person doesnt know about like taxes discrimination and sexual harassment.,sysadmin,cxjf6ik,2,t5_2qnp7

I click add click select principal and at first set it to Everyone figuring it would show all activity from all users including admins. But it for some reason wasnt showing any admin activity just normal users who were viewing the files. Normal users can only read and execute the files in that folder. Admins have full privileges so thats really who I want to monitor. So Then I changed the principle to Administrator and then it showed my activity when I was logged in  as Administrator.

Apparently there was a red flag on CPU within VMware  and the motherboard had reported memory slot  was bad so it was replaced under warranty.  VMware never did identify why it was giving the red CPU flag. I was doing an upgrade from a Dell server with DAS to a HP servers on a SAN.  I vmotioned all servers off to the SAN formatted the array on the Dell then copied servers back for part of the contingency plan.Once Monday came and the contingency period was over I no longer needed the Dell I proceeded with the firmware update DVD.  The BIOS update failed and the network update failed.  Now that Im retelling the story in detail I do recall the BIOS didnt fail as it did revert properly it was the onboard NICs that were bricked.  The BIOS failed back to its prior release.  Dell came out and replaced the motherboard.  I then had them rerun the bios update  I think the BIOS succeeded or perhaps it wasnt needed but the NIC update failed but didnt brick the board.   However when it tried booting ESXi it would not boot up.  It threw CPU errors. Ran diags cpu would crash and reboot while running tests on CPU.  So we pulled proc  and put proc  into .  Ran diags it booted and tested just fine.  Dell shipped out new motherboard proc and memory stick for good measure as it was showing failures again.After all that we got it all back up and running and they are using it at a branch office for ... I forget what.The other server that got updated was an HP ML? G running the update DVD. I was not the tech but was present when it happened. The update completed with failures the reboot forced the bios into recovery mode and it booted off the backup ROM but the server would not  boot up completely it just hung up on the windows loading screen.

I cant give you any real advice without understanding the situation. Are the tickets being sent because the others dont know what to do and just hope that you know where to send them to? Or do they send the tickets to the server team because thats how they often get resolved?What Im asking is  is the server team better equipped to deal with these tickets or are you just getting nonsensical requests?Off the top of my head Id say show the other teams how to solve small individual tasks and suggest to the managers that they become part of the routinearea of responsibility now that this team not the server team one of the other teams has learned this new trick.

Its just cludge on cludge right now.The end result even with competent staff Perhaps generous... is that unknown and forgotten design choices collide either expensively or catastrophically with significant harm to the organisation. Conventional failsafes like regular backups and monitoring cannot avoid or prevent these issues though they can lessen the harm of the eventual failure.Having not dealt with something like this before it has taken about a year to fully compose a strategy to Avoid creating additional technical debt Either uncover or remove existing technical debt without harming services Systematically reduce technical debt going forwardThe solution for the Systems and Network is to set up a parallel environment and migrate users and services across piecemeal implementing change control for services documenting as we go while adhering to best practice. Thats all. Nothing fancy. Just graft and doing it right.Once the process has started we dont even need to hold up new developments like hybrid cloud deployment because the new environment will be fully and sanely capable of supporting it.

You create it in and use it in the same script.  These dont stick around they do anything other then take up memory space while the batch file and any subprocesses are running and only for those particular processes.    echo off    set foobar    lt setting the variable    echo foo  lt using the variable    set barCD lt capture the current working dir in a var    blah bar     lt use it as an arg for the blah commandAs for how long it exists.  When a process sets an environment variable that variable is only associated with that process.  If a process starts another process the environment variables are copied to the child on startup.  In Windows you can also set a variable using setx which basically add to the registry so it added to processes Windows creates.,sysadmin,cypwaqn,2,t5_2qnp7

6208548,0,t1_cymtz9k,Hey man no worries glad you found it somewhat useful. Ive had the exact same issues coming into places built like that haha. My own standards now I usually keep an extra U physical DC in the VMware side just in case and for HyperV I almost always build the cluster outside the domain in their own world. I know Ill get flak for that but the cluster service that HyperV uses can be so god awful unreliable as it is I never feel comfortable with any other build strategy haha. As for the rest its a tough question for me to give an opinion on personally because I think right now Im of the mind that converged doesnt make a lot of sense for everything. To me theres actually nothing wrong with SILOd storage and being able to scale that silo independently of anything else seems to be a bigger benefit versus the supposed administrative simplicity that comes along with combining them all together. If it were me Id probably think more about why having everything converged is important to me. Is it for administrative purposes or perhaps an app that would greatly benefit from some data locality or is there some thought around potential reduction in costs etc. On top of that how vendor locked are you trying to get or not get  or do you even care really as long as it works? I dont have to state the obvious by saying it can be as complicated or as simple as we all want to make it haha. OpenStack is definitely potentially a very complex beast especially when you get into the world of developing and maintaining an inhouse stack with CEPH or similar. Time Warner gave a tragically terrible presentation on their CEPH implementation a year or two ago... but its definitely worth watching to see just how challenging it can be to know the little ins and outs but uh they definitely arent public speakers no offense guys  Alternatively to the custom build route as you know Nutanix offers a supposedly simple out of the box style bit that emulates the same thing. Hey you could even go just with vSAN and a traditional SAN pool architecture for the same price point Im sure really. Not that the wallet should drive everything but yeah we all have budgets to stick to. Ultimately all this stuff really just comes back to your needs. Is the thought of convergence because of a couple core Apps and their performancelatency requirements? Well maybe vSAN combined with traditional storage and vmware storage policies applied to those app stacks will work best. Is it just administrative overhead? Well maybe VVOLs over a single generalized storage platform like SolidFire or Trinti will work for you. Or is it that the org wants a true cloud abstraction a la Amazon and others? Well.. openstack might then be the route but then your costs shift from licensing of prebuilt things like Nutanix to the staffing required to implement and maintain whatever you build in house. This is all just my two cents really. Youll be spending money in one place or another nothing is free of course haha its just a matter of how the org and you wants that money to be spent and what you really want to get out of it at the end of the day. ,sysadmin,cyvcfk8,1,t5_2qnp7

Like if middleofnowhere North Dakota had a hospital that needed a heart surgeon and no one locally had the needed qualifications an HB worker could be brought in for the job.  The way the program is currently abused is to take jobs that American workers already have like Disneys IT staff and displace them with HB workers.  It is sometimes done through creative loopholes like a company hires a contracting firm to replace their IT staff and the contractor is the one sourcing HB employees.  HB employees are essentially slaves.  If your company is screwing you you quit and go somewhere else.  An HB cant as their ability to remain in the USA relies on their job.  The HBs I have worked with most recently a guy a vendor put onsite for a three month project have been terrible.  They barely speak English and have no clue what they are doing.

We setup drops on  walls of most offices so no matter how the occupant arranged their desk they wouldnt have to drag a cable across the room How many ports do you need in each office? Add an extra.  We dropped one line for computer one line for voice and one spare line. The spare line has come in handy as we have had some users need private printers or multiple computers. While you can deploy a cheap dumb switch to solve the issue if you are doing drops might as well do extras. Get a proper IDF specd out in advance. Dont let management decide that that computer stuff can just share the maintenance closet or boiler room. It doesnt have to be large and fancy for the amount of gear you are talking but enough room to wall mount a rack big enough to hold your patch panels and network switches and room to work. Are there empty offices in the new location that may be filled in the future? Plan for future growth.

Some of his talk may be self serving and missing crucial details but almost all of it was useful.gt gt He even had the self awareness to take the piss out of himself. At the end of the presentation he displayed a QR code for attendees to scan for more information joking that whod really trust something like that from the NSA.gt gt El Reg asked Joyce about the encryption backdoor question and he came out strongly against borking strong security by the police. Its clear this guy really does care about security at least as far as the US is concerned.gt gt Coming to Enigma was a brave move and his presentation thankfully lacked the bland hand of PR that has marred other NSA speakers at events at Black Hat RSA and DEFCON.

Sure green sources such as wind sunlight and such are almost perfectly clean I am not counting manufacturing because they all create bad things for the environment  nuclear has quite a bit of waste if you count the enrichment of the uranium....but the technology isnt here to power entire countrys and they are dependent on weather. The problem is responsible handling of materials and more security and control of facilities. We havent been able to build new plants that are much safer and create substantially leat waste. We can actually burn a lot of the waste that we have in storage. I think that new technology is making nuclear power a very safe and very efficient...as long as we are allowed to build and use the new technology.As far as nuclear weapons I am not sure how I feel. I know nothing good comes from them. But I treat it as a gun problem. Since the bad guys have access to the technology we must have a means to fight back. If the US was the only ones with nuclear capabilities I would say that we should get rid of them but we dont live in a perfect world.

6597869,0,t3_461ezx,Powershell.I see people doing a lot of work and a lot of digging around for that one configuration option when a powershell one liner makes it easier.It has gotten to the point where if you can not do it via powershell there might not actually be a way to do it. MS is forcing a lot of configuration only through powershell. In fact most of what you see on a  server is powershell or runs an aspect of powershell.PS can run commands native to cmd ps can hook into C libraries and dotnet. PS can manipulate registry entries wmi queries locally and remotly PS can hook into CIM and depending on the vendor leverage APIs within the CIM all via powershell. I can pull perfmon stats while filtering event logs via powershell remotely. FFS you can even launch a COM app and manipulate it and data within it via powershell. Manager bugging you about reports? Powershell those badboys into an HTML CSV or what ever you damn well choose. Then you can import all that data via TSQL via....yup powershell to a database you automated the building of via powershell.If you think to your self how cool an application  is you should also think about how you can take that and make it into powershell because its possible.Then you can be blown away by powershell profiles. Unlock Name is all I have to type in powershell to unlock an AD account for example. This is even shorter than having to...   ImportModule ActiveDirectory    UnlockADAccount name    Saving me keystrokes.   Ever work in powershell and leave the work in the console only to realize you needed something still there but you dont have a history that contains it? Well powershell can create transaction logs of everything you type and all output recieved and store that data in text files.Powershell. Well time to get back on my server  machines and not be able to do half of what I said here.    edit I lied I either dont know how or have not figured it out but I can not seem to terminate TCP sessions via powershell.

6628040,0,t1_d04sw39,I think this project as well as some other FOSS projects was created out of a recognition of problems inherent in proprietary software.Lets say you have some proprietary software that only runs on Windows XP.  It may be an old game that youd like to preserve for artistic value or some kind of application thats important to your business or the hardware drivers that run some piece of equipment.  It doesnt matter very much what it is but its an application that youd like to be able to run and it only runs on Windows and will not run on new versions of Windows.Now Windows XP is completely unsupported and by that I dont just mean that Microsoft wont provide support when you encounter problems but also that there are no updates no security fixes and new computers wont be able to run Windows XP.  Microsoft is also no longer licensing Windows XP so if you dont already own a copy you have no legal way of running it.So imagine you want to run such an app and your goal isnt just to run it for the next year but you want to be able to run it in  years  years or even longer.  How are you going to enable that?  Really there are two possibilities If you can get access to the source code of the software itself you can alter and rewrite it over time over and over again as you change platforms to enable it to continue running as time goes on. You could instead engineer a platform that is compatible with the software where you have the source code to the platform and can keep the platform updated.The second option is going to be easier and more effective but the big problem is that you now need a version of Windows compatible with Windows XP but where you have access to the source code.  So now you have to ask the question Which is easier getting Microsoft to open source Windows XP or rebuilding a Windows XP operating system from other FOSS software Linux  WINE  whatever?,sysadmin,d04wa4u,11,t5_2qnp7

I would not worry too much about any networking certifications just yet  they expire every three years.  Now if you want to pound out your Cisco CCNA in High School then add a second CCNA or a CCDA certification in College that can work.  Just be aware of the extra workload.  Choose a University with a solid Information Systems department.  IS is often aligned with the Universitys Business Department  School of Business and not the Engineering or Computer Science department so be sure and poke around there.  The best things you can do right now are   Make the PSATSAT your personal bitch.  Scoring high on PSATSAT opens opportunities for academic scholarships and increases chances of admissions to better schools.  Additionally Id encourage you to embrace Linux now.  Add a second hard disk or configure a dualboot arrangement and start running Linux fulltime.  I know you dont see the connection between a PC Operating System and Networking amp Servers just yet so I need you to just trust me on this.  Linux will help you later.

Some idiots sports fan rubs me the wrong way I am not going to lump that whole teams fanbase into the same label that person is just a jerk.  Fanboyism exists in all things  Mac vs PC Chevy Vs Ford Vi vs Emacs Xbox vs PS etc.   We get it everyone hates fan boys but if you really hate a platform because of people I feel you never gave the platform a fair assessment.  I have met plenty of Microsoft fanboys in my time that are just as equally annoying.gt they have the genius bar so if you go there you must be a genius or feel that the people working on your device are both neither or half of it may be true but thats not the point its the marketing behind it and the fact that you feel smart just because you own a product which may or may not accurately represent your true intellectual capabilities.Yeah Genius bar i LOL at that so hard.  We have had ex Apple Geniuses apply for entry level positions at jobs I have held.  We will hire one but typically they dont impress us.  However I do know some that came up through the Apple Genius path and they are extremely competent and smart people.    As for marketing if anything Apple markets how hip it is not how smart you are.   The Genius bar is like the only exception to this.gt the price for the device i feel is also ridiculous as uTargren pointed out but youre not really paying for the hardware youre paying for the support as with anything enterprisecommercial. ive had friends that have dropped their macs off their bunk beds in college and have gone to the apple store saying i dont know what happened it stopped working and they fix it is absolutely amazing. but it reinforces the fact that if youre an idiot and pay lots of money theyll take care of you and its ok to be an idiot... its not ok to be an idiot.This is entirely not true.  Warranty does not cover physical abuse.  Apple has a good customer service policy to sometimes replace abused hardware to keep the customer happy.  They may be the only company that does this.   You are wrong also about your hardware statement you are most definitely paying for the hardware.  High end components IPS back lit LED screens metal unibody design light weight long battery life if you try to match a laptop spec for spec it is the same price as the MacBook Pro.  The thing is Apple doesnt use low end components.  It is like someone going to an Audi dealer and trying to get Volkswagen prices.   If you want the Audi you pay the price for an Audi and you get what you pay for.  High end Lenovos or Dells that actually match the hardware spec of an Apple laptop are same price and in some cases more expensive.  The difference is you get the cheap Volkswagen option on the PC side.,sysadmin,d0czs3x,0,t5_2qnp7
6706579,0,t1_d0cy3vj,Ive used ansible pretty heavily and for me the biggest architectural gotcha is that ansibles default model is a push model.  This works well for deploying new machines or pushing out singular changes but you cannot easily use this to maintain the state of long lived infrastructure.  Additionally this push model doesnt scale super well.  When I was at around  nodes with ansible each run would take  minutes to complete.  Im sure I could reduce the time it takes to do a run if I tried but Im not left super confident that this is going to scale to  nodes.ansible does support a pull model but its a bit of a pain.  It definitely feels like it was thrown in as an afterthought.Personally I use both chef and ansible now.  Chef for maintaining configuration state across my infrastructure ansible for orchestration type tasks.  EG. I need to change the owner of a file in tmp across  nodes.  I dont need this enforced by chef so I use ansible to make that change.  Technically you can use chef for that as well but doing this with ansible is really really easy.,sysadmin,d0d0nrg,4,t5_2qnp7

Not sure Id recommend it for everyone but a lot of our key apps either use Oracle Database or WebLogic so it made sense for us.  Support isnt amazing but it hasnt been completely terrible either.  We more buy the support so that we get ksplice and have a number we can call which makes the higherups happy over something like CentOS.Kernel ksplice has been great and pretty much just works  no reboot required.  Ive only had  box not able to install patches live in the last  years and its an odd duck Oracle Linux  with an ancient kernel required by the version of OpenAFS its running.Userspace ksplice required a reboot to take effect because it basically replaces the normal glibc and openssl packages with special ksplice versions that can load future patches live.

What if it wont fit?Veeam veeam veeam. If windows can see it Veeam can backup to it.

So I found a job at company C at  more  than company A for a job that was more closer to my career goals. I didnt fit in with thier culture which was  probably the worse job experience for two years. So I found an opening at company A for  than what i was making originally and after working there for  months they gave me a  raise which is not something they normally do. When I was gone the company was sold. The CEO left. The new CEO cut all the upper and middle management loose and hired his own management. The management was the cause of why I didnt want to work at company A. Now this is the best job i have ever had. In my experience the grass is not greener on the other side. You trade problems for other problems you just have to find the job with the problems you do t mind dealing with.

Microsoft does a great job at implementing new changes utilities and powerful tools but they seem to be moving away from approachable and translatable implementations for management. Its almost abstracting the natural translation and encouraging the administrator management divide. They need to understand that they are empowering the department to empower the business but without the business side the implementations wouldnt exist. Help us sell the business and quell concerns.I think MS needs to implement a lot of the features you mention here with an emphasis on approachable reporting and alerting.I want to emphasize on  for VSS. Not just per folder but go even further and allow policy driven VSS for files of specific types amp content.I also would really like to see revision based vss retention not just space and timeline based snaps.When looking at the previous versions I dont want to see the snap time I want to see the last captured modified time. My other  centsI also want to add a better implementation of best practice analysis. I feel the older copies of windows server with downloadable BPA had more fine grained information. New windows server BPA feels like it might as well just say thanks for choosing Microsoft!I really want to see emphasis on reFS development. Im incredibly excited by it but there are features and functions missing that exist in ntfs making it not ready for use. Bridge that divide!FinallyI want integral historical ACL retention. At x date what filefolder access did employee y have access to.back when folder A was used in my timeline what employees could have read the files?I also want ACL entries with SIDs to retain resolved account name in metadata at time of ACL modifications.

6858578,0,t1_d0tphzi,Well you can do half of what you want by setting up an SPF record assuming your mail system even checks SPF but this will only be useful if the spoof mails are forging the envelope sender  return address to look like yours. In a lot of cases that address would be forged as something different like maybe a domain that doesnt have an SPF record so that your mail server will accept it or maybe an email address that a spearphisher controls so that replies would be sent to him.In both of those cases SPF would not help. And in both SPF would not check the From address which is probably the one youll see forged most often because thats the one users see.Its unfortunate that your mail system may not provide you with what you need but if you can research a bit youd be looking for Groupwises equivalent to Exchanges transport rules. With an ability to filter email based on From addresses you can address the part of the equation that SPF does not.Additionally if you have a spam filter sitting ahead of your mail server and internally addressed mail doesnt leave that mail server you may be able to just simply blacklist your own domain in the filter if you dont expect to receive mail from your domain originating outside of your environment.,sysadmin,d0tq8vs,9,t5_2qnp7

6892423,0,t1_d0xj738,I tried Mint and while it was nice it didnt feel really that polished and nice as the public opinions would make it seem. I dont see how Mint is necessary to have as a separate distro what makes it different from just Ubuntu with Cinnamon as the DE? If the reason to choose Mint is because it looks and feels more like Windows then I would rather choose Ubuntu MATE or Xubuntu or just install Ubuntu and install Cinnamon. Thats just because theyre actually Ubuntu and the more standard and mainstream your distro is the less obscure and weird problems youll run into.Regular old Ubuntu didnt appeal to me because of Unity. Now Im not a blind hater. I used Ubuntu with Unity and quite enjoyed it but there were problems like searching in the Dash was slow theres the weird Amazon thing and theres very little customizability. Of the modern DEs I prefer Gnome since its IMO well thoughtout coherent has a modern and consistent! look and feel and is very customizable through shell extensions. Maybe Ubuntu GNOME would be a nice distro for me but somehow I feel that Fedora is just more coherent under the hood too. Its a lot like the argument Mac users often throw tight integration between hardware and software Fedora feels to me like the different software components fit together and work together better and with less problems.Maybe its because Fedora is developed by Red Hat who develops both Gnome and systemd and a lot of the other pieces of the puzzle too. I dont know because I havent studied the OSes to really see how the parts are integrated together. All I know is that since I switched from Ubuntu to Fedora a bit over a year ago nowjust because I had never used anything other than Ubuntu and I wanted to know what it was like my experience has just been less problematic and more like what I feel that a computer experience should be.Now this turned into a long rant but its just my two cents on my own experience using different operating systems.,sysadmin,d0xkodh,1,t5_2qnp7

I finally got that entry in my gpo when I took the windowsupdate.admx and adml files from the WindowsPolicyDefinitions folder and copied them to my central store overwriting the windows  v.  version of the admx files that I figured were the newest. Now this part is all conjecture. The ADMX downloads installextract the adml and admx files into the Program Files xMicrosoft Group Policy folder and this is where I was copying everything from. However the version of admx file that is actually needed was distributed with Windows Update KB which apparently extracts the updated admx and adml files to the WindowsPolicyDefinitions Folder. When I didnt have the Turn off the upgrade to the latest version of Windows through Windows Update GPO entry I downloaded the latest Win  Admx files and tried using those. Then after further research I installed the specific required patch. It wasnt until reviewing the post that referencing the windows directory again this morning did I realize that I hadnt tried replacing the windowsupdate.admx file found in the Windows directory in the central store after I ran KB. This was a lucky break for me as users in my org started getting the  prompt for Win late yesterday.

The only supported way to fix this is to reinstall the operating system.This can be frustrating if youre testing your deployment and sysprepping multiple times and dont realize youre rearming each time then after three tests your OS is broken and you have to start over from the beginning.If you dont have a KMS key the solution is to disable the rearm step so you dont reset the countdown timer which consists of setting a few registry keys and specifying SkipRearm in your unattend.xml.Before sysprepping    REG ADD HKLMSYSTEMSetupStatusSysprepStatus v CleanupState t REGDWORD d  f     REG ADD HKLMSYSTEMSetupStatusSysprepStatus v GeneralizationState t REGDWORD d  f     REG ADD HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionSoftwareProtectionPlatform v SkipRearm t REGDWORD d  f     start wait msdtc uninstall    start wait msdtc installThen copy your unattend.xml file and Setup scripts into your installation    copy myfileserversomefolderunattend.xml Cwindowssystemsysprepunattend.xml    robocopy myfileserversomefoldersetupscripts CwindowsSetupScripts e And finally sysprep    cd Cwindowssystemsysprep    sysprep oobe generalizeIn your unattend.xml make sure to specify not to rearm in the generalize pass    ltsettings passgeneralizegt        ltcomponent nameMicrosoftWindowsSecuritySPP processorArchitectureamd publicKeyTokenbfade languageneutral versionScopenonSxS xmlnswcm xmlnsxsi            ltSkipRearmgtltSkipRearmgt        ltcomponentgt    ltsettingsgt,sysadmin,d13uyk2,1,t5_2qnp7

Example...We have a moisture analzyer for materials we use in manufacturing. It has a serial port. The company that sold it to us said a printer that supports it costs  minimum and the software to read the serial information officially costs  dollars. We then just hooked up a spare PC to see what serial printing would do and collected the data. It was plain text. Made no sense for us to spend  dollars on this software that may or may not be supported forever and instead made more sense to setup a raspberry pi connect it to the serial port get it on the wifi and just have it transmit the data to an automailer that then sends it to people and drops it a text file on the network where it needs to go. This was much cheaper to do than buy the stupid proprietary solution. our time my bosss time maybe  minutes? mine ? or  dollars?I dont like these absolute statements in IT where you try to apply enterprise grade thinking to the SMB world it isnt always an option. If we had thought to just buy the software what about  years from now when its not supported? However with our solution we have it documented we have the image for this specific use raspberry pi out there and all this information means we could do it with another device like it in the future if they stop selling raspberry pis.,sysadmin,d17xsmv,1,t5_2qnp7

Tho just  drive RAID for both would probably be fine too buy however much you want of WD reds for bulk storage with ZFS for your files leave few slots freeSplit like that ensures that your bulk storage is cheap and uses less power your VM storage is faster and separate so they dont affect eachother.And if you do find yourself lacking IOPS for certain project you can just pop a SSD in one of free slots and have it exclusively for that.

If this happens all of their files in owncloud are lost UNLESS you are able to use the admin recovery password on their account. The problem is that for whatever stupid reason they decided that each user has to individually go into their owncloud account page and enable admin recovery access. The justification for this?

You will first have to monitor things for a while and find who sends mail on your behalf to weed out legitimate and fake senders. After that you will need to quarantine but start conservative and slowly raise the  of what is being quarantined. Quarantine will most likely just be your spam folder. After you are  sure that you are not quarantining legitimate emails you can start slowly rejecting mail. But make sure you dont just blindly turn on  reject because you are going to have a baaaaaaad time. Adding ruamailtoruaexample.com rufmailtorufexample.com to your DMARC record will send zipped XML reports to that address. Those are a bitch to open and read every time. We use  for that.

If I host my own site with my own cert I can still provide an  session but the application chrome in this case doesnt inherently trust my cert because it wasnt issued by a trusted root CA Verisign Entrust etc. usually stored in the browser by default.

Very hard to understand when youre not only learning the language but also the concepts of programming Python  pretty good but a little lean on the plugin library at the time Ruby  Scores well in all my criteriaI bought this book Learn to Program which is small  page book focused on learning to program and introducing you to it through Ruby.

7151014,0,t3_4dfmu5,Admittedly Im a student without the industry experience or time that you have. So please take this with a grain of salt. If it helps great. If not no worries.Have you taken a step back and evaluated how youre trying to learn to do this? If books and online guides are not working perhaps you should look for an evening class at a local university community college or technical school. After all youre after the knowledge not the degree.When I first began programming I tried and tried and tried to learn from highly recommended online guides and books. Often times it was too much too soon and I would put the book on my shelf never to be opened again. Fast forward a couple years I began taking the intro classes for my CS degree. I began programming in Java and my professor taught us concepts bit by bit and concept on concept. Giving us tools to put in the toolbox. Combined with the assignments due dates I forced myself to struggle through these new concepts.Important note here  there have been LOTS of people that are much older than me in my intro courses more so in the evenings. Do not let this be a limiting factor if you decide to investigate classes.Continuing on I discovered that at that point in my life I was able to focus so much better on how to program from these lessons than I was with other lone resources. I have no idea how often I sat at my computer pulling my hair due to my being frustrated over things that I now view as trivial. It was worth it and I look back in pride at struggling through it.I did not get to where I am in a month. It took me many semesters to get where I am now. During these months and semesters I was not waiting for the next assignment or doing nothing. I was regularly toying around with these small things that I was learning. I made so many pointless little programs  just for the sake of refreshingsolidifying concepts to experiment or just to see if I could do something someway or with some method. Heck many of these programs never resulted in anything most were never finished and many others I picked up again later to finish to experiment with concepts for another language.Fast forward to now and Im comfortable using online guides or documentation as a reference not a crutch more capable as a programmer creating programs and scripts. New languages dont scare me nor does perusing others code for critique. Admitting to defeat and the fact that studying on my own wasnt working for me was a huge step for me. tldr  Evaluate how you are trying to learn. Explore other methods such as classes. Break it down learn and experiment with the basics. Most importantly dont expect to become a pro overnight. ,sysadmin,d1qzybc,1,t5_2qnp7

LTO can stream up to  MBs so that probably isnt your bottleneck.  Also check your block size on the tape drives in BackupExec.  Having it too small like k can slow down the write speed. I think I was using K on my sets.Also you really really dont want to be streaming those differential backups directly to tape.  Youll shoeshine your tape drives in no time speaking as someone who did the exact same thing to my LTO drives with BE differential backups.

The criu project checkpoint and restore in userspace is working on this but their implementation is not productionready and in comparison with VM migrations  which are straightforward you just transfer CPU state and memory  its scarily complex. It needs to keep track of everything  from sockets and file descriptors to inotify watches see  Its extremely impressive that it works at all.   You share kernels. This cant be stressed enough. It massively increases the attack surface in comparison with VMs and it removes a lot of flexibility. If one of your containers need specific kernel modules say CIFS or fuse or specific settings things get complicated. If one of your containers happens to run an application which triggers a kernel bug all of your containers are gone Ive been there.... If you install security patches the entire host goes down no matter what. Theres no defense in depth  SELinux and AppArmor dont change this. See also    Linux auditing still does not work well with containers which can be an issue in enterprise scenarios. This will be fixed at some point  Ive seen patch sets floating around for years.Containers only really make sense for singletenant cloudstyle applications with no local state and clean application ltgt database separation where high availability and redundancy is built into the application and the loss of a single host is acceptable. This is where CoreOS and Docker are extremely useful and valuable.For multi tenant systems or traditional high availability scenarios by all means use virtual machines except if you dont care about uptime or security.VMs have come a long way. The performance overhead is extremely low nowadays thanks to paravirtualization and hardware features like SRIOV and there are some great developments around lightweight hardware virtualizazionbased containers    An introduction to Clear Containers      I believe that those are the future  by running their own kernels they remove most of the risks at a very low cost while still providing the deployment advantages of containers. As far as I know Google is using something similar inhouse where they use Linux containers for deployment but wrap them in KVM VMs for security.,sysadmin,d1tcn4f,14,t5_2qnp7

Also dealing with a v or an a or t or i for that matter although most of the nonFTE technical employees with microsoft.com addresses will be vendors or contractors v or a doesnt mean youre not talking to Premier support but if you pay for the incident any way other than out of hours on a Premier support contract youre not talking to a Microsoft employee  youre in Professional support land which is outsourced to vendors.  I cant and wont say anything one way or the other about it either as I was actually working in Premier CSS years ago when that decision was made to outsource the profree cases and as I understood it the decision to keep the profree business out of the Premier queues was a business decision probably financial hundreds of dollars an hour for Premier cases versus a onetime fee of a few hundred dollars for a pro case can add up when cases take hours days weeks etc. to solve.With that said obviously using a Premier support case isnt a guarantee youll get good support just as opening a payper pro case doesnt guarantee that youll get poor support.  However the odds are better than even that the Premier support incidents especially for core products will have you engaged with someone who knows the product well sometimes extremely so especially if your problem ends you in the escalation tiers and the odds that youll get a vendor on a pro case who can handle your Microsoft issue like someone in Premier probably arent those same odds.If its a Premier case and you have a case  I can see what I can do to help.

If someone changes the name servers to point to fraudulent ones a higher TTL will reduce overall damages done.

I believe in these cases the TTL was  hours for one and  or  for the other.ampnbspIt all comes down to knowing for sure that if your TTL is set to  minutes within  minutes of something going wrong you know all your users are pretty much screwed.

But from what I have seen about Parallels it is made to be as easy as possible to exchange data between the VMs. Qubes tries this too but not if it compromises security there are a lot of interesting design choices in Qubes to achieve that goal. read the documentationpapers from them if you are interested.I agree that Qubes can be complicated to use for normal usage but thats not what it is built for. It is designed for when your threat model includes nation state attackers NSA GCHQ Mossad China ....

7585356,0,t3_4j5ua7,My prediction is that Cloud  important today  will be more important tomorrow. Cloud represents a practice and a philosophy toward system administration applications are being developed so they run in either onpremise Clouds or some providers Cloud. Running an app designed for the Cloud is a different experience from one designed for an Enterprise target those who continue to say that Cloud is just running your software on somebody elses system either have a point to make or dont understand what theyre talking about yet.There is a divergence happening right now in sysadmin culture the DevOps admin vs. the hardware admin.  Being a hardware field admin guy is hard work requiring lots of specialized knowledge. Its not that one role is skilled and one is lessskilled but that the skillsets required are diverging instead of converging.  The generalist role is becoming vital but stratified toward higherskilled longertenure employees while the specialist role offers enormous growth opportunities with minimal skills.It seems as if it used to be you started life as a SA as a generalist then worked toward being a specialist. If I were new to the job market now Id pick a specialty and work on becoming a generalist over time instead.. Containers amp virtualization. Docker is but one container management system but IMHO the most successful so far. Expect ripe competition in this space. If you can understand containers LXC Solaris kernel amp nonglobal zones FreeBSD jails and more youll understand how to play in this space.  Virtualization plays intimately in the container space for many reasons security among them so you really need to understand both to be competitive today.. Storage specialization. In the race toward hyperconvergence many vendors are neglecting storage performance. On the plus side SSDs  for now  often allow them to ignore their most egregious mistakes in managing the slowest part of the software stack. Learning how to effectively manage disaster recovery in a Cloud environment  whether orchestrating a vendor solution or working around a vendors lack of a solution  is an incrediblyvaluable skill.. Hyperconverged administrator.  While hyperconvergence has an important niche to fill it will not dominate the entire market because it simply is not always the right choice and a hyperconverged infrastructure is very rarely the highestperformance or lowestcost option.  However its good enough for an awful lot of cases at a reasonable price for the flexibility you gain.  Knowing how to choose and implement the best hyperconverged options is becoming an increasingly valuable skill in midsize and largescale enterprise amp Cloud computing at the lowend though companies are increasingly likely to outsource their compute infrastructure to a Cloud provider. . Engineered Systems.  The market for all Cloud Compute amp Cloud Storage is growing and this includes nonhyperconverged infrastructure though admittedly the HC stuff is growing faster than nonHC right now!. This means that specializing in certain technology silos designed for specific purposes will remain indefinitely useful. Big Data Analysis HadoopHDFS Apache Spark MongoDB etc. is an example that may be built on a hyperconverged platform but often an engineered system will solve the problem faster.  When time is money its frequently cheaper to lay out more money for a system that will give you an answer now instead of less money for one that will divulge its secrets several months from now.  Highperformance reduces costs.. Data integrity specialization. Something that people frequently ignore in piling their stuff into the Cloud is How the hell do I back my stuff up? because frankly trying to pull down petabytes of data over a WAN pipe is very painful.  A closely related question is How do I give access to other companies suing us in discovery without giving them access to our whole enchilada?  Ive written on this before there arent enough people playing this game and recent data breaches and data losses highlight the need for SAs who dont suck at understanding how to keep their data alive despite hostile threats.. DevOps. This career track seems to have really grown into its own new category of devops admin rather than being adopted by the industry as a whole. Like multiclassing in a roleplaying game the role will often suck at traditional tasks for a really long time but once you get the experience needed to be effective  about  years for most nonsavants  and stick with a company building a product long enough you can build and deploy some amazing things because of your unparalleled knowledge of the whole stack from soup to nuts.Of course the existing networking OS hardware and other roles will continue to exist. But with the rise of Cloud and DevOps were seeing these roles go to work for Cloud providers and larger companies at the expense of the small to midsize market.  If you want to be the OS generalist system administrator in the emerging market youve gotta bring something else to the table besides fixing PCs and printers.My two cents.  As always I believe if Im somewhere within  of reality with a prediction I nailed it and this advice is worth exactly what you paid for it!Disclaimer Im an Oracle employee my opinions do not necessarily reflect those of Oracle or its affiliates.,sysadmin,d34f200,8,t5_2qnp7

I read that as saying one user the right to access an rd session host server  i t doesnt say just one....I used Exchange user CALs as an example of how they work the same  not saying you need one for RDS!For example I have a VDI farm  my windows OS has SA on it so im covered on everything for VDI rights except the RDS CAL  no matter how many VDIs the user has I only need one CAL for the user.Note When using peruser RDS CALs there is no server side enforcement IIRC. that RDS mode is rather forgiving. The license server bit is so you can put ALL your RDS CALs into one server and enable all servers to handle sessions. Otherwise using RDS farm functinoality to handle user load with user cals would be horribly broken licensing wise. Device CALs are slightly different as they load a temporary certificate into a device to validate its a licensed one and remove a license from the available pool. ,sysadmin,d3hzkz5,1,t5_2qnp7

Try to track how much of your network is being utilised for nonbusiness applications and include that.Try to get pricing on three levels.Option  Do nothing.

Reasonably decent gigabit switches VLAN configuration router  firewall with applicationbased bandwidth control. Show the difference theyll see  x improvement immediately paying y dividends down the road. More charts.    Option  Shoot for the sky.  Cisco G switches new redundant fibre connections you name it.  This is industry standard what a company in their size should expect to spend.  Downside is initial cost upside is massive improvement in throughput and futureproofing for several years at least.All you can do is be honest  the network is working as well now as it was then.  If it seems slower its because more people are using it or the same people are using it more something that is outside your control.  You had no way of estimating a correct budget because you were brought on after the budget review was completed.If they go for it youre gold.  If they dont emphasize the problem will get worse and unscheduled downtime may occur if and when hardware fails.Edit  I work in a lot of these situations old networks at companies that dont want to put much money into them.  Getting blamed for crap that is completely out of your hands is normal unfortunately. Try to stay goal oriented and focus on reliability and future costsavings.

7805337,0,t3_4m7jew,gt Were looking at centrifyNo just dont.   I have a lot of Macs at my work like a very large amount probably more than most Orgs.   Ive been in the MacLinux admin side of IT for a while now and it isnt that hard.   Centrify completely rewrites the builtin Apple AD plugin in OS X.  It is complete third party magic so I would avoid them for Mac management at all cost.I should probably try to get someone to sticky one of my posts about Mac management in the Enterprise.  First off Dont Panic! and start to look at tools to help you succeed.   Here go some tools methods to help you get started. Casper Suite  fully loaded commercial offering comes with support does most things out of the box offers MDM solutions imaging inventory self service portal etc. Munki  Free Open Source solution that helps automate software installs and software updates.   Has a self service store and you can technically install profiles via pkg but to me that is a weaker point of Munki.   Munki is very good at installing and updating software.  Munki also has a self service portal PuppetChefAnsible  all have OS X clients and can be used for config management.  These tools are typically combined with Munki when Orgs choose to go open source and not pay for a commercial product like Casper.   Use tools like these to set configuration settings on OS X FV key escrow  use a redirect profile to send it to your web app to escrow the FV key.   Casper can do this automatically and store it in their JSS Caspers server side app.   Redirection profile can be found in OS X Server.app profile manager but you can redirect to any service you like.  So you could have your web developers build a web application to do it yourselves Casper does it out of the box.  You have options to choose from.gt the more I hate them and think they have no place in a corporate environment. Macs actually save us money over PCWindows boxes.  We did a huge internal study on it.  Many orgs have Apple products working in mass and have no problem with it.   Here are tools to avoid using as they arent that great for Mac management in my opinionexperience Airwatch iOS sure but their MDM OS X solution is not good KACE  yeah the best thing about KACE is how easy it is to setup.  They really nailed the virtual appliance thing I give them props for that.   Otherwise dont waste your time. Extended AD Schema  This is where Windows admins try to use Windows tools to manage Macs.  I am sure you can guess how it goes.  Centrify does this as well but adds their own third party magic to it.  Avoid this at all costs and last I checked their SLA on new OS support was  days upon release which is not acceptable for how rapidly Apple releases OSes. Absolute  I had to script everything because the product didnt do enough out of the box.  To the point I pretty much should have just written my own solution LanDesk  pretty much the same as Absolute Parallels SCCMMac plugin  never used it didnt seem appealing to me especially since SCCM is sort of a pile of garbage I didnt want to use it.  I advise against it but unless someone else knows way more than me feel free to add your review.Here are the big gotchas from Windows Admins when they are trying to figure out how Mac and Linux typically work.  First the biggest different will be a push model versus a pull model.   Almost every MacLinux tool goes to a pull model.  Imaging is generally not needed for deployment but for breakfix sure.  So I really dont advise imaging Macs when you get them in because you are literally laying down the exact same OS that it ships with.  Apple doesnt ship any bloatware on their devices.     Then the next thing is you need to start shifting your infrastructure to platform agnostic tools.   We dont map any network drives and we dont BIND to ADLDAP on any of our Macs.  It is all local accounts  web based apps  SSO.   People will try to claim that it doesnt work it isnt enterprise but it is.  The reality of it is Macs are desired end user laptops and they make a pretty good one at that.   The near future is going to be mixed client base with platform agnostic back end.   If you look at Stack Overflows  Survey OS X is now the number  desired dev platform and Stack Overflow estimates that next near  or more of dev machines world wide will be Macs.  It makes a lot of sense the Mac can run every platform and develop for every platform.   When you approach managing Linux and Mac systems you cannot keep a Windows mentality.  For example the word policy probably means GPO to every Windows Admin but the rest of the world policy is a pretty generic term.   Stuff like this typically trips up Windows Admins who are delving into new platforms.   You really dont manage things in LDAP like you do in AD and typically you leverage LDAP for what it is LDAP.  The Unix philosophy of do one thing and do it well means you will probably have to get your hand dirty with some Unix tools shell scripts maybe Python etc.   It isnt needed to get the job done but if you really want to do it right you should aim to have those skills.,sysadmin,d3tdqxa,6,t5_2qnp7

Even MSPs will outsource overseas when they get big enough.  Why hire a bunch of inhouse devs to build your apps when you can outsource half of them for a fraction of the price and then have one or two inhouse devs control the work?

Depending on what is done it can take quite a while to do everything.In lazy solution everything is installed after server starts and finally the application runs. While server startup will likely take  mins installing the software can take a while. Better solution is to essentially capture an image of configured system which was configured in similar way as in lazy solution and then run that. It will drop deployment time to that  mins.However when using containers you essentially just run the application in constrained environment. The image is run in copyonwrite mode so while all similar containers will run things from same container and benefit from various caches there is copyonwrite for writes and thus the changes are not shared between them.,sysadmin,d4db2d2,2,t5_2qnp7

I kept warning my boss though that we had to be careful about how we handled letting him go when the time came.  The guy had a history of breaking things in production letting his team flounder trying to fix it and then dropping in as the savior.  I never knew if he broke things on purpose or was just sloppy while he was working and broke things on accident.My boss never thought the guy would do anything.  They didnt really get along but he didnt think the guy was that untrustworthy but I was worried about back doors and shit like that.  Then one day my boss comes over all in a huff.  You were right!  He built a back door into all of the UNIX servers!  Look at this list of processes running on everything!  My boss pulls out a report of running processes and we found that dtlogin was running on almost every one of them.  DT got us!I had a good laugh before explaining to my boss that dtlogin actually stood for desktop login and was part of the display manager for our UNIX servers.

Ive been much more impressed with Arubas infrastructure capabilities and monitoring tools.I do not know why exactly the decision to go with Xirrus was had but I can say that it was done well before I was even brought in as a technician three years ago. They probably did an experiment in one of our large auditoriums which seats  students and decided that Xirrus worked better however the Layer  team probably halfassed it. Fastforward two years and youd find that WiFi was rolled off to us the recently organized Layer  team as a responsibility and weve hated having to deal with Xirrus hardware every day.As for half the number of APs the claims of Cisco and Aruba would definitely make it sound that way but I would still like to see their performance in our large lecture halls. Not because I dont think they can handle it but rather because I want to see how they perform with multicast isolationscrubbing ex. mDNSBonjour client bouncingroaming and high volumes of streaming.

8190775,0,t3_4rignk,. imo this is largely irrelevant as this is the environment youve got so you have to deal with how it is. fixing your NAT problems at the other sites so that you dont have the agents is going to require at the very least some network reconfiguration and possibly client reconfig reIPing the endpoints firewall or router rules etc. Maybe put that on a roadmap down the pike but if you just got this thing and youre learning I would suggest that you deal with that before you reconfigure everything.. If you dont have a central logging server consider setting one up ELK or Splunk or whatever so that you can get a highlevel view of whats going en masse. Bluecoats reporting is nice enough that maybe you dont need it though. Check out some youtube videos on how to do stuff with it..

Ive found my commutes are a lot less stressful and annoying when I read. Only really works if you enjoy reading though. You can also watch a show or something on your phone if thats more your speed. Very worth it to do something youd otherwise have to be stationary to do while commuting public transit.Find the Do Not Disturb setting on your phone and turn that setting on during at least an hour before bedtime. Unless your company will literally burn to the ground without you being available theres no reason you cant take some time for yourself without email or calls. Find a way to make that work even if you need to coordinate with a colleague to do so. Your time is important!Start working out again. Even doing some burpies or pushups at home.

My personal PC Ive got set to only start ramping its fans up when the GPU hits f andor the CPU hits f during gaming. So quite often the inside of the case will be sitting at f.Some datacenters run their cold aisle temperatures at up to f to save power... because as I said.. it will be a constant f going in so thermal expansion and retraction isnt majorThere are obvious caveats... ambient temperatures could sky rocket over the weekends PCs could be contributing too much heat to be comfortable for the users.... Lots of variables to take into consideration...,sysadmin,d5cci10,3,t5_2qnp7
8278424,0,t3_4sv09r,Probably your best bet is to setup a KMS server and activate it with the KMS Host Key you get from purchasing  r DC.   There is a  server minimum for KMS to work  but I dont know why youd buy datacenter if you werent virtualizing more than that.   You dont save money with datacenter unless youre going to have more than  vms   standard licenses.Then on your newly virtualized  vms youd change the product key to the published KMS client keys and then activate them against your new KMS server.Make sure to use the unique host key only on the KMS server and the below published client keys on the virtualized boxes.   Using a host key as the product key makes the server into a KMS host.You can find the client keys here,sysadmin,d5cd16i,5,t5_2qnp7

8307825,0,t3_4tbevn,At the end of the day those of us in IT are not the ultimate decision makers. There will always be a CEO or owner who outranks even the CIO and if the most senior management wants something done or not done a certain way we need to abide by their decision. In the event of something illegal thatd obviously be different but at that point we need to get as far away from that company as possible. For lesser situations it is our job to advise in a way management can understand generally by reflecting our views as they relate to the business in appropriate terms. Management doesnt know or care that you need a vCenter license and SAN and multiple hosts to put together an HA cluster with vMotion they care about minimizing lost revenue and increasing efficiency. If you dont understand anything about managing a business perhaps check out some basic courses at your local community college. If management wont listen to reason or are dead set on a decision make sure its documented then accept it and move on. An hour of downtime may not cost the company anything as far as the CEO is concerned because maybe the staff is all salaried and exempt and will just work an extra hour to make up for the downtime. That may be a more attractive solution than shelling out s of thousands of dollars to build extra redundancy into a system. ,sysadmin,d5g199x,41,t5_2qnp7
8312306,0,t1_d5fnaao,Good morning!Question I dont see any problem developing on any version of linux. Ideally you should be both Python . and Python compliant but thats work. You developed it in Py. and hopefully you or someone else will start the process of porting it to three as well. Havent seen the code yet. Unit tests and stuff. Python has a huge battery of cool libraries for that and it really pays to learn them.You can install any version of python from source as an altinstall so you could have the latest pythons without needing to upgrade the OS.local development  If you havent seen the comment urazielp had a recommendation for local development.In general I cant imagine it matters to your program where the running code is living considering it should use the users home directory or absolute system directories.You can also test using a vagrant virtual OS pretty easy to set upIm going to try to get you some unit tests going on as soon as I can find the time.Regarding changing the cheat directoryWhy not make it a flag or something?

8320980,0,t1_d5gwezp,Also  here. I got into devops about . years ago.I was in a job I knew was going nowhere for me. So I spent lunchtime and downtime learning tools I could use on the job or could land me a new job. The best part was that I did implement some of them. I wasnt even looking when a recruiter found me for a role. The things that were most helpful for me transitioning. Understanding linux. Most but not all of the tools out there are centered around linux. I had been using linux as a desktop OS for about  years when this role fell in my lap. I only wanted to learn linux because Google told me it was the reason I didnt get a helpdesk job there early in my career. I was pretty lucky that I already understood things like SSH linux permissions and file system hierarchy. Its pretty easy these days to get into linux though. VagrantVirtual Box are your friends and useful tools besides the point.. Scripting. The job I had at the time was just automated jobs running under CAs autosys but they were all shell scripts. k jobs a day. But I did get to mess with ruby if I wanted to python if I wanted to. I had been learning just the basics and I was always using  how would I do this in bash as a reference point. . Version Control. Take a couple days and learn some of the basics of git. Even if you dont end up going into a DevOps role this is one that will benefit you.. AWS has a free tier you get for a year. Learn at least something about the parts of cloud computing that are cool. Tons of AWS tutorials out there. Acloudguru has some great classes the Solutions Architect Associate is a great overview and runs like  on average on udemy.. Some way to deploy code. Bunch of tools out there for this. Capistrano Fabric Deployinator write your own. Lots of ways to do this but learn some of their nicer features like rollbacks  ex. if a code change causes a problem and there wasnt a database migration you can just instantly rollback to the previous version.. CICD  some kind of tool like this Jenkins Bamboo Gitlab CI Travis GoCD...bunch of them out there.. Some kind of config management tool  Puppet Chef Ansible Salt etc.. Just be aware of stuff like docker etc. Theyre already become standard at a lot of places. Hell knowing docker pretty well would give you a leg up on a lot of folks.Not saying you can master all these in a short amount of time. Id say a dedicated person could be passable in a year? I already had   and   the rest I picked up in about a year. I learned the basics of puppet over a long weekend in prep for the interview I had. Jenkins I was kindof familiar with. AWS I learned from the acloudguru material over  months and capistrano took a few days to get the basics of.If youre dedicated you can knock something out within a months sparetime if youre pacing yourself. Just pick one thing and learn it and then try to find ways to link them together.Some good books Infrastructure As Code Oreilly Phoenix Project explains what devops is as a fictional story. Hint its technically not a role but a way of getting teams to work together. Pro PuppetLearning ChefAnsible for DevOps Learn rubypythonetc the hard way Linux Documentation Project online resource Linux Administration Handbook handbook is a bit of an understatement  its a big but useful resource. Elements of Scrum if you want to learn more about Agile etcSecurity is a bit nuanced to get experience in. I took some security training and then the standard firewall permissions acl stuff most sysadmins get into. But even understanding firewalls security groups file permissions ACLs how SSL works how privatepublic key auth works bunch of other stuff. A lot of that youll just get over time anyways. My boss treated me with a CEHv course earlier this year that was fun but hasnt been too terribly relevant to my day to day work.Sorry for the wall of text.

By default    it will create a folder using the format        WeeklyYearMonthDayHourSecond        The script will delete the oldest folder once  subfolders have been created.    Use the Monthly parameter to do the same thing but for folders that begin    with Monthly i.e. MonthlyYearMonthDayHourSecond.        Because the export process can be time consuming you can use the AsJob parameter    which will be passed to ExportVM. You will then get PowerShell background jobs    which you can manage with the standard job cmdlets.        This script must be run as an administrator in an elevated session.        .PARAMETER VM    A comma separated list of virtual machines. You can also pipe GetVM into    this command.

8543273,0,t1_d69gjof,I didnt really say turn it over to the devs. I said the devops solution is for the same team to be responsible for operation as is responsible for creation.If its an outsourced team theres scarcely any chance of doing this the devops way. You need to carefully document the operational requirements and insist that the developers code to these requirements. Sometimes the middlemen are unwilling to press the development team as needed and thats the root cause of the problem. You also need to have these requirements written in from the start as its unfair and impractical to change the requirements halfway through development. This means devops teams need a seat at the table and to be recognized as a stakeholder in the development project.Devops is the answer to a lot of problems but one of its effects is to tend to force root causes to be fixed. One doesnt spend nearly so much time making underlying infrastructure bend over backwards to accommodate poor code when things are done this way.,sysadmin,d69h8x3,1,t5_2qnp7

This company had a fleet of over  MFPs and over the course of the year of using rd party toner they destroyed the printers. I dont have the details handy as this was at least  years ago but it was Staples brand toner. BBB purchases millions of dollars of HP hardware every single month and was told to kick rocks after they looked at each printers. Third party toner will destroy your printer eventually it happens every time and all the printer manufactures design the cartridges to do this.  The reason your printer is so cheap is because they know they will make their money from the toner. So suck it up buttercup and buy the HP brand toner or deal with ruining your printers. It sucks absolutely sucks that this is the case but this will happen every single time.  One caveat to this though Lexmark has their own refurbished tonerink.

So those were blocked.  I went through all the usual attachment extensions and blocked accordingly as well.Also if youre not doing business with those TLDs block them with a return email saying why and to call your main phone number if its in error.  We blocked all TLDs we dont do business with such as .de .fr .camera etc.Finally we use the geo blocking feature that Office  provides I imagine you can as well if youre not on that but it might be a bit more convoluted  so emails from countrys we dont do business with are blocked as well.

Done off the back of Powershell in Windows with Nano Server arguably showing that they still want to compete with Windows itself in more use cases but then bringing Powershell to the OS people actually use for a big slice of the pie.

Official parameter explanation could be found here  Also check on thisacl group control SIn a POSIX filesystem only the owner of a file or directory and the superuser can modify the permissions and ACLs on a file. If this parameter is set then Samba overrides this restriction and also allows the primary group owner of a file or directory to modify the permissions and ACLs on that file.On a Windows server groups may be the owner of a file or directory  thus allowing anyone in that group to modify the permissions on it. This allows the delegation of security controls on a point in the filesystem to the group owner of a directory and anything below it also owned by that group. This means there are multiple people with permissions to modify ACLs on a file or directory easing manageability.This parameter allows Samba to also permit delegation of the control over a point in the exported directory hierarchy in much the same way as Windows. This allows all members of a UNIX group to control the permissions on a file or directory they have group ownership on.This parameter is best used with the inherit owner option and also on on a share containing directories with the UNIX setgid bit set on them which causes new files and directories created within it to inherit the group ownership from the containing directory.This is parameter has been was deprecated in Samba .. but reactivated in Samba .. and above as it now only controls permission changes if the user is in the owning primary group.

Anyway this happening doesnt surprise me at all. In general it seems they dont know what theyre doing. That or there is malicious intent. Either way in my opinion this should not be a trusted CA.Edit Actually the story was that I had come across a blog that listed the steps involved and the certificate would be sent to you through email. Now thats perfectly fine if its just the public part of the certificate however the blog didnt mention any steps related to a CSR. So in the end they might be following proper procedure but for all I know they could be generating and sending you the keypair which boils down to the same they have processed your private key. Currently it does appear that they are doing it right at least they have mention of CSR in the FAQ.,sysadmin,d73nlvs,5,t5_2qnp7
8785639,0,t1_d73mwdb,They had an incident with their database that caused us to lose all of agents on over  Non domain laptops scattered across the US that needed to be locked down. They didnt acknowledge any incident on their end until  weeks later when the agents were out of their free grace period. Once they were out of their grace period the agents did nothing to protect the computers that they were installed on. So users were now able to do whatever they wanted on their computers. We had a good number of those laptops that got infected causing us to wipe them.After they restored their services those agents still did not work and they assured us that everything was working. Well it took them another week to acknowledge that they were wrong and offer us a solution. They gave us some script that did not work the option to send users an email which no one would click on since users never check important emails from IT or instructions to set up a GPO that would install the agent. None of those solutions worked for us so we had to contact over  users to get them to turn on their laptops and let us connect to them so that we could uninstall their agents and install a new one. We were promised a free year of service for this incident. Right now our service is expired and I had to battle them to acknowledge the previous events and give us our free year. Since our license is Dell OEM an EOL product they could not renew that service. So we know have to open a new account and redeploy the new agents on over  laptops again.I wouldnt say a thing if the response times to that service disruption were acceptable and if we were given what we were promised without having to fight for it again. But we were basically without service from them for over a month that couldve have caused us a lot more problems than just a few infected machines.Now the actual product isnt too bad you can setup groups and apply rules to them. They have ransomware prevention builtin and when you want to block a website or allow a website for specific users its not a hassle. When the agents actually work we dont have any infections but that is most likely because the antivirus doesnt actually have a chance to meet any infections due to the laptops not being able to access anything but a handful of resources.,sysadmin,d73vm0b,1,t5_2qnp7

So either rules need to expire boring but effective  or you need to find the sweet spot on the parabola?  This is one of those using words to sound more photosynthesis moments curve where you are blocking the top X of offenders but adding and removing at the same rate with some room for swing for say a DDos or anything distributed for that matter. Im also lucky enough to be working in a Niche market where I have very little foreign enterprise other than hosted services. So if I get a bunch of WAF stuff from Country A    .  Geoblock.  Shoot first ask questions later.    .  Calculate Rate of Addition of GeoBlocks   .  if Rate of Addition is higher than threshold AND Current Quantity score for Countr A is low expire geoblock in XShort hours   .  If Rate acceptable expire in Y Standard days   .  ReAssign quantity score based on Variances or Quantities of IPS hits.    . Alert if Rate of Addition is High Means distributed evil inbound or Quantity Score is high Means targeted evil inbound,sysadmin,d73yrqb,8,t5_2qnp7

8933236,0,t3_52k5cc,It was an old systems architect that had been around the block more than a few times and it wasnt a single lesson but a series of lessons on how to troubleshoot complex issues that span multiple systems.  The dude was seriously cranky but he knew his stuff.  When a major issue came through he would talk me through how to troubleshoot the issue help me if I got stuck during troubleshooting and discuss afterwards what worked what didnt work why it didnt work and how to do it better next time.  The gist of what he taught me was there are several approaches to troubleshooting cut the problem in half iterate through the system from start to finish iterate through the system from finish to start use your intuition and make an educated fck!ng guess already AKA sh!t or get off the pot.  All are valid but the best approach is a hybrid methodology  repeatedly use intuition or a methodical cutting of the problem in half to zero in on where the issue is occurring then start iterating.  But more important  when you fail rather than giving up step back think about what happened and come up with a better way to approach the issue.  Then wash rinse and repeat until you have a firm grasp of whats going wrong and how to fix it.  Most issues can be solved this way.The bit about the different troubleshooting methodologies and being resilient were important but most important is understanding what worked what didnt work and how to do better.  Like any skill troubleshooting requires a little bit of talent and a whole lot of practice and practice doesnt mean mindless repetition but rather repetition with intent purpose and insight.,sysadmin,d7ln5pz,1,t5_2qnp7

How about performance? Do you think SAN vendors have teams of thousands of people that just sit on their ass and do nothing towards performance? If it were as easy as you say why would they exist? Try your whitebox against an enterprise platform and see how it performs. Watch it fall on its face when you put it under any kind of moderate VM workload more than a few hundred or low thousand IOPS. If vendors just made a GUI for running zfs set shareiscsion rpoolvolume commands do you really think they would still be in business? There is so much going on behind the scenes of an enterprise SAN that you would never even think about in a whitebox solution. How about reporting and pretty workload graphs that give you metrics at a glance? How about multiple file or block level protocols like SMB NFS iSCSI or FC? What kind of optimization can you do on an open source solution once you hit a software performance limit of what that software was coded for? Are you going to develop it yourself?

So notice period may be a factor depending on your job market.  Also check that the notice period both ways is the same or fair ie. if you have to give  weeks does your employer have to give you  weeks or can they drop you with zero notice?.In Australia we have superannuation self funded retirement and a lot of companies like to bait and switch the value of the compensation package to include or exclude it.  The end result is they effectively screw you out of  of your inpocket pay.  So in a similar vein double check the salary component that you agreed to with whats in the contract as well as other components such as healthcare.Potentially push back on noncompete clauses depending on how sillyrestrictive they are.  I had one contract that stated I couldnt work for the client in any capacity anywhere in the state.  The problem with that is it was a large government department and thus one of the largest employers in the state and it was a pretty big state.I have thought about trying to get trainingprofessional development enshrined in my contract because I was sick of being baited and switched on that but Ive never been in a strong enough bargaining position to go for that.If youre seriously concerned about the content get a lawyer to provide a professional opinion.,sysadmin,d8pyqhe,2,t5_2qnp7

9413907,0,t1_d995x6a,Yes absolutely.SSL inspection on multiple longlasting connections uses a lot of proxy resources and definitely is what you may want to avoid in this scenario.I have seen proxy crash because of this.If bypassing the proxy entirely is not possible then the second best choice is to tunnel the connection which will stop the proxy from doing SSL inspection on this traffic.The proxy will still receive the traffic from clients but instead of doing inspectionfiltering will just forward packets back and forth to office URLs.So based on what you mentioned in the original post this should solve the problem with the firewall it will keep receiving packets from the proxy outbound interface and wont drop them and at the same time help the proxy to work better.A side effect will be that the proxy wont be able to perform filtering on these URLs which for some companies is a big no but if youre ok with this then definitely go for tunneling this traffic.HTH,sysadmin,d99a1b6,2,t5_2qnp7

If power and ground are on two wires of a twisted pair they the network equipment will short out your device.With Power over Ethernet devices things are a bit different. They make use of the above mentioned facts to supply a nominal  V DC. So your  V could be an issue. That said the networking equipment would likely remain fine as miswired cables are an anticipated problem and could result in shorting the power and ground so the equipment is designed to be robust to that sort of issue.bottom line the most likely effect of plugging your equipment into a network is your equipment goes up in smoke and a network admin might possibly get an alert indicating that a miswired port or malfunctioning device was connected.,sysadmin,d9iedb7,1,t5_2qnp7

Cover letters were not covered we were told they arent used anymore and if we had to write one just look it up.  We were encouraged to use colour and designs on our resume.  The resume objective should be at the top under namephoneaddress and should be  full paragraph.  Aside from the header objective job history and educational history nothing else goes on your resume e.g. skill summaries awards certificates etc.  Include every job and every schooldegree program post high school.  For each jobschool try to put  bullet points that are  lines long and explain something you did that youre proud of or went well. Not necessarily anything that has to do with the job youre applying for.  If your resume is over  page with  margins take things out until it fits. This applied no matter your jobeducation history.

To my mind I think that unless you do  as you have done and mindfully grow each aspect of your life IT can be all consuming. Worse is that almost invariably in my experience it is in the corporate interest to ensure you encourage that overfocus on all things IT which lends itself handinhand with some fairly universally bad business practices. Unlike some other professions however IT does not suffer the sun too much at pm there may be just as much work as there was at am and thats the catch so while my thoughts center on IT as thats my personal experience.You can easily replace IT with the workintensivehighpressure job of your choice in many cases NursingMedicine ScienceResearch Teaching Entrepreneurship and to greater or lesser extents many perhaps most other jobs have similar catches if you fall into those patterns. The second catch is that what makes you an excellent student and an excellent employeeresearcherteacher or entrepreneur in your late teens or s may not be the same skillset that leads to success later on and most corporations have very limited rationale for moving good or excellent staff upout of their positions.Lastly of course is the everincreasing utilitariancommoditized approach to management where staff are hired specifically BECAUSE they have issues oh  that obsessivecompulsive tick and poor work life balance here you go heres a comfy chair and more work than you can handle and when you burn out well ensure we find someone with similar qualifications.The caveat here where real damagerisk proposition occurs both for corporations and for staff is when you are both overworked and unable to train others to do aspects of your job to relieve riskpressure. Ive seen people be destroyed by the job and Ive seen corporations fail because their rock stars burn out.

Most vendors dont  they also guide them through the deployment which can easily take months in large infrastructures and these are also the months were they would constantly run into the issues with restrictions rd party tools environmentalspecific problems etc. So vendors engineering and support costs are easily a few times higher during this period comparing to the following years. By the way this is also the reason why maintenance contract cost for the following years is  times less than the initial product price in case of Veeam.And of course you also want to factor into the price all the expenses required to actually make the sale happen expensive enterprise sales and marketing.

9965761,0,t3_5ia3bs,Requirements drive technology decisions.  Focus on the requirements.  The servers amp networks support the needs of the applications.  What do the applications need?  The infrastructure must also comply with and enforce security amp availability standards.  How are those standards defined and how can you best meet them?    Everything else after that is all vendor relationship preferences.  Do you have a better relationship with Cisco or HP? NetApp or EMC?  ...and so on.  Dont ignore work history and support experience. It is not wise to abandon support experience for no good reason.  But experience can be applied to new solutions too if those new solutions bring muchneeded capability to the table.  All of the major network vendors have solutions that work.  All of the major server hardware vendors have solutions that work.  All of the storage hardware vendors have solutions that work.  Within all of those spheres there are vendors with solutions that better align to your needs.  Somebody has a slick data replication mechanism that should make a key application easier to achieve DRBCP or something.  Identify those solution providers that best align to your requirements and focus on streamlining your sourcing amp purchasing process.  Either crawl in bed with a single VAR and buy EVERYTHING from them or make a small handful of VARs compete for your business.  Be aware of how such competition impacts maintenance contract renewals. You might be saving money on the initial purchase and losing a few points of discount on the maintenance side year over year.  Ask. Learn. Understand. Then decide.  IMO It doesnt matter if you standardize on ProLiant or PowerEdge or Cisco UCS. They all work. Just make sure youve nailed the best possible purchasing process and discount rate you can with a VAR or VARs with the support amp product assistance capabilities you need.,sysadmin,db6kc7d,19,t5_2qnp7

9982522,0,t1_db8d35s,Its worth pointing out that different vendors name some of these things differently.  iphelper is also called dhcp relay in some contexts.  Also the description of port mode leaves out the concept of tagged vs untagged traffic.Essentially a vlan aware device can be configured to tag its traffic.    This is done in the network interface configuration.  By default most devices do not do this.  An access port allows untagged traffic and assigns it to a specific vlan.  A general port allows untagged traffic that will be assigned to its PVID default or tagged traffic on other allowed vlans.  This is useful if you have for instance a computer with untagged traffic on a data vlan and an IP phone with tagged traffic on the same port. A trunk port allows any number of tagged vlans but doesnt allow untagged traffic.  Having two DHCP servers on two separate vlans is just fine.  While you can use iphelpersdhcp relay to serve addresses to multiple vlans its not a requirement.,sysadmin,db8r1gz,1,t5_2qnp7

A global server window for patch deployment helps.I dont know how good your bandwidth is but if this is all the same site remember you could set up a few more Shavlik consoles ans have them all use the same SQL DB preferably clustered. You could scan over decent WAN links and set up distribution servers for localized deployment so you arent sending  copies of the same patch over the link but I dont recommend scanning over a less than  megabit link. Years ago you could grt away woth scanning over a T and get results in an hour but now there is too much to scan for.PM if you want to talk.,sysadmin,dbijtof,5,t5_2qnp7

If your hard drive is large enough create a new partition and install SteamOS. Then choose to boot into that partition when you want to play games and the other when you need to do school work. OrGet another computer that the school doesnt own Im guessing they own it since it has this software installed?. And this is probably the better way to go. If you get caught tampering with their property the best case scenario is they reimage and tell you not to do it again. Worstcase scenario you get some kind of punishment or even have your computer taken away. You might not care right now until you realize how much of a set back that would be to your education. Edit and if theres compliance checks you could still get busted for tampering with their equipment. Either from an unregistered device on the network or network monitoring might flag you as malicious or noncompliant. My suggestion read the student handbook and see what it says about tampering with the computers  read what the consequences are and be prepared to be given the harshest one.

The KCC will auto generate COs from EARTH tofrom MARS and MARS tofrom MARS. In the event that one of those sites goes completely offline the KCC with BASL enabled would try to bridge. If MARS disappears MARS and EARTH would attempt to create COs to each other and replicate. If those are routable great. If they arent then no harm. Replication will continue to fail the KCC will keep trying and eventually your DCs will be back online and the KCC will figure it out and go back to normal.

Theyve already withdrawn from the smartphone  tablet race and with the public cloud severely decreasing the sales of servers into SMEs their server revenues are going to start dropping soon especially when the webscale companies start picking up custom ARM chips.,sysadmin,dcadafl,1,t5_2qnp7

IBM gets shit on a lot for being a tough place to work but in reality very few work environments are actually toxic. Sure you might have to work some longer than normal hours or put up with some extra bullshit but if you work hard you can move up learn and grow. No one ever got ahead by doing the bare minimum Government excluded here. Plus its a great thing to have on your resume later down the line. But the major plus of working somewhere big is the experts youll get to work with and hopefully learn from. Ive been lucky enough to have three amazing mentors and without them I wouldnt have an eighth of the skill I do today. Note I do not work nor have I ever worked for IBM just a lot of talking to people who worked at IBM. On my last job hunt I had it narrowed down between IBM and a SMB. At IBM I would stay specialized as a Linux admin and go very very deep into it. Narrow but deep. At the SMB learning would be more widespread over different areas but relatively shallow. Eventually I chose the SMB because I wanted to expand into some other technical fields than IT that the company worked in. ,sysadmin,dcbawhg,1,t5_2qnp7

But Jane in customer service is not going to get a choice in machine.  Typically non dev environments need a standard though.  Typically in this scenario the software is written to run on a certain platform so there isnt much choice.  Web Apps are a nice workaround but they are not at every company for everything.   Support overhead really does increase though when you add more platforms to support thats where a business justification comes in.

Ones that earn trust enough to handle software deployments breakfix and other IT related issues in their classrooms or specific labs get a pass from myself and our department. But those are faculty members that have earned that right from me generally by approaching me and working with me on it. These are also some of my best colleagues for pilot programs direction and general voice for staff.But no a nonIT member who back doors the process and goes over my head in a petty way doesnt get anything.I suggest meeting with your director and outlining why this isnt such a good idea. Propose a limited scope of duties for which they can control to provide them agency and voice but beyond that all district equipment is ITs responsibility.It is an oversight budgetary and management issue and the Director should treat it as such. If the Director still insists on giving them what the want work it out with your Director that youre not responsible for support issues that arise from it until control is put back where it should be.What is their major complaint? Why arent you working with them to facilitate their underlying need? This isnt about control over a few PCs it is about their frustration because their classroom needs arent being met.Educational IT isnt us vs. them. Our mission in Education is to provide faculty and staff the tools to teach students. Our job is to serve students. That is done by having a unified voice on curriculum technology. My department are IT staff were not teachers. We need teachers to tell us what works and what doesnt and we work with them to craft the best solution within the confines of budget and standards. We arent there to just fix a broken printer were there to support student learning through technology.What do your districtschool board approved policies and procedures say?

The legal team may prefer to use their Tablets when they have to go in and out of meetings all day or if they need to make trips to court.  Management may want to carry around their iPad over hauling around a laptop because it is lighter and the battery can last all day.  If you are in constant meetings all day going from conference room to conference room an iPad can take notes do email run probably the few apps you need or connect to your web apps and you dont have to charge it several times during the day it weighs less and you possibly dont have to haul around a heavy laptop bag.

10377744,0,t1_dcjhf9m,An additional comment.. of something Ive observedlearned over the decades Ive worked in TechnologyIT..... Theres a lot of people out there who just do the bare minimum and call it good. Dont be like that. Always look for ways to go above and beyond even if its just in little tiny ways. Always be thinking in the back of your head... How can I surprise and delight the endusercustomer.. ?Heres an example.. and its rough.. but I think it gives an idea... In the environment I work in.. I never sit down to a computer and only fix  thing. Thats a waste of time. You should always be looking for multiple ways to optimize a system. When I sit down to a computer .. I always keep my eyes out for a wide variety of things both Hardware and Software...  BIOS need updated ? Video drivers need updated? things like JavaFlashAdobe AirAdobe Shockave or other plugins need updated ? AntiVirus up to date ? Hows the free HDD space? Event Logs look good ? Anything I can do to improve the Users workspace? Longer cables powerstrips?.. USBcharger for mobiledevices? .. Tape or cablecover to cover any loose cables or trippinghazards ?.. Basically.. as Im sitting down to work on someones problem.. Ill talk to them assuming they are around.. and get an idea of how they use their machine.. and even sometimes just pointblank ask if theres any other problems or things I can do to help them. Even if its not BreakFix type stuff... and youre at your desk writing Documentation or writing some CodeScriptingetc.. always be asking yourself.... How can I push this to  ?...  Look at some of the stuff that frustrates you or takes the most manual work... How can you automate those things?Technology has almost unlimited potential. You can arrange the s and s in an almost infinite amount of ways. Use technology to help YOU. Anytime you find yourself frustrated by something even if its something small... theres probably someone somewhere out on the Internet who has already solved that same problem. Google it. Use the powerknowledge and exponential possibilities of software to magnify your results. ,sysadmin,dckdq9h,2,t5_2qnp7

10442009,0,t3_5pjaov,At the job I was at  years ago we rolled out dual stack quite easily. Then we monitored the traffic to find out what used IPv to our servers and fixed those. After a few weeks we had all internal traffic on IPv and about  of external traffic. So we started turning off IPv on our servers since they did not use it. Initially we did tests that showed that there were no need for NAT but we ended up implementing it anyway although there were no traffic over it. A few front end load balancers were allowed to keep their IPv address of course.The goal of the project were to reduce the public IPv address usage to allow for future expansion and to improve the client NAT which had started to show some issues. Both goals were reached. The reason we turned off IPv on the servers were to minimize management. The project sadly did not include the unconnected networks so the IT department were the only one who were still using IPv internally. However the embedded devices would likely not have been tested with IPv only. We did not do anything with the printer network either and rather just put it behind NAT to make them available over IPv.,sysadmin,dcroj8j,2,t5_2qnp7

We even had sort of a division in that sysadmindeveloperanalystproject manageretc jobs all required a  year degree and were salaried and technician jobs were hourly and required a  year degree.Cable was run by network techs. Servers were racked by data center techs. PCs were deployed by desktop techs. Its now to the point where nobody on my team has even seen the servers they deal with.Now that were so heavily virtualized were really becoming more application centric than server centric.I think there are blue collar IT jobs but there are also a ton of white collar IT jobs.

10499447,0,t1_dcxw903,The fundamental mistake you are making is that its not Neflix traffic thats the issue its customer demand.  Neflix is filling a demand by ISPs customers to use their advertised bandwidth. If the ISPs are overselling too much thats their problem.  My ISP currently Charter grossly oversells what their peering arrangements can handle. It actually works greatly in ISPs favor that most of the content is coming from one source because that can be handled much more easily than if customers were demanding content from thousands of different sources. An internet connection without sufficient peering to the rest of the internet is a superhighway to nowhere.  Case in point what homeuser would subscribe to an ISP if it a gigabit bidiretional fiber for  a month but couldnt get out of their local network?  Almost no one. The value is in the connectivity and the big ISPs are trying to double dip. ,sysadmin,dcy81gw,1,t5_2qnp7

To get more than MBs of shared storage on macs youll need a fibre channel SAN with shared LUNs and special software on the macs to coordinate filesystem metadata also scary ass shit.some of the macs were the traditional ATXstyle and some were trashcans with thunderbolt gbe NICs all of them exhibited the same poor performance with file transfers while iperf gave a perfect result for raw TCP throughput.SMB and AFP is dead slow on OS X barely hitting MBs. Plugging my windows  workstation into this youtubers network to prove it was his macs bottlenecking I pulled and pushed MBs to samba with zero tuning on the client side. His macs were decked out too with  core xeons shittons of RAM and titan X GPUs AMD radeon of course in the trashcans. Better specs than my PC by a long shot.

10613802,0,t3_5rwjiw,Personally.......... I would utilize a message table to achieve this.Basically the HR process would make the necessary changes into whatever HR tables  database theyre using then upon a successful new hire  termination  change the app would insert a row into a message table which would be formatted something likeMessageID|EmployeeID|EventID|EffectiveDate|||||nh|||tm|Where EventID of nh would be a new hire EventID of tm would be a Termination... you could have additional events such as dc which is a department change mg which is a manger change etc...Then you would have some other app reading this messages table see that the message is a new hire with EmployeeID ... so it would go out to the HR database query EmployeeID  for the first name last name manager department etc... and run the proper script with the information to create the user... once the script is run successfully the message with that MessageID would be deleted.  The app would then move onto the next message in the queue.The EffectiveDate would be nice for department changes or knownterminations retirements  week notice etc... so the account changes can be put off until the proper date... dont need to update managers or department info on an employee that will be moving departments next month.,sysadmin,ddaqe4o,2,t5_2qnp7

None of my clients firewalls mostly Meraki and SonicWALL handled OpenVPN. So either every PC gets an individual VPN connection or you have to hack together an OpenVPN router.On a positive note the individual client VPN deployment is really really good.

10707388,0,t1_ddk4158,First of Woah! Thanks for the superb response. Ill do my best answering everything we have so far here. On a side note we are not going quite as in depth as this is the first of many projects in this capstone but many of your questions fit into what we are working on. Ill make a note on the ones that we are supposed to mark as out of scope but this will definitely help in the upcoming sceneries too. extra side note In total we will be doing about  projects like thisgt What happens when a raspi stops working? We were factoring in replacement units for final cost as far as replacement procedure we are assuming that the company has their own IT staff that can handle it. In this exercise we are playing a contracted design team.gt Also they only support a single monitor. Have you ever seen a dev using less than two?This is something we had not considered. Our group will look into other VDI solutions like ones from Samsung thin client pc board built into the monitor that do support multiple out or possibly miniPC form factor units that do as well. Even though this is nearing dedicated workstation territory it would still run VDI I can see the limits of the Raspi now that multi monitor is brought up. This will have to be looked into further.gt Consider the server too. keep in mind a single server is a single point of failure for  of your company. Good point. We could look at redundant servers with failover and load balancing. It is less likely that both would fail at the same time.Since we are tasked with VDI and it is basically on site only for this project we are limited in disaster planning.gt What sort of downtime is acceptable for your servers? is hours of downtime a year acceptable for servers alone?For this scenario downtime is not a major factor. The systems need to be operational from AM to  PM. Downtime in between is allowable.gt Network redundancy how much? How many active ports will you have in  years? The general replacement cycle for network gear. Can your network gear expand to accommodate that number? Do you need PoE for phones or will they use power packs at the desk? Speaking of phones What kind of phone system? onprem?This is just an IP phone system that will have access to external calling through an ISP service. We were planning on running POE for phones. we are still discussing but using something like Asterisk or FreePBX is possible. As for port need we will only need to plan for  employees workstationsphones some conference rooms and possibly some wifi routers but should also provide a plan that allows for expansion later. This will probably be done via layer  switch based networking and separate IP networks based on job roles. CS Help Desk HR DevsWe arent super technical in this section this is one of the gimmies. Basically phones need to touch the ISP and then it just works. Its to get us to  do a little research on phone software on our own. Basic IP addressing is needed but not as in depth as Access Control Lists gt What about border protectionfirewalls?We have not discussed this portion yet but a hardware firewall between the internal net and the ISP WAN is a probable solution.gt internet What kind of BW and usage do you need? Do you have a lot of hosted services? Do you need to consider a backup connection? do you need redundant paths for internetSIP?We are assuming a single connection to the ISP. We are not planning redundancies for this project. The project basically stops at the walls of the building and we are assuming a single fiber connection leased line to the ISP. This cost is not part of the project. Offsite access is not a requirement and the services the devs need are going to be hosted locally in the office building. gt Backups how often how much when and where? VM based diskbased or filebased?Backups were going to be implemented to a separate SAN. Nightly backups with  day rolling storage. Its a small startup business so we figure this is an acceptable solution. We can also plan for rd party backups like AWS but these costs are not part of our design. offsite backup is not required. however Implementing a way to backup to an external location is something my group wanted to add anyway. Backups would be VM based and file based like NASAD for specific documents. gt Regarding security systems conferencing generators etc these are outside the scope of this project but our group plans on outfitting  video conferencing rooms. gt You should find out the acceptable amount of downtimeyear first and work from there.Downtime is not a huge spec in this project. As long as the workstations are up and functioning from AM to PM the needs are met. This is not a  hour business just to keep it simpleFinal Thoughts This project is a little on the simpler side as it is the first one in the semester. Over time the plans we need to make get more technical. As for this one its basically a quick mockup design type of assignment to introduce us to things we need to consider in designing a network.

10797418,0,t1_ddtn5qc,My alarm bells are going off in my head.  Sounds like wrong screws or lowquality racks.  So here is the thing about cordless drills  You can go cheap or you can go quality.  Eventually somebody is going to drop it.  High quality drills usually survive a fall or three.  Cheap ones usually survive a fall or two.  The new fancy LiIon batteries should last  years.  But the older technology ones all need new batteries about every  years.  The cost of a single Dewalt replacement battery is about the cost of a new Harbor Freight drill  battery combo.  Observation   A nice brawny drill loves to overtighten screws. If it has a torque clutch use it to minimize overtightening.  On that same note all that power loves to strip out screws.  Lastly all that power makes for a moderatly heavy tool which leads to faster fatigue which can cause poor alignment which tends to cause more screw stripping.  Id rather buy you an awesome set of proper screw drivers with nice long necks to get around cable managers and rails.    If you really want power Id lean towards a powered screwdriver rather than a proper drill.  Or if you really really want a drill Id be looking at lowerpower lighter weight units with a flashlight builtin.  Examples    Im not buying this for you    Too big. Too heavy. Too much power. All I see is stripped screws everywhere.  ,sysadmin,ddtod6j,17,t5_2qnp7

10914925,0,t1_de5m1h5,gt You keep saying Physical piece of metal as if hostnames are completely irrelevant. Theyre not. Theyre what syslog entries are listed as theyre what users see when they log into the machine as you correctly pointed out theyre used by some scripts in various ways.Except that what a server does shouldnt be part of a hostname because its unsustainable. Which is worse  a syslog entry for octopus which everyone who works with octopus will know what it does or your DB will tell you if you do need to look it up or a syslog entry for webgs thats no longer a web server and not in GS which you need to remember?gt As easy as you say moving a physical server is changing its hostname is even easier. Change two lines on redhat and youre done. I guarantee I could do that faster than you could move a server.Except that its not just changing the hostname on a single box. What do you do about boxes that point to it. Do you retain the old entries as CNAMEs? If so then why not use CNAMEs to start with? And you need to update the DB that youve got it logged in so you know what hardware it is and where. And you need to make a note somewhere that youve renamed it so that any historic logs can be tied together with the new logs if you need to dig out a weird hardware error for example. If you keep a name for a box then you avoid all of that potential pain. And the only harm is that users have to think about a server when they connect to it or set up a prompt and read the MotD both of which are good things to do.gt RFC says nothing about naming computers after functions it says you shouldnt name them after projects. FTP DNS RADIUS web server are not projects theyre roles. If a servers role changes its name changes. Again much easier to change a name than a role.If you dont think web server is covered by the same term as shop in the RFC then were talking at cross purposes. And again how do you handle if a server is doing DNS and RADIUS and then adds DHCP and then loses RADIUS and then gains PXEboot stuff then loses DHCP. Youre going to rename it every time?gt Firstly you shouldnt do that. If your environment is big enough that you need to worry about naming conventions for your servers your servers should be solely focused on a single role. Thats system configuration . I disagree. I used the same naming convention whether Im working with  servers or . Because the naming convention works. And I agree that a role per server is nice which is what I do when I have the resource to make a VM environment and then individual VMs are set up named for their role  because they dont get repurposed they get completely removed well archived.gt Secondly if you MUST do that just keep the name as the primary role. If your servers hostname is your sole source of documentation then again youre doing it horribly wrong. Youd run into the same issues using an arbitrary name as well except using an arbitrary name you wouldnt even know the servers primary function without looking at your documentation.Youre the one arguing for a hostname thats descriptive. Im arguing that its role is irrelevant to its name. Have you ever been promoted at work and did your name change or just your titlerole? And sure the new titlerole mapped to your name but your name was still the same. This way if you had for example a note on your HR file that you were allergic to bees then that would be retained because its information about you not your job.When you connect to a server the MotD can easily tell you in figlet if necessary exactly what that boxs role is meant to be which is far better than relying on a hostname. People who work on the same set of boxes know their name just like you know the people in your team by name as well as role and its not a bad thing that anyone else would need to look things up if theyre unsure. Looking things up if youre unsure is a good thing!gt Your config management should have templates for every type of server in your environment and the hostnames should reflect that.I can find out what my servers hardware is by looking it up in my DB are you proposing adding type of hardware to the hostname in addition to role  location? If not then why are role and location special enough to be added to the hostname?gt I dont know. Are you labeling servers now? Do arbitrary names take up less tape or something? I dont see the point here.As a NOC monkey Ive done exactly that. In a sysdev role I have been known to label servers to make it easy for remote hands to do work necessary. And yes arbitrary names a take up much much less space than the alphabet soup required to fit role  location and b dont need to be replaced when either role or location changes which c means that its a hell of a lot easier to get the right box crashcarted if your OOBM and remote PDU access fail.gt You keep pointing out easily negotiable edgecases as some sort of evidence against descriptive names but havent actually pointed out any benefits of arbitrary naming. What does naming a server fishpie or whatever actually gain me other than not having to change the hostname when I move it again a rare occurance and something that takes  seconds to do? The benefits of giving servers descriptive names are obvious. What benefits are there to giving them undescriptive names? Theyre not edgecases theyre fundamental ways of working that Ive actually dealt with in the past couple of decades dealing with this stuff. If youve never migrated services or servers then youre either a very lucky sysadmin or a very junior sysadmin or both. One of the benefits are that you dont have to scrabble about when migrating services or servers to rename anything Another is that all of the names are innoffensive easy to read out on the phone to someone in a DC with fans whirring beside them. If you look at the suggested word list youll note theres no fishpie and that the reasons for them being on the list are stated. The benefits of giving servers descriptive names are not at all obvious in a world where business needs change where you want proper documentation that spans more than a single roles lifecycle and where you can reap the same benefits from CNAMEs and MotD text. What benefits are there to giving them undescriptive names?  why do I feel that this is turning into you telling me that the Romans did nothing for us,sysadmin,de5spf4,1,t5_2qnp7

11081128,0,t3_5y8dfs,Not in any particular order. Setup some VLANs. What does recording all statically assigned IP addresses have to do with the price of rice in China?  What I mean is that if youre using DHCP to statically assign Servers Switches Cameras etc. youre doing it wrong. This would probably be your first problem to solve.. This is called DHCP Reservations. Theyre typically reserved for Printers time clocks or other minor devices. This also does not statically assign the IP but reserves and assigns a specific IP out of the DHCP pool to that device. The reason is because youve set the end device as DHCP so it still goes through the motion of DHCPDiscover DHCPOffer DHCPReq DHCPAck when the lease expires.. You can create as many scopes as youd like and activate them on the DHCP Server but until you configure your relay agent default gateway to utilize the new VLANs the server wont know to give out IPs for that scope. . If youre referencing DHCP addresses in Group Policy and theyre to servers then Id suggest you make a Servers VLAN  and assign static IPs and update Group Policy to the new IPs.Day of switch. If youve created VLANs properly then changing the lease time is a moot point. Youll have to ipconfig renew everything to the new IP ranges. . You should configure VLANs Configure Scopes and activate them move ports to new VLANs. . This should be done after hours and statically assigned with a Servers VLAN established.

But you plan to implement a solution that in all likelihood will run out of space in two years at the most?I think you need to plan for todays system to have a TB capacity with expansion capability.If I was going to use a NAS and Im not at all sure that I would Id probably use a SuperMicro  drive chassis with WD RED TB or larger. Using FreeNAS RAID ZFS that would be  TB drives. That would leave enough room in the chassis to add another TB of TB drives for expansion without having to add another shelf.Thatll be about  for a TB cheap home solution that should absolutely be doubled with a second unit that you replicate to. So with two units now your at . Hmmm may be I should look at a SAN?Edit I wouldnt sneer at a NetApp NAS like ubadseed suggested.

11380201,0,t3_62dmwq,Thats about the size of who I work for now. Heres some pointers Who you are is more critical than what you know. Youre going to be working on a team so its more important that you get along with everyone rather than you know everything on day . Knowledge can be taught passed on rubbed off etc. Theres nothing worse for a team than a problem child being brought on.  Be wellspoken calm but structured during your interview. Dont talk so fast that youre tripping over words and the interviewer cant keep up. Wait for a question to finish before answering  never interrupt. When giving an example of how you did X state the initial problem the way you determined the solution and how you implemented it. Dont say We bought Y and that solved the problem. Details are good but dont give a min monologue. If youre working towards certificates let your interviewer know that when discussing past experience. It shows youre continuing to improve yourself and learn new things. Vendor specific certs MS Cisco VMWare etc are going to be weighted more than generic IE A certs. Constant improvement is very attractive during the interview process.With respect to the current residents SysAdmining isnt some esoteric discipline that needs years of study. You have years of experience from working help desk which is where the vast majority of SysAdmins come from anyways. Its more of a mindset a way of thinking that allows you to make that jump from lowlevel to midlevel. Also with a team that size you wont be thrown into the fire immediately. Theyre going to feel you out first and see what youre capable of so again dont worry about being a master of all things on Day .

They are a big company and have a lot of contracts that people work on say about  big ones and up to  small ones that didnt have many calls coming through.The situation you have described sounds exactly like it was there and Im sure it is the same at most other places. People who work in IT or at least want to work in IT dont want to be at your Tier  forever. Eventually you get sick of talking to people who dont know where the Ctrl key is and resetting passwords and when youre at Tier  you always dread seeing tickets come through from that one guy who has never read his email about how to fix that issue instead giving more laborious work. Or again at Tier  knowing how to fix something but not having the right access to do it is another meaning that it has to go to Tier .Honestly I think with this kind of scenario there is always going to be a high rate of turnover for Tier  unless they are paid very well or there is significant shifting left going on. Incentives may resolve these feelings for a short while but only for a short while.

If youre happy with what you have and the options available to you then for sure keep it. If youre looking to replace the backup software do some research as to what would work well for your environment.Sounds like youve got a problem with individuals buying things that work but not very well thought out from an administration standpoint. For you it sounds like the big thing is to get it all on a NAS or SAN for backups but it probably would behoove you to look at a more centralized hardware resource like Cisco UCS. If you have a lot of physical servers it may be worth looking into virtualizing with VMware as it can be incredibly helpful to backup one big huge giant file as the software sees it rather than billions of kb files. Block based backup sounds like the proper solution for you in the short term and it sounds like youre already aware of that.One of the things that I suspect would help you out would be to get a SAN for the backup server. You can probably get a decently sized one with all SATA shelves for probably k and then youre sitting in a much better position than you are now. Doing backups from disk to disk would probably speed things up and then you can leisurely do disk to tape from the backup SAN.I think your first priority is to convince your management to do  yesterday. What happens if your server room suffers a disaster like a fire? You need offline copies of your data stored off site as soon as you can possibly get it accomplished. Ask your management how long they can live without operational systems while you build them all again from scratch should you have a fire.

If you need to run stuff on site anyway if you already have virtualization set up if youve already set up backups of said VMs etc then onpremises Exchange itself is not expensive.

Were a small environment and we calculated it out ourselves and since the infrastructure is already there anyway  well instead of paying over  grand a year on O we paid that  grand or some such once and will now save  grand a year past the first year and the mail server sits on short gigabit links from the endusers.

We run a  trust network and have firewalls encryption and appliance load balancing and the entire thing is being provided using NAT rules. We had a few security consulting companies help us do pen testing on it and they said it was more secure than some VPN offerings they have seen. Sure we have pretty beefy VPN client available as well as a Citrix farm to publish an RDP app. But this was a solution for our vendors and clients to get some of our rendered services over the wire. I think the biggest argument here is simplicity and level of effort. Some companies are just not ready to offer RDP services other the internet because they do not have the infrastructure or the resources to make it happen right. Its actually easier and more resourceful to be lazy and secure a VPN service to wrap an RDP session into it and not worry to hard on potential hacking. I dont think id ever recommend to someone use RDP over the internet if i know their next question is going to be how do i do that?.

You need either three file shares or one file share with three folder with three different access groups eg principal teacher student. If making the principal data as secure as possible is really required then split it off onto its own server. You can use one physical server and turn on Hyperv then create two VMs one for the principle file server and one for the teachers amp students. Each file server can be on different vlans. This is only effective however if you restrict intervlan routing with a firewall or ACLs and dont have any lan cables or wireless on the secure vlan that the principle file server is on. If this like a school setup then phyical stopping people pluging into the wrong lan port or wrong wifi network is going to be difficult so I would concentrate on using user level controls not network based ones.All that said my solution would be as simple as possible. One vlan potentially a second if you feel the need to put the voip phones on their own. With only one vlan then there is no need for routing or firewall rules. So all your devices are on one vlan both PCs and laptops treat them all as untrusted. Give each user a local account on the file server and then give them only permission on the folders they should have access to.,sysadmin,dg95f7s,2,t5_2qnp7

Otherwise I dont even see the point of him having access to the room amp taking the liberty to train the jr employees.

11638621,0,t3_662m6y,I posted this awhile backgtbang my head against the wall for hours and maybe it will work maybe it wont.Thats kind of IT in a nutshell but you need go about it the right way. You have to learn the difference between making progress and being totally stumped and then what to do about it.You are making progress when what you are working on is changing. Even if things are getting worse you at least know you have your hands on the right levers you just need to learn how to pull them.You are stumped when you cant get anything to change or when you keep starting over and ending up in the same place even though you are doing different things to get there.When you realize you are good and truly stumped its time to take a step back. There is probably something fundamental that you are missing or confused about and thats blocking you from making progress.What I do in that situation is start writing. I write down everything I know about the situation what Im trying to achieve what problems Im running into what Ive tried and the results and what I think I know about the system. This helps me organize my thoughts and my brain starts analyzing the problem from different directions. Nine times out of ten that gets me unstuck and I think of something else I hadnt tried and find a way to start making progress again.That other  of time I take what I wrote and turn it into a detailed forum post to ask for help on an appropriate website.Its a tough and challenging job. I often look around at my coworkers and envy them because they have such a limited scope of responsibility. I dont say that as a slight on them they are very good at their jobs but they dont get thrown curve balls nearly as often as we do. I cant even tell you how many times Ive walked into work planning on making progress on one project or another and had a coworker say something in passing that ended up torpedoing an entire day or more.

Sure it can all go down and likely will at some point I am pretty sure your type of business wont fold under little bit of downtime. Backups are key though! Look at macrium reflect if VEEAM or other high end stuff is unaffordable to you.  external storage array is nonsense you dont need SAN  as long as your hypervisor has enough internal storage and some raid you are ok there nothing wrong with raid  either if it does the job for you... backup amp restores need to be done often and tested!

11682192,0,t1_dgk5w2c,Windows has a few features builtin to allow systems to whitelist specific applications for execution.  If you have any modern Windows system on a domain your administrators can configure AppLocker.  If you have Windows  you can also use Device Guard.  Both of these systems will allow you to configure a list of the applications that are allowed to run on the system.  If an application isnt in the list and a user tries to run it the system will prevent the application from running.    The problem pointed out in this thread is that this shitty NVIDIA product redundant I know can be modified so that other applications can be launched from within it via node.js.  The NVIDIA driver software would be whitelisted and allowed to run under AppLocker or Device Guard.  With hijacking the node.js essentially malware could be launched by piggybacking off the permissions granted to the NVIDIA software completely bypassing AppLocker andor Device Guard.    Your average home user hasnt taken the time nor do they have the ability in the case of AppLocker as it is functionality that requires Active Directory Group Policy to configure or use AppLocker or Device Guard.

11719815,0,t1_dgobhiu,. SAN supports types including            Internet electronic mail address        DNS name         IP address        Uniform Resource Identifier URI         Other options exist including completely local definitions.     . Multiple name forms and multiple instances of each name form MAY be included.      CN is not typed at all and you only get one of them. Theoretically this can be a security issue as a CN for one type can also be legal in another type and public CAs need to be able to validate the CN which is much easier if it is typed. The code to pass a CN is also more complicated since theres tons of edge cases for example when an org name contains a dot . character is that a DNS entry or a human readable name.    Essentially       SAN scales better multiple supported.      SAN is more flexible due to types including your own.      SAN may be more secure as types allow better validation and no type crossover.     The only advantage of CN is familiarity.    ,sysadmin,dgogwxw,16,t5_2qnp7
