8004499,0,t1_d4fqqef,Thinking about OoT and MM the Master Sword doesnt need to be the best blade ever or even the main focal weapon. The Goron Sword did more damage than the Master Sword so its not so crazy to say other weapons may do the same. This could be even more true if enemy types and such play a big role weapon x does more damage to enemy yIn MM we dont even see the Master Sword iinc. The swords we get instead do the job just fine  Then again we arent against Ganon...It seem like a big fact the sword is damaged though. So it might be the fact we dont use it as an actual weapon more of a relic. Though this is huge speculation. Weve just not seen enough yet to say. Interestingly the same can be same with the Heros Tunic and the Hylian Shield which actually isnt that special its just iconic. We see link with heavy plate armor a metal shield and a broarder sword multiple times in the trailer however. Maybe this link is just different?

Running on from this maybe after TP Ganon comes back release the interlopers potential sheik as he likes to use them  partner with them. and this is what were seeing? Maybe after Four Swords or before?,Breath_of_the_Wild,d4oiqa7,2,t5_3f1s6
8090605,0,t3_4pwllw,So Ive gone around to a few other theory threads and posted something that breaks this theory.Its due to the gap between the end of Ocarina of Time and the beginning of Link to the Past which is what Im assuming you mean by Link from the fallen hero timeline.After Ganon defeats Link at the end of Ocarina Zelda and the Sages gather and seal him within the Sacred Realm. During this time he grows in power and transforms the Sacred Realm into the Dark World. Ganon is not released again until Link to the Past when Aghanim breaks the seal and floods Hyrule with darkness and monsters. And of course Ganon.Therefore the theory regarding BotW taking place during this time is impossible.,Breath_of_the_Wild,d4pghqv,1,t5_3f1s6

10314784,0,t1_dcd7ufi,Japanese VA is definitely more dramatic in a cartoonlike way compared to Western VA. From watching a lot of anime I do enjoy the Japanese VA more usually but what I heard in the English trailer is plenty for me to be happy with it. I actually like the more subtle crying from Zelda in the English version. It feels more appropriate and dramatic to me.Also when it comes to this game especially Id rather be able to watch the scenes unfold than have to read subtitles and miss out on the visuals to some degree. So even if Japanese is included I think my first playthrough would be English.If I were to bet though I doubt Japanese VA will be included in the NA release.,Breath_of_the_Wild,dcd8jns,5,t5_3f1s6

10468506,0,t3_5pxw0k,I havent even thought about pegasus boots. That would be pretty sweet.As for my hopes I wanna see the Red Mail from LTTP or LBW return. In the past Zora tunics have left Link vulnerable to ice attacks at least in TP. I forget about OOT. so if we get swimming gear it would be interesting if there were multiple sets one that has low armor and just the simple swimming ability but then there could be an armored set of swimming gear or even better one that also protects against cold for taking an icy dip.The reason I expect that is because the basic blue shirt has low armor I think it has an armor stat of  or . The quilted shirt has armor of  or  I think which is lower than the most basic armor set. Theres no way that its the only armor that protects against cold though with how little armor it gives. Another idea is an outfit that makes your stamina deplete slower. I cant help but imagine Link in an adidas track suit when I say that though. My last little thing Im hoping for is that mixing different sets of armor and outfits can give us abilities that compliment each other. For instance if theres one outfit that gives Link a speed boost and another that gives more stamina they would go together well. ,Breath_of_the_Wild,dcupnft,3,t5_3f1s6

10790449,0,t3_5uc0wi,Exited for    The MASSIVE open world and free form exploration. I want to climb paraglide go rafting ride horses and shield surf. I want to do it all while exploring this beautiful and diverse world. I can explore by my own leisurepace and go where I want to go.    The combat and enemies. I havent played BotW yet but I can already tell that this is by far the hardest D Zelda yet. There are many reasons why the combat in this game is going to be amazing. There are multiple classes of weapons each different from the last the enemies have smarter AI we have bullet time effectsmoves like parry rush etc. The enemies are also very creative and distinct and some like the Guardians look both amazing and are super OP. I seriously cant wait to take on a Guardian.    The amazing physicsphysics puzzles and abundance of shrines. Extremely complex and realistic physics in an open world Zelda game... Its selfexplanatory really. Im ready to tackle a bunch of shrines full of creative challenging physics puzzles and guardians.Not excited for    the dungeons. Its become extremely apparent that the  dungeon rumor is probably true and these  dungeons will likely be in the  divine Guardians. If so these  dungeons will likely have a very similar aesthetictheme and tbh thats boring. Thats not all though in a recent video from Gameinformer they said that these dungeonsthe one they fully completed is smaller than a typical dungeon in Twilight Princess... Aonuma even saidin a interview with GI that theyre taking a simpler approach to dungeons in this game and you cant get lost in them. This is disappointing because I remember in an interview a while ago Aonuma said that this games dungeons were going to be very largethe size of OoTs Hyrule field and labyrinthlike. Ill miss traditional large themed dungeons as those were my favorite parts of Zelda games     Zeldas English voice. She sounds like a  year old British milf... Her voice doesnt fit her at all. Its funny because literally all the other English voices in the trailer were great but Zeldas hers was terrible... Now this wouldnt be a problem if she wasnt THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTER IN THE GAMEbesides Link of course. She probably has by far the most voiced lines.    I thought for about  mins about what else I dont like about this game so far and theres literally nothing. And who knows I might enjoy the dungeonsprobably will tbh and grow to tolerate or even like Zeldas voice. I guess the only other thing I dont like is the long unbearable wait but thats almost over.,Breath_of_the_Wild,ddsyiqy,8,t5_3f1s6

10824659,0,t1_ddwfr5w,To counter your first point I think its entirely likely to not mention normal enemies in the dungeon. They didnt mention the miniguardians or anything else either.I mean if you were doing a short piece on dungeons in OoT would you find it worth mentioning that you walked into a door that locked behind you and you had to kill a Lizalfo to get a dungeon map? Or would you instead talk about how this dungeon was focused around using the boomerang or bombs and filled with lava or water and the boss you encountered at the end?edit Keep in mind they are here to generate traffic. These are puff pieces focused solely on generating hype for the game in exchange for exclusive coverage rights. Whats interesting? toxic sludge a rotating dungeon mechanic and of course the boss.

I saw one guy run right past a massive set of ruins sticking out of a cliff face like seriously huge roman looking broken down architecture. And another guy said he found something like that on the overworld and went in for a while and came back out with way more powerful weapons that he had going in.So it seems that Nintendo just took the dungeon type of platform puzzlecombat gameplay and applied it to the whole overworld map instead of dungeons. I like this approach from what Ive seen every turn you make theres another interesting little climbing puzzle or obstacle feels like an outdoor dungeon.Also personally Im praying to see some real graveyardhorror type locations like older zelda games I havent seen anything truly creepy themed yet,Breath_of_the_Wild,de7gmns,1,t5_3f1s6

Also it goes against the general playstyle of the game its very minimal with no hand holding and then once you enter the Divine Beasts youre told to get a map and directed to it and they tell you how many terminals are left every single time you get one.

11068928,0,t1_demn773,gt .the game doesnt specify how many people were left after Ganon came back and took control of the DBsGuardiansIt does say repeatedly that many people died. The sheer desolation and vastness of the wilderness in the entire game help serve to ram this concept home. gt either way each city had like  people in it total...given  years to procreate thats very little.Hateno was spared by the calamity and the others were not. It has more than  people by far and is larger than the other settlements by far. This furthers the whole idea that most people in the realm died and it hasnt fully recovered. Even several NPCs who were born after the cataclysm occasionally recount how even today is easier than it was during their childhood. This shows its been a constant state of strife since the calamity and that people have continued to die and struggle since then. This is further supported by the sheer reality of the kind of dangers that are on the road in this game. gtDont think you can relate the number of NPCs to the lore its more a function of the WiiUSwitch hardware like you said.You are flatly ignoring the actual dialogue in the game that has stated explicitly that it has been tough to survive and youre explicitly forgetting the one larger town that shows a distinctly different style for a place that wasnt hurt by the calamity. Your assertions can not be correct in the face of ingame lore that utterly contradicts you. Youre assuming its hardware focused in order to either ignore what the lore is explicitly telling you or youre simply not talking to people and not seeing that the lore exists and are therefore making assumptions in as negative a way as possible.

You cant unlock the bazooka until you reach a certain point in the story. You cant interact with certain characters in an area until the story introduces them to you after a certain point. These prerequisites are the checkmarks. It has a straightforward and directed narrative that the game is requiring you to go through to unlock the rest of the game.That is what BotW does not have. You can go defeat Ganon right from the beginning you could go to Kurapika village or do absolutely neither and just explore the lands in the opposite direction and never choose to do the main story line.

11099290,0,t1_deq1tua,Yes. Because the point of the dungeon is the Ganon fight. It should not be possible to rush from entrance to Ganon in  minutes. Look at the  beasts. Its not possible to rush the boss fight there is it?Also I never said that I didnt go back and searched for other stuff to do. I found the memory I killed the mini bosses hylian shield whew! and I tried to explore every room. It didnt feel like a dungeon to me.Were just different types of players. Im not that big on exploration in single player games. To me story is more important and the story in Hyrule Castle is literally nonexistant as is the main story in the game because its so short and shallow.I understand that you enjoy Hyrule Castle but Im expecting something else from a Zelda game. I was expecting story puzzles a hard boss fight engaging side quests with story but I got almost none of that. Dont get me wrong its a great game for exploration and for grinding but in my opinion thats not what makes a great Zelda game so Hyrule Castle is not a good Zelda dungeon to me. ,Breath_of_the_Wild,deq3ffu,2,t5_3f1s6

11120161,0,t1_dersi64,So I tried to take a video of some experiments but it didnt work out very well so I took two screenshots.  I had trouble figuring out how to do real world tests so Im going to have to do some more planning and all that.  I dont think it can get as crazy as I wanted but I think theres some cool potential here.So for starters I learned that only the ACTUAL metal parts of items carry current.  Knights Bows only have a metal handle so only the handle carries current.  If something has a wood hilt only the blade will have current.  I also learned that electric current will stop if the source dies it wont continue through the objects.  And finally I learned that you cant create a barrier so to speak as after the initial shock damagethat no matter how hard I try I cannot get to multiply at least for link past  hearts of damage theres a moment of invulnerability.  I only tested it on myself but Im pretty sure monsters work on a similar mechanic.Im trying to think of ways to creatively use this as a trap or a method of killing but I think the lightning bomb might be the most effective usage of metal plus electricity.  ALSO!  Dont be an idiot like me and make a super elaborate set up not take a picture then save and reload.  Your items dont stay on the ground and dont go back into your inventory so theyre gone forever.  Or you can just reload your autosave from right before whatever.,Breath_of_the_Wild,desgme1,2,t5_3f1s6

11130582,0,t1_detmw0i,If youre an Avid Nintendo fan Nintendo consoles are always worth it. I bought the Wii U on day  and dont regret it one bit. I spent my fair share of time on it. Between Smash Zelda and Mario confirmed as first party Fire emblem Xenoblade and Dragon Quest confirmed from rd parties I cant see how anyone can think that Zelda will be even close to the only game worth while on the switch. If someone is only looking for a specific series then thats on them. I know I dont count it as a knock against my PS that they wont get Xenoblade. And to be honest the console itself offers so much more with portability.

11148857,0,t3_5z6sre,gt but the massive royal greatsword that the knights of hyrule used smashing when I try to cut down a tree with it is just stupidTrying to cut a tree down with a sword would wreck havoc on the sword. I dont see why this is oddly an exception.The Champion weapons can be reforged though so its not like you can never use them again or that it defeats their purpose.    I personally like it because it takes for more planning makes using the weapons feel that much more amazing Nah this enemy totally warrants the  damage weapon and encourages you to use the environment more. It makes it a far more immersive game for that reason rather than just GET STRONG WEAPON EARLY BUTTONSMASH YOUR WAY TO VICTORY.

11152230,0,t3_5z85m3,My first open world guardian was one of the ones south of Hyrule Castle.  I was going to try to sneak around it but it spotted me too quickly.  I ducked behind the ruins of a brick wall so it couldnt blast me.  Instead it ran right up to the wall waiting for me to move into its line of sight I thought it might lose interest if it couldnt see me but this one didnt.  I had been killed by a few of these before but never attempted to take one down before so I figured I might as well give it a shot since this guy wasnt leaving.  I switched to a guardian greatsword and started a spin attack from behind the wall and then steered around the wall into his face.  Before he could do much of anything he had lost most of his legs and kept rolling on his side.  Towards the end he stabilized enough to try to blast me and my sword broke so I finished him off with I think two bomb arrows.It was actually pretty easy and it made me overconfident enough to try to get another one.  Out in the open.  Where it could keep me at a huge distance while blasting.  That didnt work out so well for me.,Breath_of_the_Wild,dew3d9z,2,t5_3f1s6

11206843,0,t3_5zz4yy,gtThoughts?Agree about weapon durability in general.  Everything needs to be x more durable at least.  Bow durability doesnt bother me and I use the bow a LOT.  But I think it would be better if bows lasted way longer and broke quickly if they took a hit.  The things that I feel are insanely fragile are the claymores and broadswords.  Im ok with it when its a guardian weapon or something ethereal and magicky but seeing a hunk of forged steel break against a wooden shield or hopping ooze thing is kinda weird.  Blocking  parrying with H weapons.  That would be cool.  You could handle the block like they do in Dark Souls where the weapon only blocks like  of damage.  Or maybe it takes a huge durability hit when you block with it.  The Master Sword shouldnt have to break in order to recharge.  That doesnt add anything to the game and it doesnt really make sense.  I really wish that when your weapon broke youd automatically equip the next weapon in your inventory.  Going to the little quickmenu pausing the game in combat is annoying and its really the biggest problem with the durability system IMO.  Shit breaking means you have to pause the game.  Either change that or make shit break less.I dont think having quiver sizes would add to the game.  I kind of disagree wr to foodhealing.  To redesign how eating and food works youd have to overhaul the difficulty of almost the entire game.  The OP foods are there kind of as a difficulty release valve.  Keep in mind that kids play this game and not everyone is a Dark Souls vet.  If encounters are too hard you can overprepare and lower the difficulty of that encounter.  Theres no other way to adjust the difficulty of most encounters.  If you use the Dark Souls style of realtime healing then youve got to have some other way to adjust the difficulty or you have to make the game even easier like Skyward Sword.  Id personally like nonmenubased healing better but I understand why they did it the way they did.  I dont see the problem with having optimal recipes.  A lot of people seem to have a problem with the fact that they end up cooking the same foods a lot.  The fact that Hearty foods also restore hearts to full as well really just saves you having to cram your inventory with even more stuff.  It doesnt make the game easier.  Just reduces your time in the menu.  If it didnt heal you could just carry a million seared steaks or something and it would be just as cheesy.  As long as you didnt use guides you had to experiment a bunch to figure out what these optimal recipes are.  Thats playing and beating the cooking game.    Would it be better if the best hearts recipe required one of each kind of Hearty item instead of  of whatever?  Maybe?  Not that much better.  ,Breath_of_the_Wild,df2a6yz,3,t5_3f1s6

However I just tried it and it does OS a IceBreath Lizalfos. The same should work with an Ice rod on FireBreath Lizalfos. But... A sneakstrike is always better because it doesnt use durability...

Until then I thought they were impossible tank beasts.Get your attack up via barbarian armor or foodelixir  this helps a lot. You want to stun with an arrow headshot get a few hits in mount hit with your heaviest hander repeat. I havent broken anything other than bows using this method so it seems that attacking them while mounted doesnt decrease durability.

Its even more delicious when you consider that many of the assets theyd need to add this sort of gameplay are already in game.Tarrey Town and the Hateno Home demonstrate their ability to flesh out an area in phases.Gerudo Towns wildberry patch demonstrates the capacity to add a gatherable resource to an area.Farm animals are already in game through cuccoos Hateno cows horses goats and Hylian retrievers. Props like coops for the cuccoos jugs of milk stables for horses and pens for animals to roam in already exist.An affection system with admittedly limited animals is already programmed in.Pitchforks and hoes are useable items alongside soup ladels and pot lids.We have a somewhat dynamic cooking system that uses ingredients like wheat rice milk eggs and butter.We can chop down trees for bundles of wood. Various trees bearing different fruits exist. We also have bees and honey.While fishing is not a thing we do have several kinds of fish and crabs as well as a rafting system. Being able to place crab pots and fish could add to that.We can already catch and release Horses as well as affecting their stats albeit temporarily through diet.Tie it all together and we could be engaging in raising animals growing crops and buildingupgrading structures.Now just throw in competitions for quality of animals allow horse stats to affect minigames e.g. Strength for jousting Stamina for long races and Speed for agility courses throw in an Iron Chef styled cooking competition by adding flavor qualities to ingredients like spicy sweet savory sour kinda like Pokemons poffins meets skill contests I suppose and you have one hell of a DLC for when you feel like taking things easy.,Breath_of_the_Wild,df895l0,9,t5_3f1s6

There are a lot of objects in this game that you should physically be able to coerce into motion but just remain unmoving no matter what you do as if nailed to the ground. You can destroy some things but not others. Rigging the Rito rock with explosives even when wasting hundreds of bomb arrows on it suprisingly does not make their entire village come down. Etc. This games physics engine does amazing things  within the narrow selection of things its allowed to interact with. Outside of that theres no physics the same way other Zelda games had no physics but they did have for other things.

If youve used that rune before you go into this fight and you pass your aim at a block and the block turns bright red and theres a hammer smashing animation it makes it pretty clear that this power can break ice blocks. Also the ice blocks being thrown at you are the exact same model as the ones you make with your rune so that screams remember you have a power that interacts with these!!

Im thoroughly enjoying the game on my Wii U and I dont have any plans to pick up a Switch for at least a year after the first pIts not even so much for a price drop since historically speaking Nintendo does not drop their home consol prices that often.  For me its the principle of not being an early adopter.  First gen consols are not the best.  They will obviously make revisions improvements or enhancements color bundles and collectors edition etc.  I hole heartedly believe that the switch will succeed.  I am looking forward to their amazing library of game collection.

Of course then discovered how easy they were to farm once you worked out how.Although the time of the day thing means that so far Ive only got like  parts of farosh and the  shrines but not farmed them for items beyond that.

11315606,0,t1_dfellpd,So do you keep pressing up on the DPad to try to move link by mistake?Perhaps pretending that its actually just four separate buttons might help you in this case.I also grew up in the age where controllers did not have joysticks and I do have some gripes with controls I have a lot of difficulty with games where it doesnt let you have separate inversion on the camera for rd person and st person view  I struggle with aiming bows and Runes since I play with inverted camera but when Im aiming a cursor I want it to not be inverted... which Zelda does not let you change but you really shouldnt instinctively move to a completely unrelated set of buttons for something to do with movement when all your movement is on the stick.  You have been playing the game for longer than  minutes by the time you get to the Yiga hideout so you should at least be comfortable enough with movement controls to know not to press anything related to the equipmentchange buttons in order to sneak...And anyway you technically dont even need to use the Sneak option if you walk slowly or eat some Stealth food.

I recommend you immediately hit the bow aim button as you hit it the fifth time to bullet time as you get thrown from its back and aim at the base of its mane youll hear the extra crit ding on a hit if your aiming at the right spot you should get a good  crit arrows as you dismount fewer depending on your stamina wheel if your lucky hell go straight into another stun. If you have the savage lynel x bow use it! Repeat until hes dead.To practise Id recommend the Lynel in the Gerudo highlands next to an updraft vent. That way when you screw up you can use the vent to get airborne again trigger bullet time and go to town on the headshots for the next stun.,Breath_of_the_Wild,dfju2l3,2,t5_3f1s6

But after  hours finishing all the beasts and most of the shrines and the fight still should be a bit of a challenge.

Gerudo use lots of that stuff in their equipment and even clothing.If Gorons are truly Male they might be permitted in the town for the sake of trade. A sort of What is worse? A few men in town or losing a massive part of our jewel and gold supply? situation where Goron are considered the lesser evil.That and if Goron are male maybe they think that no Gerudo would fall in love with one or no Goron would fall in love with a Gerudo.Goron might not even have gender they might be akin to Asari of Mass Effectas someone else mentioned in that they simply use gendered pronouns but dont fit the standard malefemale gender thing.,Breath_of_the_Wild,dg0dfvx,14,t5_3f1s6

Once looking for shrines side quests and korok seeds starts feeling boring or repetitive Ill tackle part of the main quest. Rinse and repeat. Thats something I love about this game. Normally in other openworld games side quests feel like a chore or an obstacle blocking me from what I want to be doing but in BoTW I find myself spending hours having fun with fetch quests haha. You dont need to progress in the story to have fun with the game which is awesome.ALSO this game is so big and open so everyone will play differently and have unique experiences.

They ruin surprise attacks. If Im trying to sneak around an enemy camp and one of these guys shows up it quickly becomes a diaster. Instead of taking out enemies one by one while theyre unsuspecting I now have a hp teleporting enemy and an entire enemy camp attacking a the same time. Theyre cheapskates. I dont particularity like windcleavers for starters. The Yiga with about  health drop vicious cicles and duplex bows both which I like using. On top of that while the weaker ones drop reasonable amounts of rupees the big ones drop a pair of mighty bananas and thats it.TLDR  So not only do they ruin sneak attacks they also dont reward you well for defeating them.,Breath_of_the_Wild,dg1yxuf,2,t5_3f1s6

11663077,0,t3_65vv3c,Well to me the two version of scripts portrait two quite different Mipha this is certainly a cultural thing that if translated directly Westerners will have some difficulties understanding the originali.e. Japanese  Miphas character unless they have a solid background knowledge about Japanese culture.From the Japanese scripts it is obvious that Mipha while deeply loved Link has fully refrained herself from showing her affection to him. On the other hand Link has never considered her a love interest due to his insensitiveness but simply a close friend. She clearly knew her place and only hoped that she could give Link all she has without asking anything in return.This is of course a typical plot instrument employed in many Japanese love stories to glorify the traditional image of ideal Japanese women which I myself sometimes doubt its appropriateness but I personally dont dislike such image.And I dont think the English translation captured any of these again like I said largely due to cultural difference as such image itself doesnt quite exist in Western culture.To sum it up I think the Mipha I know is quite different than Mipha you know so I was just trying to show what exactly was omitted from the English translate in hope more people get to know the Mipha I think I know.,Breath_of_the_Wild,dgi0wfv,1,t5_3f1s6

11724002,0,t1_dgokgv7,Except the game starting you back before the final boss is the standard for the Zelda series as a whole and many other games. Breath of the Wild is in no way unique in this regard. Its very likely that the devs dont consider a nonexistent postgame to be a bad thing but one can hope they figure it out eventually.,Breath_of_the_Wild,dgoy2ag,8,t5_3f1s6
11724528,0,t3_679ge6,Of course this doesnt take into account all of Skyrims underground areas. I would have loved some explorable caves and caverns in BotW. Especially if they used the darkness mechanic present in some parts of the game.Hopefully well see this kind of thing in future Zeldas if Nintendo continues to push the boundaries of open world games.,Breath_of_the_Wild,dgp07pc,4,t5_3f1s6

11728215,0,t1_dgp2nby,This was the first clothing set I bought and it makes catching things so much easier. The firelfies idk if its possible to catch them without it but every time Im in normal clothes the just fly away. Faries animals all easier when Im in stealth clothes. Blupees just walk right up behind them. Made getting the blue flame to Akalla lab so much easier as I just sneak struck all the moblins...God damn how did you go without this stuff?

11731615,0,t3_67dp4r,I think that one of the ways that people usually  use to decide if something is a dungeon is if it has a bottlenecked entrance. One entrance. Roughly one path with certain conditions that must be met to advance within.Personally I think of it as a dungeon. It has its own eerie music. There are sub bosses. Theres lore elements and gear that is exclusive to this area. Reasons to explore. Rooms that have to be gimmicked to gain access. Its open for exploitive and creative methods to get to the final battle but this whole area has one undeniable dungeonlike central focus the need to go to the end of the map and trigger a final boss battle. Seeing as some conditions allow you to meet old dungeon bosses here I think theres nothing wrong with saying it qualifies. More tension works into the game play like traditional dungeons do too. It even has its own map...A right in this game that is limited only to Hyrule castle and the four dungeons.Aside from its open world concept....An openness that is the very foundation of the whole game I dont really understand why anyone would would say it isnt actually a dungeon.,Breath_of_the_Wild,dgpt4tc,4,t5_3f1s6
