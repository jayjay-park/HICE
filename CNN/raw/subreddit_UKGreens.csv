2614499,0,t3_2psqoc,gt  To recap the Greens are an antiestablishment populist agenda and a solid niche vote based on a clearlydefined demographic that feels alienated from the main parties. In other words Ukip for young people.This is absolute crap. I believe if you vote for the Green party youre doing it because you agree with their policies and are particularly aware that prejudices should not be involved in politics. The only reason the likelyhood of voting one or the other follows the trend of age groups as hes mentioned is because older people overwhelmingly base their political leanings on their prejudices. Its got bugger all to do with alienation its not a protest vote its looking at the facts and coming to a sensible conclusion.,UKGreens,cmzupxb,9,t5_34166
2735401,0,t1_cnewfxu,Myself and a few others brought a motion that failed on this to the last autumn conference. Well try again in time. Need time to prep though and also garner a larger body of support in advance. The people likely to vote against it are on the whole older longer standing members that are more likely to go to conference so the demographic is weighted against it even if more than half the party were to be in favour and I dont think it is yet. ,UKGreens,cnf047o,10,t5_34166
2831693,0,t1_cnpuy14,gtgt  I dont know if its because Im a white British man but Ive just never seen the need for it.gtThis is a pretty familiar sentence for pretty obvious reasons. gtgt Im sorry but I dont see how discriminating against me because of my gender is any better than discriminating against a woman.gtBecause we live in a representative democracy politicians are meant to represent the people they serve. You say a better candidate but in what way do you mean better? Its not really a simplistic thing like that.Sorry the candidate stuff was more on general terms about a job role in the normal world. What I meant was the best person for the job should be given it regardless of gender unless gender is a legitimate factor in it. As for representative politics I agree but when it comes to the leaders debates surely it should be based on clear unbias criteria not on gender equality?,UKGreens,cnpyivg,3,t5_34166

4840540,0,t3_3h1bhw,Corbyn thinks that coal can be mined and process environmentaly freindly via carbon capture for the powerplants and good practice. I think while these things are possible the onky risk is compainies will skimp on cost and damage the environment. ,UKGreens,cu4orv6,2,t5_34166
7297729,0,t3_4dvti0,I look at it this way our first big issue to solve right now is climate change so we need to do what we can to reduce our carbon emissions.Now while nuclear energy certainly isnt a perfect solution here it does have a few pros namely it doesnt emit greenhouse gases and unlike a lot of greener energy sources its reliable and works  and we can get funding for it through parliament as it currently is. Of course theres the nuclear waste issue and it would be silly for us to ignore that but unfortunatley we dont have the luxury to wait around until we have enough renewables or fusion we need action now on climate change. So while nuclear power is far from perfect it could certainly be a stepping stone away from fossil fuels.One last thing when Im talking my friends the Green Partys stance on nuclear power is often one of the main points on which it is discredited and mocked and call me a blairite but we need to win to enact the policies we need. Nuclear power is often seen as unsafe by GP members which is fair enough but we dont live in earthquake zones and are more than capable of enacting proper engineering and safety measures.Tldr Nuclear power could help us as a skipping stone away from carbon fuels and the sooner the better.,UKGreens,d27pae3,1,t5_34166

8235285,0,t1_d56ujoo,I want to ensure that people dont turn up to a first meeting or event  to what can be quite a necessarily dry experience   and get turned off  as Im sure most of us have experienced on one side or another!Its hard and often unproductive for people to work use their skills and feel valued or able to speak in teams that are too large.I would therefore propose and encourage the Party to adopt a neighbourhood team scheme.This would enable people to be and feel more involved and connect the Party to more voters and issues.It would also give people more chance to talk about issues locally have a level of responsibility and decisionmaking use their skills and bond in a more comfortable environment with other members.The scheme can be promoted directly to members and using technology to put those members in touch with each other if theyve agreed. Local members could form neighbourhood teams working within specific party guidelines and reporting to local party. There neednt be defined boundaries and they could help people keen to work on very local issues with the support of national resources and their local party. They could take actions on planning issues or reporting local concerns stalls discussion meeting and talks. They would reinforce rather than detract from local parties. For example by adopting a patch for leafletting or canvassing for the local party and spreading our message further.,UKGreens,d56yscp,2,t5_34166
8336871,0,t3_4tqclp,What do you think can be done to get more people involved with their local parties and more widely in local politics? Our membership surge has brought in a lot of new often young potential activists but local parties do not seem to be making the most of this opportunity  what can we do to make sure local parties reach out to them and when they are on board how can we better mobilise our activists for local elections and other campaigns?,UKGreens,d5jnvzq,2,t5_34166
