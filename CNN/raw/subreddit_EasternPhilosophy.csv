3400502,0,t3_2z43d2,Id like to add that hitting in Zen is a general thing to be expected anyway. Everyone is hit during practice. Its about creating an environment of such irrational pressure that the ego is transcended. In The Three Pillars of Zen its said that many monks achieved Kensho upon being hit the jolt of energy and alertness propels them into enlightenment.,EasternPhilosophy,cpfvste,3,t5_2vm4l

9805792,0,t3_5fn68b,The TLDR this philosophical perspective called advaita vedanta came about due to a particular style of functioning of the brain resulting from various meditation practices and so intellectual analysis of it without either having that same style of fucntioning or at least understanding the physiological basis of it is doomed to failure its not a philosophy in the usual sense but a set of observations made by people in an altered state of consciousness completely foreign to most people who were trying to intellectually grasp their own point of view..You might be interested in the radical advaita vedanta of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi MMY founder of the Transcendental Meditation TM organization. For MMY the socalled philosophy of advaita vedanta wasnt an intellectual exercise the way Western Philosophers conceive of the subject but instead an attempt to make intellectual sense of a perspective based on a certain kind of physiological functioning of the brain. MMY first started calling for the scientific study of meditation back around  claiming that there would be distinct physiological changes in the brain associated with samadhi  AKA tuirya the fourth state of consciousness AKA pure consciousness PC and that these changes would start to become a trait found outside of TM practice. As these changes became stronger and more persistent the meditators perception of internal and external reality would go through various transformations eventually ending up with the one discussed in the advaita vedanta literature. These were the stable higher states of consciousness collectively known as enlightenment.The first stable stage that would emerge would  be a pure senseofself not associated with any specific attribute normally associated with our selfawareness a sense that I am with all other mental and sensory phenomena appreciated as notself. While this is the basis for all further growth towards enlightenment it is also the state of the total separation of self from the world and so MMY called it merely normal or glorified ignorance. He used the Sansrkit term turiyatta quality of turiya to refer to it and the English term Cosmic Consciousness CC.The next stage in growth towards enlightenment was where the meditator based on their enhanced physiological stability experienced as CC would start to perceive more and more subtle aspects of relative perception until the most subtle could be appreciated and gone beyond. This he called deva chetana or God Consciousness GC.Finally beyond GC one would start to appreciate that all perception arises out of Self which was first noticed in CC and this he called brahma chetana or  Unity Consciousness UC..The current state of research on TM and enlightenment is summarized in this review article published in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences a few years ago Transcendental experiences during meditation practice pdfPhysiological research on samadhi during TM was first published in  and several studies have appeared since CAPTCHA phrase required to access many of the following papersBreath Suspension During the Transcendental Meditation Technique pdfMetabolic rate respiratory exchange ratio and apneas during meditation. pdfElectrophysiologic characteristics of respiratory suspension periods occurring during the practice of the Transcendental Meditation Program.pdfAutonomic patterns during respiratory suspensions possible markers of Transcendental Consciousness.pdfA few years ago researcher  Fred Travis at the TM university in Iowa  found  subjects who at least met MMYs criteria for the beginning stage of CC having a pure sense of self present  hours a day  days a week whether awake dreaming or in deep sleep and published two studies on the physiological and psychological correlates of people who reported that this situation persisted continuously for at least one yearPsychological and physiological characteristics of a proposed objectreferralselfreferral continuum of selfawareness pdfPatterns of EEG coherence power and contingent negative variation characterize the integration of transcendental and waking states pdf.All of the philosophical discussion surrounding advaita vedanta can be explained in MMYs terms once you realize that TM is NOT a form of concentration but an enhancement of normal mindwandering rest. The current theory is that PC is a situation where the part of the thalamusthe gateway of the senseswhich accepts incoming sensory information and passes it to the relevant parts of the cortex for processing and accepts processed data from the cortex and merges it with the incoming sensory data has shut down but without shutting down the longdistance communication between the processing areas of the cortex.This leads to a situation where there is no experience of the outside world nor of any kind of thought process or memory or dream or intuition or anything else and yet the brain is still in an alert mode of functioning. This leaves the default mode network  of the brain the DMN which activates when we arent trying to do anything and is thought to be responsible for our senseofself   fullon while the task positive networks the TPNs which are basically activated when we are trying to do things without any ongoing stimulation and so the DMN starts to become accustomed to being active without any associated stuff we typically associate with me or mine. Eventually outside of samadhi and even more eventually outside of TM practice this nostuff senseofself emerges and starts to dominate our perception of who we are..The links I gave above sorta support this theory and the rest is pure speculation on my partas the brain reorganizes its style of functioning around this new mode at first only the DMN is appreciated as less noisy. However as time goes on the DMN and other resting state networks RSNs start to become better coordinated and so the meditator starts at first to appreciate the period as the DMNs activity gives way to TPN activity where various areas of the brain cooperate to do math or predict the progress of a jumping animal or to appreciate the loving relationships between family and friends any kind of higherorder process. This is appreciated as perception of devas or those activities in consciousness responsible for all the laws and rules that we appreciate the world as functioning under. Eventually the meditator appreciates all largescale  TPN activity of the brain as being the result of the DMN RSNs giving way to  activity in the various taskpositive networks and interprets this as appreciation of the fundamental creative impulse of the universe acts of God if you will. Hence the label God Consciousness.And now we come to advaita vedantaAs the DMN amp RSNs become even more integrated the meditator starts to appreciate that EVERY bit of activity of the brain other than the DMNampRSNs arises out of the Self first noted in CC and so the perception is that all the external universe and not just thought processes arises out of the Universal Self Brahmin..The philosophical perspective provided in advaita vedanta is as is the atom so is the universe as is the individual self so is the Universal Self. The assumption the advaita vedanta philosophers made is that they could by analyzing their own interiorexterior perspective based on the functioning of their brain that noone had any inkling about a few thousand years ago comprehend how the universe works and how it was created by that  Creative Principle that is constantly appreciated within their own thoughtprocesses and perception of the outside world as the brain shifts modes of functioning roughly every  of a second This constant shift is described as the hum of creation.And so they made up stories that explained both how their thought processes and perceptions arise out of Self and how the universe arose out of Universal Self thats physiologically the ONLY way they see the world which being preneuroscience  used the language of religion and spirituality..Hope the above made sense.,EasternPhilosophy,dalrw39,2,t5_2vm4l
