1627702,0,t3_28spwd,Laser treatment seems to have varying levels of efficacy based on the patient and treatment regime employed but it is quite effective for redness which is all Ive read up on as I dont have papules. Laser treatment depending on the parameters used can produce a purpuric bruising or subpurpuric nonbruising outcome the purpuric delivering larger amounts of light energy  heat to the blood vessels thus hemmhoraging  them more completely than subpurpuric. Its my belief that laser treatment that doesnt bruise isnt really going to do enough damage to really treat diffuse erythema  in a decent timescale. That being said its also prudent to start subpurpuric with test patches to ensure your skin can cope with the treatment.TLDR you might still get results but it may take a few treatments or a more aggressive treatment with the laser.,Rosacea,cjkc4vb,1,t5_2qwbh

6750031,0,t1_d0he4pp,Im ingesting it.I read the paper about Milk thistle and MSM being good for your skin. I misread it and apparently it was a cream. But I took the MSM and milk thistle ingested anyways and it cured it.MSM played the biggest role milk thistle did basically nothing. ,Rosacea,d0hid8r,1,t5_2qwbh
6909160,0,t1_d0zcq41,Snail cream seems to burn me a little but I cant tell if thats normal or not. I dont really know weather to carry on using it. I have also developed some small reddish bumbs around my mouths chin which are horrible as I thought accutane would stop breakouts from occurring so very disappointing ,Rosacea,d0zh1qn,2,t5_2qwbh
7050265,0,t1_d1cd6zv,Yes it has.Of course no cream gives you the same results as laser treatment.But the cream does a good job of lessening the redness cutting down the flushing and irritation.I dont normally have pustules so I cant speak to that.Good luck! ,Rosacea,d1fi7on,1,t5_2qwbh
7358710,0,t1_d2emfm8,But isnt it bad to flush. If I had an IPL apparently you need to avoid all flushing as it can mean the redness comes back ,Rosacea,d2emvaa,1,t5_2qwbh
7448131,0,t3_4h7fsa,It took me about a week. It doesnt really remove the existing rosacea but will prevent some of the new ones that develop for me. It also doesnt circumvent the rosacea from particular triggers.So for example MSM will heal histamine foods and sugar foods for me. But Alcohol or fermeneted foods never seem to heal with MSM for me. ,Rosacea,d2ot076,1,t5_2qwbh

7609634,0,t3_4jidsa,Yah never realized I had rosacea until it started becoming a more permanent issue on my face. I always thought I had an allergy to one of the beers I drank because my face would flush then sometimes my chest then sometimes my arms then patches on the backs of my hands and down the top of my thighs. Still no idea whats rosacea and whats not.,Rosacea,d376csj,2,t5_2qwbh
7630336,0,t3_4jcxi5,I was on accutane when I was about  Im  now and it made me pretty red. Ive always had very fair skin and tend to get red when I work out really hard or when Im in the heat for a long time.After accutane my skin remained sensitive and only got red occasionally. However about . months ago my cheeks became red all the time. The derm said it looks like classic rosacea so now Im trying to deal with it. Nothing has reduced the chronic redness yet.I do think it is an accutane side effect however Im not a doctor and just relaying my own story. Good luck!,Rosacea,d39j0ry,1,t5_2qwbh

8724062,0,t3_4zdydi,I think it helps to remind yourself that some people are born with it x worse than me. Deformities conjoined twins etc get worse stares and  they live their lives. Rosacea is beans compared to some of the more serious issues people live with.,Rosacea,d6w5dq6,6,t5_2qwbh
8776174,0,t3_4xogkv,Laser didnt work well for me unfortunately . I have pretty bad redness though and didnt try many treatments if you have bad rosacea you might need quite a few sessions to have any significant progress.,Rosacea,d72ou1f,1,t5_2qwbh
8784167,0,t3_50ei14,Looks like rosacea. Definitely go back to your derm. Maybe  years ago it wasnt as apparent. Hopefully they can recommend some appropriate products. I use Cerave cleanser and face lotion with SPF. You will probably also need a prescription rosacea cream. Some treatments you can look into ahead of time are metronidazole Metrogel Azelaic acid Finacea or Ivermectin Soolantra in order from oldest to newest treatment. Ive heard the second one also has antipimple benefits but if thats not a problem for you then it doesnt matter. Good luck!,Rosacea,d73oz28,1,t5_2qwbh

9172505,0,t1_d8e9p6y,I actually tried their chamomile toner and Im not a big fan either. If youre looking for a great calming face cream I really recommend Phytomer soothing cream. I tried it out and it really made a difference. It was a bit of a splurge but it was worth it. Its cheapest on amazon if you are interested  ,Rosacea,d8eoljg,1,t5_2qwbh

10007293,0,t3_5iypi1,Ive been diagnosed with severe eczema since I was a month old but this doesnt look like eczema to me and I havent had an eczema flair up anywhere in a good year . My face is hot to the touch not dry but inflamed slightly bumpy and sometimes itchy.  two weeks ago it did this but not as bad. I used my lotion a good  times a day and it disappeared but came back yesterday. I also have broken blood vessels on my cheeks but Ive had them since a young age. Ive been to a derm in the past when I was  through  and he always said it was eczema even though he saw the broken blood vessels. I keep stressing thinking my face will always be red and gross looking. Help!Note I did wear a wool scarf around my face last night. Am I just paranoid and this is just eczema  winter time?,Rosacea,dbbz8zb,1,t5_2qwbh
10260869,0,t3_5mue4w,Yes sometimes although much more when I was younger. My ears used to burn and itch worse than my cheeks probably because they get hit with the sun more.Nowadays its rare that my ears flush bad but it sometimes still happens. Doesnt bother me nearly as much as my face though.,Rosacea,dc74iwa,2,t5_2qwbh

10693348,0,t1_ddhyap1,Try starting with a much lower dose and slowly raise it.I highly recommend you stick to it. Its entirely likely that your body is detoxifying and you will respond very well to the MSM in time.gtThis is because MSM is a potent detoxifier. It dissolves many compounds reacts with certain toxins and greatly facilitates elimination of toxic wastes from the cells. Detoxing too fast can produce a variety of uncomfortable symptoms such as nausea diarrhea fatigue headache insomnia depression or anxiety skin eruptions itching the worsening of allergy symptoms and even palpitations. Reactions if there are any tend to be quite individual. If youre prone to getting headaches MSM may cause headache if you tend to experience insomnia MSM may lead to insomnia and the same with other potential reactions.gtWith any new supplement its wise to start out with a small dose and build up gradually and this is particularly true with MSM. Start out with half a capsule  mg for several days to see how you do with it before adding more. If youre very sick very toxic or know you are extremely sensitive begin with even less.This is quite likely a good sign but another possibility is that its unpure MSM and some of the impurities are causing issues. Or I suppose you could be having a rare allergic reaction to it but I doubt this.,Rosacea,ddixu7d,2,t5_2qwbh

11377872,0,t3_62aerm,I use MRM for the MSM cream. I think you can find their ingredients online but I think they use petroleum jelly and some other stuff. This has made my skin super smooth. No more crazy dry skin so I am hoping over time it will also help reduce the redness. I use it twice a day before applying my moisturizer.I just started taking MSM mg x a day yesterday so I have no feedback on that yet.,Rosacea,dflnvf6,1,t5_2qwbh

11759072,0,t3_67s9hm, Mandelic is weak enough that you can just leave it on your skin without washing it off. It neutralizes itself even.But you should try Azelaic Acid.  is normal.  if effective.  is prescription strength but you can buy a couple versions on amazon which has immediate results for redness.Niacinamide  also should help,Rosacea,dgsx5h8,1,t5_2qwbh
