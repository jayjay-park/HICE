840181,0,t3_23nmu3,Last summer it covered a big chunk of my payments. This year maybe not so much. Theres a grant based on your summer enrollment and your grades from the previous semester.

901813,0,t3_23lukc,I dont know what to recommend since it would be pointless to take a course which doesnt transfer. I would go talk to your academic adviser at your home university and see what your department has allowed to transfer in the past. In my opinion getting Calculus II or Differential Equations out of the way when youre not taking a full course load would be conducive to your health lol. ,FIU,ch6shlh,1,t5_2s56w
909144,0,t1_ch7mewc,Simply that I didnt need the class for my career field.  It was a fields and waves class and I argued that for my EE with a computer specialty I was not going to be using that much of what I learned from his class. I think he felt it was valid.  This was over  years ago.,FIU,ch7mist,2,t5_2s56w

1260059,0,t3_28fxz2,Ive been going to FIU for  years now and i didnt even know there was an anime club. Maybe put more flyers up around school when you have events coming up to spread the word more. Also im assuming most people wont join the club because theyre kind of introvert and dont know what to expect from the club besides going to a dark room to watch anime. So maybe take pictures of the club and what goes on on a regular basis to ease people into going.Not too sure what else to do for activites except maybe play video games or card games. Bringing Japanese food to share would be nice too if everyone did it. For events maybe start a con at school like the one at BBC or maybe just get people to go to a con like SuperCon and cosplay if you want.,FIU,cibdepg,1,t5_2s56w
2088993,0,t3_2irps7,I dont understand how FIU is so poor to maintain such a critical piece of infrastructure that we need for JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING. No excuses for a university to be having these many issues with WiFi for days in the midst of the semester.,FIU,cl5cvai,-1,t5_2s56w

I say this as a first gen college student that is now a professor.
