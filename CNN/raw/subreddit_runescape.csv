8654,0,t1_cefcib0,Its totally relevant. Runescape is all about repitition over long periods of time it was originally intended to cap out at what lvl ? Each skill takes effectively  days ingame to max going on not quite k average. So Give or take a day So for years people have been playing for three five six eight hours a day just to keep up. They have a routine a schedule for when they play and how much. They got used to this schedule over YEARS because there were no quick reactions needed for basic gameplay it was left mostly for bosses and questsAnd you know what? Again I enjoy EoCI think it is FAR superior to the old system though there are some inherent flaws with the implementation but Ive never had my skills developed from a prequel so poorly transfer over. I dont think since Lufia on SNES have I played a game that changed its core so much from one iteration to the next. It is an entirely different combat system one that doesnt fit the RS mentality whatsoevernor Id argue the engine but again thats another rant,runescape,ceff69a,2,t5_2qwxl

I immediately started using momentum and ignoring the skills. The next day I got a challenge to do the barrows... I remembered this vaguely and was exited.

279032,0,t1_cf9j8vl,I KNOW you do not have to buy skills. It is however in terms of time UNREASONABLE to collect your own materials. I have played for  years and on more than one account. I have done BOTH methods so I know EXACTLY what I am on about. It goes from taking roughly  hours from buying stuff to well OVER  hours by collecting your own stuff. A nondeadbeat ADULT or RESPONSIBLE  student does NOT HAVE  hours a day to play the game. Lets say they have roughly  hours which still may be a bit generous. At hrs a day and  hours for the paid method that works out to  days of playing spent solely on that skill which means no breaks which is already NOT FUN and against the very nature of a GAME. Bump that number up to  and that skill alone could take well over a year. Now there are  skills total. Some train very quickly and assuming you do quests a lot can go by very fast. Now for arguments sake I will not count bonus events such as double xp weekends or world events. This works out for it taking more than TEN REAL YEARS OF ACTIVELY TRYING for a person to come close to maxing. That number goes higher for busier people or more casual players. Your argument hinges on the fact it has the highest bonus outside of events already by the way at this point it seems we are not talking about the event anymore and it is the way prayer is designed well maybe i am submitting that all skills and not just prayer need higher xp rates andor to be redesigned point of games is to have fun. Now the foolish people responsible for the horrid direction games are taking might say well if you dont like it just quit or you just want one click s and that is NOT the case. Jagex is a company and Runescape is an MMO for them to survive they NEED money and NEED it to take longer than a month to complete the game and I get that. A decent model may be to aim for halving the time required based on the average free times working adults may have. If it were to take an extremely time crunched casual  years to complete the game then someone who plays regularly for outrageous amounts of time may be able to do it in  or  years. That is reasonable considering that the new content alone should keep players who really like the game playing. What would that do? Simple more people would get to where they can enjoy the game players wouldnt look for less time consuming alternatives it would become easier to get new players and maybe a good deal of the players wouldnt be oldschool elitist dicks. I wouldnt want to see these changes even within the next two years as I know just how much work they would take i have studied game design programming psychology math and I think in terms of logic but tiny changes that help out more frequently would do wonders for the game. Like I have said i have played the game since elementary school over  years ago and I do not intend to just abandon ship. The games player base seems to have shrunken quite dramatically over the years and I want people to want to play the game and enjoy it. Some people think of skills as challenging but the only difficult thing about the majority of skills is from being able to deal with the monotonous boring arthritis inducing way that they are designed. I have no problem whatsoever with the idea of a skill being difficult merely with them being repetitive and extraordinarily time consuming in fact I WANT to see more challenging skills come about that ARE about a players abilities rather than availability. It would give more meaning to max capes and skill capes obviously not making them integral to the core of the game to the point where those without it basically cannot play. This is about all I wish to say on the matter. Hopefully it provokes thought rather than fanboy rage.,runescape,cf9on5h,1,t5_2qwxl

279370,0,t3_1xayti,How similar things are depends severely on whether you last left before or after the EoC update. EoC or Evolution of Combat replaced the old combat system with a abilitybased system closer to what you might find in other MMOs. To say reception was mixed is... a large understatement. That said within the past few weeks there has been a combat beta aiming to fix several lasting issues as well as an initiative to begin development of a legacy mode that by my reading will mask the majority of the changes to allow diehards for the old system to largely ignore it. Reactions to this is also mixed but thats the RS community for you.As far as Slayer Id hold off for the Revolution setting to come out of beta if youre wanting a more AFKish setup as it automates a lot of the keypresses youd otherwise need for full efficiency. Most other skills are the same though quickdropping is a lot easier with the ability bar for things like powermining or powerfishingOther than that theres a new customizeable UI there was a thread a few days ago where you can see some examples of what various people use. Theres also a new ingame polling system to help Jagex more accurately figure out what the majority of the community actually wants  the keystone poll last month was a new skill vs the elf city for  instance.Then theres the usual array of content quests have been in short supply unfortunately but theres plenty of nifty stuff to check out. This month is gonna be big with a new Grandmaster quest and a new minigame so were all kind of excited about those.

A spells damage is limited to the tier of the staff youre using so even if you used a Mystic Earth Staff Rock Barrage would only deal damage on par with a Tier  weaponspell. Staff of Light makes  of your casts free or in other words its a . price reduction. Currently Rock Barrage costs  GPcast so a staff of light reduces that to . GPcast and would be the most cost effective option.However if you want to get the most damage barring Tier  weapons then Id advise dual wielding Abyssal weapons those would be a bit more expensive than SoL due to the fact that it uses runes more quickly but it has the same rune saving effect and is generally better for barraging.,runescape,cfksfiz,5,t5_2qwxl

Fetch and fedex quests certainly exist though usually stuff like combat is not so bad as bring me  bear asses and instead translates to one or more boss battles.

I imagine he does have a tremendous love for his people hes spent an eternity working on his own cure and he will likely spend another. It has to do with the odds against what there was to gain. Kerapac never seemed very hopeful about the whole affair. It was a big gamble and chances were Hannibus would sacrifice himself for no gain for either race.Besides he just made some great progress with the aid of the World Guardian. A long as they continue aiding Kerapac the curse may be lifted soon or at least lessened substantially and all of the Dragonkin can work together on the reproduction problem. ,runescape,cfzi053,2,t5_2qwxl

577594,0,t1_cg5wbe7,Before anyone points out how the Wealth Evaluator isnt that bad doesnt give you an ingame advantage or anything like that it was the straw that broke the camels back. We had just gotten the Wicked Pouch which many people were outraged about because we had been asking for an ammo slot item for runes for years. A basic feature that was implemented as a cash shop item. Next up was the blast from the past which brought back some of the exclusive cosmetics from Squeal of Fortune. A lot of people didnt like this because they were said to have been removed from the SoF forever. Yes they should have known better but it is an annoyance nonetheless. Next up was the Prismania Promotion which I didnt find as bad because I think bonus xp promotions instead of direct xp promotions are fantastic but this is what started annoying an extra bunch of people.  Then we had the Silverhawk Boots which is a Treasure Hunter exclusive item that trains agility at a rate much faster than traditional agility training. This caused a massive outrage. They have promised us an agility rework and while this isnt a significant update content wise it would have revitalised agility slightly. These boots should have only worked while actually training agility for a slight boost about an extra k xphr at last course. They would have also been an excellent minigame addition  tickets at Brimhaven Dungeon for the boots  ticket per  feathers for example. and then this... the straw that broke the camels back Wealth Evaluator. A feature we have been asking for for years. Every single time we have been shot down with Jagex claiming that it would put too much stress on their servers. Thats perfectly OK just dont implement the feature then. But what do they do? Introduce it via SGS as a rental item and come up with the same excuse that it would put too much stress on their servers when several people have proven multiple times that thats bullshit. Even if it was there are several things they could have done to implement this feature free of charge.I hope this clarifies the current level of outrage to everyone who doesnt understand.,runescape,cg5xdim,21,t5_2qwxl

Sure a screenshot of a  is just a quick screenshot but think of the time and effort behind getting the . Just because you have that  already or you find it easy the person who posted it probably didnt.I saw you mentioned the Dragon Sq Shield thats being made.

Then the game kind of updated over the past  years and tons of people for  smithing.Herblore...Was good for selling super sets at edgeville at around .Fletching still ok money. Doesnt deserve anything decent though its the easiest and cheapest buyable skill to train and always has been.Runecrafting is still mh. Thats fair.Crafting...Honestly I dont remember it being profitable ever.The point is a these skills are pointless b anyone can train them and achieve  easily c Theyre past their prime with the exception of Runecrafting and d did I mention anyone can do them? Look at it from a realistic perspective. Literally anyone can work at McDonalds. Everyone can settle for a job at McDonalds or start their careers at Mcdonalds and maybe become efficient enough to move up the chain. But its also fair that every single low end McDonalds job could be replaced by a robot and probably be made  more efficient but we as people hate robots because reasons. The point is anyone can work at McDonalds. Literally anyone. Some people are fine with that. Others want to be managers. Regional managers. Board of directors. CEOs. Some people dont even want to work at McDonalds but want to be M Secret Service Rocket Scientists Dictators. These jobs are highly sought after require years of experience and other Bonafide Occupational requirements that means not everyone can do them. Because they are so scarce they are paid greatly in return for quality or qualifications of work. Any M could work at McDonalds. I doubt theres a single person working at McDonalds who would qualify to know the location of NASAs recruitment centre. But but but Mcdonalds employees work really hard! They do the same thing over and over clean tables take orders fill cups. Yeah. Literally anyone could do that. In fact literally anyone could do it better. Can you jump from train to train pursuing a man twice your size in the bitter cold because your country needs you to? Hell no. Thats why James Bond makes so much motherfucking money while McDonalds employees get shit.This should be the end all to any skillers deserve to make money. They dont because anyone can skill. Get some balls and go pvm if you want to make money and if you refuse to level combat because thats just how you play be sure to whine to your McDonalds manager that you cant complete the customers order because you refuse to use your hands.Filthy skillers.,runescape,cgrv3od,-6,t5_2qwxl

799597,0,t3_23a7gk,I have been playing through my vpn for over a year and a half now with no issues. If it matters I have JAG enabled and use the same laptop every time.The socks proxy they gave me doesnt want to work with my torrents for whatever reason granted my utorrent client isnt up to date so its easier to just route all my network traffic through the vpn and set it to auto connect at startup.Servers are close  fast enough that I usually only see about a ms extra ping for the runescape worlds I frequent so I never bother turning my vpn off. Nice for peace of mind as well because I dont need to remember to turn it on if Im doing something that requires it.On the flip side I have heard people who claim they have gotten banned from using a vpn but most of the stories dont come with details. Are they using a private or public vpn? Were they using it to bot on an account? Do they use jag? Lots of unanswered questions to those situations.Due to a few complaints from other players I do not recommend doing so however until an official statement by Jagex is made on the issue. If you must I would make sure to use a paid for or private vpn instead of something public. This last section is my personal theory and not proven but may explain the bans for vpn use some players have claimed. If you do not have JAG enabled having your account logging in from random points around the world is very suspicious activity. If people have used the same ip you received from a public vpn to bot accounts there is a possibility they are going after any account that logged in from that address. Both of those are theories and speculation of course so dont take them to heart.TLDR If you have to then use a private vpn. Best to wait until Jagex finally gives a statement on this issue due to claims of bans from vpn use most likely public. If trying to get around a website ban to play setting up a proxy to your home computer would be best free and safer.,runescape,cgv60sl,3,t5_2qwxl

Its a loselose to add BXP to try and revive minigames. People will put in the least effort possible without a doubt which wont revive anything. But giving XP for pking is a good move. Its removal was completely stupid and didnt help to encourage pkers to learn EOC.Its also true that bots did help keep minigames alive. SW  PC were big ones that were constantly running due to bots. Now that we dont have nearly as many bots or players for that matter keeping minigames  alive revolves around a proper matchmaking system  an instance between all worlds or something.So basically old styles of combat  XP for kills  proper matchmaking system  an overall revival,runescape,cgyc6o0,12,t5_2qwxl

861176,0,t3_23ysen,The server only sends your client information about a limited area around your character. This area is approximately the size of the draw distance. If they were to remove the fog and draw further there would be no players NPCs or special objects because those things are unknown.So if they extended the draw distance they would just draw like buildings and the ground but that would be sort of deceiving because actually there could be players and NPCs and stuff there and youd just see it as empty til you got close. Some MMOs do choose to do that like WoW. You see emptiness in the distance as you get closer things come into view because the server starts sending them. Maybe it woud be good as a choice but Id probably take the fog.And they cant extend the server info distance because its exponentially more network traffic and server work.This is the best sort of ELI I can give.

You keep saying that Legacy would not and will not undermine our experience yet recent changes are disproving this entirely.From the recent combat beta update. You are bringing back  effective protection prayers to certain bosses again one can only assume this is a trend that will continue.. Youre tweaking special attacks to be more relevant again at high levels which locks players into certain choices of weapons rather than being able to choose any weapon from their respective tier tier  is a very good example of this.. You have removed entire EoC mechanics for their old combat counterparts critical chance vs. Strength.. You are harming the pace of combat by having food trigger a global cooldown.The people who stuck with you through thick and thin are once again being bashed mocked and ridiculed for continuing to support you. We are being shoved aside in favour of a toxic community of the past.It is getting to the point where you have not only pissed off that toxic crowd in the past you are now also beginning to piss off your current players for a chance to get back some of your older players.,runescape,chhp46p,4,t5_2qwxl

Yes people can now effectively buy a m skill but I distinctly remember a time when nobody was even close to this and only a handful of players were even maxed.  Also achieving m with bonus exp. still requires m exp. worth of skilling.

Players see an outfit decide they want it purchase it and enjoy it! They feel like they spent their money well because they got what they wanted without feeling like they had to.Treasure hunter promotions are the exact opposite of this. They are a cheap attempt to lure a player into spending money on bonuses that the player would be worse off without. But even when the player purchases keys they still feel like theyve been cheated and are left upsetunsatisfied.Jagex dont make the player feel like they have to spend money while simultaneously making them hate doing so. It is not a sustainable business model. If it continues this way both you and the players lose.Its pretty obvious at this point that MTX will continue to be in the game forever.

I RAN OUT of prayer because my character could not kill the hellhounds fast enough to support soul split and turmoil.

There wouldnt be any need for restrictions like game ticks.Sure they couldnt advertise the game as browser based but lets be honest... Browser based MMOs arent anything to rave about aside from their portability.  Of course it would be a massive overhaul that would require a ton of development time but I think the end result would be more than worth it.Maybe Jagex should hire a few extra developers to work exclusively on something like this.,runescape,ciax7lz,0,t5_2qwxl

1305502,0,t3_290u23,I had an old account a long time a go but I made a new account recently last month I love that it is easier to get experience in expensive skills its allowed me to do a lot more quests than I would have on my other account I flat out refused to train herblore EOC is fun I like the combat and consider it a step forward. Im kind of dissapointed with the lack of a good midgame boss i think players with midlevel stats and gear need a challenge which is useful not giant mole A lot of minigames being dead makes me a little sad but ports I find really fun. I find dungeoneering really fun but almost impossible to find parties for if you arent at similar dungeoneering levels and similar skill totals its really inefficient for one person. Social slayer seems to be a great idea but nobody does it due to less experience.In short I like all the changes and it feels more welcoming to a new player except for the insane amounts of quests you need to complete atleast these are fun.I also wish there was another way to get loyalty points maybe the same way you earn keys? it feels quite difficult to keep up with other players without some of the more useful auras. ,runescape,cighhuy,3,t5_2qwxl

1396521,0,t1_cirbeod,Exactly. We arent professionals... We are just the players. Its like when we ask for a better game its not like we can tell them what and how to do it. We cant makevideo games most people have not a clue when it comes to making games. Its not up to us to do their job for them. If they dont advertise and they dont find a way to then somebody else will. Simple as that and RS will get left behind in the dust while other games take advantage. Heres an analogy. In high school I knew people who played football for a rival school team and the team was awful. It stands to reason the players were awful. I said this to a friend and someone from the other school heard and said dude you dont even play you cant say shit.Like... What? If I watch any sport and one team does poorly while the other kicks ass the other team lost. Theyre literally proven to be worse than the other team. Saying that I cant compare you to the team that you just lost to is the opposite of competition and contradicts the nature of sports. Dont be naive or butthurt because you lost. Same applies to this scenario. Either Jagex steps their marketing game up or their competition will leave them behind to wither in the small player base thats left.,runescape,circ28s,9,t5_2qwxl

Also you didnt say your combat stats but as a general idea for you I would suggest doing the minigame Familiarisation and also killing Waterfiends for crimsons because theyre the best expgp.

1478599,0,t3_2b3uz5,If I may argue in favor of the current design though I do agree you did some very nice work here...The current design looks natural. It is literally pieces of Araxxor the giant spider youre battling for your life against. The stick you mentioned? its not a stick  its Araxxors Leg! That already checks one big box in terms of making weaponry look like its coming naturally from the creature. Combined with the webwoven string  which is more about the unique look than the realism of the design of course  the bow literally looks like something created by defeating Araxxor pieces of his very body fashioned using your skills into a powerful weapon.And while good this doesnt have any of that naturalness. A fancy shaped log fletched into the bow itself some emeralds thrown onto it some string or web wrapped around the grip and random boney looking things around it do not point to spider at all. In fact the only spider piece is the decorative cobwebs stretching from grip to end.Thats not what Id expect to see from a giant spider boss and I commend Jagex for sticking to that core design even if it ends with the weapons not being super flashy.,runescape,cj1m9u5,9,t5_2qwxl

Break them out if they say to break them out otherwise let them Barricade.Zaros phase Pray mage pop Deaths Swiftness or Sunshine and finish her off. Run away when she yells taste my wrath so you dont get caught in the explosion.In between phases range the mages going in a clockwise direction from the entrance. Switch attack styles every kill Nexs wings will change color based on what shell be deflecting that fight same colors as the Kalphite Kings attack phases.Thats a simple guide for group DPS.

Additionally I dont think youve sufficiently justified your rationale for wanting these items untradeable. Surely if you wanted to incentivize people to train these skills youd make the endresult of their efforts Ascension bows for example tradeable so they can turn a profit and turn their skills into an investment with some return. ,runescape,cj6cclz,2,t5_2qwxl

1524800,1,t1_cj7ecgv,Sure I love a good argument.gt The fact that you can freely change that name and that your name doesnt provide any sort of benefit means that it naturally becomes a commodity that can be sold or traded.I dont see how being freely able to change it and it not providing any benefit implies that it is a commodity that can be sold or traded. What is the connection between those things? But I agree its a commodity that can be sold or traded since people regularly do trade and sell account names.gt Unlike botting you cant really detect if someone has sold a name and it would have to be investigated on a cases by case basis meaning it is probably easier to let it occur.Having it against the rules would at least discourage people specifically buyers and prevent them from advertising it publicly. Kind of like RWTing in this regard? It would also be rather trivial to detect which people are hoarding names.gt Is name hoarding really against the spirit of the game? Lets assume there are a finite amount of desirable names there are also a finite amount of party hats I dont think that you could accuse someone who hoards party hats to be against the spirit of the game because they are an investment just like you cant accuse someone who owns a bunch of property of being unfair.What exactly is the spirit of the game? I think doing anything other with gold other than using it for ingame trades is not in the spirit of the game. Its a role playing game exchanging gold for goods fits that. Exchanging gold for display names absolutely does not fit the medieval theme of the game. Im gonna put trading account names in the same list as bonds RWT and scape gold swapping.gt Trust trading is already legal but user discretion is advised such as transferring gtEoc gp so I cant see them banning name selling for this reason.They banned gambling in part because it involved trust trading and a lot of users were getting scammed.,runescape,cj7eskr,1,t5_2qwxl

Also you cant simply change scrimshaws at a whim since you need to deactivate it first then equip your second scrimshaw and then activating it all within the heat of battle.Not intuitive.Overall even if for some reason the current system is intuitive degradebyhit works much better because its more streamlined in use.,runescape,cjfyy7c,1,t5_2qwxl

As long as you pay attention to whats going on its not difficult at all to do. He has another PC since hes using reddit and plays Runescape. I think its safe to assume hes not going to throw it away or scrap it as soon as his parts come in. Its pretty straight forward to diagnose an issue if you have google handy. If youre aware of DOAs and know how to go through an RMA or can google it youre set. People are lazy and thats why you have a job. Theres no reason to encourage someone to avoid doing something simple just because things can go wrong. But helping them understand how to do it properly is a conflict of interest for your livelihood so I can understand why youre making it sound a lot worse than it really is. ,runescape,cjmlvty,1,t5_2qwxl

Youve yet to do that which really this is all about. I did miss the part where you verbally mentioned subtracted the seeds especially when you inserted the part about how the grapes were k profit on top of herbs however you have consistently NOT been subtracting the cost of your seeds when claiming your profit before that and you still arent for your herb profit.Youre ignoring the fact that what you claim is the profit has been wrong from the start. Please I want to hear you were mistaken bc you are. At least I can say I was wrong about the hops and Ill say Im wrong about the time of doing all  and  if it can all be done in mins.Well see. Going to test it right now.However I would never skip planting either marigolds or limps depending on which are more at the time when doing a farm run. The few secs it takes to do so is worth it while already right there. I have done many farm runs. I didnt plant trees past  and did only a handful of warbands. All my farm xp past  over m is from farmbush runs. If you do flowers along with herbs you get done a short time before the juju message come up.

1772385,0,t3_23tl7h,hey Guys thought i would start this post up again. I got banned in  and i think it is a brilliant idea to try resolve the issue of moderators who are somewhat insensitive to banning ones account. I was young and played almost every hour of my weekends and school nights. I invested a lot of time and money to the game which at that point of time really helped me out due to heavy family issues the game offered another world to me which i could be involved in instead of hearing constant arguments in my own. More to the point I was a heavy skiller I wouldnt socialize with friends on the game only on Skype etc.. so my membership ended and went straight to runescrafting in FP because to be honest you dont need a membership to train runecrafting until the xp starts to get heavy. It was at this point where i got my ban... unsure of the reasons as they were not provided to me but seriously shattered and heart broke. It has been  years down the track my maturity has changed and my personality is developing as years passby. If their is any mod out here in the Runescape community who is willing to offer some time for me to provide details. If you wish to PM me in the Runescape message center that would b greatly appreciated also. My account details name was heathy after a few name chnages and ended up changing to the original name for olds sake purposes Hopefully someone can help Thankyou. ,runescape,ck2kbsi,1,t5_2qwxl

It goes much faster than you realize when you tackle an entire series at once.Another great way to tackle them is to decide on a quest which has other quest requirements and then do all of those smaller quests so that you can do the bigger quest.  The more tedious way to do it is to bounce around doing random quests or picking out the easier quests because you dont feel like doing the harderlonger ones.

I was level  or so and was a bit suspicious mainly because he was offering a m stake. I quickly looked him up on swiftkit and most of his stats werent even ranked. I accepted the duel and he made me put up a bit over m worth of money and items because ofthe level difference. I had my abyssal whip out and I was ready to ice this fool when he logged out. I was so mad because it was a guaranteed m. He immediately logged back in and we started the duel. This dude instantly switches into mage gear and starts destroying me with ice barrage. I realise Im screwed and lost most of my wealth. This dude had a second account with the same name except one of the numbers that followed hotdog was changed I was so caught up in the this is too good to be true moment that I didnt even notice.Im not saying its anyone elses fault its  mine because this guy got me with a simple scam.

Someone said it was impossible probably based on the fact that it would take years and years to max all stats without buying anything from other players. The next comment was stating that that was possible and following up on the O.P. that was asking about removing multi player requirements.  So his comment was relevant by virtue of the fact that he was commenting on the exact issue presented by the person in the forums.  He was only adding on to say that the few requirements that they would need to remove only the multi player requirements from the comp cape would be negligible compared to the other daunting and time consuming requirements like  smithing Herblore and prayer just to name a few.Tldr  his post was relevant. ,runescape,ckgydjh,1,t5_2qwxl

Note that work isnt exclusively a paid job but anything that truly challenges you either mentally or physically. I cant imagine any real work that one would be able to truly focus on while simultaneously playing Runescape  it is scientifically known that the brain cannot truly multitask especially whilst performing any highlevel tasks. Read about it and if you honestly think you are an exception then please visit your closest neurological research center because Im sure they would love to study you.Exercise  I suppose this falls into the work category but here I mean exclusively physical activity. I dont know of any way that would allow you to actually exercise properly whilst playing Runescape... No human being can be healthy unless they are physically active. DoH recommend a minimum of  minutes a day.CookingEating  How can you get three decent meals a day when youre only left with two hours? It takes me at least  mins to cook dinner alone. Please dont say ready meals...Socialising  Online interactions do not and cannot replace physical facetoface interactions. There have been studies done if you wish to read up on it.Washing  Doesnt take that long lets say a minimum of  minutes a day.Can you fit all of the above into two hours? Or how many of these can you do whilst playing Runescape? Again please dont spew the multitasking bollocks youre not a machine no matter how hard you believe it to be true.,runescape,ckmvhng,1,t5_2qwxl

So I must have killed about  of them.In those  kills I saw Mithril Hatchets listed as Uncommon Grimy Herbs all three listed as rare Snapdragon Seeds very rare Willow Logs very rareand  Rune Hatchets.Its possible I suppose they still drop it but I dont think its at all worth doing. Probably better off just getting your levels up high enough to kill some DKs for Dragon and work your way to  on MithAddy and mainly daily challenges which give generous Woodcutting xp.

1997007,0,t3_2hlnob,I think the changes are warranted and fine  specifically because of a friend of mine. He has bad lag. Its not something he can help because of his internet access and being forced to solo Araxxor destroys his ability to retain his normal Complitionists Cape. He knows full well he cannot trim until his connectivity can be improved which isnt likely in the near future but has worked hard to earn and keep his normal Comp. With the Araxxor requirement for the Comp Cape already on Soul Reaper he worked with a clanmate to duo the boss successfully to reclaim his cape but he knows he cant solo.Morvrans Challenge completely locking you into a solo breaks his chance and as such I feel like those true challenges especially for those with lesser connections shouldnt be forced on people just for Comp. Comp exists to show that youve maxed your skills complete quests tasks and music and done the basics of the challenges. Trim is going above and beyond that and having to solo the strongest boss is the game is above and beyond.,runescape,cktu8c1,-4,t5_2qwxl

Really gives you lots more room and a cleaner look for such an interface heavy game. I try to keep all of these interface setups as flush as possible with nothing sticking out too much.The One Size Fits All Great for any resolution Designed to have as much screen space as possible. Everything is either on the bottom left or top right with the latter having everything compartmentalized within the ribbon. Features a funny HTML  glitch of a PoP minigame. I suggest unlocking the interface if using this setup.The Laptop Setup Everything important is seen and can be switched out with something else with just one short click on a different tab Messed up on the action bar on this screenshot Works great if locking interfaceThe L Much like the laptop setup above except designed for a x monitor Could work on other resolutions though you may have to the scroll bar visible on some interfaces have a smaller map and more tabs in each compartment. L shape design so the interface can be rotated to suit your preference for example it could be rotated like   or  Huge map size Works great if locking interfaceThe Toss All the Shit to the Side Dual monitors  HTML  Wow factor Super flexible  tons of space  everything visibleDownsides If on Windows most likely have to use AMD eyefinity nVidia equivalent etc to enable applications to stretch between multiple monitors which can be a hassle. Mouse travels much more.

2194666,0,t1_clisnfd,ampampamp Surgery politics sfw gtgtA political surgery in British politics or clinic is a series of onetoone meetings that a Member of Parliament MP may have with his or her constituents at which a constituent may raise issues of local concern. The issues may relate to local issues street crime litter a request for intervention by the MP on behalf of the constituent with local or national government or it could deal with national policy matters.gtIt is up to each MP to decide whether they have any surgeries at all or if so how many and in what locations. MPs often use local party offices church halls or rooms in public houses as the venues with a number of surgeries possibly being held at different locations around a constituency Surgeries are traditionally held on weekends when MPs have returned from sittings of parliament in WestminstergtThe number of such meetings can be influenced by whether an MPs seat is considered safe i.e. in the normal course of events their partys level of support is such that they cannot lose it in a general election or marginal one that can easily be lost. The more marginal the seat the greater the number of surgeries an MP may choose to have. In addition how clientelist a political system is impacts on the need for surgeries. The more clientelist a political system i.e. the more it is based on local representation for constituents as opposed to an MPs participation in national politics the greater the number of surgeries may be required.gtInteresting Ophthalmology | History of intersex surgery | Belfast South byelection  Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwclisnxd oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeleteclisnxd.

A rule of thumb is to hop  island per tier of node.As for which nodes you should be siphoning from you can look up a guide or just test xp rates yourself.

Either it would give bonus xp or offer stats boost. If it was for bonus xp I think it shouldve been the barbarian and gnome course top and bottom though as you already said theyll probably make a TH promotion. If it boosted levels it wouldve been pretty pointless. And in my opinion not every skills needs a expierence boosting outfit.,runescape,clzjre7,5,t5_2qwxl

2358341,0,t3_2mdk1k,gtIs it legal to use? Yep. It just takes snaps of the screen and processes them rather than taking things directly from the client or browser if that makes sense. gtIs it safe for your computer to download and install? Ive been using it for a while now and it seems pretty safe it hasnt triggered any of my several antivirus software. gtWhy is it so handy and good as i read? There is so much it can do! While it is in alpha maybe beta I forget there are hiccups but it works great for so many things. Whos that player? Oh cool instant hiscores. Whats this item? Brings up the wiki page which has the GE and alch prices details on everything. Theres the drop logger and all the other things you can read about but yeah itd be easier to just try it out I reckon. gtWhats the reason? Why do YOU use it? Its just so incredibly easy. Right click something and press alt. Thats all. It works out what youre hovering over and searches the appropriate place. I use it all the time with player lookups out of curiosity and things like the Celtic knot solver which is incredible. I do use it a lot. I have it set up to run on start up and you can use the shoutbox on the runeapps page and talk with skillbert. I also think he has a reddit account but I may be mistaken.

2438545,0,t3_2nezms,Hey White Wolf!I just want to say I commend you on all the screenshots you saved.  As a prior Pmod myself Springish   May  I had thought about doing an AMA during and after but I had nearly nothing ingame saved.  The only things I have are the original k team physical poster and  screenshots of my message centre mail saying Im not a Pmod anymore But I could be in the future again supposedly.I didnt have to go through the dreaded letter confirmation you went through.  It was actually quite easy.  Through MC asked me to be a Pmod I clicked yes and it was there the next morning.  Later on we had to release our reallife details which is how I received the poster with no return address either!I personally had a lot of reports.  I was a total snitch but being a freshmen at the time of when I started playing I wanted to leave anything middleschoolesque behind.  So I reported nearly everything.  That wasnt to say that I didnt help people out but fp quests were totally my bit and I walked about  people through about  quests a piece.I literally celebrated Pmod status by buying my first day membership with  and change through some service with Paypal.I was very detached from the Pmod community so much so that I only knew one other Pmod that I meet in reallife before I knew they even played RS.  I was on casual talking terms with only one Jmod whom of which let me know they were getting transferred to Customer Service days beforehand.  I shot some email back and forth with them a couple times and I guess I could dig those up too but I dont delete my emails...  I dont know if theyre still there.Those chatboxes are almost PTSD worthy.  That was a daily sometimes hourly occurrence.  Some days particularly towards the end of Pmod Id sit at fp Dung and answer peoples questions.During my Pmod status I vowed to never change my username.  Theres only one person on my friends list that knows me by my Pmod name active now.  Another inactive also knows me from then.  Now Im Nulunas which I wanted to change to that back in  when I started using it over my old since  user name.  Runescape is still the only thing I log into with that old name.I reached Pmodship with a combat level of  and my skill total was ish.  It ended with  skill total.  Im now maxed with  Dung and can totally vouch that being actually being a Pmod soaks up a lot of your time.  Not to say the YT  Twitch personalities arent but I dont think theyre setting aside days to help people ingame casebycase.Sorry for ambiguity but some details are better left unsaid.  Id rather not my old username antihack  Id rather not be referred to as.  Id rather not out the Jmod personal email is rather unprofessional through business and if still there could receive repercussions from about  years back.  I might scan the old poster sometime and post it on Reddit.  shrugs,runescape,cmd3yio,3,t5_2qwxl

2522488,0,t3_2ojo2w,I have mixed feelings on this.  No matter how long its been owning up to your mistakes and trying to amend the damage is always worth it.  But doing it in the name of a religion rather than because its the right thing to do and you regret it?  It just feels hollow like hes doing it because he fears the repercussions and not because he regrets it.This incident aside weve all screwed up some of us worse than others.  Weve let friendships fall apart or weve taken the quick buck over the right thing to do or maybe weve just looked the other way when others were doing bad things.  Its O.K. to make mistakes but its important to learn from them and not repeat those mistakes.,runescape,cmntrso,26,t5_2qwxl

2528861,0,t3_2olv8e,Hey Suomi nice to see you posting here. Many years ago I got  smithing th person in the game I believe when rune armour was only bested by Barrows.  Needless to say making Rune Platebodies was excellent money.  I would make full addy armour and give it to people near Varrock bank walking around in full mith or steel.   Some people would say I cant wear that.   Id tell them that now they have a target to shoot for.  It was pretty cool making peoples day.  Other people would ask for more and hound me that was kinda sad.  But for the most part I think I made a bunch of new people very happy.  Nowadays its difficult to do the same because I dont see that many new bodies.  I should go back to my old training grounds like the willows south of draynor bank.  Im just afraid every old training area is empty because of afk training and minigames....,runescape,cmonpfc,1,t5_2qwxl

2541126,0,t3_2ot1jg,From the wikigtThe damage bonus from Power armour exists as Strength Bonus Ranged Bonus and Magic Bonus  the same bonuses as on jewellery. They are added to the players mainhand damage bonus if they match the class of the wielded weapon. For example if one wields an abyssal whip the Strength Bonus from Bandos armour would affect their damage and the Ranged Bonus from Armadyl armour would not.gtShould an offhand be wielded  of any damage bonus will also be added to the offhand slot. If a twohanded weapon is wielded the mainhand slot receives this  bonus.gtThe damage bonuses from Power armour scale with the level of the armour. A full set provides an approximate  increase to a weapons damage assuming the armour and weapon are of equal level. Should a Fast or Average speed weapon be wielded any damage bonuses will be multiplied to compensate for the players larger damage stat. Hope that helps.,runescape,cmq9fku,1,t5_2qwxl

2603605,0,t1_cmyfbyy,I use Dragonbane bolts most of the time.Bane bolts are a little bit awkward  they modify your ability damage.Ability damage is based on the ammo and level tier of the weapon.So what happens is that even though Dragonbane bolts technically have tier  or so damage against dragons they are considered to be level  bolts first. This means that regardless of whether I use a level  crossbow or a level  crossbow no such thing but... the outgoing damage is the same even if accuracy isnt.As far as accuracy is concerned only the mainhand weapon matters. I lose a bit of damage while if Im using Ascension Bolts and a lowleveled offhand crossbow but its still slightly greater than Dragonbane bolts. I use the ammo switch when the dragon crystallizes.I did a somewhatawkward writeup here  if you want more info. Long story short offhand crossbows didnt help my Dragonbane damage.,runescape,cmyfg0u,5,t5_2qwxl

Id bet my own account and my life on it did not bot got hit with this macro ban bullshit and a Jmod just flat out says that all botwatch bans are  perfect. Its also sad and hilarious the way the rrunescape community turned on a time when an official response admitted to only one mistake manual applied ban and kind of promised better CS well its a lack of critical thought that the rest of reddit tends to be known to do.Ive tried to be understanding with jagex for a lot of their iffy choices  theyve made through the years but the way that they handled this I know im just a drop in the bucket etc but this has me seriously considering going to another MMO one that has better customer support for one. Its one of those situations that no one ever thinks itd happen to them or someone super close to them so they assume that the ones in charge are all correct. ,runescape,cn06v9o,1,t5_2qwxl

Tell me why do we need this feature? Even without it in you can see what raressuper rares you can win with every key directly in the TH interface.rant  First when Jagex introduced microtransactions I was against them but after a bit I ignored it hey its just small xp boosts that would cost a fortune to  all skills.  Then they started pushing SoFTHexclusive items that gave you permanent advantages  again I was against them but after a bit I ignored it hey the advantages are not THAT big.  Then they introduced THexclusive items making a gamechanging difference Silverhawk boots Spring cleaner .... At that point I stopped having fun playing RS. You can look at my flair and guess which item was my last straw.  I havent played RS much until Ironman mode came out and I play it ONLY because it has  microtransactions technically premiere memb is a thing but ... I dont care. The day they introduce Ironman microtransactions is the day I quit even if they start with something small. I know sooner or later the small thing gets bigger until its no longer possible to ignore.  rant,runescape,cn44g7k,17,t5_2qwxl

2719991,0,t3_2r7vl6,So I decided to fight Nex with some friends when suddenly my RS client shutsdown itself in a middle of a kill when I logged in again I was at Nex lobby. Apparently I didnt lost my portant of life and it seems I was instantly kicked out of the fight.Every now and then whenever I try to go trough Nexs barrier this happens and Im unable to start a fight by my own only when a friend or someone decide to open the barrier and while it is open is possible for me to proceed when it closes there is only that examine option.Everytime I go to Nex the clients shutsdown itself only there. Ive already submitted a bug report but I wonder if someone had any clues about this.This is probably not related but there was a glitch that happened to me some days ago a friend of me decided to use the yakcard team with  people in a large dungeon but I was not able to see the recipes no matter what I did I couldnt pick it up as I was blind? I checked with the elf and I still have  recipes left.,runescape,cnd921x,2,t5_2qwxl

2724372,0,t3_2r9k59,I have a friend from high school who recently started playing again. Im combat  hes around combat . And hes a huuuuuuge noob. His best stat is in the mid s and he doesnt even have Piety yet. He has tons of quests to do.We did a lot of coop slayer. One reason being because I wanted a Freezy pet. Another to get him used to the new combat system because he ultimately wanted to boss with me. I gave him some tips about ability rotations gear suggestions and skill goals to reach before the higher level PvM.He has a LOT of work to do. But hes enjoying his time back because he has somebody to help him and talk dodo stuff with. If you find somebody to help you you will have a great time playing regardless of your current progress in the game.I would suggest giving the game a try again. Especially since all those elitist assholes have moved over to the Elf City. If you PM me your IGN and stats I could make some recommendations and try to tell you what kind of experience youd have before you paid anything for membership. But regardless of what anybody says I would recommend you pay at least one month of membership to see for yourself how you like the game.,runescape,cndr047,1,t5_2qwxl

Obviously theres no need to waste time mentioning niche accounts that limit themselves otherwise wed have to do this for almost every single item andor training method.Even if you camped a good monster such as Waterfiends you still wouldnt need any spirit gems so its not just Slayer. Ive already explained why they were stupid and lying they never specified niche accounts I look to make no friends with people like these have no fear I have plenty of friends who wouldnt argue because  uses an item or method wed still generally rule it off as useless because most people do play a Main account Runescape experience. Summoning is a byproduct skill its almost as easy to train as HP. Get  in combat stats in almost any nonidiotic way and youll get  Summoning way before youre finished with combat skills this is without using any form of BXP. Obviously if you limit yourself then thats not my problem I speak for the vast majority because those are the people who will even bother to read my advice. Obviously niche accounts and players who limit themselves wont read it so theres no need to talk about it they know what to do already.,runescape,cne8aio,-7,t5_2qwxl

2842639,0,t1_cnr6dp9,When you use a Magic attack and it doesnt hit anything its called splashing. On Old School RuneScape this actually grants you a small amount of experience without hitting anything. If your Magic attack bonus is  or lower you can get this by wearing a full set of metal armour along with vambraces and you use a Magic attack it will always splash. A lot of players on Old School RuneScape abuse this by getting a Magic attack bonus of  or lower while wearing a smoke battlestaff and using lots of mind runes theyre only  gp each chaos runes are also commonly used to attack splash a monster that is incapable of hitting anything on you like chickens. This is most commonly done on PvP worlds because you cant get a random event on those worlds. This means that people can splash for  hours straight completely afk mind you to get Magic experience fire strike splashes grant . gp each and only cost you one mind rune each so about  gp.This has been quite a controversial topic on Old School RuneScape for the past couple of months.Also this cant be done on RuneScape  because you only get experience when the target monster is killed.,runescape,cnr7ff5,8,t5_2qwxl

2906763,0,t1_cnygspo,I strongly disagree. I despise the way quests are treated in all mmos minus RS. Theyre all fetch quests with meaningless rewards with no impact on the world. Gating content behind quests is one way to make you appreciate the rewards.  Short story of mine on my main account Ive done Plagues End the day of release. Later down the line Prifddinas got released I had access to it from start and while the city looked amazing ... I wasnt really having fun with the content having it for granted. Fastforward to  days ago Ive unlocked Elf City on my ironman. It felt great! I love the city so much and I loved the whole journey to get there.If youre PvMfocused you dont really have to do many quests. Most endgame bosses are available from the start quests just make getting to them easiersafer.   If youre skillingfocused ... quests are good for leveling up? Assuming you do them the moment you meet minimum requirements many quests recompensate the time it took to beat them with hefty chunks of xp. However if you decide to do some novice quests after maxing ... what do you expect?  If youre PvP focused ... do quests even matter? I mean ancient curses magicks and the digsite abilities maybe but other than that? You can buy and wield t weaponry without any quest whatsoever.,runescape,cnyi7ut,6,t5_2qwxl

So Drygores with Berserk and a DestroySlaughterAssaultTendril combo would the best dps in the game. Ranged also has its uses for things like QBD RoTS and KK mage phase. As for Slayer you should switch styles for specific monster anyway. Drygores for Airuts Ascs or Nox for Dark BeastsCelestials etc..TLDR They all have their uses and strong points making them almost equal.,runescape,cnyuys4,1,t5_2qwxl

2914347,0,t1_cnzc8ou,In your character stats the mage defensive style bonus cannot be the highest. Easiest way to obtain this when ranging is melee gear. If youre using t gear you usually need helmbootsgloves for the first two phases. I believe you can get away with superior tetsu helm and pneumatic gloves in sirenicpernix boots iircIn void you can get away with melee boots bandos or higher so that your range style bonus is equal or greater to mage.You should note these style bonuses are only important for phase . You should bring gear switches for blood and beyond.If you have more questions feel free to ask away.,runescape,cnzdahm,1,t5_2qwxl

Once attached to the previous weapons you will no longer need to recharge using a drop from the wyrms.  They are recharged byt simply adding an abbyssal whip dark bow or staff of light.This is an items sink and will hopefully work well to increase the value of high level slayer monster drops.Also I dont think there is any plans for new T weapons in the near future.,runescape,condw4n,2,t5_2qwxl

3164214,0,t1_copyiuo,Sensing a common theme here. Going for a  minute walk each day is clinically proven to help treat depressionThat being said if youre already exercising you need to focus on other interests. Every possible word of advice anyone can give you is going to revolve around cutting back on Runescape to pursue more meaningful interests. Try signing up for Tinder or join an MMA class if you havent already. The bottom line is Runescape is going to fill the void in your life less and less than it already does and you need to distance yourself from it. A gambler thinks winning will make them feel better. A druggie thinks more drugs will drive the pain away. Runescapers think comping will make them feel like they achieved something.Yet wed do none of that if we were balls rich and successful and happy. Find something better to do or continue being upset.

3217335,0,t3_2wzb68,RNGesus disapproves. But seriously even if they increase the odds of getting your last piece it would also be as hard as it is now.Items like spring cleaner and silverhawk boots which alot of people want are good examples. Unless they make it a promotion specially for those items your odds of winning it is very low due to the amount of red gemsrare items available in one set of possible rewards let alone the chance of it being in the possible red gemsrare items reward. Assuming if you have that last piece of item in one of the red gemrare item as possible reward you still need to have the luck to get a red gemrare item it could be  try or  tries depending on your luck with RNG.Note I do support that idea because it could help me get certain skiller sets faster.,runescape,covh8ge,1,t5_2qwxl

Nomad also said he would fight us in the future why would I give my future enemy a power boost?Sided with Zamorak Similar to you OP Im with Bandos and Saradomin so I didnt really wanna help a rival god but after that moment where he beat the shit out of Nomad I got mad respect. Sliske had tried to kill me multiple times Missing Presumed Death and Dishonour Among Thieves and indirectly killed Bandos so I figured it was time for a bit of revenge.I somewhat regret joining forces with the God of Dark Fire as I would still prefer to have the stone given to Saradomin but whatever.Something that really bothered me about the quest I had completed FOTG how come I had to enter the Shadow Realm to see Sliske Palkeera the Vaults orbs and the Stone seeing as how I can see into the Shadow Realm oO,runescape,covyune,2,t5_2qwxl

Why wouldnt you try to abuse to get ahead when at most youll just lose the xp that you abused? That is basically the mentality with a lot of high level players right now if you find something thats a bug which gives a generous advantage you should abuse it until it is patched and hopefully there will be no punishments which is often the case. Merely rolling back that xp even with the you will be banned in the future threat does not make it harsh enough. There should not be a tolerance. Players know exactly what they are doing when they abuse these methods. Do I think these players should be banned? No. Should they lose their ironman status? Absolutely.,runescape,cowa85b,6,t5_2qwxl

Also it will reduce the amount of time it takes for a person to take down a boss on the first attempt. Its similar to a problem in WoW right now everyone wants raids to take months for the top tier of players but not take years to complete for the lower ranked guilds. It should be fairly similar no matter your skill level so as to not discourage low levels but not disappoint high levels. How do you best do that?

3387626,0,t3_2ykdck,Oh wow  I created an account just to share this as it still hurts me to this day.  I was maybe  years old and it was Halloween of  I think?  I was upset with my parents because we had to go out and I wanted to stay home to collect the rare item drop for that year.  Needless to say by the time we got home it was late at night Australian time and I rushed straight to the computer and dialedup the internet.  Logged into whatever world I always used to play on I happened to be in Falador and started a frantic search for any left over rare drops.  Eventually I noticed that there were crowds of people following around the lucky few that had managed to get the Halloween mask and of course I was pissed because I missed the event. Then it hit me  what if I logged into the underpopulated worlds and went somewhere that no one else had thought to look?I logged into a world which had hardly anyone on it and walked to Varrock and then up into the wilderness.  This was quite an achievement for me because I was only a relatively low level maybe ? and hated the wilderness from being scammed there at the mosshill? giant bridge and losing my steel armour.I kept one eye on the minimap watching for hostile approaching white dots and the other looking for red item dots.  First red dot was a standard few gp on the ground but it didnt take long until I found my first red Halloween mask.  Going further into the wilderness I was freaking out because it was the most expensive item I had ever held and I was going through the wilderness with it!  Not long after this I scooped up a further two blue Halloween masks and decided to track back through the wilderness as fast as possible but on a slight curve holding my  Halloween masks tightly.  Going back through the wilderness I managed to scoop up another  red Halloween masks. Frantically rushing I finally made it to the end of the wilderness with my coveted prizes still in my inventory.  I couldnt believe my luck  Halloween masks although none of them green which was my favourite colour!To keep a long story short I was young and didnt realise the full value of the items I had managed to acquire and gave a blue mask to my older brother sold the other blue to someone for some mithril items who kept pressuring me to sell it to him constantly messaging me and following me gave two of the red masks to friends for their respective birthdays and I cant remember what happened to the other red all I know is I dont have it now.  I quit not long after and came back after about  years and couldnt believe how much those items had appreciated although its not surprising given how rare they are I guess. The masks I gave away I am alright with but that one guy that pressured me to sell him the mask I still get angry about now!boldTLDR  found numerous red and blue Halloween masks current value m and sold themgave them away for a pittance.bold,runescape,cpef05x,2,t5_2qwxl

3388545,0,t1_cpee931,It essentially breaks down alchable drops into either bonus XP or its base supplies. For example a Rune Platebody would give either Smithing BXP or  Runite Ore and  ? Coal. The kicker here is the resources obtained from the breaking down of the item are automatically sent to your bank.The physical item dropped is destroyed in the process which cleans up a lot of junk on the floor during Slayer for example.Edit sp,runescape,cpeirp3,1,t5_2qwxl

Maybe Im shit! haha The general strategy when meleeing for me is to just tank most of the hits.

When those gloves came out they were fine because most of the tiers hadnt been filled in but it would have been hard for them to really give out anything thats useful without devaluing something else.The quests are there to be enjoyed. Theyre not all going to lead to great exp or new gear. The overrides and pets will be used even if not by everyone. Whats great about petsoverrides is they give you more choices not everyone has to use them for them to be a great reward.I think the quest was enjoyable regardless of a useful reward. Exp is everywhere and there is plenty of other content to get gear from. Quests arent really supposed to be great exp or massively useful rewards although every once in a while they are so if you go into one expecting it or its the only way youll enjoy it then youre setting yourself up to be let down.,runescape,cpoogwc,2,t5_2qwxl

3479098,0,t1_cpotsh2,Its not dead they are not reviving it its about consistency. Let me explain you little fella. Back in the old days when runescape was created they didnt expect much of it rune was the highest tier thus it required the highest level to be smithed magic bows required a decently high level to be created and so on. Somehow runescape went over those expectations and new content was added but they never thought of reworking the requirements for that armour. When the quest while guthix sleeps was released we faced the first problem  smith for tier dragon plate smithing and  smith to make  a rune plate as we know dragongtrune and required less levels.  Now you know we always get new skills lastly we got divination which was to be followed by inventor but due to the lack of consistency on the old skills for the new times it was paused and possibly scrapped to get things right  making rune smithing lower level than a dragon plate or tetsu etc.  Also not everyone cares for s i rather comp before working on s for example so do many players others just want to get s and max  and for those maxing itself its a huge grind expanding the grind to  will just kill them.Also making all the skills an actual  would kill so many compers as they would need to get all the s  before recomping even if they added it from parts it would be such a hassle. If you want to grind every single skill to  go ahead do it if you find it fun. I know some people who does. Also if they were to raise skills to  then they should raise them to  which is m xp in the skill and only under  players have m in every skill. Personally i like how jagex is thinking giving consistency to the old skills and then heading back to adding new skills which will have new content and will work together with the other skills.,runescape,cpoucjz,2,t5_2qwxl

Access to this dungeon requires  Dungeoneering. Players are able to put their arm into the maw and remove treasure once per day. Rewards include a range of items some of which can be useful in helping players complete requirements for the regular and trimmed Completionist cape. Rewards received are weighted towards requirements which have not been completed by the player. Once per day in exchange for  motherlode shards Wythien will give the player rewards similar to those given by the Maw.,runescape,cpxq0cd,4,t5_2qwxl

3559314,0,t3_312khu,If youre not already familiar with it the fanwiki for RuneScape is quite good and has a lot of information.Dungeoneering  Sinkholes is the main DampD to do for Dungeoneering and can help you along your way to higher levels. Rushing lower level floors e.g. by generally ignoring collecting resources and fighting enemies can help you get more dungeoneering xp per hour though the later floors offer enough xp to stretch out in solo mediums or teamed large dungeons. Dungeoneering daily challenges offer some pretty absurdly good xp rewards for not much effort and Id recommend extending them with vis wax too to double your xp.Agility  There is the silverhawk boot route but thats not available to everyone and is quite expensive to boot. The Flash Powder Factory minigame offers a bit of xp if you dont want to do agility directly through any of the courses. The Surefooted aura might be a good investment to help avoid failing obstacles for whatever course you choose.Construction Herblore and Mining can all be boosted by Wilderness Warbands if you get the relevant supplies. Mining is timelimited compared to Herblore and Construction being moneylimited so it might make sense to go for Mining over others when you have the choice.Construction  Primarily a moneysink skill so there is little opportunity to avoid that. However using cheaper materials could save you some gold and using a butler for retrieving planks could save you time. You could also move your house portal to an area near a bank like the Taverly house portal that is near a bank south of the portal.Prayer  Some bones or ashes are cheaper gold per xp than others so you could look into those options. Primarily though one of the most reasonable options preElf City IMO is using gilded altars to get xp a bit lower than Ectofuntus but that is much faster than it. Youll either have to level your Construction up to the point where you can build a gilded altar or try to find an open gilded altar server.Crafting  Cutting gems is very fast but very expensive. Making dragonhide armour is a balance between expensive and fastish though you can procure your own hides from combat if you wish. Urns are slow xp but are profitable.Mining  Higher level ores give more xp per ore but are mined much slower. Sticking to mining iron or coal ore will probably be your fastest option until you can start making use of the Living Rock Caverns.Herblore  Cleaning grimy herbs is slow xp but actually profitable rather than the moneysink potions. However if you farm your own herbs or get them from combat or wherever you can actually make a slight profit by buying the secondary ingredients to mix in to your unfinished potions.,runescape,cpxzjbl,10,t5_2qwxl
3559561,0,t1_cpy05dt,Mostly because I can still profit off of frosts from their secondary drops and theyre fast kills with a good exp yield plus the bonecrusher will give me decent prayer exp on the side and the abundance of green charms compared to spending hundreds of millions on chins. ,runescape,cpy0jwk,1,t5_2qwxl

3704393,0,t1_cqeij2y,Alright. Lets use some imaginary numbers to come to some sort of compromise. More players want cosmetics and more players dont care either way than players who dont want cosmetics. For a variety of reasons for each party the anticosmetics crowd are not only the minority they also havent been around long enough and offer no financial incentive for Jagex to cater to.There is no decision anyone can make ever that doesnt have a negative effect on one party or another unless something is offered to make restitution. Id love some cosmetic enabled safe PVP minigames enabled on some worlds and Im sure others would too. But then Jagex would either need to make a new server or take over a different server which is a negative to the company or the playerbase.So this transaction offers us nothing. The only reason people do anything in this game is to show off. Youre taking that away from people simply because you dont like a certain thing because youre pretending youre somehow important in the overall playing scheme by asserting your opinion on how the game should be run matters when it doesnt.Therefore all possible actions come out to a negative whether it be appeasing both parties or just one party. Im guessing enabling cosmetic dangerous pvp is out of the questions as well. So the best action to take is no action and if you dont like seeing cosmetics I would recommend logging out.,runescape,cqeixmn,-1,t5_2qwxl

3723872,0,t3_331ptw,Recently Ive decided to come back to runescape after around a  year hiatus. Throughout this time of not touching the game there has been quite a few updates and the one I was most interested in was the addition of the QBD. So I am coming to you I would love to receive the  mil to help me on my way to  summoning to fight the QBD as well as training my herblore.  summoning will be achieved through pyrelords and will cost approximately  coins for the shards as I will need  pouches leaving me with around .mil to invest into training herblore. From  My current herblore level to  it will cost me around .mil making Super attack potions. This will leave me with around . mil. This .mil coins is currently undecided as to what I will do with it however I believe I will use it to train my prayer as it will let me purchase around  dragon bones. This will boost me to  prayer from  assuming all were used on a gilded alter with both burners lit. This will give me an amazing boost on the way towards fighting the QBD assuming I get all my gear myself. If you would like to check my math or total level my rsn is Rnoney.

3725932,0,t1_cqgz3cl,gtYouve experienced such a small portion of slayer . from . There are boss tasks and harder enemies later on in the skill. RuneScape is based around grinding out completing repetitive tasks content to access the next best thing.Im glad there are harder enemies down the road as well as bosses thats a welcome relief. However I still think there is still a massive problem with slayer from at least  my current levelgtThere is a system where you can setup your preferred tasks and block tasks from being assigned completion of Smoking Kills you will never have full control over your slayer assignments though exception use slayer points to skip tasks.Ill give this preferred system a look  but I dont think it will resolve my current issues. Thanks for telling me about this.gtAll skills in RuneScape are going to be doing the same things over and over. Click objectitemnpc X perform action A wait time T repeat until the goal has been achieved.I understand runescape is about grinding and I dont have a problem with that. My problem lies in lower leveled slayer where the grinding is not creative and boring.To me introducing better rewards a wider variety of progressively harder enemies with occasional bosses as well as the other suggestions I gave would make the grinding infinitely more enjoyable.The current system of low leveled slayer where you face grotworms then fire mages only to go back to grotworms again is unfulfilling  and seems lazy to me. With proper effort and creativity grinding can be much more fun.,runescape,cqgzcmn,2,t5_2qwxl

First  or  kills went fine but then I started lagging badly midkill so I commenced plan B and tried tabbing out. I had to watch my sign of death get popped while I was furiously tapping the teletab but I just got kicked out with less than k HP left. I wasnt able to log back in and I remembered that when you die on corp you dont get a gravestone. At this point I was sure that I just got DDOSed for my brand new torvas.After about  tried I got back in and looted my stuff.

I didnt know that was a thing. But the problem where it loads your window in the wrong dimensions is real. It will be off by a pixel or two which will translate to a big difference.Say I set up my inventory to be the minimum size so that it will display all my inventory without having to scroll. If its perfect down to the pixel if it loads even slightly off my inventory is messed up. That is a common problem and I did not know there was an easy solution to it loading wrong.

3918499,0,t1_cr2x7ay,A long time ago in a galaxy quite far away Seren was created by Mah an Elder God. Mah didnt want Seren to be alone so she created Zaros a being of Shadow and Purpleness. And to force a connection between them Mah used her magic to make sure that Seren and Zaros would forever be attracted. But being set up by your mum is never romantic so Seren and Zaros parted ways.Seren went wandering and discovered Tarddiad where she first met the Elves. The bond she once shared with Zaros was now shared with the Elves who loved and worshiped her as their god.Guthix came to Tarddiad through a Stargate and invited Seren and her elves to Gielinor. Here they lived in peace Guthix fell asleep and a bunch of gods ruined the neighbourhood. Their squabbling caused Guthix to wake up and he had no choice but to banish all of them including Seren.But Seren wouldnt leave her elves she feared that theyd die without her so she shattered herself into thousands of crystal pieces. The elves did what anyone in mourning would do they built a city out of her body parts.Without her leadership the elf clans descended into war. The goodnatured elves reverted Prifddinas into crystal seed so that the dark elves couldnt have it for what felt like ten whole years. Now an adventurers regrown the city and stopped the war. The elves united and are looking to unite Seren. But what will she be like after hundreds of years split into pieces? How will she react to the gods in the world the awakening of Mah and the return of Zaros? DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN!,runescape,cr2y0wa,9,t5_2qwxl

Solomons store is a realmoney store  with what other MMOs have for example WoW has its Blizzard store that you can buy mountspets and other things of that category. Solomons is the same however Bonds can be redeemed for Runecoins  which for me is completely huge. Its not often the game had paid features which can be completely ignored via playtopay mechanics. You can fund your membership buy that silly drake pet from the store and fuel treasure hunter for that skilling set  all through ingame currency. Instead of the other games only being able to support the membership part.This is why the bond system earned a lot of respect towards Jagex for me.

3972956,0,t1_cr94a1y,Ascensions give you slightly higher DPS because of the ability Unload Dual Wield.  Ascensions has the ability  Needle Shot which makes Ascensions do slightly more damage but nothing huge.   Ascensions have the added bonus of swapping a Shield while still keeping up DPS which can be extremely useful at Araxxor because you use a lot of defensive abilities.  In short Ascensions provide slightly more damage but lacks mobility.Noxious Bow has farther range than Ascensions so its x more useful at Queen Black Dragon and Kalphite King.Noxious Bow has dazing shot which is useful at bosses like Araxxor because you are tanking not just dealing damage.Noxious Bow will not take up an extra slot making weapon swapping for hybridding easier for bosses like Nex Queen Black Dragon Kalphite King.  Noxious Bow lacks slightly less damage but has far increased survivability and utility. You can still use Shields alongside Nox Bow just slightly less added effects.The choice is yours. Find what suits you best.As for Siesmics and Noxious Staff I dont know too much. However I do know that the most efficient Vorago farmers use Siesmics  of the time over Noxious Staff. Not to take anything away from Noxious Staff it does more damage than Siesmics but for Vorago it is necessary for players to tank up. In essence they can do damage  use their Arcane Spirit Shields to take less damage while still dealing a hefty amount.,runescape,cr95f0g,3,t5_2qwxl

4202652,0,t3_38zlo8,Hi Gokeio. We take rule breaking very seriously and have a team of dedicated professionals who work hard to stop these types of offences. Abuse reports for Macroing and Bug Abuse send substantial records of the reported players ingame actions to Jagex for further investigation.Reports for macroing are generally not investigated individually but instead are added to a heat map which Jagex watches closely to find botted locations and monitor them over time. Jagex uses these reports to help them develop systemswide solutions to eliminating groups of bots all at once via Botany Bay. This can take some time so dont expect your macroing reports to be looked at within a day or even a week.If you report someone for bug abuse you will be asked if you want to submit a bug report. Doing so is a good idea since it will allow you to further explain what portion of the game is being abused.Thanks for bringing this to our attention and we will carry on working hard to track these offenders. Have a great day ModHawx,runescape,crzaksu,1,t5_2qwxl

4242691,0,t1_cs3u9iz,Well Chaotics are still T so you wont experience a massive difference in getting the mainhand rapier only slightly better accuracy because of Frosts being weak to Stab attacks. But if you can stand to DG Id destroy the mainhand long and get dual Chaotic Rapiers. But as I said it should still be find with a MHlong and OHrapier.I cant think of any other offhand stabbing weapon that could replace the OHrapier if you decided to destroy both for a MHrapier. So just keep it the way you have it now or get another k DG tokens destroy your MHL and get a MHR p,runescape,cs3uwew,1,t5_2qwxl

4452760,0,t1_csrpecf,Sorry for the late reply. The problem that I personally have with kk is that theres no predictability to what attack hell do next. Every time you stun kk he skips an attack in his rotation. So when youre in a trio its hard to ever know whats coming next because of that. That means that you have to watch how long you let your asphyxiatedestroyrapid fire abilities run. Youre not allowed to use certain abilities altogether because they cause him to start healing from every attack you do to him instead of taking damage. Its very obnoxious the way a team is punished for trying to do dps when thats the point of the boss.On the other hand bosses such as Nex Vorago and Araxxor all made by Chris L are all predictable. There is no need to cut abilities short. You know whats coming next every time nex says something. You know that after every reflect on phase  at vorago there will be a red bomb sent out for you to prepare for. Every  attacks that araxxor does will always be a special so you can prepare for it by using anticipation or freedom. ,runescape,csrydi9,1,t5_2qwxl

4512851,0,t1_cszgmen,My statement was directed at the fact that EoC was released too early for its own good and fit perfectly well within context so I dont see how you would can even say it was a stupid statement.. Yes Assault with a h does  hits the animation does only  swings however. Yes Assault with dual wield hits  times the animation only shows  swings however. This is a problem and youre choosing to ignore it. Especially in a game thats trying to promote its PvP reading an enemys animations is pretty important in any given MMO thats like me playing Guild Wars  but the enemy only uses  animation for all their skills its bad and you cant react to anything properly.   oh hes done swinging looks like I dont need to eat that shar damn    You also say you can activate an ability right after the assault animation ends. Assault will still do all four hits. No this isnt a good thing at all it only adds to the problem.  NXT is a massive project requiring a lot of dev time and so would the tick system I agree which is why something that big should have been worked on as early as possible instead of adding to the pile of code to rewrite. By wanting them done at the same time doesnt mean I thought they were connected at all I just found that the situation called for them being worked on at the same time simple as that.,runescape,cszhq0t,3,t5_2qwxl

4532387,0,t3_3d51uf,They said they can do it but it would be a very large job and take anywhere from  months.  I still think they are wrong though. If enough players want it like we do they should make it a priority. If they do not have the staff to do it in a reasonable amount of time hire more people for a temporary length of time. For the remainder of this post I will assume they would drop the tickrate from ms to ms x like used in most MMOs.A lot of animations and weapon speed things can be automated. Each weapon has a predefined attack speed. Something like a whip would have a speed of  which is . seconds between attacks. If they lowered the rate they could write a script to go through items and multiply this field by  which would make it have the same delay with the new tick speed. Instead of waiting  game ticks your character would wait  before attacking something.I assume they have a function which is something like delaytickCount or pauseyieldtickCount which tells the game to wait for a certain amount of ticks before progressing to a block of code.  If they wanted to really shorten the workload they could deprecate the use of that function Basically leave it in the scripting API but warn those in the future to use the newer function create a new function which delays things using the new tick rate and within the intermediatecode generation of the scripting language compiler add an instruction to multiply the value of the deprecated function to equate out to the new tick rate. This means everything would scale on older code to work with a newer tick system.The larger part of the job would be QA testing. Every boss monster and weapon in the game would need to be tested. All quest triggers that go by time would need to be tested. Path finding would need to be checked to make sure that it doesnt break. Bosses would need to be checked for balancing issues as players could better avoid their attacks QBD firewall as an example is annoying to dodge with any sort of latency. PvP would probably need a complete probing too.Another issue is how well things will perform with the servers. Currently they run two or three game worlds and multiple shard instances on a physical server. Since the logic routine of each world will be running  times faster they would probably need to resort to a world per server like other games do.I dont think it would take a year like they have said rather maybe  months at most three months if they recruit some dedicated staff who work on nothing but reducing the tick rate.,runescape,ct1xwu7,3,t5_2qwxl

4584176,0,t1_ct83vnr,The reason that you get multiple runes per essence is twofold It keeps that rune somewhat relevant at higher levels and Higher level spells require more and more lowerleveled runes and they are consumed at a very high rateYour idea would be better if for example it required multiple logs for one shortbow scaling with tier of bow made but that is not the case. If you got more than one log per cut the price of logs would dramatically drop because the items made only require one still. These items also arent consumable unless youre making arrow shafts which... who makes arrow shafts out of elder logs?It also doesnt help that you are comparing apples to oranges as rc is an artisan skill and wc is a gathering skill. The items made from woodcutting and smithing are meant to be a oneoff as youd only need them once where rc is something that is consumed. And because youll inevitably say that arrows are made with fletching and smithing those are made in multiples of  for darts and bolts and  for arrows.,runescape,ct8fpzz,2,t5_2qwxl

It has potential to be more profitable if you limit how many brew flasks used on your trips as they are ridiculously expensive. Not much profit maybe somewhere in the realm of two million gp per hour accounting for no leg pieces or weapon pieces.The leg pieces and the weapon pieces up that amount significantly. Assuming  leg per  kills thats . million gp income per kill excluding standard drops.

Thus the brawler demon positions itself in the center of box and hit most of the demons with ring of fire as opposed to standing away from the box with ranged attacks.The main feature of these demons is the ring of fire scrolls not the ability to attack a target.You can see the brawler demon in action edit uEgotisticalRainbowalso uMrGW this is an example.,runescape,ctlkhsz,5,t5_2qwxl

4832333,0,t1_cu3mp55,Although the bracelets effect is not the most amazing especially since damage reflected is reduced to  if the initial hit to reflectimmune foes and a  chance of activating on an incoming attack it still means eextra DPS even if it is small.It also helps for bosses that are advantageous to hybrid at such as Nex KK and so on. This means potentially  or  saved inventory slots no annoying armor switches for your gloveslot and slightly more potential DPS than power gloves.Although I say this if you are not going to do bossing or if you will be sticking almost exclusively to  style then getting Power Gloves andor a different Hydrix item may be more worth your time.The Ring of Death is extremely useful making deaths safe outside of  charge being lost but also by making PvM where you kill many foes very rewarding in that you receive adrenaline up to  per kill based on the dead monsters total HP.

These are usually set up by idiots who have no idea how dangerous a keylogger can be to the hacker themselves.

4839033,0,t3_3h5v5q,You definitely need to train your defense up some in EOC it is quite important to have balanced combat stats. Without a higher defense level you wont be able to wear good armors. With that said one of the easiest things to get into is Slayer. Im not sure what combat level you are but find the master closest to your combat level and get to it! When youre not slaying you could take the time to train up your skills and quest. Quests unlock a lot of things and having a long term goal of finishing them all or at least Plagues End a high level grandmaster quest that unlocks the city of Priffindas will give you both short and long term goals to keep you motivated.

4870324,0,t3_3hkx9v,This is my rotation with nox staff. Use one threshold and basics on the glacor. When glacites appear target the enduring with combust. Run back a few steps this way you can do more damage on the enduring because the farther it is from the glacor the lower its defense. Then use chain which will damage the other two galcites too. Then concentrated blast. If the enduring is still alive use another basic or two. The key here is to never cast dragon breath when the enduring is still alive. After the enduring is dead dragon breath the other two and finish them off with basics. Then use your other threshold along with some basics to finish off the glacor. At the start of each kill if you have full adrenaline activate sunshine to speed up the kill. With the noxious staff and on slayer task I can kill around  glacors per hour using this rotation. If off task maybe  ish. I hope this helps! Have fun! ,runescape,cu8fwnj,1,t5_2qwxl

4878029,0,t3_3hnx6q,IMO  rrunescape has become another forum for high level players. Lower level players and their achievements are not allowed. Well they are but at times they are heavily ridiculed for not being efficient or not doing things the way the high level community do them. On another note the game has become so competitive and this has seeped into all runescape related content on the web. No wonder the game RSRS hasnt seen any significant growth since .

Even now my energy increases. It is about time you met your end.    Sliske Ah yes you can feel the energy coursing through your veins. You are addicted just like Saradomin is just like Lucien was. And now I am too.    Player What do you mean addicted?    Sliske Cant you see? Everyone who has ever touched the Stone has sacrificed everything in order to keep it in their grasp.    Sliske The energy withheld in the Stone is not from this world and the feeling of absorbing it is incomparable. I am not so clouded by pride that I would deceive myself    Zamorak You speak only of your own addiction. The Stone is but a tool a necessity if I am to liberate this world from the other gods.    Sliske Fool yourself all you like Zamorak. I now know the truth.    Player What about me?    Sliske It would seem being the World Guardian is a doubleedged sword. You may not be harmed by the gods but you are also unable to absorb divine energy.    Sliske Good old Guthix gave you a blessing  and a curse. You do seem to be quite handy at channeling the Stones power temporarily though.Doesnt this atleast prove hes not a world guardian?,runescape,cuifcgs,2,t5_2qwxl

This isnt adding m experience an hour to nothing this is increasing experience by  or so for a cost of a significant number of soul runes and chaos runes.

4972239,0,t1_cula3as,Comped I did in fact stop playing for a whole  months after the release of EoC. It was a buggy mess on release which didnt work and needed far more QA than it actually received. Came back and gave the game the chance it deserved and saw that it was actually bettered when it came to combat aspects. It wasnt bland like it had been for a year or so and didnt feel drained just clicking and waiting for things to die. I would LOVE to see the stats and time played of your RS or OSRS account. It just seems like youve brought the RS hatred circlejerk from scape and brought it here. I can see the merits upsides and downsides of both version of the game but I wouldnt put down OSRS because it is a game in its own right. Both are great and in fact made by the same company.

5218875,0,t3_3mejbb,Well Ive read through lots of the clan posts here and the one the interested me most had a requirement of  total level. I just passed  and I dont think DXP will give me  levels this weekend. I am interested in clans that are beginner friendly. While Ive been on and off of RS for upwards for ten years I will need someone to teach me beginner bosses. Id like a clan with mainly a PvM focus. Im slowly grinding all my combat stats to  closest being  range atm but have the best gear I can wear for now. Full ganodermic full armadyl full bandos and a set off Guthans for the most annoying slayer tasks. Most times Im online I can be found in a slayer dungeon or on task somewhere else grinding for my next piece of gear or next slayer level. I just hit  combat last week and am looking for an active clan that leaves maxing at citadel optional I skill there when I can or when other members might be there. I have real life obligations and those will always come before RS if clan events are mandatory I doubt Id be able to make it work. If something takes places when I happen to be on Ill likely be there though. Flair not my username anymore and cant change flair at work. Username is now Brutal NugsTLDRWants Mature and social clan PvM optional events citadel work optional. ,runescape,cvf2epi,1,t5_2qwxl

I think it certainly falls into the play the game the way you want to style more so than anything else Ive played. Youre not locked into a certain class or play style and the game gives you no guidance on what to do. What I suggest doing is exploring the game for yourself. Dont feel obligated to grind for levels or level up for higher tier monsters. Do what you enjoy and levels will come. If you find a quest with rewards you want you can grind in small chunks for requirements. Play the game casually. Im not saying that the game requires no skill but its not meant to engage you  all the time. Explore dont feel pressured to do one thing because its the best or most efficient. Embrace your inner ADD and jump from skills and areas. Enjoy the characters scenery and depth of the game.Sorry for the wall of text I just thought Id offer my opinions on how I play and enjoy the game.

5359597,0,t3_3oeytm,Im guessing the developers didnt account for players breaking the moneycap since there wasnt any items that had a player price beyond that. it was only realized at some point after the GE existed.Except now that since GP is a defacto currency and that some people may convert their GP into either items for investments or just purely to hold the collective GP. adding official condensed GP coins would shake the market assuming theyd be usable in their current form in a way that bugs isnt introduced into existing content.Also the GE would still have a money cap which would mean players would have to take GPcondensed GP at face value in direct trades so it wouldnt solve the whole Street Price situation. The case of Platinum Tokens is just the OSRS teams way of coping with potential inflation most of the high end items of Modern Runescape is much more common such as Party Hats in Old School. guessing rd age items are more valuable.,runescape,cvwqz21,0,t5_2qwxl

5383903,0,t1_cvzo37l,I guess it depends on what kind of paint you mean. If you look at the upcoming Falador rework for example dont get me wrong  I love it! based on what they showed on stream it completely changes the atmosphere and the looks of the city.A rework like that might work for Falador but I feel like it wouldnt be ideal for tutorial island simply because the only reason were going back there is because of how it was before it got removed. If Tutorial Island was still the current tutorial for the game things would be different.I feel like you approach the concept of this quest like you would do with any other quest. Meaning that in your eyes the key elements should be a great story in an amazing looking place with fantastic monsters. But this is not any other quest this is Tutorial Island. Its different. If you want to make a normal quest that can be done anywhere on the world map. This quest in particular though is the only opportunity for Jagex to focus on Tutorial island. So the story should be about Tutorial island whether that involves Crassians or not. And it should most definitely be a nice somewhat nostalgic trip meaning the place has to be recognizable even if they update the graphics.That doesnt mean there cant be a good story or anything it just means the main focus and subject of the quest are different.,runescape,cvzurfa,2,t5_2qwxl

Basically my experience with it was trying to run to varrock being a level  and getting killed by a level . Thats when I logged out. Theres zones where the range of combat levels that can kill you get broader. Safe zones I think? are a range of  combat levels so a level  can attack .

5564394,0,t1_cwmrlzj,RuneScape HD was great the graphics were still simple and clear rendering speedquality improved etc.All content lately seems to be made as hard to see as possible especially when it comes to lighting. People had to ask the jmods on stream to go outside to show off the ripper claws because its literally too dark to be playable in there with lighting detail on high. Hindering game play in the chase to look good in videosscreenshots is not good for people who actually play the game.NXT will bring slightly higher resolution textures that will fix a bit of the blurriness of textures atm but the art style in RuneScape still seems to be trending down the road of making everything dark or overdetailed look good fully zoomed in and in screenshots but be hard to recognize during actual gameplay.,runescape,cwmtaqh,3,t5_2qwxl

I just got a free godsword from the event last week and it doesnt degrade why would I waste money on a lvl  bow that costs my entire bank at time of completing the quest to repair?Its also particularly insulting that the only way to reduce the cost is through the construction and smithing skills both of which are pretty damn expensive to level up.Im particularly interested to see how this works if at all with stuff like crystal equipment fuck that initial cost and sacred clay especially given how much sense this system would make in this context.,runescape,cwo0h2j,1,t5_2qwxl

Find other people who want to learn and go with them.

Assuming all the drygore weapons have the same drop rate and the combined drop rate is  for any drygore and the average price of a drygore weapon is mil then hourly profit for kk in a duo across many hours of kk is  mil kills on average for a drop  kills an hour   person split  .milhr off just drygore weapon droops.,runescape,cx85dn8,2,t5_2qwxl

The split second that it takes you to enter the second map is enough time for the attacks logic to iterate completely thus you are seeing the UI catch up to the damage that had been calculated on the server side. One way they could patch this would be render each attack separate and to remove threat on character interaction with the exits which could be abused. ,runescape,cxp7rza,-2,t5_2qwxl

5982977,0,t1_cy3ui43,This was really the only rational argument that I could see coming out of my post. While I do agree chatting in teamspeak is socializing in a way I dot think its enough to truly develop as a person. Even assuming it was a sufficient social skill tool the majority of players do not use teamspeak anyway. The thing with grinding I dont understand is why people think its fun. Youre not getting anything out of it. You repeat the same task over and over and over  times and then you get  and never touch it again. You didnt accomplish anything significant you just got an imaginary level. Thats my whole point. If you play rs  hours you get some levels. This translates into nothing. No growth or development for you no stories or experiences just another meaningless level. If you play the guitar  hours you change significantly. You use different parts of your brain you can now plays songs impress people have more dexterity. Thats what it really boils down to for me. I could easily just play  hours a day. I spend all that time and get nothing in the return. But if I just spent a fraction of that  hour a day learning anything else Id be an really experienced in no time. ,runescape,cy3we7x,-1,t5_2qwxl

6002247,0,t1_cy5vu5a,And we do. Any teasers we get are either posted or reposted particularly on Twitter.The issue we have particularly on Facebook is Facebooks Edge Rank algorithm. Posts that dont immediately get engagement which due to the nature of things like newsposts mean that you click the link read the content and then probably dont come back to Facebook to likecomment onshare the post do not get seen by the majority of our audience.An exampleThis post on Facebook a comic by Prezleek reached nearly  people.Whereas this one about the Winter Weekend Minigame Weekend reached only . Youre a lot more likely to have seen the comic rather than the newspost.I do make a conscious effort to balance our content engagement posts as well as teasers newsposts community content and videos. However in many cases we are at Facebooks mercy when it comes to who sees which post.Its an issue which a lot of companies are trying to combat and naturally these more engaging posts memes nostalgic images community content get more engagement and are therefore seen by a lot more people.Believe me if I could harness the amount of engagement we get on a newspost or a teaser and there are some that do well but only on a large update generally I would  but Facebook are being Facebook unfortunately.I have taken this on board though as a lot of people have mentioned a lot of the posts we put out are community content  art comics etc. which I see and enjoy and hope the rest of the community do as well. ,runescape,cy6fath,9,t5_2qwxl

If you are having problem with the Iorwerth Elves then try using Bind Spells like Ensnare from the regular spell book.These are the ones that cost Nature runes to use. I always use the one that costs  Nature runes and I can kill them way before the time runs out. To note there are times the spell wont work and it uses an ability first.However recently I have been killing the Cadarn Rangers as I am training Melee.

6163271,0,t1_cyq5z8c,Well the GPHR is calculated by subtracting the value of the inputs from the value of the expected outputs over a  hour period  kills. You can see the inputouputs theyre using on the righthand side of the table.Inputs will vary from player to player for example the wiki assumes k hourly repair costs but this might not apply to you so you could be making an extra khour.The outputs should be consistent between players because theyre based off the QBDs drop table. However I couldnt find any references to hard defined drop statistics so its likely theyre crowdsourced which means there is room for error. Also the Wiki is editable by anyone so these values change over time and there doesnt seem to be any easy form of verification other than getting more drop data.Maybe theres some exaggerating going on maybe theres some good RNG maybe the expected hourly drops on the wiki are slightly off or maybe a mix of all . If you think the drops are off and youve got some data to back it up get in there and update it EDIT It occurs to me that most people probably dont account for input costs at all when talking about their GPHR but the wiki calculation factors in about M per hour in costs.,runescape,cyq78ig,2,t5_2qwxl

Disgusting.Even though he apologized thats still bot very professional.Here in Germany where I live there was a court case against a weatherman Jrgen Kachelmann. He was tried for rape with the only witness being the woman he alledgedly raped. Her accusation went similar to how OPs picture is. There was a lot of media coverage especially by the magazines for the ...less intelligent part of the population and they made it sound like its a fact he raped that woman.While it was discovered that Jrgen did in fact not rape her the media did irreparable damage and did NOT apologize for it.Due to all the hate Jrgen had to move to austria forfeit his career and start a new life even though he had done nothing wrong at all.I expect a little more research before a guy who has k people that believe what he says accuses people of anything.,runescape,cyrsh2q,8,t5_2qwxl

Here are some tipsGet a black dragon task and do it with a slayer helm. If you have done Ritual of the Mahjarrat switch to range and get dragonbane bolts. Using a crossbow along with a thrown offhand gives amazing damage with dragonbane.Run through her fire walls instead of standing still. You will take one hit of damage. Sometimes it bugs and you will take no damage if you run back a little right before the fire wall hits and run through it. Wait till the tortured souls speak and then walk through them to lure their attack onto them,runescape,cyxuxgx,3,t5_2qwxl
6230985,0,t3_40vsn7,Im sorry but this is all wrong. You cant make up content and claim thats a reason to vote.. Actually youre visiting one Island Chain. Theres more than just the Arc in the Wushanko Isles and getting only a tiny piece of that with no guarantee of the remaining Island Chains would be such a massive disappointment. If were not getting the full location which we would not be with this option there is absolutely no reason for it to come out yet.. The content will not be . This has been confirmed absolutely nowhere. Its far more likely most players will be able to access it as Jagex would not lock a large new location behind such high skill requirements. You have absolutely no source on this and thus this is a moot point..  smaller islands. Thats not a lot of exploration space.. Thats a bad thing why are you calling this a plus? We have locations on the MAIN GAME WORLD that still desperately need to be complete. Specifically Menaphos and Arposandra most notably. Moving to yet another new location separate from the main landmass is just doing in essence another round of World Gateing. It doesnt make an impact on the main game world and doesnt advance stories that have existed for ages.. None of that is confirmed. This isnt only the start of the Eastern Lands. This is a single Island Chain and there is absolutely no guarantee that anything else would ever come. A Sailing skill is complete fiction and is in no way confirmed for any Eastern Lands update ever.Stick to the facts next time with what we know from the poll. Youve outright made up content and claimed its a reason to vote for the Eastern Lands while ignoring so many of the negatives that should be heavily kept in mind before the poll starts.For instance. Theres no confirmation wed see more of the Wushanko Isles than the Arc region which is what is ACTUALLY being pitched.. Without further confirmation well just be getting yet another unfinished location instead of wrapping up areas weve been waiting on for ages.. The Wushanko Isles are already a huge part of existing gameplay  Player Owned Ports. We dont need to go there especially not right now when locations that we never have visited are up for the poll.. Content and locations are extremely limited by Ports lore. How on earth is the story going to work? Ports is locked behind level  content and extremely long voyages to tell the story. Locking new islands behind level  skills would be a terrible way to do things but letting everyone go there tells a very confusing story. Waiting for a full Island Chain release would at least allow Jagex to treat the Islands as acting after the Ports story has ended without needing to poll more islands or find it in the budget to do more sets of Islands.. As mentioned above Budget. With this budget we get  Islands. There are eight whole regions which means wed need to get the SAME size project SEVEN more times in order to actually get to access the whole Eastern Lands. Doesnt that seem a bit absurd to you?,runescape,cyxw86s,8,t5_2qwxl

Doing the Arc region first seems like the best and most logical start.Then depending upon how it is received future plans and available resources releasing it region by region appear to be the most plausible outcome though I wouldnt assume that is what will happen.,runescape,cyz4gw1,2,t5_2qwxl

The change of ancients triggering is only a  chance with abilities and using dark form in pvp would have your pray going down pretty fast. Add in that with proper use of anti and freedoms. Your comment about wrack applies to range as well in fact it applies more to range as impact you cant get boosted damage and deepimpactaphyx you only get  boosted hit with. Whereas binding shot and tight bindings allow for  hits of piecing shot boosted damage. Range is also all about combos to allow for high hitting kos such as tendrilsrevenge dark bow specs. No style really has to much of an advantage over the other even melee vs mage.

Yes some of them are hoarded but people think the volume of items we have is much greater than it actually is.Sure after a few weeks the demand and supply will balance somewhat but the resource drops are not going to be even remotely close to how much we disassemble those items.I would have been more than totally okay in lets say  price increase to artisan materials but like I said  is just way over the line.,runescape,czce4l4,1,t5_2qwxl

Skill releases always see massive upheaval on an economic basis while people dump valuables for cash to train and purchase materials to do so. Things will level out. The only problem is we have to wait for the rest of the skill and the obviously upcoming postrelease rebalancingtweaking for things to be a little less hectic. But the item sink aspect will be fine with time.But theres absolutely no call for being an asshat. Poor form man.,runescape,czck0aa,12,t5_2qwxl

6375576,0,t3_42zk7q,Im going to disagree about the debuffs. This is inventor not builder. Its supposed to be as though we are experimenting to find the best thing. A lot of the results should be negative however when we get a positive it should be worth actually having and wading through the bad for. Also maybe make it a tad more predictable and less chance so players can discover actual combinations. Although I understand it has to be somewhat random because the internet will ruin the surprise without a doubt.,runescape,czec0a2,4,t5_2qwxl

The people who were banned for abusing the grot souls bug sold over  of them to a store each. at the VERY LEAST. some sold OVER A MILLION. Not normal gameplay but intense abuse of something they knew wasnt right.this number is also effect of drop rates if jagex would not want players to sell large ammount of items then ammount of these items droped by monsters would be smaller. I had  souls from fire giant task on ge k gp price set by jagex it would be    gp ridiculus for fire giant task but this is in game tested by Jagex QA team so it is fine and then players sell it to shop for lower than ge price. How thsi can be banned?IF players were baned for adding a lot of gold to economy then this is not true because if  players would sell the same amount of souls  but low amount per player amount of gold added to game would be the same. It is easy to see that entire grotesque fiasco is jagex fault and players should not be banned for it. ,runescape,czqyrzh,1,t5_2qwxl

6546304,0,t1_czwdzpn,Is it? Its not that much more complex to work out through xp. Youd have a running total of xp and then modulo it to get the remainder remove the remainder from the running total and then divide that by the required xp for a piece. The result from the divide is the amount of items you should get the remaining xp from the modulo goes back onto your running total.ExampleLets say the drop rate is  piece per flat rate of k xp in any combat stat.User has k xp and gets a drop of k from Arraxor the user has k xp in their total and then that gets put into the modulo. k comes out as the remainder and then you divide k by k to receive .The user receives  piece and their running total is set to k.Might seem complicated in that explanation but the implementation isnt that complicated.

6658786,0,t3_46v7yl,Well as a lot of games youre free to do what ever you want to do. Theres isnt exactly a certain path to take on RS opposed to other games with story lines I guess. Its really just what ever you find fun. Again theres predetermined way to play but common thingssuggestions include Quests! Aim for the quest cape which is obtained after completing all the quests in the game. Youll need to level up your skills andor complete certain quests to unlock some quests. Leveling your combat skills allows you to get into bossingPVMing which many find to be the more enjoyable parts of runescape myself included.  A suggestion to start would be slayer as it allows you to become more familiar with combat as well as leveling your combat stats slayer all while making money. Leveling up all of your skills to  or  for dungeoneering amp invention to get the max cape  If youve maxed out all your skills and also completed all the major came content then youll be rewarded with the completionist cape  Although many have this a lot of people dont actively aim for it. They just do things that they find fun and dont worry about it. So in a nutshell just try out some different stuff and see what you like!As for your question about levels. Yes you want to raise them. Leveling up your combat skills unlocks more abilities to use.  Having higher attack allows you to use higher level weapons which do more damage and hit more accurately which makes training faster.  Strength helps you hit higher and defense helps you take less damage and use better armor.   As for guides you can look on youtubegoogle for powerleveling methods. But I suggest you train them through slayer as its pretty efficient because youll make money to upgrade your gear level up your combat stats and slayer all at the same time. ,runescape,d082qmv,2,t5_2qwxl

6719675,0,t3_47nm7t,To add to whats already been mentioned...For the neck slot you can use either a Fury or a Saradomins Amulet for the combat styles of choice. All three are a bit cheaper than the Fury with slightly better stats for the style they benefit.Much like the Saradomin amulets the Kiln Capes offer some strong benefits for each aligned style. Substitutes include God Cape for Mage the best Avas cape you havecan get for Ranged and the trusty ol Fire Cape Melee. A Skill Cape fills the same role as the Fury.Slayer Helm or its stylespecific components is a huge boost while doing Slayer assignments and should be your first priority for your loadout if choosing to Slay.For armor I would probably prefer using the Fremennik Armor over DragonRoyalMystic. The Fremmy sets which are often forgotten about have offensive stats for the respective style which is usually more beneficial while doing Slayer. The Culinaromancer  Barrows gloves are slightly better than the gloves from these sets and should be used instead if you have access to them. Crystal Weapons are viable if theyre within your budget. Nondegradable options might be better until you can establish yourself. For Melee the Godswords Saradomin Sword and Whip are all fine options. Staff of Light or the Abyssal Wand amp Orb would get the job done with  Magic. For Ranged Dark Bow will do until you can get yourself a Royal Crossbow which is arguably one of the best high level welfare weapons.Depending on when you last played Rings have a much larger impact now. Fremennik Rings benefit a specific style and are tradable while two other rings worth mentioning are the SixthAge Circuit and Asylum Surgeons If you have either of the two rings or the requirements for their quests I would recommend them over the Fremennik ones. The Prayer Books from the Lighthouse were recently updated they have some small combat benefits and are equipped in the pocket slot. If you have a completed one in your bank dont forget to bring it with ya! Working towards the Elf City Prifddinas would be a highly recommended focus. Access to the city is a reward from the Plagues End quest. I also recommend checking out the daily activity Soul Reaper also referred to as Boss Slayer which is much like the name suggests... Death tells you to kill X of Y boss you get some points and Slayer experience for completing each task. Slayer Helm has no effect on assignments unless you have an appropriate assignment from another Slayer master for the same type of creature.  Points can get you a Hydrix gem which can fetch over m or be used to make powerful accessories. Names in the flair feel free to shoot me any other questions.,runescape,d0edfci,3,t5_2qwxl

Yes it does have the ability to go beyond the limits of that and become  but mousekeys has that ability as well.

6754545,0,t3_489775,In early  about a month before the RS beta became available my cousin committed suicide. I was around  combat at the time and decided I wasnt doing anything else until I got to level  which at the time was very rare. I even stayed up  days  hours straight one time to go from  roughly. Its been so long I cant recall for sure but anyway.During this my cousin messaged me saying how he was going to commit suicide. Back in these days the age range of RS was much younger and a lot of people would say that to attention grab. I didnt believe him and told him Id talk to him the following week end when Id be  since I didnt want to be distracted from my goal. Well I think it was Monday night I got level  then went PKing and got a full rune set about  hours later. Thirty minutes after what was my highest ever PK at that time I received word my cousin had in fact killed himself. I blamed myself for not taking him seriously for many years. Even came close to doing it myself if not for a few people on RS convincing me otherwise. It happened when I was  and I didnt get over it until . His mother still has not gotten over it. His parents are divorced and Im sure his father who found him hanging isnt over it either. In fact he sold his home because of it at a pretty big loss I heard. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem and you ultimately hurt those around you more than anything else. His mother will never be the same. His sisters daughter saw him as an older brother and her life would be very different if he had still been around and probably would not have some negatives in her life that she has now. In short the worlds a worse place for his action and if you were to ever do it yourself you may very well put those you care about on a very bad path themselves. ,runescape,d0hz64d,5,t5_2qwxl

You can reduce the costs to about m if you grow the expensive herbs and gather the expensive ingredients. Getting your own wine of zamoraks will end up saving you about m or m for super range pots. But cheap ingredients like irits potato cacti etc will be better spent not farming for. Also stock up on portable wells now. Their prices are lower and their boosts are undeniably worth the k minute uses of xp boosts and additional free pots finished and unfinished.Get a god banner.

I take full responsibility for both of those and the only reason I blamed the team originally was because I hadnt realized my mic was muted. I dont recall muting my mic and it also didnt make the beeping noise it normally does when I try to talk into a muted mic which is why it took me forever to realize it was muted. Essentially I was annoyed at the team because I thought that they heard me when they hadnt but then after learning my mic was muted during that time I had taken responsibility for that.The only reason I was originaly blaming the team was because I thought they heard me when they obviously didnt. I even offered to pay for all deaths that I caused.Look I had an off day and I really doubt you want much more to do with me after today but I am  certain that I did not provoke a vitalis. When I first hit provoke I was in melee distance so there could not have been a vitalis between me and Vorago. When my provoke activated it went on cooldown but vorago did not agro onto me. This is when I started screaming into my muted mic lol that I couldnt voke so then after I heard you guys getting annoyed at me for not voking I got annoyed at you guys as I hadnt realized my mic was muted.I am very sorry for how I performed today and yes I know I suck a lot for messing up  but just trust me that I had an off day.

If anything decreasing drain rate would push more people to gather their own energies which wouldnt really do much to the price since theyre both the supplier and the consumer.  The core of my argument isnt price of energies will still be expensive.

If there is a cost difference it certainly isnt coming from the cost of energy but rather the cost the lower leveled resource.So its still simply turning one thing into another with a reasonable cost of resources to do so.

6858213,0,t3_49p03d,RS has great PvP but the current risk it too high and the gain is not too much so people wont do it. The risk everything  rebuild for  month to get your items back is just not sustainable anymore. I belive Jagex atm working on PvP rework with Bounty Hunder and Crucible PK. RS PvP also involves much more skill than in Old School and thats exactly why OS pking is much more popular. In OS you grab a whip full rune a spec weapon venge and basically good to go and have good chance to win even if you totally suck at PKing. Basically all you need to know is how to switch and spec fast  everything else is RNG. In EoC PKing the fights are much more intense needs more knowledge and tactical thinking good timing etc. If you dont know how to pk you can get absolutely REKT with max level gear against a guy with much lower level gear. The problem is you dont gain good stuff unless you smite your opponents pray. And if you high risking it is really hard to rebuild in rs.So the main reason people dont PK much here ibecause t is mostly not worth it compared to other way safer money makings.,runescape,d0tor5u,0,t5_2qwxl

6866531,0,t1_d0um96m,gtPopularity doesnt necessarily equate to what the community at large wants. Sure streamers like that get a lot of views but Im willing to bet that most people are against that sort of thing.How does that work? If they get x number of views that means that a x number of people from the twitch community want it and again here goes my previous point on why all those harassers are the root of the problem.  Now if another part of the community doesnt want it nobody is forcing it to watch the those streams.gtBecause for the longest time Twitch did nothing about this and most of the community doesnt like it.Again that doesnt make it right. Think of those streamers who dont show their tits on stream think of how much harassment they have been through because of all this.  At the end if you could remove or at least educate them the toxic people who keep going to streams to harass or cause all the drama around the topic everyone would be fine.,runescape,d0umr3n,1,t5_2qwxl

You could even invest in T armour for the kills trust me it lasts a LOT.You could invest in Torva if youre not fancy in buying armour that will degrade to dust. Or maybe if youre not in the mood of a tough challenge you could grind out QBD for some cash. If you ever need some Araxxor help or tips you can PM me.,runescape,d18grtb,1,t5_2qwxl

7040362,0,t3_4c21ym,Heres a post I made on the forums about itFirst do the top row. Left to right such that all the pieces match the hint. For the last  pieces on the row youll want to back in by putting the piece that goes on the end into the nd to end slot then moving the piece that goes there under it then slipping the hole to edge moving the random piece there down and moving the end piece to its location one right and the other one up.Do this same thing for the second row.Once these rows are complete doing it by row wont help anymore but no matter what you do do not touch those two rows you do not need to do so to finish the puzzle assuming you matched them correctly.Next you can either do the right or the left side since I did the left Ill suggest you do that one first. There are numerous ways to do it but I suggest going by column. Youll need to do that same backing in trick for the corner piece as above only this time youll start by moving it one above its ultimate spot moving the piece that goes where it is  right then moving the hole so that you can move the piece in the corner out put the piece that belong there by moving it one down then slide that other piece  left.Repeat this for the next column.At this point we are at the trickiest section but again do not touch the areas completed in the above you dont need to. Id start by getting the remainder of the bottom row correct by now you should be able to follow how to do the corner piece correctly. Once that is done youll need to do that same corner strategy for the two pieces on the far right column. At this point there are only  pieces remaining. All you need to do is circle until the hole is back in the center and you will be done assuming you do not touch any of the completed pieces and you will not need to do so.,runescape,d1edr8a,2,t5_2qwxl

It seems absolutely absurd to have them locked behind loyalty points when you cant earn those through play you just have to wait months to get these high end items whereas runecoins have a gp value through bonds and can actually be earned by playing the game more.I understand that a concern would be making auras pw but it at least seems more reasonable than what we have now. Its not like auras are great on their own anyway they need nonpw high end gear to make them useful.  It makes more sense for fun cosmetic upgrades to be restricted by a set amount of time think veteran capes than it does to lock a player out of high end gear for months because they just recently started playingreturned to the game.,runescape,d1hywfz,-3,t5_2qwxl

Example Augmenting t top and legs costs a total of k gph to simply wearuse in charges. So thats another k gphr you have to make just to cover that.

7179960,0,t1_d1uaeqb,Ive been wanting to make a huge reddit post on the topic at some point but classes and real life have been keeping me busy. The shortest explanation I can give is that the TH promotions are generally inconsistent and negatively effect eachother occasionally due their specific styles.For example temporary content which is completeable but still difficult to do without TH will gain more interaction with more players. With more players there are more potential people spending money. However Jagex has been creating permanent content skilling outfits which is only obtainable by the use of keys. Therefore the few who are already spending money will already get a permanent xp boost above everyone else and will reach a point in which they dont need to spend money.Now of course this is an entire assumption since theres no way of me knowing how much money they make per promotion or in general.Oh also I didnt mean that as a harshrude attack against you personally.

You shouldve see what happened to the player counter after bot nuke Every world was infected with spammer bots now you can see none. For minigames...they are less pupular because of their outdated rewards and gameplay. What was fun back in ? with old combatand mechanics may not be fun now. If you really want to play them you gotta look on the good places. RSOF gaming FCs etc... You cant just walk in a minigame lobby and expect to find people. Look for which minigame is spotlighted atm.Yes the game was still more popular back then even with bots. Yes not as much people play now than used to be. EVERY game has a golden age.

7258873,0,t3_4eth67,Great idea to add A Souls Bane All Fired Up and Broken home to FP but Missing Presumed Death should NOT be made a FP quest. The sixth age storyline is complicated enough and if it is made a FP quest virtually everyone would complete it out of order. All sixth age quests assume that The World Wakes has already been completed. If FP had access to MPD then every FP player would complete the quest before they even have the opportunity to complete the storyline in the correct order. It would make no sense to complete MPD as a FP player then eventually get members and do TWW. The storylines are already messed up enough and imo MPD should require TWW to complete but thats a completely different story. ,runescape,d23a6ht,5,t5_2qwxl

7262746,0,t1_d23ab2k,Zaros  definitely not neutral he is power hungry with massive superiority complex. Before Zamorak betrayed him he invaded Gielinor and started conquering it. You cited Saradomin as evil because he he killed those who opposed him. That is literally the same thing Zaros did with his old empire. He believes he is better than others because he was created by mah and therefore purer than mortals who only ascended to godhood. That is why he thinks Gielinor belongs to him and those who disagree are killed. He is pretty much same as Saradomin both think people need their guidance want to control them and both take what they want by force. The only difference is that Saradomin actually believes his intentions are good while Zaros believes the end justify the means.Guthix  should be true neutral imho. He believed in balance and didnt really help people to preserve it. I mean the people of Morytania were suffering immensely from the Vampyres yet he didnt help. Plus he banished all gods even the good ones Seren wasnt warmongering only helping the elves but she still had to leave so he is not really that good rather neutral.Armadyl  not sure why is he neutral he believes in justice and while he may be bit nave he is not power hungry and fought for good.Bandos  should be with zamorak. they have very similar ideologies both believe stronger people should be free to kill weaker because it causes progress. They believe weaklings need to die for society as a whole to be stronger. Plus their actions are similar look what Bandos did to Yubuisk and what Zamorak did to Morytania.So to summarize I would put Seren to neutral good Armadyl to lawful good Guthix to true neutral Zaros to neutral evil rigth with Tuska and Bandos to chaotic evil rigth to Zamorak.

I have max range gear and the time it takes to kill things is not far apart. In legacy youll hit some zeros far more commonly than in EoC. The way I see it if you want low but common hits and extra convenience EoC. If you want to play nostalgically but hit high and notasfrequent legacy. Both are good imo.,runescape,d23w84q,1,t5_2qwxl

7270515,0,t1_d23r6hn,gtI think hes more of a Lawful Neutral.Depends on ones view on what constitutes evil. We know Zaros did some rather... questionable experiments on sentients resulting in the Nihil. And there are questions about how much he knew about certain atrocities going on in his empire Cthonians eating civilians Sliske using humans as live puppets in literally homicidal plays for the amusement of Zaros officersnobles Zemourgals creation of undead abominations.And his comments on wars could be taken in multiple ways. He claims not to have Started wars but what constitutes a start? Consider what precedes that comment ..it is also because I sought unification. I wanted to bring all the young gods under one banner How was he trying to unite the gods under one banner? It would be supremely bizarre if other gods were declaring war in response to him sending a diplomat to suggest an alliance. Especially after his empire was the most powerful on Gielinor.Given his personality he wasis certain that it was his right to lead the gods could he have been demanding other gods allow him to annex their territories and considering refusal a start of a war. Nor did he seem inclined to let wars end at the negotiation table note the desperate measures the Menaphite pantheon took to stop his empires invasion. We also note per Char his invasion of the elves who were presumably neutral.From what Ive seen Zaros is rather obviously evil. Hes ruthless ambitious and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his ambition which from what I have seen is achieving elder godhood with a secondary goal of improving mortals. If he had to choose between saving mortals and becoming an elder god Im fairly certain we could kiss our existence good bye.,runescape,d24lwlh,2,t5_2qwxl

7331020,0,t1_d2bhh53,I used melee with full bandos  dragon rider lance. Helwyr is very very easy once you get it down. He always follows the same rotation of attacks. Mushroom gt big hit gt spazzyfunspintime gt wolves.  attacks between every special attack thing. Mushrooms just dont stand in them. if they spawn on you move out asap. The big hit you can either stand in it and take it to the face if youre not hurting for hp or count the hits since mushrooms and run to the side as he does the big hit to avoid it. You can also get all fancy and resonance it with a shield but thats really not needed. For the spazzyspinfuntime just devotion if you have it up or debilitate if you dont have devotion then use freedom after the last stack of the bleed. For wolves just cleave them down. I started the kills with a slaughter moved him cyclone tendrils if using vamp aura that trip quake if not then wait until he was about to use the spazzyfunspintime thing and devo. After I clear the bleed from the spin Id zerk and go from there. Once you get the hang of it you dont even use food if you have a vamp scrimshaw. ,runescape,d2bhjj0,6,t5_2qwxl

This will slow your early progress by a ton in the beginning but it will allow you do max port much much much faster. Farming scroll involves only sending away scroll mission as they dont contribute to your progress toward the next regions. Its much easier to get successful scroll missions in the early region than to get them in the later regionsuntil you are fully upgraded... in  months.,runescape,d2by9it,2,t5_2qwxl

Thats sort of wrong  it shouldnt because I can never recover that essence. And...From a User ExperienceSystems perspective I dont have a good idea of how item value works. But if the value of my Sirenic Hauberk Barrows was m what would that mean if I died and went to Deaths Office? While using the armour  I know that most people keepsake the armour but humour me here.I would be paying upwards of .m for reclaim per item  and even if I chose to save my dyed armour Id be paying full reclaim for by bootsglovesweapons in all likelihood.I get why some people want this but for a majority of us it either misrepresents our wealth again  we spent the gold to get the item but we can never recover the item or is a bad idea.,runescape,d2c17zv,1,t5_2qwxl

Applying vsync to RuneScape.exe will do nothing as this is merely a wrapper.

7450513,0,t1_d2p21tk,My bad I didnt know youre only allowed to tell a certain amount of people.  Tell you what if I make another money making guide Ill limit it to the first  people.  Honestly telling people about it creates competition.  It could very well drive prices down even crash them but at the end of the day competition is good.  Itll force people out of their comfort zones.  People on RS seem to hate competition whether it be having their training spot crashed or their money making methods revealed to a large audience but thats too bad.  If one market drops theres always another one to take advantage of.  No market is safe if anything the only thing my guide will do is drive Nihils to their natural price rather than leaving them inflated at k.  Steel Titans were never close even when they were the strongest combat familiar.  If Nihils drop theyll likely rise again.  The worst part would be the surge of people doing it until the prices go into a steep decline after that chances are theyll climb to where they should be.  The longterm effects are unlikely to be anything super significant and after its all said and done there will be a useful tool for anyone that wants to kill Nihils in the future.  The backlash on this video has been incredible.  I knew the Runescape community had its share of bad people but honestly?  I didnt expect so many people to be against helping the community as a whole.  I made a video a while back on Mort Myre Fungus which received a few complaints but nowhere near this.  Its in a similar boat to Nihils easy to do and makes great profit for the effort but the negative reaction to this is significantly worse. I dont much care personally Ive learned to shrug off internet salt but its certainly an interesting thing to observe.  Regardless of all the salt it was a pretty good exercise for me in seeing what I can do with my editing software. I dont always reply to internet hate but when I do theyre pretty angry.

7452282,0,t1_d2p9h5i,Long story. First back when the wilderness was removed the majority of the PvP community quit the game. Later when Eoc was released it killed off most of the remaining PvP community because at the time Eoc had alot of issues long since fixed that made PvP just not practical. As I mentioned Eoc has been updatedfixed since its release but the initial issues turned so many people off of eoc PvP that no large community has since sprouted. Eoc also makes PvP much faster pace and takes much more skill something that people dont likewant to spend time learning. The final blow for Rs PvP was the release of Osrs given the option of the classic style vs eoc the choice was easy for many.Even after all of that there is still one option for PvP in Rs legacy only worlds. Legacy is a system that tries to emulate the classic combat style while still playing Rs and on these worlds you can typically find people looking for fights just north of edgeville.A new update coming soon may have help revitalize PvP by allowing fun matches anywhere in the world. These fights are a safe death meaning if you loose you dont loose anything besides a bit of pride. Hopefully this will lead to more people putting in the effort to learn Eoc PvP and eventually people wishing to try risk fights in the wildy like the old days.,runescape,d2pa00a,1,t5_2qwxl

7462834,0,t1_d2pul41,please dont come back like this lol you are literally spitting garbage. You ignore all ethical practices associate within online service provision. What business has acted ethically with a fucking incentive to do so lol? They have to follow regulation and precedent set from governing bodies and they  surprise surprise  do nothing but reduce a businesss immediate profit. You act like jagex have the freedom to do what they want but this is only somewhat conceivable because they are in a seemingly poorly regulated industry. They must adhere to trade and ethics laws from every single country they provide a service to not their own based on their european operations. Thats not how the world works. These servers have been a problem for upwards of a year now so I dont think this is overnight. I dont understand why you make up bullshit excuses for companies that cant do it for themselves. I dont see people trying trying to rationalise Nike using slave labour because it means people in lower income areas are more likely to be able to afford to purchase their clothing. People on the internet like yourself live in this nieve world where you have the freedom to do what ever you want in your head. Enter the real world and youll learn thats sadly for some not true.It isnt about what they gain from fixing the servers it is about being responsible to fix the servers. They keep ducking responsibility acting like they have a freedom to ignore the issue but they are providing a lower grade service for the same price to specific regions around the world. Is it geographical discrimination? Probably. If i was a new player or a returning player Id naturally go to a world with sub  ping being AusNz worlds. To have me lag like shit or crash twice daily locking me from my account for potentially hours  in what world would i be compelled to keep playing when my alternative is playing at a distinct disadvantage compared to the majority in playing with an offshore ping upwards of .Much rather go play a game founded by a company that is successful enough to be able to fund servers that can support the game. Because on face value if they cant afford something so basic what is the chance of them growing after being one of the older game companies still operating.And please small portion of the player base that is some stupid fucking claim australia is the fucking th largest economy in the world with some of the highest rates of disposable income in the world. Literally every Australian i know of that plays the game hundreds from my clan have completely given up on australian worlds entirely. Just because they arent vocal doesnt mean they arent there so please dont pull any more of these bs assumptions so easily turned on their head.To Tldr your assumptions if it costs more money for a company to supply a viable service to their player base rather than leaving them with squalor it is a bad business decision.That is why the green business movement or social sustainability movements took place right? Because spending money on the environment the community and employees gives financial return right? Because that betters the business financially right? Oh wait no they dont.,runescape,d2qh7yc,0,t5_2qwxl

We know the whole desert once looked different and Ullek itself got destroyed so maybe Crondis and items of significance were stored in a tomb or something considering Crondis hates greed maybe shes protecting them in the case of a more cataclysmic event in the future.Like an underground bunker sort of thing disguised as a tomb that contains letters from the past stories about what the surface was before the desertification of the desert things that the people of Ullek stored in the hopes it could serve their progeny better than it had served them and you need Hets help to unlock it maybe with help from certain heroes along the way.Just a small idea but I really think one of the demigods should be on our side should want to be active again in service of hisher people and ideals.,runescape,d2rok5g,1,t5_2qwxl

7529112,0,t3_4igyx1,PvM Should never drop skilling resources or complete items this is what causes items to lose value and not viable to gather the way its supposed to be training skills. Rather than dropping complete items like Rune Longswords or Rune Platebodies they should make it to where the monster drops an incomplete version that requires Skilling Resources to complete and that knocks out  birds with one stone. The same arguement could be said about Rocktails. Rocktails are very slow exp just like magic logs but they are good money. Not everyone would like to sit at a fishing spot for hours on end because it isnt worth their time. Alot of people do because Rocktails are in demand and it is a viable money making method. Jagex basically took that away when they added such a big drop of noted coal and magic logs so much that it isnt worth it for players to sit there and gather the resources manually.Many people think that bots will take over again but lets look at a common botted item Nature Runes. Before the average price was  each. After the bot nuke they are  each which makes runecrafting Nature Runes a viable method to use. Yes even after the bot nuke there are bots but the price is still above average.,runescape,d2y0umb,-2,t5_2qwxl

Nox bow arent as popular anymore so its going down along with an increased supply from people camping rax for fang. Staff is going down for the same reason and seismics arent used as much for tanking any more since hardly any shield camping is needed.

In reality youll go off and try the scam and the guy will log on a second account. What they told you is that to gain the scammees trust is you need to drop your own items to show them that itll be fine. Then when you open the trade to show that they will ddos you done easily by finding your IP on Skype or even going as far as ddosing the world done almost as easy on Australian worlds due to their poor infrastructure. They stop the ddos when you disconnect and immediately logon to pick up your shit.Bottom line is that these people are master manipulators and you should be careful who you talk to when money comes into the question whatsoever.,runescape,d2zswfi,10,t5_2qwxl

7619456,0,t3_4jm7ge,Barricade  Heal Other didnt need to be fixed years ago because you didnt have structured raids with huge bosses like Yakamaru. The fact is if they keep it in they will ALWAYS have to balance around assuming that someone on a team will be able to Heal Other while taking zero damage. That just means boss damage can continue ramping up at incredible rates introducing more and more mechanics that are instant death or even begin to REQUIRE Barricade  Heal Other to perform at all. That is not a sustainable model to move a game forward.And okay one person loses an ultimate. The other players get to continue DPSing or performing mechanics in place of surviving on their own. If Runescape had real dedicated healing roles and classes this wouldnt be a problem but anyone can fill any role with the right gear and levels which arent truly barriers that need to be considered anyone raiding already has maxed combat stats and likely T gear. When any player can survive on their own and any player can tank and any player can Barricade and spam Heal Other you have an imbalanced group by design. Cutting out options means raid design can be more focused on interesting mechanics instead of how do we kill people when they can be healed so easily while staying true to RS. Most people here are thinking way too shortterm. Jagex devs were too when they left this mechanic in the game in the first place. Keeping it around longer will cause even more problems.,runescape,d38ajm3,4,t5_2qwxl

This means standing md means you take less damage with range and mage. However on shark pool being md makes avoiding sharks harder. On sand pool is makes it harder for team mates to free you from sand. On tentacle its harder to run from the special. And stun should be fast anyway. As I wasnt really losing hp anyway i didnt bother to go md. Theres also the risk of missing a pray flick when moving md can be negated by using resonance as you move md,runescape,d3a784f,1,t5_2qwxl

7644164,0,t1_d3b31bj,If your idea was implemented then what would stop someone from buying an aura using it to get  or  or m xp then just get some of their loyalty points refunded to them? Auras werent meant to work that way but rather a pick and choose type of situation where if you bought one youre stuck with it so that you can just get your points back after youre finished using itEdit Also I said freebie because in the time you have that aura you accumulate more and more loyalty points which lets you get more auras and if youre close to a better aura you want you can get a refund for the aura you have. So say you buy aura A for k loyalty points and have it for  months. You decide you want another aura which costs k loyalty points but you only have say k loyalty points. Now your choices are either wait  month as intended or you can simply get a refund on aura A and be over the k loyalty points you need. If aura B the aura that costs k lp was skilling aura and you got m xp in that skill in say another  months you have no use for that aura so you refund it and get k lp back. Auras werent meant to work that way. If you bought an aura it was for keeps. If this was allowed you can max basically every skill using its respective aura and just returned it. Say you did this for the highest level Jack of Trades aura. Wouldnt be that fair if you kept it for a long time while getting its xp and then once youve maxed or gotten .b xp just refund it,runescape,d3b3mc5,-4,t5_2qwxl

7671778,0,t3_4kd33j,Ive been working on trim reqs for almost  months now. I pretty much only  have the castle wars req left and thats close to being done. I still feel like this req should be removed. I dont understand why something that is suppose to represent completion is so heavily influenced by one minigame. In the  years I had played runescape before going for the trim req the only time I had played castle wars was for ardougne tasks. Another issue is that something new is constantly being added to the comp reqs. I have nothing against adding new content to the requirements but I feel like its unfair to newer players. As things are added I think old reqs should be made shorter and the outdated ones should be revised. One common complaint is that itll devalue the capes somehow if we remove things. I dont think thats true since people today have a lot more reqs to do than people had to do years ago to get their cape. That said I dont  support your solution but I think its on the right track. If a minigame is going to be part of trimmed cape then all the minigames should be involved. We just need a req that shows adequate knowledge of each minigame and is reasonable enough where people arent spending s of hours in a game they dont want to play. ,runescape,d3e8j17,4,t5_2qwxl

7713472,0,t3_4kv37c,Man this brings back so many memories. It makes me want to rant a little.I dont get why Jagex doesnt update clan wars purple portal? It used to be a very popular minigame back in . A lot of the traffic used to be in World  FP Clan Wars when it was in the wildy. It attracted both serious and casual players. Everything was fine up until  or so when the content became stagnant too old and out dated people started losing interest. It needed a new look and more fun gameplay modes yet Jagex kept ignoring it. Then EoC came and made a very large chunk of PvP community to quit and later migrate to OSRS. OSRS keeps trying to appease the people with new PvP things but RS keeps ignoring it.Even so whatever clan wars community remains in RS it still deserves attention from Jagex so that it can attract new players and grow. They should rebalance FP multiway combat so that people dont get shot with overpowered DPS of large teams. Even in PP clan wars the experience is not so great compared to before and Jagex seems to be trying to push for Warbands instead which isnt exactly popular with people that seek a safer more clan vs clan type gameplay. Jagex even tried copying Rated Battlegrounds from WoW and made Rated Clan Wars but it failed to gather enough attention because of the bad points system. I think RCW was the only thing apart from making citadels for avatar buffs that you can actually do by being part of a clan channel?Moving the clan wars portals into a hole in the ground didnt help either. It is in an obscure place which makes you wonder if Jagex actually wants you to forget about it all. How would it attract new players if its not even prominent enough?The red portal is only being used to scam and lure people into losing their stuff and Jagex doesnt do anything about that either. Then you hear uJagexKelpie considering to remove Fist of Guthix. Of course its not popular when you constantly ignore it and force the related community into mass exodus to OSRS or quit both RS altogether. Of course the polls wont show the numbers because the people that cared have moved on to other things.The only thing that remains nowadays related to gamers grotto is NSers camping the white portal and calling FFA wars Free For All as clan wars which is not even fun with the amount of bots and gear switching macroers abusing it. Every time anyone has ever asked uJagexPi or uJagexKelpie about updating clan wars they either ignore the question or say that they have no plans. Why is it so that a content that has had a track record of being so popular gets ignored and never paid any attention? I believe that Jagex still holds an yearly competition involving clan wars and gives out prizes for it. Clan wars is dead content now and it isnt as popular as before but they still keep doing it every year yet they dont do anything to improve the health of the minigame itself.,runescape,d3iywcr,5,t5_2qwxl
7713544,0,t1_d3iioy9,Unless it has changed recently the Tuska Warpriest effect is  chance per piece to deal a critical hit instead of your normal damage  not simply an increase to critical damage.Each piece works out somewhere around about  or  damage per piece I believe obviously requiring  pieces to get any sort of bonus to begin with  that should give you a rough idea on comparing to other setups albeit the value would be slightly different depending on other gear sets.Bandos and Arma Warpriest on the other hand is odd you get a flat  chance  at   at   or  at  I think per piece equipped to reduce the cooldown on some abilities by like . The big catch that makes this set not even worth considering in my own opinion is that it only reduces cooldowns on abilities with  seconds or more cooldowns to begin with  so pretty much your ultimate and a couple other things like slaughter or bombard.There are a lot of downsides to armabandos that could be listed but most only occur when looking at high level pvm where warpriest as a whole is rather redundant  although I will note that there is some potential for armabandos I personally believe it will be inferior than damage boosting armour in the case of hybrid then void or tuska in all cases.Keep in mind you will not always have  items because of better capesgloves or using slayer helm etc  all warpriest sets suffer from this.tldr Tuska is like  damage to all styles roughly per piece on average because of how the proc works Bandos is meh because its a chance to proc on abilities that might not even be on cooldown and only for a small reduction...Man this ended up a long comment.,runescape,d3iz6xw,1,t5_2qwxl

7857284,0,t1_d3z855u,Honestly it would likely be smaller than it is now. They wouldnt have been able to add in any higher tier of armour or weapon without breaking PVP. The combat system was outdated to begin with. EoC was a great idea in theory it just wasnt implemented now. For those who use it now it fantastic. Theyve given up on PVP as any attempts to fix it have failed miserably even legacy PVP is nearly dead. So EoC can be very well balanced in PVM.If EoC wasnt ever added the game would have slowly declined rather than a big drop and  wouldnt have been added so there wouldnt have been that revitalization.,runescape,d3z8a04,3,t5_2qwxl

I got detected and was temporarily banned for two days. However I did not get a trade ban or mute but got rolled back in the stats I botted. So rollbacks still do happen but I think it has more to do with the account age. Anyway learned my lesson and would not like my account perm banned so I quitted botting now and am actually enjoying the accomplished feeling of doing things myself ,runescape,d42b90v,2,t5_2qwxl

7928476,0,t1_d4708dn,Yes but you have to take other circumstances into account.Like the fact that a lot of people will have invention as their last skill because they were already maxed before same with divination and so on. Also some skills are a lot harder but possible of course to get in a certain position its hard to get Slayer as your first skill and its hard to get Constitution as your last. You have to take into account that the game makes some skills more important than others which affects the overall order but also some skills are easy to get a  compared to others cooking or firemaking are probably very common first s as they are easy to get. Its rare to see someone get Agility or Invention as their first .So yes there is a huge number of possible orders but the distribution of orders is not that widely spread. Your order might still be unique but I can see you did easy skills and combat skills first and then the hardermore expensive and slower skills and of course Invention last because its new. This seems like a very common approach to maxing. So the chance that there is someone with the same order is not ! it is much much higher.TLDR The order of skills done by players isnt completely random so chances there might be someone else with the same order are much higher.,runescape,d478h9g,5,t5_2qwxl

8018819,0,t3_4p1rcd,Do you actually mean Cleansing Crystals? Seren stones are the mining thing. The gp per xp ratio of Cleansing Crystals used to be roughly the same as normal dragon bones on a gilded altar. Dragon bones and infernal ashes crashed pretty seriously after GWD dropped tons of them so now crystals are noticeably more expensive in terms of gp per xp. Seren stones are decent xp especially when doubled but even then Id still consider it pricey. If you have enough frost bones to last the entire hour then Id say its probably worth doing frost bones instead as the aura is timelimited and frost bones are expensive enough that its probably worth squeezing the maximum value out of them. Cleansing crystals are more along the lines of a modestly expensive but AFKable method and thus they can always be saved for just regular bonus xp or double xp weekends. I personally made sure to always do cleansing stones only under some kind of double xp circumstances so the gold cost was more reasonable.,runescape,d4he1wv,1,t5_2qwxl

If you use revolution and you hit the buttons too slow revolution might use an ability and mess you up.

8158360,0,t1_d4xajm2,Consider a brand new account or med level returning account who wants to aim to do Nex Araxxor RotS and Vorago. To do these efficiently you need  combat stats with  summoning  prayer and  herblore. Realistically youre going to want access to priff also which requires  mining  agility  construction  dung and  woodcutting. This would take an incredible amount of time for an average player to achieve. By the time they got there these bosses wouldnt even be the highest content. If the time and rates remain constant every time new content comes out fewer and fewer people get to see it day one. Higher exp rates make it possible for low level characters to catch up but not surpass those already high level. They did this many times in WoW whereby they lowered exp needed to gain certain levels so new players could max faster to see end game content.  ,runescape,d4xcd75,1,t5_2qwxl

8347582,0,t1_d5kzopy,Okay so nothing that can result in losing items should be mandatory. Lets do a quick review then.No Spirit of Summer so looks like you cant complete quests either since thats in the Wildie and that has risks of losing items. A number of other quests have unsafe combat so looks like those are struck out. In fact we can get rid of any PvM that isnt in a quest as thats all unsafe by default so already were gutting a majority of the game because you feel that anything that can result in losing items should be optional.Shall we continue? So PvP is out too so lets look at skills. Unless you train completely through MTX youre going to have to participate in combat to get combat experience. So since combat means you could lose items that means you cant max Attack Strength Defence Range Constitution or Slayer. At least with magic you can sit in the GE. No risk of losing items there! Oh wait I was wrong there was that glitch where someone was able to attack people and kill them in the GE. That means that you COULD lose your items by standing in the GE. That removes a TON more skills. Even then unless you bought all your gold youd have to have risked some of it at some point to get the materials to complete the skills. So since as you say anything that can result in losing items should be optional Jagex should just drop  mill on everyones accounts right away to train those pesky skills that could require PvM at any point or just tell them to buy some Bonds. So that leaves skills like Agility and Mining may be the only ones safe anymore though to train Agility youd probably be stuck to the Gnome course as every other course may have too much risk for you could die could lose a cake or something... Optional!So with PvP out and PvM out and most of PvE out its looking to me that this completionist cape is more like a complete everything that doesnt put me in the slightest bit of danger cape. And thats not completing the game. What youre really saying is Anything that Im not comfortable doing should be optional because Im sure youre comfortable doing something like Barrows but not comfortable going to the Wilderness even though both can result in you losing items.Sorry.,runescape,d5l01fx,2,t5_2qwxl

We can let them keep their spot on the current scores and make a new one. We shouldnt let them keep their hiscore spot for eternity just for starting the game early. We just need new hiscores separate from the  current one.uAccent As I said we cant hold the same people on the top  spots forever. They arent still the best at the skill. The monthly and weekly hiscores doesnt solve anything as once you hit m you cant compete anymore. Mediocre scores is what they might be to you but a handful of players would still participate in it. uMonzellRS Regardless of if they achieved m when skills had lower rates the hiscores doesnt accurately reflect this time.,runescape,d5lbu1o,-4,t5_2qwxl

Because you can only claim one island and the cost to revisit them is equal among the three sizes. Larges can hold more resources.

8425352,0,t3_4v063t,Something to upgrade Ports gear would be nice. It still wouldnt  probably shouldnt be BiS in part because the armor is tank armor but itd be nice for those who like to use Ports to have an upgrade. Raids gear as a step above Ports is quite a bit more involved than time grinding Ports gear solo so an upgraded set in between the two t? could be nice. As for the weapons I think an interesting option could be to upgrade them to t but have them degradetodust at a similar rate as t armor. That means they should last a long time before going away entirely and there would still be some incentive to hunt for new weapon materials from Ports after already unlocking and obtaining one set if you want to go that route. Drygores ascensions and seismics would still exist as permanent ts that can be repaired but degrading Ports ones would be an interesting niche I think. Seismics in particular are a tough gold bullet to swallow so an alternative and the cywir wand is an imperfect one would be nice.,runescape,d5upl9c,2,t5_2qwxl

Full manual just gives you more control at the expense of having to manually activate every ability otherwise youll do autoattacks. Revolution activates basic attacks in a order you choose and automatically cycles the attacks. IMO you can be just as effective with full manual as in revolution and each has its pros and cons. For full manual you have much better control of your rotation and if you know the abilities well can pull of really amazing dps. For revolution you have less control but your attacks are dealt auto automatically for you letting you put more attention into things like eating or prayer switching. ,runescape,d5w05d4,1,t5_2qwxl

But this update isnt aimed at those people. This update is aimed at making mining and smithing fit in the context of the entire game a game in which T armour should not require  mining and  smithing to create.I am  mining and  smithing.

8444694,0,t1_d5x3edg,Late reply was in a Kree instance.I think  being restricted to elite skills and dungeoneering would be the best place to start for now. Like my above suggestion most skills should be fleshed out and reworked as required as well such that ifwhen there is need for  additions theyre not a jumbled nonsensical mess like mining and smithing currently are but instead have a distinct logical path of useful content.Adopting the elite skill curve across the board is an interesting idea but I actually think it would be better to keep the current m   curve. Having such a large amount of xp to cover between  and  means theres loads of room for content when and as its needed and it means Jagex could release in batches of  levels at a time eg  instead of doing one big release of  which results in them being stuck and having rework the skill again when they want to add new things.,runescape,d5x4i0m,1,t5_2qwxl

The best way to make money would be tanning dhides and the list I linked will tell you the best way to do this and what dhide is currently best. It is very click intensive and boring however so you might want to find other methods that will be easier. My personal favourite skilling method for money is the divination skill as it is mostly AFK and can be over mh.

8473597,0,t1_d60f7j4,I see your point but I dont feel its very relevant. Skill capes dont require additional content to complete like comp and trimmed comp do. Jagex doesnt add requirements regularly to them like they do with comp. Thats why the cape isnt devalued over time like every skillcape has been. With regard to pursuing trim all of the methods of finding games that you listed are viable including HLF since anyone actually focusing on trim should be able to obtain access already. It sucks for people who enjoy the minigame and want to play it those that are lower leveled anyway but removing it from trim reqs would result in it becoming even more dead. Theres no easy answer for making it more worthwhileless dead I feel and I dont know if Jagex will ever really address the issues with minigames again.

8479226,0,t3_4vu0jj,This is just my opinion i know you people wont like Not a surprise though but read me through first. Its better to play alone. Because when you join a clan they will be looking for people to cap when the clan recruiters say they dont cap theyre lying because no one will join a poor clan... want to confirm this fact? Advertise a fake clan by yourself say you are tier  or just new clan and you will confirm this. Joining a clan involves working for people you dont like doing things you dont want  clan leaders are just plain basic assholes.  My best advice for you is to start your own clan should you want to get all the benefits from the citadel. Just you and couple friends with the same mindset you dont need a lot of people the more people in the clan the more problem they carry in the long run. Stick with just few clan members  should do. Like metal bands it will be better for everyone and easier to manage.  In my case i made a clan so long ago we were  members everyone shared the mentality that we wanted to reach  in the citadel we discussed about music or Patapon Games when we grew bored of capping if we felt like caping together we capped if not no worries at all there was no need for it by the time. Some people would say Thats how to fail at citadels your leading skills suck you are the worst leader ever and you should feel bad but we were happy the  clanmates nobody left until we went to college then everyone took separate ways i disbanded the clan and now i am a free man again.Nobody in the years as a clan leader ever complained about anything just like metal bands we worked together towards the same goal disregarding the time it wil take we were happy and shared this common goal toghether i told them i never was his leader i was just one more clanmate with amazing amazing working friends we leaded the clan togheter and that made us a solid clan one leading clan instead one shepherd and his sheeps This is what clans nowadays forget about they are just leading the sheeps towards a endless grind and pointless goals they say they want to be the best clan they say they want to be recognized but they are like any cult they just need enough people to be called A big clan a proper clan but sometimes the leaders cant manage a lot of people and theres when clans fail. Ok some people born to be leaders and powerful organizators and shit like that okay okay i got it go and become the president if thats true but a leader works towards the same goal as his workers not just order them to do stuff they dont want by saying Its for the best Think about the others.Dont join a clan people dont be another sheep for the shepherd. And you OP make some good friends people you can trust blindly and make your own clan theres no need to join the Power Hungry clans you will be blinded by the beauty of day one but the next week you will be looking for another clan.,runescape,d61g2kg,0,t5_2qwxl

8489018,0,t3_4vz43p,I can do up to about  on any rotation with a nihil i am sure some people do  nihil all the time but that comes with for me a lot of practice. with a high level boss like araxxor you have to learn how to use the mechanics you hate in your advantage. For example who likes web shields? reflects damage and heals himher? ew. Nah you snipe that shield switch to a shield and reso for a k heal at high enrages. Mirror back spiders are another one. For the second and third spawn of minions you can snipe araxxor as soon as you see the animation to spawn reso again and heal that reflect before being hit by anything else assuming it is a mirrorback that spawns. Same with p. just reso every opportunity you can and use preparation to increase the number of resos you can get done. Typically i only reso the ranged hits as sirenic has pretty good defences. I guess the main takeaway is to resonance as much as you can. and then of course avoid special attacks as well as you can.,runescape,d62oaf0,3,t5_2qwxl

8500138,1,t3_4w53p4,Hey Jack! Ive got a lot of thoughts about the mining and smithing update but Ive got just these Four big pointsI think the most important thing in this update is going to actually be a drop table rework rather than reworking Mining and Smithing themselves. Other important things should include that Mining and Smithing be rewarding enough in their own right that they arent just XPmills for Pvmers who want to get a comp cape.Mining and Smithing shouldnt just be rewarding experiencewise We saw from the Arc that though players are okay with experience mills that theyre not rewarding enough to make them feel that the content is entertaining and nongrindy. Instead you should be able to get some meaningful profit from them. I will accept that Mining and Smithing will not be able to be as profitable as PVM. Im not happy with it but Ill accept that as long as skillers are able to make a reasonable amount through them. But Mining and Smithing needs to be given a way to make profit not just making armor.And the thing that gets in the way of that is the fact that so much ores and rune equipment comes through the PVM drop tables and not from skillers.Those drop tables need a serious rebalance. Im not talking reducing the profit from them though I feel that its a bit ridiculous thats a whole other thread but in order for skillers to be able to glean something good out of this rework they will need to be able to turn a profit. Ore and some Worthwhile Armor needs to come from them.Moving onto Worthwhile Armors a big sticking point with the previous version of the Mining and Smithing Rework is that even through an Active process Smithing was unable to create armor that would be able to compete with PVM drops. I will accept than PVM armor could be situationally better especially for the PVMers that know how to use it. But Mining and Smithing should be the goto route for people who are just setting up PVM or arent big on PVM but still want to participate anyways. In doing so I feel that maybe Smithable armor should at least be on par levelwise with dropped armors.Having a set of armor that includes PVM drops should make it automatically better than the previous set of either smithable or drop armor. That is just common sense.This is the Active Process vs. Afking part  Personally i feel that Divination does it best Have one method where you gain resources for low exp have another method where you gain moderate exp but few resources and have a third method where you dump in resources for the highest amount of exp.Naturally there is more complexity to what you can put in and get out of mining and smithing You put in time money resources and attention which is the most important to most people and you could get out money refined goods and experience. If there was some way where you could decide how much you want to invest in your mining project your smithing project or your miningsmithing project and then get some sort of cash refined goods and exp appropriate to that out I would be a very happy camper. But ultimately that just comes in the form of different training methods.DO NOT BE AFRAID TO REMOVE OR NERF THINGS FROM THE GAME. I cannot stress this enough. Mining and Smithing need to be fixed. If you can find some workaround to fix it then great but I really disagree with having to keep content for the sake of keeping content. If its badly broken and doesnt make sense to fix it dont keep it around.Thanks for posting this thread btw. I know a lot of people have opinions about this update and Im just one of them. This is just what I want to see in these skills.,runescape,d642igd,0,t5_2qwxl

Glitter updates such as cursed energy and the new farming patch will not revive the wildy on their own I agree.But I also dont see the harm in adding glitter in the form of increased pet chance. I mean its not like the wilderness can get any deader as a result of it. Believe it or not some people actually enjoy going to the wildy for exclusive skilling rewards.

I also kill chromatic dragons BlacksBlues usually in tav dungeon with a portent to teleport the hides back to the bank for me. Doing this I can make about .mhr only using a few monks and about  portents in my inv. If you are doing this use an x arma xbows or an arma xbow and offhand demon hunter one until you have your Royal Crossbow. I only got my Royal Cross last week and it really speeded up doing this. Bring DFS for extra heals every few minutes just be careful incase your antifire runs out.Also do herb runs. Herbs are very nice money and seeds are dirt cheap. Pretty much K every  mins and if you do the Wildy Diary  you get the Wildy Sword which will teleport you to the Wildy Herb Patch where you can plant bloodweed you can buy seeds in the Bandit Camp for k ea  in stock or on the GE and that usually nets me about k in herbs every run too be warned you may get PKd but the cape vendors are banks now so there is sometimes one nearby.,runescape,d7bt2fs,1,t5_2qwxl

But Im wondering if there are budgets for the other games as well ex. is old school making up for their own costs? It kind of feels that RS is the only game to suffer by trying to make as much profit as possible. I feel like Jagex chooses for direct read shortterm money  like any business would  and kind of loses the longterm perspective which is killing when their is only one really profitable product RS,runescape,d7fuacm,6,t5_2qwxl

Ill probably use it when I start camping telos at first.Arma book does so much dmg its not even funny.What do you mean the bandos book is weak?????????!!!!?!!?? I get faster times at Nex with bandos book inspiration than I get with cruelty sharp maybe  the time. When bandos book goes off you can literally edit your rotation and dump your burst dmg with an almost guarantee itll hit. Id argue that its one of the strongest combat modifiers that exists full stop.Theres pretty good reason to use all the different books except the Sara book probably.Also do you even buy scrims?

9012583,0,t1_d7v3cuv,At  qbd kills in revo thats about as fast as it gets because you arent really on control. Then look at the qbd records that are under a minute and see what they do.For range you only really have to worry about cancelling snipe and rapid fire. You can squeeze in auto attacks at the start of ds or during shadow tendrils. If youre fighting a stunnable monster you can use piercing shot to youre advantage. You can choose to use weaker abilities to finish a kill to save the strong ones for next monster etc. Manual mainly allows you to to adapt to every situation but doing so requires knowledge of every single ability and howwhen they are best used,runescape,d7v67b2,1,t5_2qwxl

9017202,0,t1_d7vl8ol,I dont actually dislike the skill Ive had  in it for nearly two years and still do an hour of it here and there to make money or to make some charge for Invention. I fully understand the uses of it  I have a stack of  porters in my bank from Thieving I do Divine Locations every day in the Prif resource dungeon and I have a bit stack of signs of life in my bank from Divine Simulacrums. And theres my problem. Energy is used to prop up the Invention skill whose ongoing success is a contentious issue. The other things I listed are so generic that they could be rewards from anything. Why couldnt Invention or porters or Divine Locations exist without divination? Theres nothing really linking them together thematically. My issue with Divination is a relatively small one in the overall point Im trying to make. If my point about Divination was removed I think my argument would still be valid. The big impactful updates that Jagex are promising are getting more and more fundamentally flawed and arent content that most people actually want to interact with  at best they interact with it because they feel they have to. ,runescape,d7vq6sd,1,t5_2qwxl

9020807,0,t3_53r5t2, is far from what I would call the best year in RS history.January   pretty much only brought in KK one of the better PvM updates first PVM content designed with EoC in mind.February   was pretty empty after OSRS release caused TWW to be pushed back.March  I know this is controversial but to me TWW is one of the quests I really dislike. The quest started the trend the neglect proper quests requirements. A direct sequel to ROTM having no requirements makes no god damn sense. The quest itself is pretty disappointing too. There is hardly any build up during the quests and it all takes place in  isolated dungeon. The aftermath of the quest however is the worst part. The th age is a completely stupid idea. Your character stops being an adventurer youre now called because guthix gave you some stupid power. The quests are now involved in pretty much everything and forced into all pieces of content. Sliske becomes the joke character he currently is. March also introduced Warbands which gives massive amount of XP for doing something completely unrelated to the skill youre getting XP in. Kind of a necessary evil after EoC killed of pretty much all activity in the wilderness.April  Pretty empty mostly small improvements. May  Doesnt add a lot of content either more th age crap with god emissaries.June  Order of ascension was a nice PvM update but june didnt offer much else.July  Vorago was a great update although i didnt play it much due to a combination of my general dislike of the EoC and me prefering solo content. The other big thing in July was the first world event. A completely stupid concept storyline progression should be mostly done using quests not some stupid daily activity. The fact that it was clear that saradomin would win on day  and jagex didnt see this coming was also pretty bad. Were still stuck with that stupid eyesore of a crater too.August  Removed one of the iconic fp quests and replaced it with a shitty th age quest. Forced inclusion of the boring signature heroes. No requirements due to the th age reset. Lazy implementation of scaled difficulty. Divination felt incomplete at release and the promised partner skill wasnt released until this year. Invention didnt really need divination as a skill it either. Runespan the skill.September  Introduction of legal RWT and a nice task set. October  Had probably the best quest of the year which wasnt that hard considering there were hardly any quests released in  and most of the other quests were pretty bad. It still lacked complete quest requirements though. Woodcutting update was nice.MPD is a contender for worst quest ever. No requirements God and Mahjarrat thrown in for epicness. Really start of the horrendous sliske storyline.Rebuildathon was stupid and pointless.Sirenic armour was OK.November RotS and the coinshare update were good. December  Nice slayer update iin Airuts and a few more questslines were ruined by another shitty world event. was a year with a lot completely stupid questing stuff with some great PvM updates doesnt come close to being the best year ever IMHO.    are all way better than . And  doesnt really beat any of the other years easily either.,runescape,d7w5rd9,0,t5_2qwxl

I have an alt acc I have killing chaos dwarves for dragon pickaxes while I do something on my main account. Currently I am just afk thieving and doing the clues I get.

9247282,0,t3_570ov3,So as someone who has been vehemently against MTX since the early days of Loyalty Programme and Game Card extras theres a few holes in this argument.. First of all Jagex does not really cater their MTX towards the casual players. There are a few whales who spend really sizeable amounts on spinsrunecoinsetc. And these people alone keep the MTX promos running. Sure Jagex is always happy if Bob the noob is so tempted that he buys a small spin package and thats why you see events like Prismania recycled so many times. But generally speaking promotions like this one are not intended to reach the masses but rather the handful that will buy hundreds of spins.. Not playing the game puts you behind. Sure its easy to say Then dont do it. And surely it is hypocritical to a certain extent if I complain on Reddit then proceed to buy  spins. But this item set is a situation where not playing disadvantages me in game. Essentially the set rewards on these sets are so strong and influential that it separates DG into two categories those with it and those without it. The only purpose in not playing is for pride purposes. This is the biggest problem with MTX as Jagex does them. We can all bitch and cry about how unfair they are but its such a powerful set the itd be disadvantageous to not attempt to get at least a few pieces. Jagex over buffs the MTX content to force the players hands. . Jagex has always had a terrible customer base interaction. Its improved a LOT in the past few years but it only improves in certain areas. Posting dank memes on Reddit or Facebook is great. And the Ninja team is an awesome addition and when there are minor problems or tweaks that can fix overall quality of life Jagex is usually on top of it. But compare these to big controversial updates and the response is completely different. MTX since its debut in  has had like dozens of times now the same Sorry we got carried away we will do better  Ctl  V response. And whats changed? Nothing the promotions are getting more frequent more strong and more frustrating. So even if the community gets outraged like theyve done dozens of times itd be foolish to hope for anything but a Weve noted your feedback and passed it on .Note that other big games can be stubborn too. Customer support and interaction is a hugely lacking part of the video game industry with reasons that could take another post in itself but when you compare Jagex to other companies its a clear difference. Earlier this year another big game thats in a League of its own removed a very popular game mode called solo queue. Players complained and protested for weeks and this company ignored the Riot it had caused to say it was staying out. Still in the end about a year or  months later they said they recognized the importance of this feature and planned to reintroduce it for the next season.When have you ever seen Jagex reverse a decision theyve made that wasnt minor balancing issues or quality of life tweaks? Please let me know Id be eager to hear.Lastly There are good MTX too lets be clear. Bonds are a healthy addition to the game that allow players to earn their membership benefits even when they cant afford them conventionally. Hell Ive been a broke college student and used Bonds numerous times to save my grandfathered price. Bonds are good. Solomons is okay too for the most part. Its promotions like the DG outfit that are so fundamentally bad for the game and being blanket against all MTX in the current video game environment just is not reasonable.Hope that makes sense. Its what Ive learned over the past  years.,runescape,d8o5t3e,34,t5_2qwxl

However unless we get an enormous sample size which is not bound to happen everything is speculation because we dont know exactly how the drop rate equation works. Personally i have had horrible luck with streaking but that is just anecdotal. I am not sure if we can ever definitively put together good conclusions on this without jmod leaks. I think starting from  is good if you are planning on doing a long streak because normal loot is good. But otherwise starting at  saves an hour and would probably be better for rare chance. But maybe starting  is better who knows. Not sure we ever will. ,runescape,d8pwbe9,1,t5_2qwxl

9301178,0,t1_d8uysse,Dreadnips being overpowered made tons of tanking items and tactics pointless.You complain about dreadnips becoming useless but isnt it a much bigger problem if achto and other tank armor shield abilities tank auras tank perks and even yaks are all useless because you can just stunlock the boss endlessly and take drastically reduced damage? Why bother raiding for  months for full achto when you can just stunlock and tank in power armor?Hell dreadnips arent even useless just using them consistently contributes more dps than an active god book and theyre extremely powerful on stunvulnerable targets like telos and durzag pets.As for planted feet I think they should rebalance it in a way that makes it useful to actually use on your main weapon rather than being a switch. Invention perks are meant to take up your gizmo slots so you have to choose between one or another.

9303933,0,t1_d8vbwd6,.... Mizuyaris are like m. You take an average of like  or more accurately like . hours to get one and it takes around  hours less if you are a pro at Ornate turtle hunting to get the chimes needed to get a Fang to make the Mizuyari. Also you get an average of  Visages which make up around .m and around .m in common loots right now which also add into the money made an hour.Now lets say we can sell our Mizuyari for m flat. We then add .m to that number giving us .m. Divide that by  the total hours on average for making and selling a Mizuyari and you actually get an average of mhr.

It needs to be relative in demand and supply to t so as to not outstrip usefulness and ensure cost is slightly higher than t.  Then theyre talking about balancing for t and t items as well...  its just too difficult.All it does is make the items either exclusive to the top  become a hindrance in gameplay to upkeep or restrict usefulness.I personally dont see any other way working but the Overload route.,runescape,d8zstdo,2,t5_2qwxl

9346558,0,t1_d90q0py,Dont have any videos off the top of my head but some benchmarks to keep track of how youre doing phase  you should have it down under k before the web finishes burning. This can be easily done with zerking and adrenaline potting and can even be done without either once youre practiced enough. Slaughter and walk the bleed for a lot of damage but pay attention to the specs  specs dont go back to back so he wont webcleavecocoon twice in a row.  Phase  for mid and bottom path are kind of timelocked anyway so just lure into acid then surge up and wait  he should easily be under k this phase as well. If taking bottom then obviously just chill use resonance and stay in the light.  Phase  Just dps hard and pay attention to specs  he attacks faster so more special attacks will be happening. For minions remember that they spawn in a set rotation OOXOO OXOOO XOOOO OOOOO with X being either a mirrorback or a pulsing so take it easy on the dps when those are about to spawn. Group minions up and use quakehurricane around them with devotion and youll get a lot of damage protection. If no minions just continue as normal and dont bother luring acid spiders. Phase  Make sure you have  adren before you phase it then use an ability to break the cutscene and stall your adrenaline. I like to start off with zerk adren pot into assault hurricane to get it under k no more specs from araxxi. From there just pray flick accordingly and keep dpsing use threshes before you get dps drained at k. You should be able to kill it before you get hit by the core or getting hit once max.  General survival tips I like to have reflexes perk so I can anticipate more often  the window that anticipate works goes down in duration but its up for every special attack. Venomblood is also a pretty crucial perk saves the hassle of having an antipoison. Might want to do this later when youre more experienced with the spec timings. Use a vamp scrimshaw it heals you a massive amount. For the web you can do a few things run in and cleave quake or assault then switch to shield and resonance. I dont recommend assaulting since its kind of a waste of a strong threshold but if youre mid assault and he websmirrorbacks just remember you can switch and get a res in. Clear minions with aoe use sacrifice on special minions when theyre low hp. On path  having mobile is nice camp a shield for the phase and use resonancepreparationreflectdevo. Having a defender also helps here since it can reduce darkness damage and also the egg damage.  I have over k rax kills in duo and another few hundred solo so just let me know if you have any questions. I do my kills in augmented malev augmented zaros souls blood nihil and zerkerbrawler aura. ,runescape,d90qrw1,1,t5_2qwxl

The company had an open position for the job because the company wanted someone to do what he does. The company as a whole has stepped up their community outreach program and Shaunys position in that company puts him as the face of it. For a game developer as a whole I would want my employees who have roles in the game to be excitedenjoying the game that they would want to discuss it with the players on their personal time.I generally think what he does is great because Jagex should be much more open about what theyre planning and how things work. Im not a fan of godlike status for someone when there are true developers who dont get the same sort of adoration simply because they arent faces of the company. So Im not exactly putting him down but rather pulling others up.Take this thread as an example.

9375890,0,t3_58yiwj,This has nothing to do with lag or an issue on your end. This happens when an ability is activated on the same tick that the cleave is supposed to pull you in.USUALLY the cause of this is the Ability Queuing feature. I highly suggest disabling this. It can be found in Combat Settings press F. There is a little tick box. It will take a little bit to get used to however I strongly recommend disabling it. Note I am NOT telling you to disable Revolution. Revolution is completely valid and does not cause this issue. Jagex has not done a good job implementing it in combination with the tick system  and to be honest it will probably never be fixed. I have made lengthy posts about the negative effects that this feature has but to no avail. ,runescape,d94gl88,1,t5_2qwxl
9376498,0,t3_58z4qw,The money making part of Smithing should be smelting ores into bars. Like in Herblore people can make good money making unfinished potions for people to use for mad xp gains. If a similar dynamic is achieved in Smithing then I believe the rework will be a success.That means regular bars have to be only achieved through players processing them and that these bars can be bought in bulk and used for smithing with huge xp gains. Most buyable skills have a around  gpxp price tag so that should be the aim. How that is achieved I dont know but I assume Jagex have a good idea of how their economy works with access to all the data.,runescape,d94jd32,0,t5_2qwxl

9377072,0,t3_58z4qw,I put this idea in the dev blog comment section but not sure how noticed it got. Make the smithable sets the base sets and use the artifact armor drops like nex malevolent energy etc. and smith it to the smithable base sets to get the artifact effects and stronger stats. This way smithing retains that overload model if you made the smithable sets untradeable and highly degradable and keeps pvm profitable for those stronger set effects.TLDR mine the ore or buy from grand exchange smith the ore into bars and into untradeable and highly degradable armor PvM for say torva or malevolent or buy from grand exchange all dropped armor sets now arent wearable as they are artifact so they are in a broken state until repaired you smith the artifact set onto the smithable set to get the effects and stronger statsThis would in theory keep mining highly profitable if the ores could only be mined and traded instead of from PvM drops and traded and make smithing likely profitable when combining the smithable and artifact sets.,runescape,d94lz9u,1,t5_2qwxl

9384949,0,t1_d95kuut,Whatever the end result will be it at least seems like Jagex has intentions for removing some mining resources off the drop tables or at least the highest end ones if rune and stuff becomes more of a junky resource.The effect on potions etc I think is fairly predictable since IMO we already have examples of this happening. Uncommonly fought monsters  monsters that are annoying to fight even with current standards of potions costs etc tend to have their unique drops be very expensive to the point where it doesnt even make sense from a practical standpoint e.g. ripper claws more expensive than drygores or at least that once was the case. Recentish monsters like arhats drop essentially minimally valuable stuff outside of the rares of draconic visages and seiryus claws. Visages are at the alch price floor already but IMO claws are obscenely expensive. Mizuyaris are when done efficiently near Araxxor levels of profit per hour despite not being anywhere as difficult its just a time and skill requirement grind mainly. If the cost of potions rises  the profitability of combat falls I totally anticipate value skewing towards rare  unique drops. The profitability of common drops at something like GWD IMO contributes to stuff like dragon rider lances being th of the price of a noxious scythe despite not being merely th as good.,runescape,d95lwhu,1,t5_2qwxl

Best bet to be safe is phase to font charging after a special and revengereflect font and cadeimmortality when the SMP occurs. This ofc means you cant cade the first font either or drag out st to nd font till cade is off cd if you choose to cade smp. Another option is to bring ancients with shield dome spell incase your cadeimmortality wont be ready because you phased to font charging lateearly by accident.

What you dont get is that Jagex will keep increasing the effectiveness or rather making items even more overpowering to tempt even more and more people into buying such things. The argument Stop buying just does not cut it. If you go into fine details its analogous to how anti trust lawsuits work.

Maybe I had stopped trolling as they believed I was even though I wasnt in an initial comment which may be deemed as sarcastic and then decided to give the thread a friendly bump and move on?They acted based on presumptions and subjective opinion. They did not deal with the post objectively as it is for what it clearly is a bump and not only hid it but instantly banned me as well. This shows that theyre extremely eager to jump the gun and deal with things based on their own biased interpretations and automatically placed me into the same bracket with others who had posted with no regard to objectivity or the actual literal contents of the post.To reiterate its not a big deal had they hidden it based on what they may have interpreted it as but instantly banning is too far and an abuse of power and they have no right especially with no evidence regarding what was perceived as sarcasm. I dont even believe sarcasm was their issue here  they most likely banned because I posted again on the thread.

9491612,0,t3_5asseq,Im sure youll find that gear loses durability quite slowly in practice. When a piece of gear is slated to last at least  hours unless youre in some serious AoE combat youll find it probably lasts more like  hours.Because of the strength bonuses of Torva and since you already have it just use it for your melee slayer tasks. It will only cost you about k per task in repairs because it really does last a long time. If that seems like too much to you you can pick a more economical approach such as GWD armor or Anima Core armor which is the same level but slightly weaker.You dont need to recharge Torva until you have used all of its charge but because you dont want it to break while youre fighting just check it before every task and repair it around . The cost scales with how degraded it is so there is no penalty to repairing sooner rather than later.Also make sure you use an armor stand in a PoH. It makes the repair costs scale with your smithing level down to halving them at  smithing cape.,runescape,d9j1li7,3,t5_2qwxl

I personally know little about that world other than that high sums of money can trade hands there. That said its not technically impossible to earn such high gold amounts through bossing. Nex equipment and seismic wands used to be worth a lot more for instance and people who regularly as much as RNG allows of course got that and other high value items back in the day could probably afford a party hat and such just through bossing. Although such extremely high value boss drops are few and far between they also arent gone entirely as evidenced by stuff like Telos .

9603035,0,t1_d9wrcxl,gtAs a dpser shadow spells can reduce the damage the tank takes increasing the chance that the kill is successful. Fair point but I still would never put all the timeeffort into livid farm just for that  spell.gtVarrock tasks have pretty high requirements. Varrock armour has laughable stats though.The stat requirements arent that bad tbh. It actually has good miningsmithing effects. If youre Crystallizing granite you can mine double the ores sometimes. For Smithing if youre making RHs you can smith faster. gtAnd the daemonheim aura isnt very useful outside of inside daemonheim.Its not supposed to be used outside DG. And youre quite right. The stats required for those tasks are too absurd and the aura certainly should do a little buffing. However the aura still offers a fair benefit for its cost. At least a nd gatestone could be used for expert DGers especially ironmen who cant do sinks. Also great for training up certain skills with DG for ironman. However the rest of livid farm aside from the spells I listed are very underpowered. ,runescape,d9wrqzf,1,t5_2qwxl

9615069,0,t3_5cov2d,If path  is open absolutely  kill all the spiders. They output absurd amounts of damage I often end up using twice as much food on kills when path  is open. Focus down the Mirrorback or Pulsing first.Theres  sets of spawns  well say D is the damage spiders S are the special spiders. They always spawn in this orderDDSDD  DSDDD  SDDDD  DDDDD  For your first few kills Araxxor will be floating at over  HP while you clean up the spiders. Thats fine. Dont worry about it. Once the spiders are dead path  is the exact same as phase  with the egg spawn special thrown in.Honestly if path  is open I suggest taking that. Its easier that way at least in my experience  other people will definitely disagree with me. Heres my reasoning you have to deal with the spider spawns at some point and other than Araxxi theyre the hardest part of the fight. Why would you want to fight them while also dealing with the darknessacid mechanics when you could just deal with them on their own then deal with darknessacid on their own?One thing to keep in mind for Araxxi if youre using range if you sit back at maximum range the projectiles will take long enough to reach you that you can get two shots in the air at once letting you swap prayers less often  alternating every two attacks instead of every one.

I often play other video games  surprising I know  and sometimes I would use cheats right? Like it seemed innocent enough. Like I was having too much trouble on a certain part so I decided I wanted to just give myself infinite health. Then its mana. Then its this that the other thing. Quickly I find things are too easy and the game players too differently from what is intended for me to have fun yet I cant return to playing without the cheats  the game is ruined for me for a very long time and I have to come back after months or years to really appreciate the regular game againIm really glad that I experienced that before TH was a big thing and Im glad I came to realize the importance of managing my money well and seriously considering every purchase I make before TH was a big thing because well I could have been a whale as well. It could have started innocently and the next thing I know Idve pissed away hundreds or thousands even.Learning things like this the hard way like you have OP is rough. Im glad that you did indeed learn though. Im also glad that you were willing to post this because there are lots of people like you who needed to hear this and theres a lot of people who might have ended up like you if not for this post as well.I should quickly note that I do think theres perfectly healthy ways to spend money on Runescape but its so important to keep things like this in mind as you do it  to really think about purchases in general especially those a person might intend to make regularly. I think a lot of people dont think about their purchases until its too late. Anyway I really appreciate it. I hope you can turn things around in the future.,runescape,da1lz8u,0,t5_2qwxl

Crashing prices is a universal problem and it is by no means unique to frost dragons.If we cant have a frost dragon slayer task to preserve the price of the bones then using your logic we should disable all the current slayer tasks because all the NPCs unique items are crashing.

9857101,0,t3_5gg69a,Its not only Telos but bosses in general. If you look at Vorago for instance just to name a few bugs Vorago completely changing his rotation in certain ps  ps when all your teammates die. One hp glitch at the end of a phase. If you have a bleed during the phase transition youre still marked as having the bleed so youll take k .k k dmg e.g. on taking your first bleed at any phase. If you dont complete P straight after the third waterfall Vorago goes nuts continues to throw bombs on TS week inside TS for instance. GB rotation is simply broken if you let GB explode on you and tank the hit the next GB will hit the damage of a double bounce hit even if it is the first bounce.  Post calculation damage such as scrimshaws does not affect DPS during bring me down or phase   . This is not only bugged at Rago but also at other bosses Doesnt count towards phasing at Nex and Telos. Also Metamorphosis is post calculation DPS so its a total waste to use it at this place totally ridiculous.  Scopulus aggro mechanic is broken af Vitali are retarded not really a bug would be nice if they just became a normal npc. In HM the red TS is actually two squares you can stand on the eastern adjacent square and still receive no damage.Ive seen a lot of Araxxor bugs posted on reddit too. IMO jagex should focus a lot more on fixing annoying bugs rather  than on developing new content. As a sidenote I totally agree with the things you suggested.,runescape,dasej2c,7,t5_2qwxl

I get the whole friends chat already exists thing but A thisd allow you to push messages to friends without having to have them join friends chat first just like a regular pm. Thatd be something id absolutely love although unfortunately the spam bots would most likely love it too. That being said most people play with private on friends anyway so all good. B Even if you were with a group of mates in an fc already you may want to pm all the others without having to kick the friend first in order to stop them seeing it. If you were gonna prank a good buddy for instance. The best way I can think of is just have it so where youd normally click a friend on friendslist to pm you could hold shift and click more than one. So for instance you could click Bob and the chatbox would goto the usual To Bob . Hold shift and click Steve and the chat would then be To Bob Steve  and you could continue this process on to include many more friends much like a CC in an email. Coz lets be real in the case of a one off message having to pm  different people to get them in your fc to save yourself typing the message  times is still super inefficient compared to just being able to multipm. Plus some friends always have to stay in dampd related FCse formatting,runescape,daw2p8r,6,t5_2qwxl

9891171,0,t1_dawu6a4,I dont believe that is the issue.  My card was set up at the time to auto renew members.  At the time I didnt notice it right away and  month of members was taken again.  I had to go via CS to get it stopped etc and it was.   months later I recovered the account.  I then began to use the same card to buy membership etc  months at a time.  Used it twice and when I went to use it the rd time I was denied and told it was because the card had fraudulent payments made with it.  Yet that was  months prior and I had used the card already.  I will send another ticket that way though just in case but I suspect I would have heard about a negative credit at some point. ,runescape,dawucha,1,t5_2qwxl

9923476,0,t3_5hkgw6,The best tip I can offer is to pay attention to news updates and upcoming events as much as possible. Pay attention to any changes in the community. By reading the news you can predict what items you need to buy and sell in advance based on whats coming up. Huge raid boss pvm update? Buy a ton of food and potions now. Certain weapons may go up in price right up until the update. Sell a bit before the update drops. Pay attention to any information Jagex releases too they may give away hints about how to tackle new bosses that may affect prices. If an update drops pay attention to video guides on YouTube. If its a pvm update and a huuuge one chances are youtubers will try the be the first ones to get a video guide out there. Theyll have gear recommendations based on the meta. If the gear is something new that people hadnt planned on using then its a good item to flip! For example someone releases a guide to kill a new boss and you need something unusual like a Bone Dagger to kill it. As soon as you figure this out you better be buying out all the bone daggers in the ge for cheap and selling at a profit. The earlier you start buying the cheaper you can buy it and therefore the higher the profit. Dont just pay attention to pvm updates. Skilling updates are just as important! Pay attention to items and skills mentioned in behind the scenes that may get used in the update. If its a firemaking update that is designed to burn up a lot of logs logs may go up in price. Buy for cheap sell for a profit over time. But if there is an update that makes it easier to get a certain item then you better sell it off fast and avoid it. The market will be filled with it.  Tldr The best thing to do is pay attention to the news updates and the community. Especially watch videos of the popular youtube streamers. They usually give advice on certain updates that affect item prices. Use your knowledge of upcoming updates and general community mindset to figure out what people want.   ,runescape,db11ya5,1,t5_2qwxl

If im ranging ill have the extra range tab open for things I dont have on main bar that I mightdo need to use for example snipe death swifttight bindings richochet. Likewise when Im using melee ill use switch to the melee tab there for extra things I want to use thats not on melee bar. nd bar I have a lot of my defensives i need to use but also have the defensives tab also for things not within that nd bar. Magic open is good for when you need to intercept switch spells for a part of a fight or abilities not on my bar. What works for one might not work for others. Its all preference on how you want it to look and what you find easier same as how you have keybinds setup.

QBD averages kkill and even if your only have  minute kills thats still mhr.  Also... supppppper useful tip you do not need  herblore.  A pulse core can give a  boost to herblore... with the christmas promotion going on pulse cores are being used quite plentifully at portable locations.  Just join the portables fc go to a world with lots of portable locations and wait until a pulse core is used.  After you get the  herblore boost log out.  The way stat boosts work is every single minute you stats will drain by . but if you log out every  seconds... your stats will never drain.  You now have as long as necessary to make as many overloads as you want.ish overloads should be more than enough for bossing until you can get a higher herb level and get overloads without the hassle of getting a pulse core boost.,runescape,db7xzr3,2,t5_2qwxl

10029415,0,t3_5j70mb,I sort of disagree with pointlessly complicated since it actually had some similarities to a dungeoneering floor. We can at least be thankful it didnt blackout the minimap use random generation lock your camera andor have a timer. The maze wouldve been a lot harder if they didnt use several room designs and just kept repeating those designs. With the rooms you can see the edges and where the important rooms are. If this was one open floor with no rooms it would be way more complicated. I will say however the initial start popup shouldve been able to be reopened and a better explanation about the instance size limit i.e. why there is a cutamppaste x section of the maze around the edges and through doors that we cannot access. So not perfect but not horrible either.,runescape,dbeuzm1,1,t5_2qwxl

10059265,0,t1_dbiktrm,Well If were ignoring kill timesAn ideal situation would be as you sacrifice more and more dps you gain more utilitytankiness  in order to maintain the same amount of sustainability as you had while you were dpsing.Of course you would need abit of  balancing and tweaking as it would be hard to find this sweet spot where you avoid defensive abilitiessets  becoming over powered or underpowered in overall pvm.example if using stall abilities and using  healing from Effect ten youd probably just out sustain the boss while killing it slowly with basic abilitiesattacksAnd Im not saying to completely remove all your dps just a portion of it and of course youre not gonna compare to the damage output of a good dps rotation youre using defensive abilities Also you could... just use some dps abilities  while devotion is up or reflect or barricade or debilitate there are seconds inbetween defemsive abilities. And you would be taking extra damage from the boss being up longer but you will also be reducing the damage aswell with the right abilitieseffect you could potentially mitigate that extra damage of the boss being upif you want somewhat close to competitive kill times at the very least although contrary to what ive suggested you could just use the tank gear which would reduce damage taken to an extent and just go for full on DPS  slightly slower kill times but comparable if not better sustain if damage reduced is greater than potential lifesteal lost verses dps armour. Essentially a slightly safer playstyle due to tankinessdamage reduction but slower killls due to lowered dps.It would really matter on how the items are implemented. ,runescape,dbiqvyc,0,t5_2qwxl

But rather than going through Jagex to get a refund by forcing a chargeback theyre going to lock your account until they money is paid for the services they already provided to you your subscription. An  balance owing would also mean you charged back more than just a few months so youll have to submit a ticket through billing to sort out which of those months your account had any activity whatsoever on it and hopefully reduce your amount owing to just those months worth of membership.Unfortunately for you like a lot of businesses theyre going to have limited staffing for the holidays so it might take a while to hear back.,runescape,dblougu,1,t5_2qwxl

With practice it can become second nature and you can like only lose a single ability in terms of timing and if thats resonance youre not losing anything per se anyways. Its possible to use just clicks to switch to and back quick enough to be sufficient but with hotkeys you can really push your luck to squeeze out an extra attack or two before a switch.

10096272,0,t3_5key02,HiI had this issue last year. I dont remember what the JCoins balance was only that it was negative and less than yours. Someone had basically taken control of my account bought mems keys etc and then issued a chargeback on the account so it didnt go through and hence the negative balance.How did you contact support? I went through the different categories for support there was one for negative credit I filled out the form I was directed to. Heres the link read through it press contact us at the bottom and itll let you log in to fill out a form. You dont need to fill the whole thing out just whats relevant and add ANY info you have at the bottom. Heres the link also sorry if youve been through this already but posting incase you havent  I dont remember what I put but basically explained Id been mostly away from Runescape for  years hadnt logged in at all for a year and was getting all these chargebacks on my account from a month prior when I only just logged in for the first time a few days back to check what was going on in RS and found a negative balance. They contacted me within  days or so to tell me that they can see that someone else had taken control of my account and basically done stuff on it so they removed the negative balance for me and gave me some free membership for my troubles  Since its the ChristmasNew Year period it may take a bit longer but I believe Customer Support are in the office over the Christmas break. If you provide as much info as you can and explain someone else took over your account theyll be able to see that it was compromised and help you out.Hope this helps you somewhat feel free to PM me or such if you need ,runescape,dbnk4ue,1,t5_2qwxl

10097771,0,t3_5jcf9l,They could of just had fun with this quest tbh. The first playthrough is canon Sliske dies Zaros doesnt ascend and all that but then in the replays they could of gone all out with it.Sliske doesnt die and lets Zaros get the stone. He ascends in power while Sliske convinces Jas that hes going to do something terrible to prevent the Elders from having Gielinor and thus causing Jas to confront and destroy Zaros. This is an example of course and it wouldnt change the main story in the slightest. All it would have to be is a cutscene when you reach the stone and cutting out the WG vs Sliske Fight. Then you can do it all over again for another cutscene of Seren getting the stone or Saradomin and so forth.,runescape,dbnr5kw,2,t5_2qwxl

If youre only using strong basics manually and good threshults you can afford to let revolution take over sometimes. Its just a matter of getting used to the abilities and building a good rotation.

I think the biggest problem is the drop tables tbh. A lot of people hate me saying it but it is true. If I want to go bossing do I go gatherbuy a whole lot of natural resources and process them? Nope I just hope down to something like QBD which drops my bolts pots rocktails etc. You can get more naturalprocessed resources from killing than you can from skilling. When the gathering rate is so huge from monsters then of course skilling  the slower method of gathering by far  becomes worthless. Processing skills are in just a shitty a place. They are practically worthless because you get everything else not just easier but better elsewhere. TLDR As long as drop tables inject huge quantites of natural resources and fuck up supply and demand skilling with always be shat upon. and skilling needs overhauls anyway.,runescape,dc3ki67,1,t5_2qwxl

A lot of people enjoy the skill for the sole reason that its easy and a good way to make money. And for the people that do want a bigger challenge past a dark beastsabyssal demons task there are reaper tasks.  Where you say that people only participate in slayer for the accuracy boostmoney aspect is completely ridiculous as the highest income slayer monsters barely compete with the lowest end of midhigh level PvM.

If anything it would be less confusing since youd only have  ability that changes on what it does depending on weapon equipped opposed to having  weapon with weapon requirements that you have to juggle around frequently.As for prayers I dont see how pressing one extra button makes hybridding harder nor do I think thats a good reason not to consolidate some prayers. However one reason as to why it might not be necessarily a good idea is because of the curse prayers such as Turmoil that drains the melee stat of your opponent but only when youre using melee yourself. So having a single curse like that drain all fight styles when only using  fight style yourself would be broken.,runescape,dc7pork,2,t5_2qwxl

10269765,0,t1_dc7jn6i,Personally Ive found at both Nex and Telos the zerk auras maniacal reckless are better than accuracy ones. Remember that supreme runic accuracy is x. not . Watching my accuracy with metrics it is still quite high enough with maniacal but you get the nice damage boost so lately my goto aura is extended maniacal.    IIRC with t wep  stats and ovlturm your base accuracy percent against Telos is . Supr Runic raises it to . Without it you can still increase the base to  with gstaff spec and then  with reaper neck. Add in extra accuracy from maniacals mage stat increase and you still have quite high accuracy. So moral of the story when youre comfortable with the mechanics and can take the def reduction go with maniacal. ,runescape,dc84u5s,1,t5_2qwxl

10274513,0,t1_dc8nv09,gt its the responsibility of the player and only the player to learn the roles they wish to doFirstly it is the systems responsibility to ensure people have a fair chance to learn roles. If that happened and people didnt want to learn roles then I will agree it is their fault but to have a system that encourages a select few to hog certain roles at the expense of others then you cant say others didnt learn out of their own fault. Go ahead and try demanding to do a certain role in a group that consist others who do not wish to share them and you will see yourself swiftly kicked from the said group. Of course it is easily arguable that the solution for that would be to make ones own group so such a scenario wouldnt happen but that would mean creating a significant gap between novice players and experienced players which creates issues in its own right.,runescape,dc8o6yf,9,t5_2qwxl

10323123,0,t3_5nquja,I was worried something like this would happen when people kept making appreciation threads for the surprise updates. Yes they can be nice sometimes but one of the best things about Jagex is their willingness to accept player feedback listen to player suggestions with regards to updates. Surprise updates are basically how almost every other game company works and once the novelty wears off ie literally the second an update people dont like comes out people will realize that they value Jagexs communication with players far more than surprise updates. Its also worth mentioning that the reason surprise updates are so consistently popular is partly because theyre so rare. Theyre always unique and special and exciting make enough updates a secret and they become the new normal and once that happens the disappointment that comes from lack of opportunity for player feedback will be very noticeable. Dont get me wrong I think surprise updates are great Angel of Death has me super hyped and Darkscape was just unreal but as with so many things moderation is extremely key here. ,runescape,dce6lc4,3,t5_2qwxl

10356438,0,t1_dchr2nc,Ok thanks. I just find it odd that the damage reduction applies to the same style rather than something like either the style you are strong or weak against. Still useful in cases where you do take the same style damage e.g. can take magic damage at Vorago while using magic gear but perhaps less so outside of the DPS bonus elsewhere.,runescape,dchynv7,1,t5_2qwxl

Resizing arrays are not words that you should hear from the db guy if those words ever leave his mouth fire him immediately.

10474558,0,t1_dcvaip3,I mean the same general arguments youre making against the T prayers apply well to soulsplit.Protectiondeflection requires very low levels compared to soulsplit yet are hugely relevant outclassing it in tons of situations. No one complains about soulsplit having limited use or something do they? Why would they right? Its got plenty of uses its just not constantly useful and thats okay. It excels in some situations while falling flat in others that makes it more interesting.We see soulsplit has plenty of uses even if its not constantly strictly better than using protection prayers  which require so much less to get compared to SS. I think itll be the same with the T prayers and I think thats totally fine.Similar things can be said about onslaught for example we already have significantly lower level stuff that you dont need to pop off M for and yet onslaughts situational but thats not a bad thing really IMO. If anything its ideal since it breeds more interesting gameplay than if that was just a greaterinsert existing ability here scroll that upgraded an existing ability to do some more damage.As for the talk about flicking people flick soulsplit too is there really any issue with that? If that wasnt intentional or at least accepted and going to stay that way Id expect that theydve changed it by now given people have been doubledipping on effectiveness of soulsplitdeflects for years. It requires great timing to make it work and can easily backfire itll be the same with the new T prayer.Even if you somehow were prevented from flicking this prayer though thatd be fine it would just make it a little more niche.The core thing though seems to be the idea of it being situational and it being a strict upgrade I think a strict upgrade would have been fine but also boring.Just giving more stats for throwing money at stuff instead of demanding a bit of strategy is just skinnerboxing rewards instead of giving us genuinely interesting stuff. It makes gear upgrades boring.I hope we continue seeing rewards that are a bit weird and situational demand a bit of extra thought to be used optimally. They only have so much space up its important to also go sideways.,runescape,dcvee8y,3,t5_2qwxl

10475760,0,t1_dcvftn1,This. I dont think they realize just how much SSdeflects factors into bossing. You are sacrificing a TON of survivability for some DPS so it better be close to double the strength of turmoil.

10491650,1,t3_5q93uq,gtmore interesting and versatile boss mechanicsgtSwitches arent mechanics and they arent funNot saying I dont agree on the whole post but these  things I think are the problem and Jagexs solution. Combat in RS is in general very easy due to the slow tick system meaning that APM is necessarily low and secondly that they cant have any mechanics which cannot be predicted and dealt with ahead of time. Switching is a player born way of increasing APM in order to get better results. I disagree its not a mechanic and saying they arent fun is fairly subjective yes its sweaty dps for RS but in any modern mmo the baseline level of effort for advanced combat is still much higher.Im not sure how easy it would be to make any fundamental changes without a tick revamp sure you could add more abilities and mechanics but at the end of the day imo a single best strat will be discovered and then that be the one everyone will use it cant change by the nature of the fights in RS.,runescape,dcxc7fs,-1,t5_2qwxl
10491736,0,t1_dcxc7fs,I agree with you in large part and the tick system is a core part of what makes runescape more slowpaced than other mmos but even given that thats the case jagexs solution should certainly not be to throw an ugly bandaid on the issue in the form of an inventory full of gear switches but to actually address the issue. Even slower paced gameplay if deeply strategic is more engaging than high speed mindless repetition. ,runescape,dcxck1h,8,t5_2qwxl

But my p goes vigour switch gtzerk gt adren pot gt severpunish gt assault and that gets rax to under k health.

Im sure most people will prefer to be able to customize their scythes using dyes if youre dice or by other means. Having an override will pretty much make everyone use the exact same weapon.However like mentioned in this thread any customization add like  or so unique items needed to be coded so it looks like a weapon override is the only feasible option.Im still interested in your opinions and will do my best to answer so please keep these coming.,runescape,dd846ew,5,t5_2qwxl

I feel I might be left unable to effectively kill creatures I can currently manage because theyll be balanced around having stronger gear.All the mention of choice throughout the video rubbed me the wrong way too. Slayer is the skill you dont get to choose. Honestly thats been one of its biggest strengths but if you want to put minibosses in they should not be mixed in with classic Slayer.

10724421,0,t3_5ta9li,Yeah but Mage and Ranged do have a secondary modifier for damage. Granted its not another skill but it comes in the form of the ammunition they use.I could be using the best staff or bowcrossbow in the game but I can still massively modify the damage I do with them with the ammunition I choose to use such as Bronze bolts vs Rune Bolts with Crossbows. Just like I could be wielding drygores but if my strength isnt in a good place Ill be hitting for significantly less.Since we dont have anything interchangeable or otherwise that we can add to our melee weapons to change the damage that also act as a requirement to use those weapons in the first place like say sharpening stones or something we have strength as a damage modifier.If we made strength modify magic or ranged it would only make sense at that point to get rid of the differences between ammunition types for ranged since the damage would now be modified by strength. Otherwise you just run into the same inconsistency people are complaining about already where Melee is being modified primarily by Attack and Strength and the weapon chosen while Ranged for example is being modified by Ranged Strength the weapon chosen and ammunition choice. If you just decide to try to figure out some formula where the other two skills are modified by both strength and ammunition type doesnt that just convolute things a bit unnecessarily?Obviously doing the second one runs into the issue of making fletching completely defunct as a skill and hits runecrafting significantly. Either way youre either just replacing one inconsistency with another or screwing over some skills which would then need a rework or just making things unnecessarily complex when the system we have now is in a pretty good place...,runescape,ddm57g7,2,t5_2qwxl

10738259,0,t1_ddmr2ze,I personally try to stick to x just because it maintains the same kill pattern not having p  gets me into a different pattern where I screw up more because its safer and easier.The main comment I have on blood essence is the fact that it makes brewing much less viable because you have to use supremes. It is deeps but it annoys me and I dont generally use it because I suck. You should try using it at GWD and get a feel for it.Livid farm takes  hours now to complete according to wiki but thats for staying on the same world the entire time. The best method is to world hop so you can bundle produce which gives the most points more frequently the only difficulty is finding the correct order of worlds because it resets on some kinda timer you have to keep ahead of. I found my own by trial and error a while back but Ive seen people posting rotations here every so often. Doing that should get you borrowed power in around half the time  hours maybe a little longer.As far as raids armour goes at low enrage very meh.

10849203,0,t1_ddykt7f,Yes that is correct but you always have an influence on that. You can resell the weapon when it starts to drop or when you have lost an x amount of money on it and you dont want to lose more. The main difference is the money for the weapons is merely an expenditure where you can pretty much write off money over a period of time to cover the depreciation of the item where the codex is simply a cost. You will never directly get the money back from it. I know theyre both investments and all but the codex has a much higher actual cost and IMO way too high for it and the weapons do not have such an actual high cost unless it crashes and you decide to keep it which is a second step that has to be made,runescape,ddz0omc,1,t5_2qwxl

10863892,0,t3_5v70v4,Barrows are fine though youll find them less useful in regular combat vs legacy mode. However for general training or slayer a set of Bandos armour is far superior to barrows sets due to the significant damage increase. Because Bandos is what we call power armour it provides a boost to damage vs tank armour which has a higher defence rating at the cost of damage per second. Its a bit more expensiveabout m for the set iirc but worth every gp as itll carry you into pvm up to and including gwd and even rax if youre good enough. It also doesnt degrade like barrows so youll save in the long run. As to weapons there are very few situations where a weapon and shield or defender is more effective than dual wield or h. At  a whip is fine with an off hand dragon scimitar or enhanced Excalibur if you can get it. As soon as you hit  Id upgrade to a godsword. Bandos and Zamorak are both around m. A rule of thumb is that h is more effective against groups of enemies like in slayer where dual wield is more effective against single targets like bosses. These are just a few things to keep in mind. Hopefully this has been helpful. If you have other questions Im more than happy to help here or in game. My RSN is Lob Law Bomb.

10922153,0,t1_de6hurw,Lets break it down.  Combat Your combat XP at least for now will be coming from Slayer and Dungeoneering. You should be switching it up as the tasksdung go but eventually you should have  Magic Ranged Attack Strength Defence and Constitution.    Buyables As you start to earn more GP from Slaying you can start working towards the buyable skills. These are skills that require resources from GE as they will be really slow without. I would start by first working on  Prayer and  Herblore and eventually  Summoning. These three will give you the tools for bossing and making the real money. It will take time to earn this but I think that these are the priority skills for money making and is more efficent.  The other buyable skills are pricier skills which include Smithing Fletching Crafting Farming and Construction. There are also cheaper ones like Firemaking and Cooking.    Freebies When you are burned out on combat which if you are like me will be all time you will turn your focus to free skills. AFK skills are ones where you can basically just click the mouce and watch Netflix or TV or work on homework while youre skilling. These include Woodcutting Fishing and Mining.  There are some that take a little more work like Thieving Hunter Agility and Runecrafting.    Farming You can start this one early as Herb runs are profitable and ok XP. The great XP where you only have to check your Trees every so often is super expensive and you can wait til you have a good cash flow.  Invention RuneScapes first Elite Skill requires  Smithing Divination and Crafting. The skill costs money but you can make the money back easily as you do it. To save money siphon your weapons or tools at Level .,runescape,de6jle9,7,t5_2qwxl

10958533,0,t3_5wf5lc,There is a certain methodology to earning RuneCoins and Treasure Hunter keys Ive noticed. From what Ive seen though it is much harder to earn Treasure Hunter keys than it is to earn RuneCoins Having earned several thousand RC myself.With your data manipulation scenario I have a slightly less sinister possibility to consider. A lot of times suveys are geared towards specific people for example a survey titled CocaCola lovers Why do you prefer CocaCola over Pepsi? wouldnt really be a good match for someone thats a fan of Pepsi. Theyre trying to get people from their intended audience to answer the survey not trying to manipulate data to create any fake news.I remember one time I came across a survey that I soon realized had an intended audience of male african americans. Being that I was neither of these things I was not a good candidate for the survey. However I was curious so I hopped onto an alt and found the survey again  this time giving them the prequalifications they wanted to hear. The questions were pretty standard and were in no way meant to be biased.Many times these surveys with political affiliation prequalifications are simply trying to collect data on something like What X group thinks of Y topic. Now of course many of these surveys do not award RuneCoins. I readily acknowledge that and agree with you. However we dont really lose anything when this happens. If youre smart youre training an AFKable skill while trying to complete surveys so youre not wasting time. As someone who has earned and continues to earn a massive amount of RuneCoins from the few legitimate surveys I get rather nervous when people complain about earning RuneCoins for free and seemingly petition for the option to be removed. If you dont like the feature then you dont need to take part  but please dont demand its removal on the basis that it made you unhappy.,runescape,deaamiu,1,t5_2qwxl

11057744,0,t1_deki2sw,People do things that arent costeffective all the time. Using TT magic and ranged armors period Using Nex boots anywhere theres a noninsignificant chance of dying high reclaim cost Using scrimshaws often more expensive to use than the saved time Biting  gizmo maybe after longterm use Crackling   Venomblood gizmo Praesul codex prayers maybe after longterm use T weapons huge use of capital only real loss is depreciation and weapon gizmos if you ever sell might be worth itEven things as basic as using an augmented weapon or augmented armor in the first place. If for example you were doing combat on an alt for moneymaking the maintenance cost on augmented items would be a serious consideration.Fact of the matter is people care about more than just money. Increasing their personal records being better than their friends getting the DPS drops at AoD or Vorago increasing the success rate or ease of success at bosses killing more things per hour for more pet chances killing more monsters during slayer for more XPhr.More important is what is reasonable that encompasses more than just straight costeffectiveness. To use arbitrary numbers it is unreasonable for anyone to spend B to increase their DPS by .

Runescape started as an indigameLook at a game like The binding of isaac its framerate is set to run at  or  something like that. Soon as you change that number the entire game speed changes because everything relates to the frame rate. This is how runescape is coded everything runs through that.In terms of remaking the game thats  years worth of code to remake and balance.

11187457,0,t3_5zogku,I am not against more diversity. In fact Ive been trying to push Jagex to make special attacks more useful for a while I think existing systems like special attacks should be fixed first instead of doing some kind of massive weapon rework that keeps building on brokenuseless mechanics but diversity is not why people are complaining about ZGSSGB.People are complaining about ZGSSGB because they think those weapons are not enough of a direct upgrade given how much harder they are to obtain than T weapons. People are literally suggesting to make ZGSSGB better than their Nox counterparts in every way which I dont agree with at least in the case of ZGS since it shouldnt be a halberd. The point is the upgrade from T to T is small as it is and because Telos is a gazillion times harder than Araxxor with much lower drop rates it makes no sense for ZGSSGB to have various tradeoffs on top of this as well. Especially when SoS Praesul Wand and Imperium Core as well as the AoD prayers have no tradeoffs let alone ones as crippling as not having halberds extra AoE and attack distance.,runescape,df032kw,8,t5_2qwxl

Nox Bow? Nox Staff? Sliske Staff? Drygores? Zaros Godsword? Seren Godbow? Seismics? Praesuls?

Also I have also said in other comments that the fuck wow clone  thing is how I feel about it. It feels like its trying to be something its not. The way I expressed this was in a rather poor way. Was meant to be a joke and gave me a good laugh writing it. Sorry if I struck a nerve.That being said man.

11417037,0,t1_dfq2gqt,gtDid I say this was the only argument I had?No but it was the only argument you had made at the time.gtGo play some League and misposition once at a Plat level tell me how much you get punished. Smite? Same deal.The highest Ive ever been in league was D about  seasons ago this season I havent even played ranked but from the few normals I play with friends I can tell the mechanics havent changed a substantial amount. When I was playing ranked back then it felt very forgiving compared to Dota. I was making mistakes with my positioning that I could point out to myself immediatly and my opponents would often notice as well but I always had time to pull myself back once I had noticed. In Dota mispositioning like that can set you very far behind because of the simple mechanic that is for turn times. Smite is the same deal I was gold  conquest at the end of the latest season and GM in duels. Smite seems a little less forgiving however I found myself making mistakes that simply werent punishable.I get that turn times can be frustrating to players who like high intensityaction fueled games. Dota is more strategic and while I do appreciate that more I dont expect everyone to share my opinion. I was just stating how it feels like Dota is a higher quality game than League and yet League has the larger playerbase.I think overall the reason why Dota feels more clunky to you is you appreciate more reactive and mechanicsbased gameplay while Dota has more of an RTS feel than anything. I was just trying to convey that Dota has a lot more to offer and entertain you with than League does Despite me having sunk thousands of hours into both before youll get bored that is to say more contentdepth. I understand both games require skill and knowledge and Im not here to try and say that people who play LoL are somehow worse than those who play Dota.,runescape,dfq3yb5,2,t5_2qwxl

11441568,0,t3_639ik6,You should get a Dell Inspiron Gaming laptop  edition. For  you get the equivalent iHQ GTX  TB Hybrid HDD and GB RAM. Its also has an m. slot in the back that allows you to upgrade your storage whenever you want in the future you buy an m. SSD off Amazon and plug it into the laptop.  Why is this a better deal than your Lenovo Legion Y?  Because for gaming you dont need hyperthreading from an i. The only difference between an i and i is the fact that i comes with hyperthreading enabled. Gaming doesnt really require the hyperthreading performance which is why most gaming desktop builds use is instead. The equivalent laptop that Lenovo offers costs  which is  more expensive than the Dell equivalent. The next model up that Lenovo offers is . and that comes with an iHQ GTX  Ti and SSDHybrid HDD combo. Heres Dells offer For   more you keep the same CPU iHQ but upgrade the GPU to a much better card GTX  Ti and you also swap out the TB Hybrid HDD for a GB m. SSD keep in mind you can always in the future buy a third party . HDD and put it into the empty SATA slot. This is a very good deal and what I recommend to a lot of friends looking into gaming laptops. If you really want the is hyperthreading  more than base  gets you the iHQ GTX  Ti TB Hybrid HDD and GB of RAM. Thats  cheaper than Lenovos middle of the pack model.  You dont need to pay the expensive OEM prices of additional RAM or SSD storage. Dells Inspirion Gaming allows easy to do user upgrades additional RAM or SSDHDD swap. Its great value for its price compared to other gaming laptops. The only con I have with it is that the fans for the laptop are huge so something you might hear a jet engine blowing to keep the heat down. Another con is the speakers are pretty meh Lenovo wins that category. Other than those two complaints I would always choose the Dell one due to its valueperformance.,runescape,dfsw3b2,1,t5_2qwxl

11506234,0,t3_648sra,For  minutes I chopped yew trees in priffdinas with a crystal hatchet and tier lumberjack aura at  woodcutting. I received  Yew logs having to bank only once I used the Crwys bank chest.   GP value per hour  k x   k  I then removed all gear and autoattacked chickens for  minutes. I took  trips to the combat academy bank chest in Lumbridge during this time each run took  seconds to go from the chicken pen on the east side of the river to the bank. this means  min was spent not punching chickens. After the first trip back from the bank I stopped picking up bones and eggs.  GP value per hour  k x   khr.  Punching chickens with no gear is approximately .x better profit than chopping yews at level  woodcutting with tier  lumberjack aura and a crystal hatchet.  This is the current state of many gathering skills. If you cannot bring in more GP than khr from your skilling method you are literally better off running into a chicken pen naked and punching them to death.  Edit I would like to add that this also means you would need to catch roughly  sharks an hour  adamantite ore an hour  mithril ore an hour and  red chinchompas an hour to bring a better profit than naked chicken punching.,runescape,dg08dpu,138,t5_2qwxl

11534622,0,t1_dg36jrk,Yeah thats one thing I didnt like about Nomad in this fight. He doesnt do much other than attack you and the mines rarely were close enough to do anything. It was also a complete dps race before he cleans out your healing basically. Because he does the most damage typeless too so defence against magic doesnt work I killed him first. I used magic my strongest combat skill. I actually bought a Cyrwir Wand of the Elders for this fight for my second attempt I noticed their price had dropped and had been eyeing them for a while big upgrade from my Sunspeare however much to my dismay I couldnt really use it. I had to heal so much from the damage being dealt that two sips into my brew I was below  magic and couldnt attack with my wand. Switching back to my sunspeare after a few more attempts I actually did more damage in the end. The fight became much easier once Nomad was gone.,runescape,dg3g9s0,2,t5_2qwxl

11545027,0,t3_64rwrw,Raid fc is a hit or miss in general. A lot of them though are in clans where no higher pvm happens or just generally dont high pvm often but want achto. I do hate the mindset some of the players have though. I dont mind people dont know a boss we all been there. You should want to learn and improve not just leech every single kill and rely on your team. Mainly talking about players who are  kc and still cant do roles or go through whole yaks a kill etc. Obviously its expected when players are new to a boss especially players who arent great pvm which is fine but make attempts to want to learn.  Another problem is a lot of people cant be bothered to teach people. You make teams have people of all different skill levels and when one is terrible you people just flame them instead of helping. Luckily all my raids are with clan so I dont run into this often and havent been in raid fc in a very long time but thats how it use to be anyways. One of the things I find funny though its an open fc to the public so obviously youre going to get terrible players..its funny when people go on and then complain about the fc. If youre such a great pvmer and all and dont want to bother with people who arent good or learning go join a good pvm clan where you have other players with your skill level and not an open fc that lets almost anyone go.,runescape,dg4mpw5,6,t5_2qwxl

Jagex cited largescale server requests for the Evaluator presets doesnt have that justification...doesnt even explain why they cost much more compared to a bar.I just wonder how theyll interface with DiangoPOH once the bank update comes if presets were able to deposit skill armor and either destroyplace inside diangohouse the versitility in using a Preset would be almost as massive as gaining  bankspots. infact if youre not mixing equipment youre probably saving  or so bankspots per usage if skillsuits leaves no footprint maybe more so for skillcapes. unless they kind of ruin it with a passive goldsink or something.,runescape,dge5lv3,1,t5_2qwxl

11634281,0,t1_dgdbdj3,TBH for me I had to move to full manual because often times doing roles like tanking or doing vokes at rago revo would screw the hell out of me by firing a basic when I really needed to use some defensive at that moment. Plus with abilities that you have to cancel to not waste DPS like snipe conc blast fury asphyx etc I just feel like I am wasting too much DPS by letting revo do the work. Would love to be able to afk a bit more while doing pvm though like sending a message or something without wasting dps,runescape,dgerbb4,1,t5_2qwxl

11650905,0,t3_663npn,HeyThis issue has been on the combat councils radar for quite some time now and I agree that the current rate of power creep is making it more and more of an important issue.The idea of changing our hard cap to a soft cap has been on our backlog for as long as I can remember but has not been one that is high up in priority. Current cap hitters require the use of the dmg boosting ultimates or are abilities built for punching above their weight such as ons or shatter and these are coded to bypass the hit cap regardless. This has meant that it hasnt been as impactful as an ability rework for instance and a member of the combat council hasnt picked it up in the rare instances that they get time for a job from our backlog.Existing investigations in to adding the soft cap show that it is far from a simple issue and isnt as easy as just stating that dmg over our current hard cap is reduced. The change over would need to ensure that normalised weapon damage over time stays the same both before and after the update within a reasonable limit. A large increase adds to the already existing power creep and a change too small would lead to you guys feeling short changed on what is actually a positive update for the system. I would expect a soft cap to actually start about  below our current hard caps which would mean anyone hitting in that region would have their dmg lowered while pushing it higher at the top end. I wont go in to any more depth than that but I believe it highlights that the issue is not a simple one.So what will happen now? Well the combat council meets regularly to discuss issues such as this and I will raise the hard capsoft cap issue power creep always comes up anyway for you in the next meeting. Aside from that this post has lead to discussions within the council already today so Id expect this to move up in the priority list as a result of our next meeting.Sorry the reply isnt just as simple as a hey well go do that thing! but it is the most accurate and honest statement I can make on the issue.Hope that helpsPi,runescape,dggn7aq,23,t5_2qwxl

After thats done we have a nd QA with fresh eyes kind of run through the new feature to find any issues.Its really helped us find those minor issues when they take about an hour to just play with the new feature.  It really does wonders when playing with new UI or functionality since they dont know what its supposed to do .  They make those mistakes end users will seedo when first faced with the new feature.  I dont know what you use of course so Im not sure if it would fit into the routine but this is something my QA team uses and has helped us find a good handful of issues before the publish.,runescape,dggtay6,4,t5_2qwxl

Also once an item goes over max cash the marchers can control the price by hoarding them so they can affect dormant price by causing the completed staff to rise since the orb set value is based roughly on SGB and ZGS prices so dormant staff is SoS price minus SGS and ZGS price. ,runescape,dgiuhcu,1,t5_2qwxl

Salty about spellbook rearranging not making it in.I had a feeling this these complaints would happen eventually when they announced expansions. It amuses me really because its only because of community feedback Jagex isnt pleasing a part of the community. Releasing finished content would also help of course.What is the lesson to be learned? You cant please the Runescape community. But I think everyone here knew that already.I think people will forget a bit about it once Menaphos does hit but Im curious if they can keep people satisfied with it until the expansion  or if rushed updatesMtx will make people angry before that.,runescape,dgp4ae7,5,t5_2qwxl

It doesnt affect you REEEEE is a nonargument in an online game. Does anyone remember when you could have legitimate experience competitions with your clanmates or actually feel proud of skillcapes? Was anyone else disgusted with that one promotion they had when you could just buy  Slayer from level  or so for about  bucks? The ability to buy experience has completely destroyed Runescape.
