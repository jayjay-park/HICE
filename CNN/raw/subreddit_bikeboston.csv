3624385,0,t1_cpqql6w,It depends a lot on how big the protected lane is. The protected section of lane on Western Ave is wide enough that for someone parking to door you it would be nearly impossible.I agree though passengers dont have a mirror to look out of. Passengers never look.Here is a cross section of what is proposed.. There is a raised and separate buffer between the parked cars and the bike laneIt looks like its wide enough to prevent dooring.Now the pedestrians thats another story. The only hope here is that with enough cyclists peds wont think its ok to wander into the bike lane.,bikeboston,cq5enk9,2,t5_2sohj

4352261,0,t3_3aurgh,I would say take the minuteman bikeway out to Walden Pond in Concord. The bikeway starts at Alewife station. Its a nice ride with little traffic and a lot of cyclists. You can stop in Concord Center for food. Check ridewithgps.com for routes.  Have fun! ,bikeboston,csg8dm8,4,t5_2sohj
4688336,0,t3_3f128j,It really is infuriating. Boston sofarlifer here ridden for  years. I feel no more safe than when i started. On the contrary i feel more at risk now that I know what Im getting into. My girlfriend on the other hand is much less experienced. Yesterday she had a runin with an extremely rude driver... the guy kept trying to pass on a narrow road by inching around her left side but instead of passing he was tailgating her and practically hitting her constantly. Driving like a total asshole. Even does this up to the next red light. She finally curses him out and he says something dickish like dont use that kind of language just cause youre scared..... like wht the fuck man? why cant you NOT endanger bikes? OF COURSE shes scared!!I too would like to have a consequence rock but Im not going to. The way I see it it only leads to more angry aggressive car drivers.Im approaching the city about fixing some of the roads to prevent passing unsafely. Obviously this is the LONGgame.Id like to see more stencils in the road saying share the road or do not pass bikes until safe. I think its a problem that the bike community really needs to get together and discuss. We CAN find solutions! ,bikeboston,ctlibgi,3,t5_2sohj

5086285,0,t3_3kf7tg,What a nightmare intersection. Essentially this means bikes need to come to a full stop even when they have a green light. The separation of the bike lane from traffic makes it impossible to move into the rightmost main lane i.e. to take the lane as one might properly do if traveling straight here to avoid right hooks. Newcomers to this intersection get filtered into the bike lane well before they can even see whats coming up. I have not traveled Mass Ave in southward direction at this spot but at least I know that Beacon is a major street and I would expect a lot of cars turning right onto it. So I would take the lane. To do that now requires a lot of foresight. Edit Upon closer inspection I see the bike lane looks like it used to be parking area and you actually need to choose to get in it. If I were going straight Id want to avoid using this lane entirely. I think sharrows should be added in the rightmost wide lane here for southbound riders. Indeed the bike lane could even be given right turning sharrows to encourage bicyclists to use it only for turning right onto Beacon. But a right turn only bike lane would probably be doomed. No one would obey it because too many southbound riders new to the area would unwittingly get into it.The video shows that the gentle downhill gets cyclists moving faster than they maybe should be for this nexus and also reveals an alarming lack of bicyclist awareness of the cars turning into them. The motorists blithely cutting off the lane I frankly expect in Boston but the cyclists not even glancing to their left as they travel next to a row of cars was surprising. It almost makes me wonder if a sign needs to tell bikes to yield to righthooking cars!Sorry but I think the answer here is to get cyclists to take the lane. I would revert this bike lane to parked cars.,bikeboston,cuz39en,3,t5_2sohj
5096790,0,t1_cv0c9e8,It sounds like before there was a better flexibility for riders to decide when to take the lane. It seems to me that there will be more injuries here than before and it wont change until enough injuries happen beyond the already mentioned death.I wonder if the plants and stanchions are giving riders a sense of being protected and this is leading them to not make eye contact or watch for turning vehicles. Car drivers too may subliminally see this as a kind of sidewalk for bikes and unconsciously expect bikes to stop the way pedestrians do at an intersection.I am not up to date on how cycle tracks work at intersections. When physical barriers are introduced what happens at the places where motorists and cyclists interact again?,bikeboston,cv0cqqg,1,t5_2sohj

7360625,0,t3_4ftgip, of work for multiple years? Thats normal. Anything that moves on the bike is consumables.ltrantgtCars consumables would be much more expensive. Tell me about brake rotors and pads on car. Tires cost more than your bike.ltrantgtAnyhow for the cheap bikes there are BikeBoom in Davis. sq. Bikes Not Bombs in JP and Broadway bike school near Harvard. BikeBoom refurbishes the bikes. Its forprofit version of Bikes Not Bombs but I like them as they cater to money strapped people who need bike.BTW dont be too stressed out about bike theft. Yes it would be painful if it happens but its not the end of world and you can make it difficult by proper locks. You could register your bike which gives you slightly better chance of recovering too.Also if you have a home owners insurance the bike theft may be covered. ,bikeboston,d2eupcl,2,t5_2sohj
