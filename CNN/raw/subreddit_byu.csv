934460,0,t1_chah8mh, All but one of my instructors was Mormon the sole nonMormon taught me evolutionary biology. Class sometimes started with a prayer perhaps  of the time and the last day of class the instructor bore hisher testimony about why the LDS church is true. Honestly not really. Past a  second prayer and the previously mentioned lastdayofclass religious experience classes are no different than at my current graduate university. If anything BYU professors are even more courteous and evenkeeled than the other professors Ive met given the professionalism of the BYU atmosphere.  Intellectual criticism isnt taught and I didnt test to see whether it was tolerated. If youre thinking about attending or generally want to know more about the Church Id encourage you to fully read Wikipedias article on Joseph Smith and the History of the LDS Church. They arent completely unbiased accounts but they do a pretty good job presenting the known facts. I fully believe that the current incarnation of the Church contains many many many more positives than negatives however the history of the Church isnt as kind and I was very happy to be educated on the subject before I went to school there. That being said it was a privilege for me to attend BYU the LDS Church subsidized my educational costswere kind enough to let me use their buildings for both learning and residence. I was very much in LDS territory and it wasnt my right to attend BYU but rather a courtesy extended forth by the members of the LDS Church. For that reason I did not at all go looking for a fight on any topics that I disagreed on. If someone asked my opinion about some demon of the Churchs history Id be honest with them however I never went out of my way or initiated a conversation on the Churchs wrongdoings in the past. It wasntisnt my place to do so. I never once attempted to convince LDS members that their beliefs were wrong if anything I focused on the great positives of the LDS community and the teachings and tried my best to use them to improve my own life.   of my friends were Mormons every girl that I dated was LDS. I would start by saying that the majority of nonLDS students are the same way unless youre not LDS and from a different country you mostly make LDS friends. There are a few cliques of nonMormons the athletes who keep to their own and try to avoid contact with other students as much as possible in my opinion the previously mentioned foreign students and its quite acceptable that they want to be together... college is extremely tough adding on a foreign country and culture to the experience just makes it that much harder and finally the rebels that specifically go out of their way for whatever reason to break the Honor Code and defy BYUs policies. I didnt really associate with the last couple of groups Im not a foreign student nor was I interested in getting kicked out if anything I was closest to some of the athletes as a result of spending time in the gym and trying out a few times spectacularly unsuccessfully for the football team.,byu,chai4bn,5,t5_2qncw

3302552,0,t1_cp3x9l1,Exactly. I would love to leave BYU but I graduate this semester and it would be pointless and silly for me to try to transfer. I parted with the church a little over a year ago and since my major is a small one I would have basically had to start over if I went to a different school.

You will want to meet then with your major advisement center after admission to complete this process. If you would like more information about how credits will transfer the above link has some transfer guides or you can fill out a transfer evaluation form which might require your documents to be evaluated by IERF first. Just so you know you can apply with more or less than  credits. The only rule is that if you apply with fewer than  credits you will also be required to submit your high school transcripts and an ACT or SAT score. If you apply with  credits you will not be required to provide either one. For more information about admission to BYU you should visit admissions.byu.edu,byu,ct2ybzg,2,t5_2qncw

Regardless of your specialty youd think that by the time you got a PhD youd know how to research things and think through problems instead of deciding that the youth of the Church have gone off the deep end with their socialist ideals of caring for poor people and not wanting elections to be bought by the billionaire class to the detriment of the nation.,byu,d08gni5,5,t5_2qncw
7186741,0,t1_d1v29g4,Unfortunately it seems to be  Someone else copied a comment they got of Facebook from a friend who went to this event as wellgtI was at this event tonight  things got a little heated for a minute because a survivor student brought up honor code during the QampA because she had been through them twice for sexual assault and directly addressed the title IX coordinator who stood up and responded that they do not apologize for abiding by an honor code so integral to BYU. The interaction was shut down right after the student responded with you dont apologize? and the event continued on the topic it intended to discuss. It was an overall good event everyone clapped after the student stated that it wasnt right what the honor code did to her. Im sure most people in the room agreed with the victim including those who organized the event but if they let the discussion unfold Im sure BYU would question letting events like it happen in the future. And they dont have the power to change that directly. Im not sure. I certainly do not agree with the Honor Code on most fronts.gtIn this regard pretty much the only safe place on campus is the counseling center. I would also agree that most universities deal with this topic poorly  watch the Hunting Ground. Additionally title IX has only just started dealing with sexual assault so most campuses are just learning what their place is in the whole thing.gtIt was also stated that Provo Police doesnt report to the Honor Code office but thats also a lie  multiple people I know have been called into the honor code office because of Provo Police. But it might just be with underage drinking. Not sure about sexual assault.My wife was in the Psychology program at BYU when we were there and yeah she definitely agrees on the comment that the counseling center is the only actually safe place where they WONT tattle on you to the HCO.

You can of course develop deeper friendships too. In heritage you have  ? dudes in an apartment. Youll get to know them really well. This is great if you get along it sucks if you dont.

11713042,0,t1_dgmn7ha,Thank you!   He would absolutely sign and uphold the honor code.  And I think he would thrive in an environment like this.  Hes always been always a very wholesome person.   Switched at birth?.    He even has blond hair and blue eyes unlike anyone else but there are recessive genes hes our kid.    Hes a camp counselor and has always loved to work with younger kids.   Hes a natural leader and so encouraging of others.  When we met all the mormons in Farmington he just lit up with all the talk and the tours of the rituals and the familyfocus.   It wasnt exactly a conversion I doubt it but I could tell he liked it.  I just want him to find a community he would do well with.   The question is whether his outsider non lds status would work against this and he should fit in but doesnt.  Well need to go there and look into it more.  Thanks for all the replies!   Very helpful.  ,byu,dgnpb37,2,t5_2qncw
