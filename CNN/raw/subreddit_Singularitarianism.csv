Im gonna get stoned watch Cosmos and try ruminating existence from a vantage point closer to your own. ,Singularitarianism,cgdzy6o,2,t5_2tsd0
792746,0,t3_237lu9,Nope. This might be the case I.e. Is the copy still you? but it might be the case that you can actually transfer. This discussion has been done to death and the only thing I want to hear about it after this is what they find when they actually attempt it. There is no way to know beforehand.,Singularitarianism,cgue0fz,1,t5_2tsd0
794178,0,t1_cgu9ase,Yes even if a person made a copy of his mind that person still dies biologically. I think the point that Kurzweil is making is that the copy can take off where you left. Workwise it appears like the copy is a continuity of the living self. For the scientific advancement of mankind there is no distinction between a biological or an artificial mind.For a scientistresearcher like Kurzweil the idea must be enticing because there is a philosophical motivation behind his work it means that he can die without worrying about the fact that his work is gonna keep going.,Singularitarianism,cgujv6g,2,t5_2tsd0
