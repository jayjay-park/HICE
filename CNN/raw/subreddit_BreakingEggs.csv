4638745,0,t3_3eg7el,By cubed venison do you mean cut in cubes or punctured like cube steak?  Assuming you mean cut in cubes  Get yourself some bacon red wine carrots onions garlic thyme rosemary salt pepper.  Season the meat with salt amp pepper set aside.  In a large heavy pot Dutch oven big skillet etc fry up the bacon until crisp.  Remove the bacon amp crumble it set aside.  Save about TB of bacon fat per pound of venison.  On high heat sear the venison pieces on all sides in the bacon fat.  Work in batches as needed so the pan isnt crowded.  Remove from pan set aside.  Reduce heat to medium.  Add some chopped onion a few cloves of garlic and about a teaspoon each of rosemary amp thyme per pound of meat to the pot.  Cook until onions are softened.  Add about  cups of red wine per pound of meat to the pot and cook for a couple minutes stirring amp scraping the bottom of the pan.  Add the meat back in.  You can stop at this point and refrigerate overnight continuing the next day.  You could also dump everything into a Crockpot at this point cooking it on high for about  hours.    Bring to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer and cook for  minutes stirring occasionally.  Add the carrots and cook for  more minutes.  If the sauce is thin you can thicken it with a cornstarch slurry equal parts cornstarch amp cold water mixed in a separate bowl then stirred into the hot food.  When serving top with crumbled bacon.  Great served with mashed potatoes.  ,BreakingEggs,ctfa59b,1,t5_38vur

Top with cheese lots of cheese  FWIW I tend to grab two meals out of this. One day I get a rotiesserie chicken adn serve that for supper. Then I take the bonesskinfat from the chicken literally everything in the container we dont eat the dog hates this and put it in the Crock cover with water add some bay leaves. Do that overnight and you have delicious homemade stock. The next day I use the stock and add in vegetables. Because Im lazy and its easy I often just get a big bag of frozen California blend vegetables a blend of broccoli carrots and cauliflower and then make my blended soup from that usually throwing in an onion or a potato if we have any laying around. Its delicious and super simple and super cheap. ,BreakingEggs,cu74qx1,2,t5_38vur

I sometimes use their meal planning features but more usually I just write it on my physical calendar.A few years ago before I started doing my LCHF diet I had  aplan for each week. Day | Meal|Monday | Grilled ChickenTuesday | Tacos chicken or beefWednesday | PastaThursday | CasseroleFridaySaturday| HamburgersNachosBreakfast we ended up going out with family often on one or both of those nights so I wanted something that could be easily skippedSunday | Beef Pot roast or somethingFor us this worked really well. The meals with probable leftovers were spread out enough to allow for lunches and there werent many nights that felt repetitive. It doesnt work as well now because my diet doesnt really allow for pasta dinners or many casseroles.

5846038,0,t1_cxlwz0k,Heres my typical recipe. Get some bread preferably something a little crusty or stale.  If thats not available toast some bread.  Youll need about  cup in volume.  Break it up into smallish pieces cm x cm and soak it in about  c of milk.  I never measure the milk I just pour in enough that it gets totally soaked up by the bread and makes the bread super soggy..  While thats soaking chop up some veggies in pieces the smaller they are the quicker they will steam.  I go for whatever I have around really.  Steam them until they are soft enough to puree easily and then put them in the food processor along with the now soggy panade and buzz until its smooth..  Saute onions and garlic until they are translucent or if you are feeling decadent caramelize them in butter.  Our family goes through onions like water so Im never shy but if your family isnt into onions its totally fine to skip this step..  Combine the veggiepanade mixture with the onions garlic and whatever herbsspices you want.  I usually go for things like rosemary parsley marjoram thyme coriander and of course salt and pepper.  Sometimes I get real fancy and put in some Parmesan cheese..  Mix this into your meat with your hands.  Anything other than your hands will mix unevenly and mess everything up.  I usually use the big  pound container of ground turkey and  links of italian sausage.  If you use turkey or chicken you gotta add a little extra fat because they are so lean that it makes for dry meatloaf and sausage works great..  Form a loaf or put the mix into a loaf pan then bake at F until the center temps at F.  I really dont know how much time this takes mostly because it depends on the shape that you make.I use this same exact recipe for meatballs I just roll it into a metric ton of little meatballs.  It makes  standard loaf pans full so after I finish baking them I cut the loaves in half.  I serve one half to my family then wrap and freeze the other  pieces because they freeze really well.  When I do meatballs I freeze those too. ,BreakingEggs,cxlxz3r,2,t5_38vur
5886176,0,t1_cxmuu6y,It definitely adds a little tang to the filling which has a less crumbly texture.  I mostly like it from a whole food perspective  its four ingredients   oz package cream cheese room temperature  cup salted butter  teaspoon peppermint extract  lbs. powdered sugarYou just beat the cream cheese and butter in your stand mixer until fluffy add extract and powdered sugar  cup at a time.  The mixture is smooth like a stiff dough and easy to form.I let them dry on the counter overnight but then store them in the fridge.  You can use food coloring and candy molds to shape and just toss molded mint in superfine sugar or dip in melted chocolate.,BreakingEggs,cxr7m2i,1,t5_38vur
