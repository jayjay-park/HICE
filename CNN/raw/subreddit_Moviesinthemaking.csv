It can be caused by taking several very deep breaths or hyperventilating just before a dive.

A lot of movies that go to Imax use film because the Imax cameras use film and it will blend together with the rest of the footage better. But George Miller didnt use film.

With Star Wars the entire production is crafted to near perfection hoping that with every year the films will never run stale. With video game movies it feels as if the production is made as a cashgrab. There is no love or not enough effort or care to show audiences a really good movie. From lazy writing to substandard CGI you cant convince an audience that your movie is worth seeing especially when your up against Rogue One.
