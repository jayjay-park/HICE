3359097,0,t1_cpaz8vt,You shouldnt dismiss the gem defense. If you keep upgrading it you can get up to  defense chance.,kot,cpb5uei,1,t5_36u4k

3924314,0,t3_35e1me,Yeah exploiting bugs. Youre a genius congrats.Edit Ok apparently theres a way to do this. There are so many glitched dungeons lately that Ive an easy trigger now.,kot,cr3lvxl,-4,t5_36u4k
3969192,0,t1_cr7n9an,This is not a hacked base. It can be done using the gap and leap off at the highest point of the right corner. I had a similar set up before in the old engine. You are able to raid the base in the old engine if the base was saved with it.,kot,cr8pzae,1,t5_36u4k
3975816,0,t1_cr9fqkl,No it can be done on any map. If youre curious about this just google it! But I highly recommend not using it since itll get you banned.,kot,cr9h68q,1,t5_36u4k

4164216,0,t1_cruudho,You seem to have completely avoided my question.  You are also ignoring the fact that anyone recovering gems will help the delta of the entire guild.  Someone who sits at  but helps recover the gems at others is more of a team player than someone that just worried about their own gems not saying this is you just providing an example.  Plus more players in the guild mean more players benefit from the payout.Congrats on your k but for any guilds Ive seen it would be a waste.  My guilds current opponent is at .  I could beat them on my own sitting at .  The highest delta only helps kings league and doesnt do much for your guild.  A win is a win and the payouts are always  per player.  Higher deltas just hurt your ability to keep growing in further matches sooner or later you will hit the cap.,kot,cruxhes,1,t5_36u4k

4976130,0,t1_culrr66,Oh yeah I didnt mean to tell you but to anyone who happens to see this video. Youre going to change bases kind of fast so Id say paying orbs for a different set of traps is not worth it.,kot,culs0xn,1,t5_36u4k
5946718,0,t3_3wcjc4,I am at  k but only been playing for about  days. I will need a guild when Im out of wooden league. ,kot,cxz583q,1,t5_36u4k
6197551,0,t3_406vhq,You could put your traps closer together. Its easier to get over one trap and then over the next one than get over two traps at the same time. So combine the power of your traps,kot,cyu3fzq,2,t5_36u4k
6563464,0,t3_450j5q,Exact same thing happened to me. Two gbs in two days from kot ads. Ridiculous.,kot,czy7tnm,1,t5_36u4k
6645825,0,t3_46ig8b,Absolutely! Check out this website Look at Base Projects. It helped me a lot. Youll want to find your base layout and then browse the trap set ups. Youll want to find the ones that have a video guide on how to beat them. Be warned though. Some of the highly rated setups arent worth it or two hard to beat even with the guide. Eventually youll learn some tricks on how to set up your own dungeons too.,kot,d06qih4,2,t5_36u4k
6676518,0,t3_437r6h,How much would you piss off if you were me in this case? That was my brandnew layout I was sure it was pretty hard until the greatest luck hit me ,kot,d09wrqb,2,t5_36u4k
7120035,0,t1_d1nfqrq,For the red guard you need to jump at the last second just before it gets to you from the ground.I had a base with a jump like that before I moved to my current one. Its kind of consistent once you know how to do it.,kot,d1ngni9,2,t5_36u4k

7504018,0,t1_d2toykg,still whats the point of bothering with making a good base if it doesnt matter whether or not they beat it cleanly? they steal my biggest gem literally every time its stupid and makes the game not fun.,kot,d2v61t2,1,t5_36u4k
7504395,0,t1_d2v6498,If you beat all the single player dungeons then you get a free k gem every other day. You just started so you dont realize how meaningless k gems are.,kot,d2v7lmp,2,t5_36u4k
7691145,0,t3_4kk5yn,Gotta save up for better thrones that give you greater steal chance. ,kot,d3gfmkv,1,t5_36u4k
7880354,0,t1_d41shwh,you were wrong in assuming i was bad too this is why you dont say you are bad at the game without actually knowing how that person is doing. dont randomly throw it out in an argument its common sense.lesson learned?,kot,d41tpxn,2,t5_36u4k
7941982,0,t1_d48mcif,I have seen  different this one gave  orbs ritual bonus. So the two other gems get sucked into the unique gem and you can do it again until it gets stolen. Getting promoted and demoted averages  orbs per day for me so this gem was still a  increase to the total amount. ,kot,d48r40x,1,t5_36u4k
8274616,0,t3_4snf08,Yes save up all your orbs the first thing you should buy are extra gem slots.other things to spend orbs on are respins for big gems only and after ritual respins to get eyeballs save them all for forseer throne.After that save orbs for combining your biggest gems and rushing the ritual if you filled all your space with larger gems,kot,d5bvw47,1,t5_36u4k
8324098,0,t3_4m25pi,My guild is currently full but I am about to free up a few slots by kicking some inactive players. I regularly check to make sure as many people are playing as possible but I do allow some time to be fair as I understand everyone has lives to attend to. Mostly people who join and then do nothing after one guild battle eventually get removed.Our current total is about .m with minimum requirements of just k. The name is Thievs I didnt spell it wrong I wish we could rename guilds if we get promoted to leader lolWere usually about  players active per round but I would like to have closer to  activity going forward so we stand a better chance. Active players are very friendly in game chat and most gems end up being retrieved.Just to check OP do you update the details yourself or do you require leaders to post back periodically?,kot,d5i2fnz,1,t5_36u4k

10481292,0,t3_5pn1sx,Ive read that the default trap is the one trap thats present in all three base trap options.  i.e. if the red guard is present on all three trap options for the current base thats the default trap.  Havent tested this though.Ive also heard what you posted that if you edit base and stack all the traps the one that drags out is the default trap,kot,dcw5van,1,t5_36u4k
