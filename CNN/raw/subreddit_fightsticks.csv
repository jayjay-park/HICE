4063212,0,t1_crjewbr,Yeah I did for some reason it was way more expensive than it should have been when I did it. It was about  for the faster one and  for the slower one not idea why. It came out to be slightly cheaper than buying it here though even with the shipping cost.,fightsticks,crjfofz,1,t5_2uvie

Putting them back in is even easier just press them in and you are good.If you are unsure just check youtube there is a lot of video footage of people modding their sticks and they show you how to do it.,fightsticks,d1jkzut,2,t5_2uvie

10420923,0,t3_5p3k9d,Ive been using a large actuator for about a year and its really good when it comes to sharp movements but it feels very blocky with a square gate not a bad thing  Ive also switched out the spring to a heavy lb and Ive also switch the gates a few times. My recommendation is to buy it and experiment with different setups and sooth your curiosity its only gonna cost you is  bucks on focus attack. I mainly play third strike and Ive had less execution errors with the stock spring and the large actuators and a square gate. Theres not enough information on arcade sticks imo its all trial and error. Right now Im actually looking for information on buying a Myoungshin Fanta Korean stick and trying it out on third strike.  I play makoto Alex Urien Dudley ken chun li and necro and Hugo.,fightsticks,dcpa3zu,2,t5_2uvie

11047823,0,t1_dek7tlp,True. I only play KI on xbone and waiting for UMvCdays. Have not noticed any lag. You are right though. Many better sticks than HORI but for the price and only OoB option for Xbone im happy. I really like the feel of the Hayabusa stick put an octo gate in and swapped for sanwa buttons. Would swap it in a second though if qanba made the dragon for Xbone as well. ,fightsticks,dek92mx,2,t5_2uvie
