6589417,0,t1_d00rtw9,Exactly.  I believe in the comics Apocalypse was woken from his slumbers and drawn into action by the huge mutant energies he sensed from clashes between the XMen and the Brotherhood.  An argument could be made that in the original movie timeline he would have made an appearance following X.  Maybe he was going to wake in that dystopian Sentinel future to rally the surviving mutants as their god.  We dont know but its certainly possible that he was present in the background and biding his time.  However in the postDoFP timeline he was seemingly  awoken early by the huge display of power from Magneto moving a whole sports stadium or something else that hadnt happened in the original film timeline.  The timeline changed at this juncture in the s and now everything that possibly could happen is going to happen differently than what did in the original film timeline.TLDR  These timelines are confusing....,MarvelatFox,d00we7s,1,t5_3ac9j

6942115,0,t3_4asw61,Recast JLaws Mystique dont make mystique the leader of the Xmen and change those godawful Xmen costumes Magneto storm Apocalypse and psylocke look pretty good and archangel is acceptable but the others are perfect for singers fetishes. Other than that it seems pretty good but a bit more like a generic action film without the depth that Xmen should have such as dealing with racism Issues sexism homophobia etc... but we cant really judge that by this trailer. We have Deadpool BvS Civil War Suicide Squad and Doctor strange this year and all of them seem to do something different while this just seems generic.,MarvelatFox,d137v4t,6,t5_3ac9j

7543230,0,t1_d2zmeja,X had some nice little fights but the XMen are a group. Seeing them face off one on one here and there is nice but rather lacking to me. X despite its flaws at least had a classic XMen fight at the end. The Xmen taking down Magneto not by overpowering him but by working as a team.I did not much care for the Sentinel fights because to me a fight is something that goes back and forth. You should not be sure who is going to win. The fights were flashy and it was great to see Iceman finally doing his full thing but fights where the Xmen get brutally slaughtered every time are not quite what I am looking for.If the XMen in DoFP had managed to take down a few Sentinels each time but still lost in the end the fights would have been much better.,MarvelatFox,d2zmn7c,1,t5_3ac9j
7543751,0,t1_d2zompw,Yep. I think its because we have so many CBMs this year and they are all released within a short time frame of each other. So comparison is inevitable.,MarvelatFox,d2zorq8,2,t5_3ac9j

7791853,0,t1_d3ra3lx,I agree that the lack of consequence for action does hurt the film but not enough to ruin the just a weakness. I do believe that enough is mentioned in the movie to infer why Apocalypse destroyed all the nukes. He was taking away weapons from nonmutants to ensure that mutants powers were untested. He didnt want to destroy the world but rebuild it where he is god and mutants his angels making nonmutants servants and worshipers.Jeans actions that led to the death of many soldiers were taken very lightly but it could be argued that she felt Wolverines pain caused by his torture from the soldiers. This allowed Jean to have less guilt over their deaths.As for Magneto I guess only the Xmen know the extent of his involvement in the destruction? The rest of the world may not know the part he played. I think most of the damage he caused was focused in the nearby area he was in along with some in the oceans.The fact that every major supervillian in the Xmen series has been a mutant does kind of undermines Charles Xaviers ideas on peace.It does have weaknesses but I still enjoyed it. I would have liked a little more character depth but I dont think they should have made the movie any longer. They packed a lot of interesting stuff into the movie and I guess they expect the audience is smart enough to deduce what isnt explicitly stated.,MarvelatFox,d3rv16c,1,t5_3ac9j
