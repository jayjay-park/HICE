3333468,0,t3_2yb3ga,Currently I dont think they have any mass transit transportation to the airport. I know that the school was considering running a bus route out there a couple years ago I just dont think they got the support. Most students just drive out the the airport. Its only about  miles from campus. The city bus can get you within a mile of the airport from there you could ride a bicycle to the airport usu even offers free bicycle rentals.,usu,cp88p6g,1,t5_2sph5

9206600,0,t3_56acvs,I lived in the Towers for the first two weeks of my freshman year. I didnt plan very well and I was put on a floor where  of the residents were students from the Dominican Republic. I dont speak Spanish. It wasnt all that fun not being able to talk to anyone. They almost all spoke great English but you didnt hear a word of it on that floor. I dont blame them It was probably really nice to have a group from home around you while going to a foreign school. Eventually I moved to South Campus and loved it. The Towers themselves werent bad at all. Just plan better than I did.,usu,d8j07do,1,t5_2sph5

9796782,0,t3_5fh6gn,Yup. Suite style forces you to get along with four maybe five people. Traditional forces you to get along with the whole floor.,usu,dakny33,1,t5_2sph5
