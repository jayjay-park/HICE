When your options are salty greasy pizza salty greasy burritos salty greasy chinese food or salty greasy burgerchicken tenders you start to feel physically ill fairly quickly. Not only does each meal make me sick to my stomach but if you eat mostly pit food a mistake I made sophomore year for too long you just feel awful all the time. Obviously there are alternatives even in the pit salad bar blimpie at seemingly arbitrary hours but there are plenty of options with which you can go wrong.,URochester,cjsjkm1,3,t5_2sps7
4827072,0,t3_3gw1f4,Dang is that what a permit costs now?Between  I parked on campus without a permit. I would choose spots that the parking crew had just canvased or Id park by backing into a snow bank hoping they wouldnt dig my plate out for a ticket.

I dont exactly remember what the tot costs were but I do remember figuring out that  years worth of tickets plus the boot fee added up to less than two years worth of parking passes. ,URochester,cu2zq9s,0,t5_2sps7

As long as your parts are compatible and sites like PCPartPicker will tell you if they are Id say the biggest thing to watch out for is static electricity.Id also recommend checking out rbuildapc since thats what I used mainly. If you have other questions feel to comment or PM me.,URochester,cw79eui,2,t5_2sps7
