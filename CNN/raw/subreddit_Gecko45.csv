8865445,0,t1_d7dcq9j,You are my hero and role model.  One day I will patrol JC Pennys Sears and Hot Topic as bravely as you.  Do you have a junior officers program? Id really like to get in on the ground floor and eventually end up on the roof somehow.  I wouldnt want to get left up there too long because that guy at the end of The Hangover looked pretty fucked up but you get what Im going for with this metaphor. I would like to go from the bottom to the top using some combination of vertical and lateral motion. E.G. move up in the ranks of the mall warriors. xoxo,Gecko45,d7di2yv,2,t5_3g0gm
