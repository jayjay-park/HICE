5706924,0,t1_cx4fy6p,I honestly think spell pierce is better your opponent might have  mana left over to pay for SD. The upside only comes if your pump has already resolved which means they are doing whatever they are doing after combat in which case they are probably at  infect anyway. Otherwise whatever you are countering was played in response to your pump so you dont have ferocious,Infect,cx4hzry,1,t5_391l2

6219808,0,t1_cywm55b,Thank you. Im leaning more toward the foothills now. I dont even know if Ill ever play on a competitive level. ,Infect,cywmi9q,1,t5_391l2
6221980,0,t1_cywom2z,This seems like a slightly more preferable alternative to taking out that forest. What matchups do you find the Dryad Arbor to be effective in? I can imagine it would be helpful against anything with a LotV but Im not familiar with other applications.,Infect,cywve7g,1,t5_391l2
6715923,0,t3_47jh1z,Eldrazi have been wrecking the format and its frustrating. The size and number of their creatures is too much to contend with and there needs to be a ban on one of their lands.,Infect,d0dzgbq,1,t5_391l2
6895640,0,t3_4a74p7,I have two paths in my sideboard but Im running  fetches. I like the versatility of sideboard options it gives me overall but I think the correct question isnt path vs dismember but is it worth splashing white as a color. ,Infect,d0xxtpp,3,t5_391l2

7096386,0,t1_d1kf67i,Ive also tried geist of St traft.  It was good at shutting down bgx and grixis.  Grixis essentially cannot deal with a resolved geist.  Also on the play turn  geist beats burn.,Infect,d1kquc1,1,t5_391l2
7156508,0,t1_d1rm9o7,usually does a lot of work against uw decks too because they usually only have access to path to exile. happy to trade a glistener elf to get ahead on land count. abrupt decay being uncounterable is another plus and hits almost everything relevant other than a few planeswalkers or delve creatures.a little bit of spicy sideboard tech with spreading algae the rancor of land destruction. works great when you got an urborg out too. good times.edit dont overlook aphotic wisps. seems like a dumb card but its the black equivalent of slip through space. theres a reason i run multiple wild defiance main and this is it.,Infect,d1rmij3,2,t5_391l2
7295291,0,t3_4exkrd,As other have said you can run with  green khans fetchs i do due to budget reasons but i would defiantly look at picking up inkmoth nexus as they are  of my creatures. Also being a land makes them very hard to deal with if they only have sorcery speed answers. Also i see you mentions not having hierachs not as big a deal but really good in the deck. I would pick these up asap after the inkmonths. Being able to play hierach t then protect a glistner elf or blighted agent t is really strong. Also having incidental pump is really useful too. Managed to close a game out where i had no pump but all protectioncounters meaning i did it in  turns rather than .,Infect,d27fb8r,2,t5_391l2
7738135,0,t3_4lar7q,I tried adding red but it just isnt as good. Gitaxian probe is great for seeing if its safe to go distortion strike gets rid of so many enablers in modern slip through space is just cheeky card draw that gets someone through. I love the idea of Temur battle rage. Hitting for first and double strike is just filthy. Problem is you dont want to be making one awesome dude only to have it stripped pre combat damage and thats what blue adds. Maybe temur but the mana is guff and you probably want birds of paradise rather than noble hierarch but your are losing that sweet sweet exalted bonus. ,Infect,d3lrpvv,1,t5_391l2

8108149,0,t3_4qajd7,I tested it against heavy removal decks. In testing it was an inefficient use of mana always having to leave it up. Just replaying a creature every turn leaves their removal effective as you arent attacking. Often I would have won had the card been a wild defiance the card I was trying it over.  Its better to just have protection spells.,Infect,d4rfg1n,2,t5_391l2

9669031,0,t3_5ddbuw,So I used to play bug infect a lot at fnm bug like bg is a slower more midrange like deck than the ug varent. I played it because it did well in my local meta which was lots of red decks like burn jund etc. However since blossoming came out I feel like ug has pretty much evened out on those types of matchups compred to lists with b. Recently Ive exclusively been playing ug. One other point since bg is a lot less comboy it can be a good budget option because imo you dont need become immense and all the fetch lands,Infect,da4wsge,1,t5_391l2
9677202,0,t3_5dkn5f,Both are relevant depending on your meta. Its more a personal call however I prefer DS. Rebound is priceless and it fuels delve enabling our best pump spell.In addition it doesnt lose damage to blockers as Rancor does for blockers with high toughness such as Wall of Omens. The greatest benefit Rancor has going for it is that it recurs. But even thats a small consolation. Id rather not lose a creature at all if I can help it. Also it takes mana to cast again and again and it can be sent to the graveyard by fizzling. I just want to hit for ten as swiftly as I can and Im of the opinion that DS helps get there swifter more reliably and better than Rancor. ,Infect,da5x2uo,3,t5_391l2

10640440,0,t3_5s11d5,I wonder why natural state over Natures claim. In that version you have even more targets to use  Claim on your own permanents skite and wild defiance vs burn.Also super insteresting that you have access to the spellskite and WD combo here i guess is the plan post Sideboard vs midrange decks,Infect,dddhac5,1,t5_391l2

11059168,0,t3_5v5lwl,I guess with probe gone protection spells that sit around spellskite are better cause we cant see their hands to around it. ,Infect,deljei5,1,t5_391l2
11108962,0,t1_deqchme,Yeah I would agree that fatal push made the deck harder. But you just have to play a little slower and more protective. That is why I like the full playset of Spellskites. It makes them waste at least one removal spell. Haha thanks. There are a lot of uses for Vines not to just protect your own creatures. Use it anytime they target one of their creatures as well,Infect,der6w5h,1,t5_391l2
