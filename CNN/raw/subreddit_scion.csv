486212,0,t3_1z4b8t,I detail a lot of cars and I can say if the car is a  or newer than youre fine. Dont use a powerful spray and dont drench it. Spray every part for a little bit and then spray degreaser over it all. Use a brush to scrub it and loosen dirt. After that wash it off. Once it drys purchase  aerospace from a boat store and coat the plastic parts with it.Important things to keep in mind Wait until your engine is cool. After you wash it let it sit for a couple hours to dry.,scion,cfvjay0,2,t5_2qnhk

749885,0,t1_cgpft0z,Whats happening is that air is being forced through the AC system just from the fact that your driving. If you were to have the AC button engaged this air thats being forced in is what would be treated by either the heating or cooling. The reason you want to click the recirculate button is because then the system will draw air from within the cabin and not air from outside your car. Even when the recirculate button is clicked in without the AC being on it still essentially closes off the outside air the air that youre feeling coming through the vents. ,scion,cgpiobu,6,t5_2qnhk

Fantastic sound quality and the tablet means you arent dealing with crappy outdated software. I tether to my phone for Pandora or you can use local storage. Oh also the tweeter location in front sucks I disconnected the tweeters in the doors and added some small pods at the base of the A pillars mounted with magnets so I didnt have to drill anything. ,scion,cm74pdv,2,t5_2qnhk

4931351,0,t1_cufgupv,Yeah the FWD helps alot in autocross actually.  Most of the people that rode with me were surprised by that because you have to drive it differently.  Someone with a RWD car would have to get the car completely turned before they could get back in the throttle.  The minute I got the front end through the turn I could get back on quicker.  The only weaknesses were exactly what you stated.  I probably could have used some wider and stickier tires and maybe a few hp.,scion,cug4w7b,1,t5_2qnhk

6016571,0,t3_3xtz6n,Zero words on how the cars drive bundled features and the Scions single trim level business model. Misleading comparisons. Unbacked claims. This article is a doozy.IA Okay we know it has different names in different countries and its slow its also one of the most aggressive looking entry level cars yet the reviewer calls it bland? Bland compared to what? Line it up to all the other cars at the same price point and then see whats bland.XB Subjective review again no comparisons to any other cars in the same price range in the market. Okay?IM Article has nothing to say except its a hatchback with hp. How about you pull some numbers and comparisons to other competing cars in the same price bracket and HP bracket and give us an actual article there big guy. TC This is where the article goes off the deep end. Says they look the same throughout their revisions so we can assume our author is blind. Then goes on to say the Fiesta ST is faster than the TC which is a long repeated lie by people who read brochures instead of sitting in the cars. Every reviewer that has ACTUALLY driven the cars has found the TC faster from  mph. The only time the ST pulls ahead is from  mph and yet the TC still gets ahead in the end when puling to mph. Just look at Caranddriver times or really any article where theres actual research involved. If youre going to talk shit about the TC talk about its fuel consumption that way you could have at least one accurate claim. FRS Doesnt mention it  and the the Mazda MX are the only FR layout cars in that price bracket. Goes on to compare it to FF cars. Doesnt mention how much fun it is to drive  which is its main selling point. Doesnt mention the massive aftermarket support. Doesnt draw any comparisons just says waaah wahh its expensive look at these Fords. This article is poorly not researched and awfully written. Reads like a th grade book report where the kid didnt read the book and was paid to talk about Fords instead. ,scion,cy8arl1,1,t5_2qnhk
