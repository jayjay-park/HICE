2844173,0,t1_cnrbe0a,Ive heard that but also saw this on Pattern Day TradingDoes this rule change apply to cash accounts?Day trading in a cash account is generally prohibited. Day trades can occur in a cash account only to the extent the trades do not violate the freeriding prohibition of Federal Reserve Boards Regulation T. In general failing to pay for a security before you sell the security in a cash account violates the freeriding prohibition. If you freeride your broker is required to place a day freeze on the account.So we can day trade with cash accounts as long as we arent free riding but we are also limited to the  trades in  business days rule as well?,RobinHood,cnrdq7h,1,t5_2uud8
2844670,0,t1_cnr6lnh,December   is the ExDiv Date. Which is the date you need to own shares on or before to receive the dividend. If you buy the stock after that date you wont get the dividend. The dividend is then typically paid out a month later January   to those who owned a shares before that date. All dividend dates are the same for a company regardless of the broker. If you were to receive a dividend it will just be added to your account. ,RobinHood,cnrfrrs,2,t5_2uud8

7568484,0,t3_4iyz0m,This post is screaming at me. You sound like the person I was almost ten years ago now. I was completely new to the market and I saw these penny stocks and thought Hey if the price oscillates between . and . why not buy at the lower and sell at the higher since it oscillates so many times between those prices?That lesson cost me  which was a great deal of cash at the time. Dont get me wrong I actually was up to  before I messed up I call that luck.Heres what I think you should do. Read read read. Read everything you can get your hands on. Benjamin Graham is considered a classic. Learn how to properly evaluate a company through basic things like the fundamentals balance sheets etc. and learn a few indicators. A few ones to start with are the MACD RSI Williams R along with the EMA SMA. Also learn how to manipulate the variables and create a trading strategy suitable to you.Please dont take this comment as condescension. I wish someone had told me that when I first started. Now I will answer your question.Generally penny stocks have much lower market caps than stocks priced over . This means the company is not as large and thus does not have the resources a blue chip may have. Its exponentially easier for a subB market cap company to file bankruptcy than a Bank Of America or Apple. Next these penny stocks generally have much less volume which makes them susceptible to manipulation by trading groups. This also means less players for you to trade with so price swings can be violent when youre trying to make an exit. If youre new to the game I highly recommend you avoid penny stocks. Robinhood doesnt have OTC trading only NASDAQ. NASDAQ has certain rules for every stock to be listed. Some of those rules include the value to be above  if the value falls below that requirement the ticker is at risk and could be delisted.Lastly penny stocks are rife with mismanagement scheming investors and predatory lenders.

8216301,0,t3_4rvt4q,I did a lot of research because I had the same questions. Limit buys say youll buy UNDER a certain price. Say thats .. Youll purchase anything . and below. Basically buying on dips. Stop buys buy OVER a certain price. If . youll buy as soon as a rising price hits .. This sounds counterintuitive unless youre day trading. Say a stock spikes  and you sell it expecting it to go down. It then starts going down but you think to yourself What if it shoots up again and I miss our because I already sold? So you put a stop buy. That says that if the stock starts going up again you buy and can catch the run. It basically buys on large spikes and trends. Stop limits are the same but say to buy on a spike but only if it doesnt go TOO high. Theyre both tricky but can be useful for charting  day trading. ,RobinHood,d54lch4,9,t5_2uud8

8341623,0,t3_4ttx2r,I have been trading with Robinhood for almost  year and have built a portfolio of  stocks currently. Here are my top  ways to use Robinhood Diversification is free on Robinhood. So buy a well rounded portofolio Dont day trade you will likely miss out on big moves by taking profit too early. Let the profits run and keep them running. Take risks but not dangerous risk. Avoid penny stocks.. Yes I know you can make a fortune.....but its unpredictable and slow and steady wins the race. Buy good companies and research use  for free stock screener. Buy low and sell high. Objective is to find stocks that have fallen at least  from  week high and start buying at intervals    and use dollar cost averaging. Buy dividend stocks! Find companies who have raised their dividends through long periods of time. They are reliable and youll be happy with extra change in your pocket to keep buying more stocks. Watch news to stay up to date on hottest items. I can honestly say that Ive joined some really good rallies just by joining in the hype. But remember they must follow rule . Be conservative and dont let any stock be more than a certain percentage of your portfolio. My rule dont let  stock be more than  of your portfolio. Set a budget and invest what you can each month. Do not panic do not stalk your phone money comes with time. And remember good companies usually bounce back. Use a charting software try tradingview.com  they are free and they are the best html charting website. Learn trends view historical prices watch how stocks trade similarly and buy the best stock that is on discount. ,RobinHood,d5k99cf,11,t5_2uud8

Ive never used a rental agency that did not also act as landlord. They fixed everything and I never had or needed a connection with the owner. I just assumed it would be the same here. I guess I expected Robinhood to act more like a landlord since all my dealings with Apex are hidden behind a Robinhood interface.I still question the responsibilities here. Where does the handoff of responsibility and liability occur? If it is my responsibility to communicate directly with Apex to resolve transaction errors why can I not communicate directly with Apex to create transactions? The API cant be that difficult to figure out. Im using someone elses python scripts to download my Robinhood transaction history to CSV. Shouldnt I be able to access those records directly through Apex if in fact I am truly a customer of Apex? Seriously they are my records arent they? If I am the customer and not Robinhood I should be able to access them without going through an intermediary.I may be totally off base here and probably am.

Here youll see how much value your account can lose before you would get a margin call. A simple heuristic is that you want this number to stay positive the bigger the better. Well also send updates if you account happens to get close in those situations reacting sooner is better.What do I do if I get a margin call?gt You have two simple ways of resolving a margin call.gt gt First you can deposit additional funds from your bank to increase your account value. This allows you to hold your stocks and allow them to potentially rebound.gt gt Alternatively you can sell some of your shares and well use the proceeds from the sale to cover your margin call. This allows you to avoid depositing funds.I covered my margin call but I still cant buy stocks?gtCovering a margin call means that youve sold enough stock or deposited enough funds to get above your margin maintenance. A margin call isnt fully resolved until you close a trading day with a portfolio value above your margin maintenance.

11281582,0,t1_dfaaq1e,gt why wouldnt many investors buy in right before exdivs to take massive amounts?The real reason is very simple Everyone knows that this is possible. And so the price of the shares reacts accordingly. All things being equal if a company offers a dividend of  its share price drops by  on the exdividend date. In fact brokers will even adjust open limit orders by the dividend amount automatically and often stock price charts will adjust the chart to account for the dividend drop thus making it look like no drop actually happened.So yes you could buy the share the day before exdiv and then sell it but all youve done is taken a  loss on one side and a  gain on the other  so youve broken even. And so has whoever you traded with.Naturally this isnt always exactly the case but thats just because other factors might simultaneously push the stock price up or further down. If everything else was truly held steady anyone who saw that a stock was undervalued predividend would indeed buy it up in hopes of doing dividend stripping thus correcting the undervaluation  and Im sure some arbitrage firms do so. But youre still taking on risk because of other factors pushing the price around while you hold it overnight.,RobinHood,dfar1bi,1,t5_2uud8

If this doesnt work they will go bankrupt and youll probably lose everything which I know you say youre okay with but I just think it seems so obvious that this is gonna happen. The trial  data basically said that they gave a patient a dose and nothing happened. They then said that some animals tests required multiple tests so they might just have to give a higher dose.Plus several larger companies such as Pfizer have improved Alzheimers treatments in the pipeline that are far less speculative that should have results out soon. That could take a lot of pressure off approving this drug and the chances of approval are so slim anyways.  ,RobinHood,dgt3u2j,1,t5_2uud8
