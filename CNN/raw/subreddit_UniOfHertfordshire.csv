6601096,0,t3_4618v2,You want to live on College Lane. Bellingham Spalding and Maclean Court are the nice new halls on College Lane. Telford Court was recently refurbished however isnt as nice as the others. Bellingham Spalding and Maclean have both rooms with ensuite and rooms that share bathrooms. Townhouses have a kitchen at the bottom and some rooms on each floor with a shared bathroom. I think they have like  or so people to a house. Standardenhancedpremium are ensuite rooms with either  or  rooms per flat they have a large kitchen and are all located on the same floor. They also all have fairly large kitchens with sofas and TVs and a couple of fridges.Telford Court is a bit more lively when compared to the others on CL. The buildings are older but it was all refurbished last year. They also share bathrooms and there are more rooms per flat.All the halls have a common room which has some TVs and sofas and pool tables or table tennis. They also all have launderettes. To be honest all the halls are pretty good. Whether or not you get on with your flatmates is really luck of the draw. I lived with  others in my first year  two were exchange students who never came out of their rooms two were mature students who were rarely around and the other guy was alright.If youve got any other questions feel free to ask.,UniOfHertfordshire,d023vtp,3,t5_33gqt
