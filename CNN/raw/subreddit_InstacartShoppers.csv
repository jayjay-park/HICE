4771476,0,t3_3g54d0,One thing Im not quite clear on is lets say you are shopping for an order and you get everything except they are out of stock on one thing and the customer doesnt want a replacement and you refund them.But the app still forces a customer wants a call for replacements. Do you call? The app wants you to call them and Ive had cases where they want to know what else is in the store and other times their tone is like Why are you calling me? Theres no replacement decisions to be made here.,InstacartShoppers,ctvzjyf,2,t5_37nqy
