904587,0,t3_24gx25,Try sharing this post on the OSU Bitcoin Group facebook page you might get feedback on there with this. I also have listings on localbitcoins but am leaving town for a little bit Im glad to see this being used in Columbus. Be safe helpful and good luck...we dont want to give Columbus localbitcoins a poor reputation before it even really develops.,columbusclassifieds,ch73uza,1,t5_2tc6o

4020552,0,t1_creh5ac,It means that I refuse to put him in a shelter and want to give him a good permanent home the rest is none of your business. We took on this dog with the sole intent of only being foster parents so he wouldnt have to go to a shelter a few months ago it was never a permanent thing,columbusclassifieds,creknnm,1,t5_2tc6o
4027091,0,t1_creknnm,I wish you had said that to begin with. It puts an entirely different light on your situation and on you. Thats the sort of behavior that should be admired and emulated not criticized and I apologize for the harsh words. As a real dog lover Im sure you understand why the original limited info would cause others to conclude that this was just another case of irresponsibility.Can the organization that brought Bruce to your attention in the first place be of any help? Would they at least agree to allow Bruce to be listed under their sponsorship on PetFinder.com which works very well but doesnt take listings from individuals? If there wasnt a rescue group involved before maybe you can find one through Columbus Dog Connection which maintains a comprehensive list of general and breedspecific rescue groups in central Ohio.I wish you and Bruce the best of luck in this and again offer my apologies for the misunderstanding.,columbusclassifieds,crfbgu4,1,t5_2tc6o

4917769,0,t3_3i85n0,There are tons of staffing companies in town that make it a lot easier to find an office job than going at it on your own. Ive used Dawson Resources amp theyre great to find a corporate gig. If youre opposed to corporateoffice work amp want to focus on your photography try offering lessons or workshops on Craigslist OfferUp or Thumbtack. Good luck!,columbusclassifieds,cuef8cx,1,t5_2tc6o
