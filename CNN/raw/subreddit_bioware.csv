4628189,0,t1_cryv6w6,I will agree that political correctness doesnt make the game worse. In fact its neat having the option of being vay lesbian bisexual or heterosexual. You can tailor the player character to how you are in real life OR you can be something youre not Im a cishet guy who played as a bisexual female so you know. Then you have characters who are gay straight or bisexual to romance.That said...Inquisition is pretty lame outside of its main quest line and companions. The side quests suck the exploration isnt as exciting as it is in games like Skyrim or Fallout and so they made it a huge world without the benefit of being as interesting and also  abandoned the really in depth side quests of DAO and past rpgs in favor of fetch quests. A plethora of fetch quests. I remember Bioware games used to let you persuade or threaten people for a better reward or let you tell the person to keep the reward.Hell I just got DAO the other day and came upon highwaymen that I could either comply with and give them my money fight and kill them or persuade them to let me pass. After letting me pass I talked to them again and had the option of persuading them to give me money after i intimidated them by saying i was a Grey Warden. I could then say it wasnt enough and fight them OR accept the money. After that I could tell them to beat it and have them run away OR I could kill them even though they gave me their money.Yeah that shit? That wasnt in DAI. Not even close. Its also not found that much in Mass Effect. KOTOR Jade Empire DAO  those games are amazing. But DAI is not even close. Havent played DA yet so Im not sure how that one is though after the demo it seems to mechanically play similar to DAI but the demo was just fighting which I doubt the game is... didnt give a good idea of what quests are like.DAI would give me a quest to collect X or kill Y. I would do so return to the quest giver and then theyd give me money and Id earn XP. No agency whatsoever except to decide if I feel like going through the hassle for such a mediocre and monotonous and repetitive fetch quest or decide it wasnt worth my time at all. And that sucks.Dont get me wrong I enjoyed DAI for what it was but it didnt leave me as amazed as DAO already has and I havent even finished it. I dont feel the same allure of replaying the game like I do with DAO JE or KOTOR. The only reason Im going to replay it is after I finish DAO and DA to see how my choices affect DAI.That said Witcher  vs DA is silly really. Pretty different. Id be lying if I said EAs acquisition of Bioware makes me sad. I cant say for certain but perhaps we would have gotten games that didnt try to appeal to mass audiences as much. A little guaranteed. Thats just how it is now. But I feel like DAI would have ultimately felt more like those older Bioware titles. DA may not have been as rushed out as it was. This is speculation of course they easily could have decided to do similar things but it is interesting that my complaints start to begin after EA bought Bioware. Even as good as Origins is the DLC quest shenanigans where youre given a quest and then told okay now buy the dlc to actually do it is bullshiiiiiit.Basidally if EA announced Bioware was making a new KOTOR game one of my all time favorite RPGs Id be pretty skeptical. Id be willing to bet itd have more in common with DAI than it would with KOTOR and that would be heartbreaking.,bioware,ctdydm6,2,t5_2rnfb
