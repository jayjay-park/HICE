8021518,0,t3_4p1yio,This was one of the best SMCs yet in my opinion. I really liked the way that Woody used the inferno tower to defend the Royal Giant and protect the mortar.   I am looking forward to the invitational with the top . ,CompetitiveCR,d4hozzv,2,t5_3dlym

8085012,0,t3_4pylxh,I think it depends on the timing and placement of the Barbs. People I face tend to place their Barbs directly in front of the tower right when they see my Hog and it usually stops it with  damage to the tower.,CompetitiveCR,d4otv4e,4,t5_3dlym

8263885,0,t3_4sm8w2,The card is fine so all that matters is level. Epics trail commons by  levels so if your baby dragon is lvl  and most ppl you fight have lvl  spear gobs archers lvl  musketeer etc then your baby dragon will be hard to counter and very powerful.,CompetitiveCR,d5ajkc9,1,t5_3dlym

8314013,0,t3_4t96t2,I play this deck on the ladder with regular gobs instead of spear gobs and ice spirit instead of guards. It may seem like ice spirits dont do enough work to replace that defense slot but they only cost  so it helps you cycle faster to musketeer or mini pekka who are great defenders.And yeah to play it on the ladder you need to keep your furnace up with opponents tower levels. i spent a few weeks requesting furnace to lvl  before it was able to hang in the  range,CompetitiveCR,d5gt3n8,1,t5_3dlym

10779421,0,t1_ddr2zw4,Thanks for the thorough explanation! That all makes sense!Still a little confused why the deck builder seems to recommend the furnace more for ladder decks than for tournament decks given that you and I seem to agree that furnace is more reliable for chip damage in the tournament.,CompetitiveCR,ddrtht7,1,t5_3dlym
