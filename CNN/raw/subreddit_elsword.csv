775852,0,t3_22oas8,With post skill revamp characters and uber balancing Hard to play characters dont exist anymore. Every single character in North American elsword right now for every single class can be gotten to SSS with very little practical experience in the game. The only way to create especially difficult situations for yourself now is by fighting other players at your same gear and skill level or by playing as a lower level character.,elsword,cgsgvth,1,t5_2szkr
832038,0,t1_cgyucfq,BSS rank is really not a feat in S arena. Hell even getting SSS is not hard with freeinexpensive gear. Hell I did it with only a  weapon at level . But if you havent had experience being utterly trashed in  by  gear then youve not experienced the reality of arena. Anything below that doesnt matter. What matters is the highest rank play.SSS specifically  AP tier is heavily gearoriented. When the opponents stop being relatively terrible and you find yourself on equal or lower ground in terms of skill gear gives the necessary edge to win. You can be a top tier player and be great at techniques but still lose because of facerolling due to lessthanstellar gear. Even if you have incredible skill the gap you need to fill to overcome a somewhat decent player with  red k add  crit  awk charge guild passives etc. is ridiculous. Sure if you can infinite then you wont have to be worried about the tanking completely but one mistake and youre fucked. A person who just tanks mp and waits to awaken  special activecombo  wreck half to all your HP in  the amount of work you did is not pay to win?Additionally if it wasnt pay to win arena why the hell would they allow  and  gear into PVP in the first place? Why not just have FAIR arena with sparring gear only? Equal gear varying but balanced stats etc. Thats when you can finally say its no longer pay to win and mostly about skillmatchups. However the company makes money by allowing people to use their OP equipment in arena. People pay for gear and more to have a better chance of winning so they can enlarge their epeen be proud of being a top player. If gear truly didnt matter you wouldnt see people paying absurd amounts of money for the asstastic enhancing rates to get a   or . Face it having better gear gets you farther in the game even if you suck regardless of whether you PVE or PVP. To think otherwise is absolutely ludicrous.Having had experience being on both sides of this pay to win spectrum I can guarantee you gear makes a massive difference in high SSS and anywhere else in the game. The pay to win factor is everywhere. Equipment costumes IBs bslot etc. you name it. Just because you have not had to spendwin in less meaningful ranks doesnt mean the rest of the community hasnt elsewhere.,elsword,cgyusmi,1,t5_2szkr

BUT WAIT! IT GETS EASIER! at level  looney tunes psyker gets a passive fantasy tracer that allows him to nasod armor combo off of this  mana  second cooldown homing ability. did you know this passive also allows him to gain mana when he awakens which he can every  seconds? stack that with ancient guardian secret dungeon set effect and youre easily gaining  mana just for pressing ctrl.speaking of nasod armor combos did you know each punch of NA combo can do ? did you know that these combos also add  knockdown? did you know that while doing the combo you essentially have super armor and can restart the combo whenever you hit something? did you know the hitbox of these combos also extend behind you so you can literally faceroll the keyboard any which way and win?on top of this bullshit that this class already has he also has really stupidly high percentage abilities like conqueror  for the homing bullets  for the big explosion quake buster  for  mana and particle accelerator  for  mana. put this all together and you get one of the many flavors of cancer found in this game. wonderful.,elsword,cqkjpdt,2,t5_2szkr

My guild master is getting really high scores on CBS that hes within the top  CBS probably in the s but I dont have a CBS to check because  points is really low  is what I think should be bare minimum and  if you got a lot of pots.My opinion would be to aim for unique weapon on all  of your chars if you can. Try to get them in a guild that can get star rank or s for sure by the end generally guilds with really well known people like Traffic that  guy who made rage in the megaphone for  to  EC but you can join others if you want or stay in your guild.Sidenote I know that feel when your computer  laptop lags for Perkisas but I find it a lagfest when EM TT and CN are in  raid and they buff each other like crazy. Sometimes you soloing the raid can get you much more points than you doing the raid with others I went from average .k points with others on my BM to .k points soloing.That said some people dont like Void here for some reason and prefer not to talk much about it here I got no problem with it.

Cant even remember anything then.I came back around when the Transform patch came around the third job patch but didnt stay for very long only to around when Battle Seraph came around. Also whenever Ara came around whether that was before or after that patch I cant remember.Then I forgot my account and made a new one about two years ago didnt get very far only about lvl  with two or three of my characters before dropping out.Then around winter of last year I think that was also when stuff like Asura CrA and DiE were coming out I got back into the game but this time with friends who havent played it before and I think that was what help me stay in since it was more fun playing with them than alone. That was also when I picked up my main BM and a bunch of other characters at the same time. After making about  different characters achieving max level and having everyone else about level  I fell out again even with LuCiel coming out though I did make one until lvl .Around the latest revamp patch this winter was when I got back in again with the same group of friends and man did I grind my soul out. During the ElswordRena event I made three new characters and got them to about level  before I decided to go mad and make a total of  characters yes I got to character cap in a single sitting and grind them to level  in preparation for their revamps thank god I had  others already done from the previous year. Then I just spent every event grinding everyone out to at least level  and thats where Im sitting at right now with two max leveled characters BM and CBS and a bunch of others sitting around as I wait for something to bring me back in hopefully Rose will get me kickstarted again.

7697950,0,t1_d3h3e1s,Thx for the answer.AS for pvp i dont intent to do any since im from EU and playing in NA server. I dont lag in dungeons at all but in field areas the delay is quite noticable and im guessing its gonna be the same for pvp.As for the movement i meant jumping aid. For example Ara has double jump add is flying etc. My Noblesse has a double jump but it requires to use gtgtx first and the second jump makes you lose all your air speed meaning you dont actually go much further just higher unlike ara which is a genuine double jump. I find it hard to jump over certain bosses and navigate fast in maps that require you to go higher thats basically my only complain about the class.CBS sounds like a more laid back style of my Noblesse. Noblesse is kinda different cause you have to keep track of combi points and keep switching between characters to unleash your huge map clearing aoe. And Noblesses main abilities are also seeking with exploding aoebouncing. I was also thinking MM sounds very similar to CBS doesnt he also have some seeking abilities? I had a low level Add and his movement with flying and staying in the air was superb i rly enjoyed that.I might give BH a shot if im feeling more of a melee style.edit i took a look on the elsword kogforums where i play and i saw CBS isnt doing too well atm pve wise.

9968544,0,t3_5ib1gw,I run heroics hell regularly solo a lot too and the one thing I say about most CRos I see is that they tend to rely on her Special Actives... theyre pretty bad in comparison to her normal xxx. I run the following Chain Powder Enhanced Rising Shot Killing Blow Bloody Chain Critical Chain Snatch Gigantic Bloody Carnival Heavy Kill Point Regenerating Hyper Active Blood Bullet Chain Viper Gun Dance HeavyThe way I play her is to get her into overstrike ASAP so the three talents put into her  key active skills chain powder rising shot and bloody chain will get you there. From there you go in with her xxxltltgt loops or gtgtx I dont use this often as it got nerfed pretty hard. Use Bloody Carnival if youre building her trans stacks or use gun dance for AOE around you clear. If no AOE or you have max stacks then just use your xxx loops. Also dont be afraid to use either of them for the invincibility frames to dodge attacks that would most likely kill you.Use chain snatch to group mobs followed by kill point. Great if youre running big hand elixir for even more range. Doing this will get you your trans stacks and depending on mobs as most heroic mobs are pretty resistant to wind will get you your bloody action stacks from the bleed. Use kill point and chain snatch regularly its your bnb setup for keeping your stacks up  having good crowd control and will give def reduction on mobs.Chain viper is amazing just use it in your rotation to slow mobs aspd down. It doesnt do a lot of dmg but it helps from a party play as a semi support role. Blood bullet can save your life when consumables are on CD and its great in henir challenge mode where no consumables are allowed. Use this when youre running low on hp and switch your active rotation up to include it drop bloody chain from the rotation. Yes it takes longer to get to overstrike but a dead dps does  dps.Lastly her HA is underrated IMO with a wind orb my HA does  bars of life off a heroic hell boss so use it with big groups or bossing.,elsword,db6xems,2,t5_2szkr
