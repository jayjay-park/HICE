9666474,0,t3_5aezx8,Not sure what I call this but Ive been really inspired by more ambient vaporwave for the past few months so maybe people here can find something interesting to say about it. Feel free to listen to one thing or the whole package whatever you have the attention span for!  ,makingvaporwave,da4lg3n,1,t5_3aknz

10995904,0,t3_5x0pl6,Hey guys! About a week ago I remembered reading about those Kmart tapes that were posted online and had always wanted to make vaporwave since I appreciate it so much. So I took a few samples and messed around in Audacity and FL Studio. If you give a song a listen could ya tell me what you like and what you dont? Looking to improve and make some great stuff one day once I actually think of a name and take this seriously as in put a lot more effort into my music. Thank you!,makingvaporwave,deecoep,3,t5_3aknz
