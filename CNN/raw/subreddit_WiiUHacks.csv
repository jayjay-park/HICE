6467488,0,t1_czo88xx,Blocking the domains alone isnt enough for some users the main way to block automatic updates is to use Tubehax DNS on your Wii Us connection setting.This guarantees to block the updates but it also prevents you from using Eshop. You can play online though.if you need Eshop make sure theres no new updates then disable the DNS. Then renable it when youre finished with Eshop.its impossible to turn off automatic updates Nintendo did this for a reason. it helps to turn off standby function though. And automatic software downloads Doesnt include system updates,WiiUHacks,czoa8fg,3,t5_2vh6q

8168531,0,t3_4381ld,So Im thinking about getting a wii U. I already have a hacked wii with cfgusb loader and emulators decked out but Im ready for an upgrade while still keeping my games on an exthd. My question is how different is wii u hacking? Like can I still run GCN and WII isos off a usb drive? Can I load new wii U games off an exthd? Is there a priiloader equivalent yet? Do I even need to worry about internet upgrades and version numbers?Im not new to the wii hacking community by any means but I know nothing about wii U hacking. Can someone give me a quick run down of how easy it is to transfer to a wii u console and setup it up. I assume the Wii U just emulates a Wii console within itself. Are we at the point of being able to hack and load wii u games yet? Does it effect online features?

8393800,0,t3_4ud0a0,You can use  on your WiiU this exact address not the appstore web frontend one you get redirected to when going there with a PC to load HBL homebrew launcher obviously you must have HBL setup on your SD. From there you can launch homebrews such as NNU Patcher or WUP Installer.NNU Patcher patches the NeedsNetworkUpdate function allowing you to access some eshop related features such as the main eshop app providing that you spoofed your system version to the latest one with WUP Installer.WUP Installer allows you to install titles such as system titles updates and games updates using encrypted files downloaded from Nintendos servers with a specific filenames in a folder at the root of your SD named install.You can use JNUSTool to download such files. Use something like Notepad or probably any Unix text editor do NOT use the crappy standard Windows notepad to replace the second line with the WiiU common key it may still be on pastebin theres also some subreddit with many keys. Consider the title database Whenever you use a title ID from this list for use with JNUSTool always remove the hyphen except if youre editing the csv.If you want to spoof your WiiU to latest firmware look for the title id of version.bin that matches your region. DO NOT use a version.bin from a different region or you WILL BRICK.Open a command prompt in the directory where JNUSTool.jar is in Windows with nothing selected shiftright click open a cmd here and enter    java jar JNUSTool.jar xxxxxxxx dlEncryptedxxxxxxxx being the last  characters of the ID for your version.bin.You can also add these lines in your csv to directly use the GUI     Version.bin file with the current system version      Version.bin file with the current system version      Version.bin file with the current system version When using the GUI for example just double click the jar select your titles within the list make sure you selected the titles for YOUR region and click Download Encrypted Files. You will get a folder tmpTITLEID per title.In order to install such updates copy a tmpTITLEID folder to the root of your SD card and rename it install. Put your SD into your WiiU load the HBL and load WUP Installer and follow on screen instructions.,WiiUHacks,d5qrt1e,2,t5_2vh6q

11064413,0,t1_dej94nn,Absolutely nothing. It seems like its working but doesnt actually do anything.Sorry for the delayed response.Am I out of luck or is there a known work around such as certain formatting settings or even partitioning the card to a smaller size?If Im just out of luck I might just sell the card since it functions perfectly outside of the wii u.l,WiiUHacks,dem52vh,1,t5_2vh6q
11101780,0,t3_5y66sz,Im trying to get an easy way to start loadiine I got a forwarder but it just flashes a blue screen when I try to load it.   I also have cbhc and tried a mod so I could access loadiine from the menu but thats not working either so perhaps Im installing it wrong.  Its just the cbhc .elf file I tried replacing the copies on my sdcard but I dont notice extra options so do I need to install it perhaps?,WiiUHacks,deqdl4n,1,t5_2vh6q

11152883,0,t1_dew4ngs,Best setup if you dont want CBHC imoHaxchi  edited config file to run sigpatchersysmenu by default and HBL by pressing and holding A.Skip anything with redNAND. Its optional and unnecessary. Mocha is unnecessary if you make the sigpatcher run by default by clicking Haxchi. ,WiiUHacks,dew61fc,3,t5_2vh6q
11168620,0,t3_5y66sz,Playing a game using a save from another region?Ive been playing BOTW on my JPN console with a USA version of the game using Haxchi. I start Haxchi manually no CBHC. Everything was going great for the past few days until recently. Ive done basically everything in the game except for the volcano and there is a part where you have to shoot that goron with the bandana to hit the bridge of eldin and knock it down.However without fail every time I put a bomb in the cannon and press the L trigger the game instantly softlocks. Link is frozen in his bomb activation animation and the goron does not come out of the cannon. No buttons work I can press the home menu to exit the game and the soundtrack continues to play during this softlock no buzzing sound or anything. Also there are still particle effects moving on the screen such as flames from links sword or the fire in the air. But everything else is frozen.So now Ive decided to try the JPN version of the game to see if I can get past this one part with my save and then switch back the the USA version. As I said the USA version was perfect up until this point and Ive been playing non stop for almost a week.SO MY QUESTION IS If I start the JPN version will it recognize the save? Can I simply continue the game from where I was in the USA version? Should I even try this like is it potentially dangerous? Or will it just straight up not work?Alternatively if anyone knows a solution for this softlock thing or you have experienced it with another game please speak up as well. Thanks very much.Thanks in advance!,WiiUHacks,dexy96v,1,t5_2vh6q

11266209,0,t1_df8yflq,Thats actually a good point I was thinking about it backwards. It should be less than  left after the nand copying.I wasnt watching it took a couple hours to copy at some point I looked at my gamepad and saw I was at the Wii U system menu in SysNAND not that I was expecting to be in redNAND yet that wouldnt have made sense whereas the guide says it should have been at a black screen.Ill have to remove the hidden partition but Ill try double checking the card for errors before I try again from scratch. To be honest it is a cheap SD card I just had lying around maybe Ill Amazon Prime a brand name card.,WiiUHacks,df90b9n,1,t5_2vh6q

11269530,0,t1_df9abo8,Thank you.Does  icon means that if i create a folder to put games in hence having less icons in the menu I can go over that number or they are still counted the same even if inside a folder?Btw this is all just for curiosity.  are more than enough maybe if you install Wii and VC games in the menu as well you could reach it but for normal uses I guess its fine.,WiiUHacks,df9duq2,1,t5_2vh6q
11285043,0,t1_dfb4ghk,You can technically but installing CBHC already does that for you so you dont need mocha if youre using CBHC. CBHC automatically does sigpatching and region unlocking when you boot. ,WiiUHacks,dfb55on,1,t5_2vh6q

11435828,0,t1_dfs6x0n,Its kind of complicated I believe. The problem is that RedNAND only really patches mlc and slc the Wii U NAND part essentially and just takes vWii as is I could talk complete nonsense but pretty sure thats how it is as theres no slccmpt patches in the source. So what happens is that RedNAND takes the original vWii NAND without modifying it and thats why it errors out. It might be as simple as reinstalling vWii in RedNAND but I think that doesnt do the trick. Using abooods mocha.elf apparently also takes us a little further into the system so it might as well be a permission error. ,WiiUHacks,dfs8n9a,1,t5_2vh6q

11764726,0,t1_df9ahqk,Save games that are on the usb HDD are read IF an usb HDD is connected. If no usb HDD is found save games are read from system memory. Thus if from time to time you copy NOT TRANSFER your game saves from the usb HDD to the system memory you have a good back up. You can even connect a sd drive on the usb and keep a copy backup from the system memory to an SD card including the BIG BOTW updates.,WiiUHacks,dgtk81d,1,t5_2vh6q
