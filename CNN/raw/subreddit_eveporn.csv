1070465,0,t1_chpygv0,Thanks. I appreciate that. I actually do each polygon by hand in GNU Image  Manipulation Programming GIMP rather than using any generated means of creating the image.I tried a couple of different tools but none quite came out with the effect I wanted and usually missed most of the details of the ship making it unrecognisable.And all of the images before being edited to add the polygons are simply screenshots taken directly from my eve client using fraps.,eveporn,chpysq8,1,t5_2t2ba
2809643,0,t1_cnn4ifs,Yes I got that! Please forgive my sarcasm. I just thought it looked a tad unrealistic having such a vast space with no windows lit up like that. Personal preference though! Looks good. ,eveporn,cnng4ny,1,t5_2t2ba
