8626807,0,t3_4xzno8,I went in . I wanted to go to the last one but couldnt get time off work.it was a pretty amazing experience. I had almost a complete emotional breakdown at the stage when everyone was singing Amazon Women Rise. I was just collapsed in tears and my friend held on to me and everyone was friendly about it like yeah its her first time. lol.Ive had paranoia almost my whole life about undressing Ive taken many showers in the dark and changed clothes in a dark locked closet afraid of being filmed because thats what my stepdad did to me as a teenager. but in Michigan I was able to get naked and shower communally with a bunch of women out in the sunshine and it was one of the most beautiful and liberating I know experiences of my life.there was also a night when I was sitting outside my tent having a cigarette with a new friend and we heard crunching footsteps in the dark woods beyond our camp we were freaked for a second but when I turned on my lantern it was just a fat raccoon waddling past. going back to Area  was hard as hell.,gendercritlesbians,d6jydah,7,t5_38oby
