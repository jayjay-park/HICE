690115,0,t1_cgih8p6,Sorry for the ambiguous wording. When you connect something with bluetooth to another thing with bluetooth it is called pairing.

I also use a Moto X and never received a report of bad quality but I managed to break the screen on it.,MINI,cgipuxf,2,t5_2rutj
694000,0,t1_cgj5p0d,Yeah mine has the screen built in to the dash but I assumed that would be entirely too much work to integrate a backup camera with it. This way you just have a separate monitor for the backup camera. Not ideal but way less work and you dont risk voiding your warranty over tampering with the builtin electronics. The builtin monitor already switches to a reverse sensing mode so you would probably not want to lose that anyway.,MINI,cgj5rkw,1,t5_2rutj
837481,0,t3_23phay,Harmon Kardon is a very nice system if you are an audiophile it may not be good enough but for the regular consumer it is great. I plan to get it with my next MINI. I cant remember for second generation MINIs but I think its both upgraded speakers and an amp and Im pretty sure the head unit is the same or pretty similar. As for changing the head unit it can be done but it is a PITA to do so. A lot of the dash has to come off you will need to figure out what to do with the radio controls that are part of the speedometer...its just not worth it. So I suggest just getting the HK upgrade from the factory. It will end up being less expensive.I have driven a Cooper automatic with paddle shifters. It wasnt bad and once I got used to I ended up driving it for  days operating the paddle shifters it was kind of fun. It really depends on your driving style and preferences. You should test drive an automatic S and see first hand.Auto climate control is a must have. However soon it will become standard equipment for no extra charge. Ask you Motoring Advisor when this is going to happen because it could save you . HK is another but that was already talked about. Sport suspension is great but it depends on your driving style. ,MINI,cgzh340,2,t5_2rutj

1411306,0,t3_2a9vzy,Depends on what youll be throwing up there. I have the Yakima Loadwarrior basket because Ive been driving all over the country. Hard to keep stuff locked down to the basket and if it needs to stay dry you have to wrap it in plastic. You can probably get more stuff on it though. You also have to make sure it cinched down tight.But you can get a basket put a box on it and still have room for other stuff if you situate it right. One of the pictures below shows a snowboard racked to the basket beside a giant load of plasticwrapped body parts clothes. Im not sure that the base rack would leave enough room to put more than just a box on it but it might. And after looking at the Mini luggage rack Im not sure if you could put a box or board rack on that at all. I dont really care for that official basket personally.For my purposes I dont think I could fit enough into a box. However it would be really nice to be able to lock things up and not have to worry about weather.Whatever you decide you can get nonMini branded versions for significantly cheaper on Amazon brand new or Craigslist used.

8001504,0,t3_4oquqw,Just wanted to drop in amp confirm that build to orders placed now will definitely be s. I was told that by several dealerships. It made me sad since theyre stripping down the service plan for  models amp theyre also not due to arrive until September.  Dealerships seems pretty competitive with MINI amp I think that they know a lot of us are willing to fly ampor drive to get a MINI we really want. I dont think many if any? are willing to transfer cars from one dealership to another. I had a dealership tell me there was nothing matching my specs in Southern California despite the fact that a dealership  miles from that one had the exact model in stock when I looked online. Oh wells.As for dealer discounts Ive found it really depends on the dealership. Some are willing to give you whatever deal is running when you take delivery while others are basically like Nah you custom ordered I aint giving you a discount! Ha. Youve just gotta shop around amp find a dealer youre comfortable dealing with. Definitely go with an F if you are looking to start a family.

8158125,0,t1_d4x4wwj,Definitely pointing you in the right direction the computer uses the reading from the manifold pressure sensor to determine charge air density and meter fuel from the injectors. That code is indicating a fault somewhere in the intake system.Before you buy a new sensor do a careful inspection of all the intake components Intake tube from the air filter box intercooler boots bypass valve hose though this is usually impossible to see with everything assembled. Check for any obviously cracked or broken out rubber or plastic missing clamps any broken vacuum lines etc. Basically anywhere where unmetered air may be leaking in or charge air after the supercharger may be leaking out. It may be that the sensor is reporting a genuine low pressure condition. If the car will idle long enough see if you can detect any hissing or whistling noises anywhere along the intake air path that may indicate a leak.Also inspect the MAP sensor harness connector and make sure the wires didnt crack or otherwise get damaged by contact with hot engine components etc.If everything looks good then the sensor may indeed be faulty. The internet indicates that there are two MAP sensors on the R one before and one after the supercharger and that they are different. Be sure to get the right one.Hopefully that solves your problem. If you dont find a leak and the issue persists after replacing the sensor you may need to open up the intake for a better look. If you can get your hands on one you can use a smoke leak detection machine to smoke the intake and look for leaks without taking everything apart but those things are professional equipment and expensive as hell so not easy to come by.Good luck! Hopefully its an easy fix.,MINI,d4xbb5h,1,t5_2rutj

They had my car for well over a month rebuilding it. Once I got it back I had to take it back to repair other things they damaged during the engine rebuild such as various electrical connections and somehow the stereo and Bluetooth telephoneiPod interface were not working after the engine repair. It appeared that the tech did not know how to disconnect the wiring and just pulled stuff apart.
