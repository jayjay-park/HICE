4916337,0,t3_3i8hum,I believe you mean  on censorship rather than  but either way thats not really the case. Ive seen quite a lot of bad feedback about Marvel Heroes current Limbo event on the forums.The reason Gazillion are rebranding is that they in their own words have been holding back content when they realised they had enough to completely rebrand the game. Think of it as an expansion pack to an MMO only you dont pay for it and everyone gets it all at once later this year around OctoberNovember time.The current default costumes look quite bad yes and this has also been addressed including an example picture of Jean Grey remodeled for the  update. All defalt costumes are getting graphical tweaks to make them look better.End of the day this game offers you everything for free. Heroes can be bought with Eternity Splinters a unique currency that drop in honesty fairly regularly from ALL mobs everywhere in the game. As for the good costumes costing  dollars well costumes have varying price. Some costumes that I have purchased have only cost me  others have been given to me for free either through completing an achievement or by getting lucky from a loot drop from a mob.I find the game very very rewarding. You get a lot of stuff back from the game depending on how many hours you put in. Youre rewarded for play time and with them reviewing older heroes and updating them every character is more or less balanced with each other baring a few exceptions like Doom or Scarlet Witch who rather than being nerfed later the devs have said they want to bring others up to their level like Jean Grey who now plays pretty well and fun.BY all means Im not saying this is the best game ever made because it really isnt and Diablo and Path of Exile are probably better top down action rpgs but if you fancy dicking about for a couple of hours as a Marvel comics character than this is the game for you. After one day of playing you get  eternity splinters which you can turn into two heroes FOR FREE. ,mmo,cue8pw2,1,t5_2qm3q

7250459,0,t3_4eq3y0,Also you can find another written summary of the siege stream here    Just in case heres copypaste Wednesday night was supposed to be the big night. Beta  announcement! Thats what many of us cried. Thats what many of us expected. Thats not what we were given. We expected at least an update on beta  and it was sort of delivered. We were told that we could not be given a very precise date for beta  because some people were out and they were still trying to fix a lot of bugs. City State Entertainment has been working hard as shown by their many livestreams on the game and so most of us understand and that makes it a bit easier to take. Fortunately they did have some interesting information to help us sit down and be patient.For updates on beta  they do have a ton of features going in and will have some initial Vox Magus art in. Players will also be able to craft ballista bolts. If all goes well alpha testers may be able to test the new features next week. They have also made a little progress on hiring new programmers.Siege Mechanics!Mark Jacobs dropped a ton of information on Camelot Unchained siege mechanics and you can say that I was more than a little interested. It certainly helped me forget my desire for a beta  launch date as I got to finally sink my teeth into his ideas for siege. This isnt necessarily parts of siege that will be in beta  but rather their intention to push siege into something a little more BSC.For making siege a truly awesome system rather than the usual mechanic that has players sitting there clicking on a button to repeatedly lob rocks at a building I think they are going to focus on three areas automation counterplay and realm differences.AutomationA lot of time was spent talking about defensive siege weapons. One issue that has repeatedly come up in regards to Camelot Unchained has to do with cube how you prevent night capping. People will spend tons of time building their own keeps and so players cant simply walk in and take them in an hour or in the middle of the night when no one is on. It seemed that MJ was suggesting that Camelot Unchained will have some sorts of automated defenses for these keeps. Specifically AI guards perhaps automated siege weapons and even shields. NPC guards have been mentioned numerous times and will undoubtedly be in the game but arent really enough. As everyone knows NPC guards in most PvP games usually end up being either really underpowered or really overpowered. It is very difficult to make them challenging and interesting. CSE hopes to find interesting ways to utilize guards and magic to provide this sort of passive defense that can still be interesting for PvPers. Having defensive siege might help as well since it can target enemy siege andor provide a strong defense against careless players.Of course the real feature that is likely to be controversial is the idea of shields. In this context Im assuming that shields refer to some sort of magical barrier that will prevent people for invading and claiming a keep. I suspect that only keeps of a certain size and power will have shields or that smaller ones will have weaker shields that take less time to disable. Shields probably serve two purposes. . To delay capture of a building and . To help forewarn the keeps owners of an attack. It may be that scouts are required to set off an attack alarm but I suspect that attacking a shield may do it  at least for the owners of that keep. This would give them a chance to mount a defense. This is something they addressed but Mark Jacobs said that they want to get player feedback on it. The shields in Camelot Unchained are also not intended to be a single solid bubble covering an entire keep. Instead it sounds like they will be broken into sections. Thus an attack on a keeps shield can focus on a single wedge of that shield in order to bring down just that segment. Alternatively attackers can focus on multiple locations to provide more avenues for attack.Shields and other automated defenses will not be unbeatable. There are definite limitations to those systems. First of all being that it is very difficult to design AI that can provide a real challenge to players  especially in a PvPfocused game. Second being that not every keep will be able to have the best of every type of defense. Players will have to choose what to specialize in with their keeps. Third being that the game will feature some sort of keep power. Each keep will I presume have some sort of energyresource that powers its automated systems. This resource can likely be cut off by sieging players to prevent defenders from simply turtling inside the keep.CounterplayCounterplay is also intended to be a big aspect of this. They dont just want people lobbing rocks at one another they want tactical planning and implementation. One area where this may play out is in power. It seemed to be suggested that players may be able to boost a keeps power with their own. This might be crafters with vox power or any player Im not sure. This could enable players to help repower shields while awaiting reinforcements and since shields are segmented players can choose where to focus that power. This might also apply to guards and automated defenses as well. They want reactives in the system as well as there to be an important element of choice.cube As mentioned players wont be able to have the best of everything in every keep. You will have to select which types of defenses you want. Different automated defenses will be stronger against different types of offensive siege. Thus you may select one type of defense and have your enemies adapt by bringing offensive siege that is stronger against those weapons. They intend to have LOTS of different types of medieval siege not just the standard catapult. Were talking ballista trebuchets siege towers siege ladders battering rams mangonels onagers perhaps even bombs.Thats right I said bombs. Magical bombs crafter made? were even mentioned as a means for bringing down keep walls and gaining access. This is in addition of course to players have some abilities that can weaken or destroy enemy walls. And siege ammunition can be crafted with many different features. Some may do more direct damage some may explode for AoE damage etc. In general most siege will be slow and not particularly good against individual players thank goodness for dodging! but that doesnt mean someone cant make a siege weapon specifically to kill people.Realm DifferencesOne final big consideration in making siege compelling is to have realm differences. The theme of Camelot Unchained is nonmirrored realms. This extends beyond simply the classes. Siege will also be somewhat nonmirrored. Obviously some things will work the same. A ladder is a ladder. A tower is a tower. But there may be some siege that are specialized to each realm and certainly in some cases each realm will not siege in the same fashion! The Tuatha combat style is totally different from the Vikings and we may see them employing very different siege strategies.There are other tidbits of siege information that Mark Jacobs released for us The deeper a building is within your realms territory and the longer it has been owned by your realm the longer it will take for an enemy to capture it. Thus players cannot easily backdoor less guarded keeps deep within your territory. Given how C.U.B.E. works crafters may be able to build ramps up keep walls. There will be caravans to pulltransport your siege engines. Once built siege engines are permanent until destroyed. Players can be launched over walls using siege.,mmo,d22bq43,1,t5_2qm3q

Though the fights and dungeons take longer and we dont know what the endgame will look like yet.
