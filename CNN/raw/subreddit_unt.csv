11374524,0,t3_6295we,Musician here so Im biased. Theyre both great classes but I would have to say music appreciation. It teaches you a lot about different genres and forms and goes into a bit of detail as to how music is put together.That being said I loved art appreciation. It taught me a bit about art history and different types of art. Just be prepared to go to a couple of galleries andor museums. In my specific class last Spring we had to do a  entry journal with specific items around UNT and Denton. It was quite timeconsuming and was only really doable because I made a trip to the Dallas Museum of Art one day to take a ton of pictures.Also I second Music in the Human Imagination. It teaches a lot about music history without going terribly in depth. It covers famous composers and pieces and makes you really appreciate how we got to where we are today.,unt,dfla6ew,1,t5_2s5gf
