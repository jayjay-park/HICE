2395841,0,t3_2mv1ji,M ugh seriously? Why do I have to keep reposting this? mFrance has been forced to these measures to prevent even greater loss of life on behalf of not only the soldiers of the Republic but of the inhabitants of Indochina who are suffering daily under the depredations of the guerrillas. The use of this device was carefully considered and its use authorized only after thorough analysis determined that this option would minimize deaths in the longrun and bring the war to the swiftest and best possible conclusion.We did the best that we could to ensure that the strike only targeted a Viet Minh position. The blame for any civilian casualties lies on the guerrillas leaders not the French as the former have frequently used them as human shields during this conflict. All the more reason that we chose to act the way we have to bring the war to a swift end and minimize the harm to innocents perpetrated on a daily basis by rebel forces.Our use of the atomic bomb though carried out within our own territory not against an enemy nation is more similar to the American use than you might at first think both detonations minimized the loss of life that would occur through a prolonged invasion and both sought to bring a war to a swift close. This is not barbarity this is the height of civilization.We regret that we could not have warned any civilians in the area but due to the guerrillas underhanded nature we had to strike quickly before they moved their headquarters. Had we given them advance warning they likely would have fled  if the strike had still been carried out any civilians caught in the blast would have died for nothing. We mourn those who were lost but they died so that Indochina may live. When all of Vietnam is once more liberated from communist oppression we shall make amends to the survivors and their families.m Keep in mind that the use of tactical nuclear weapons was an unsettled question in the early s their use wouldnt necessarily make a nation a pariah like it would now.

The Brits sent troops to Goa not Dadra. Both these movements were noted in the resolution posts and both definitely meant that Portugal will hold out a little bit longer.The fact that you expect the winds of change to completely change in Portugals favour isnt good roleplaying.

9623080,0,t3_5ctfb7,We Southern Rhodesia warned the State of Belgium that for each civilian killed each refugee shot that we would demand reparations. We warned them as they flew their planes illegally over our lands in an attempt to advertise their own brand of a Foreign Legion. We warned them if they did not stop we would take action. They stopped.We warned them and told them that cholera is not contagious in the way they thought. Out of all of this a vaccination was just discovered for cholera meaning they could have been treated. We warned them that these people were desperate and needed to be shown reason. People in times of desperation see only what they want to.We warned them  if you kill our people our citizens then we will seek reparations. Now we seek reparations. We warned you for those  that had escaped we would be seeking  per death. Now We seek a public apology   and a court martial of any and every soldier involved. They were warned and told on how to properly handle refugees in such a situation but they ignored our calls. They ignored it and favored violence and the brutal murder of  Rhodesians. Ontop of this after firing they sought no remorse. They simply yelled Be prepared for more! in a rage of savagery. This incident was a clear cut case of brutality that was completely unnecessary and we also demand that the United Kingdom do intervene to protect the citizens of the Royal Crown in times of such injustice.All bombers and fighters are now set to a state of fullalertness. They are in full gear and set up prepared to get in their planes and fly to retaliate against the Belgium Congo  Belgium a nation still recovering from the Second World War their very own capital still in ruins. Their military still devastated and recovering. They will be no match against the Rhodesian Air Force and Military Might if they so choose to fight. We are ready for the worst.secret,ColdWarPowers,d9z8rcm,1,t5_33wgr

10685680,0,t3_5suj1t,Given the issues related to Syrias past especially the atrocities committed during the Syrian occupation of Lebanon we are skeptical to Syrias intentions. For a nation claiming to be committed to peace we need confirmation that Syria is serious about peace. Coinciding with the escalation of tensions between PanArab states and the Alliance of the Periphery Arabs in Chad have begun forming a threat to the government. This action would constitute an act of war and will lead to conflict if a Chadian investigation reveals foreign interference. We demand to know what Syria knows about this as we are likely to be more lenient than Chad or Israel should Arab involvement be discovered. ,ColdWarPowers,ddi5bhj,1,t5_33wgr
