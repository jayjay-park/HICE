19157,0,t1_ceghpot,Thanks for taking the time to check it out. Yes it is in the library. All of my music is in the My Music folder.I added the subfolder to see if that would work but it still doesnt see it. So then I removed the Music folder from the library and added it back. It still shows all my collection except for that song. Well a couple songs at least because the same thing happens with my Bioshock Infinite soundtracks. So far it seems to happen with stuff thats not matched to the cloud. Another thing is that it also happens on my Windows Phone. It wouldnt sync with the Windows Phone app so I manually copied it onto the phone. The search doesnt bring it up in there either but at least it appears in the new section as unknown artistalbum.more screenshots... ,microsoft,cegm4ah,2,t5_2qh1b

When he was looking at the original Xbox he could see right away that by going with off the shelf parts he wasnt going to make money or MSFT will break even. He can see numbers and sales etc. like nobodys business. I also loved him in terms of the love he has for the company. I dont even think Bill Gates loves MSFT more than Steve Ballmer. But sometimes that love can be blinding.He missed out on Mobile even with windows CE. He missed out on Tablets and search. Maybe cloud debatable. There are countless stories of him staffing up the wrong people or allowing shit to go on when it shouldnt have windows . He was a sales guy in a visionary job. Again very difficult to do but he was at the helm when that happened. For me what I disliked about him was his irrational buying sprees. Aquantive B Skype Nokia the sad day when we had to let go   people. Along with not getting his lieutants in order Steven Sinofsky Don Mattrick Xbox one disaster Ray Ozzie.

This delivery method is outlined in their EULA. It will include contact information for the Microsoft licensing agent that is running the audit. You can call them and discuss it with them if you like. Once you receive the letter dont make changes to your environment. The audit is done by an independent third party usually Price Waterhouse Cooper and takes around a month. Once the audit is complete the third party will review the results of the audit with you in order to ensure that you agree before scheduling the closing review call with Microsoft. Once you and Microsoft review the results together you will work out a plan in order to close the licensing gap is there is one. Having said all of this it seems that their method of contact is not in alignment with the EULA and you can feel free to point this out to them. Hope this helps. ,microsoft,cn886n1,3,t5_2qh1b

The reasons being are that if anything goes wrong in your system you are able to completely restore it regardless of how messed up it has gotten or in the event of drive failure. After a restore your system is as if you hadnt turned it on since the backup. All files that were present at that time are still there all programs and games are still installed etc. A free alternative to Acronis that Ive heard of but have never used is CloneZilla.

As of right now Id like to replace my MBP with the surface book but I dont have the funds... And I live in Canada. But if I had the money is definitely buy a surface book.

To say it wasnt is like saying the  was bad because its not as good as an i cpu today. Its like saying the iphone  sucked because its not an Iphone s. Its not fair to judge the the device of the past to the latest devices today. For its time the Surface was a bold and incredibly ambitious device and frankly Apple is still chasing it while MS is on SP. Were lucky they had a vision and went for it.

They made early attempts but positioned Windows Mobile then Windows Phone as more of an extension to the traditional PC then a device that can stand on its own. Web services offered by Google and Apples iOS app ecosystem is now the hub of digital life so it makes sense for those companies to try to expand those offerings to the desktop as well as IoT Amazon Echo Google OnHub etc. Android will transition to a desktop OS iOS will replace OS X. Beyond that IoT will rule computing. Amazon and Google will dominate the consumer computing landscape as the internet continues to grow so will Google and Amazon. Apple will start to fade as its premium localized hardware will not only no longer be needed their lack of AI and web services will spawn disinterest from consumers because the digital experience they offer will suffer.

Same reason Im opposed to bans on encryption. Giving the power to snoop to the government can just as easily mean that the worst people have access to your personal information and if they mandate backdoors into everything including hardware short of not going on the internet youre pretty much boned.Senators are already pushing for laws to ban strong encryption in the US which could put people at risk for hackers and other people who would abuse data that should be secured because either weak encryption or backdoors that can be exploited by hackers as well.If it takes a billion dollar company concerned with its bottom line to tell the government it cant peer in peoples things without a warrant Im okay with that.At one point the patriot act seemed like a good idea to stop terrorist but since more and more private stuff is online and I dont trust certain politicians to be transparent with their own communications let alone transparent with mine Id rather not give them the power to be jerks.I mean yeah theres a certain amount of risk when it comes to sharing your own personal information and data and that is up to you to actually do but I dont believe the government should be able to treat your personal files like a buffet without a warrant.,microsoft,d283fui,1,t5_2qh1b

This is given because it gives a safety net for employees that might be laid off given the alternative.It also gives Microsoft a potential write off in taxes should LinkedIn go nowhere for Microsoft similar to the Nokia deal.The real issue This is not an uncommon thing for corporate companies Apple Samsung Sony they all do these kinds of practices and its  LEGAL lets not forget this.  Heres where it gets messy  Say you bought a AMG Mercedes Benz for K and took out a loan even if you have  million in the bank.  By taking the loan option your credit rating typically goes up if you have good credit amp your given insurance incentives by going thru a loan i.e. loan forgiveness if you crash your car.
