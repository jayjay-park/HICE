Together they can mess up your digestive system. Thats true with me. I have to time when I take it and not drink for the first few days and watch how what I eat. The active ingredient is fatsoluble BTW.Definitely cut those pills. Anything more than a half a pill is wayyyy too much for me. A half pill lasts me pretty much a full week as far as feeling the presence of a third leg that is always at the ready sometimes overeager to go.But stage fright is still stage fright. You are trying to tell yourself something so better to figure out what that something is and work through it. Either you feel guilty or embarrassed or afraid of something.

Just in general even if it wasnt her...Let her know you found the idea hot not necessarily that it is specifically about this girl. There are many ways to approach it but I agree the sooner the better. Also know that if you do your wife could go off the rails and demand you are never to be alone with her again.

843023,0,t1_cgyud37,Im not sure quite where youre coming up with this... There are no dues charged for time you were away. If its been more than thirty days since your dues expired there are two options. One of them is a  reinstatement fee and then  for the following six months. BUT we set up the second option for people who cant quite afford such a high bill. Monthly recurring billing which can be cancelled at any time waives the  reinstatement and is only  for three months in advance and then  monthly. So if you didnt want the monthly charges afterwards by all means you could cancel the recurring the next day and still have three months paid for. So in all honesty if were talking how cheap we can go if youve expired its only  to renew and then you can just cancel that option the day after.And again if money is an issue thats why we created the volunteer program. Six hour shifts doing dishes setting up greeting closing or helping in the kitchen gets you free parties for a quarter of a year and you start getting the free parties before youve even worked the shifts! You schedule the shifts and get added to the volunteer list.There are a lot of moneysaving options in place now that were member owned and being run with a board of directors who want to please the membership as a whole. Keep up to date because its unfortunate that your experience here has left you with the feeling you have about New Horizons. I personally live paycheck to paycheck im not some rich mofo who can throw around hundreds like they dont matter Ive just taken advantage of the volunteer opportunities here for myself and my partner to attend every single party at no charge.,Swingers,ch03s2q,2,t5_2qyei

1244256,0,t3_28afz0,Agree with others. Check out the sites on the right SLS is big but spotty depending on the area. Kasidie is much classier but being a paid member opens more doors as many including us dont search the unpaid accounts. Quiver.us is our new place to hang but its new and smaller but growing pretty fast. The site is far more modern messaging works much better mobile support is growing etc. Currently free but will start doing paid accounts soon. We started off as same room sex then softswap and now dont really have any requirements though we are extremely selective since our availability is so limited. But so far all three sites SLS Kasidie and Quiver have produced some great couples and friends just takes more time and filtering on SLS IMHO.

1264709,0,t1_cibsgit,If I tried to pick up girls at the club for us  wed never meet anyone. Also  it depends on the type of club you mean.  At a strip club  for example  its all about repitition.  The girls see us two  or three times  and start to get curious.  After awhile  theyll com hang out and start to ask why we are there.  Almost every one of them is intrigued when we tell them that we both enjoy girls  we have no jealousy between us  and we are in the lifestyle together. More than once  thats has lead to meeting up with a girl from the club outside of work  going out to dinner  dancing  live bands whatever.  I think that in general  the girls are more comfortable being friends with couples they met in work outside of work because they dont have to worry about some single guy stalking them. In regular clubs its far easier to meet bi girls  and become friends with them  but it takes a lot longer to play with them if at all. Seems like every time she hits the dance floor  she comes back with one she thinks is bi.  I guess its kinda obvious when youre dancing  and thw other girl iscall up on you. Weve had various degrees of success with both  but thats far more than weve had with finding a single bi female on a swinger site. I would caution thst you shouldnt expect to play right away.  When we meet up witj girls like this  its usually to go out to a dance club  concert  rave  party  etc.  The times when weve been fortunate enough to getvmore than just girls kissing are probably the th or th time together. That doesnt really botj us  tho  because were typically slow progressers anyways. ,Swingers,cibw98h,2,t5_2qyei

1282396,0,t3_28rwhi,I think its impossible for anyone else to say whats happening since were only hearing your side of the story. I will say  its not what you want to hear but you do come off as rather arrogant going on about how attractive you think you are compared with everyone else at your club talking about people not even in the same league etc. For me and I suspect for most people energyattitude matters at least as much as plain old looks. In fact I cant separate the two. Ive met no small number of people who were objectively very attractive and who I wouldnt touch with a tenfoot pole because they have bad energy. Is it possible this is you? There is such a thing as an unlucky streak. And having a number of letdowns can impact your confidence and that can come across subconsciously too. But in general when you keep getting the same result over and over you have to look at the common denominator in this case its the two of you. You mentioned that one of these couples are friends of friends. Could you possibly confide in them with an abridged version of what youve offered here and ask their counsel? Its awkward but you might get some insight that can help break your unlucky patch. Good luck whatever you decide to do. ,Swingers,cidvx4o,14,t5_2qyei

Your story really spoke to me especially seeing as how you progressed relatively slowly but still encountered issues.Do you think had there been more communication and more defined boundaries with your friends wife that there wouldnt have been a problem?My friend and I are both very careful about coercion. We are both lucky enough to have partners that would do pretty much anything to please us so we feel that taking extra precautions in terms of making sure they are doing it for their own desires as well and not just to please us is extremely important to us. Did she come out and say she was into it because it was what her husband wanted or do you think she believed she was ready for it only to find out she wasnt? I feel like it is an important distinction.Either way Im taking your advice to heart and holding off until we can actually all chat as a group and find out what everyone feels they want out of the situation.Sorry for all the questions your experience just seems very similar and relevant.

1498443,0,t1_cj3rleb,To the OP you should tread carefully on that one. Maybe bringing up in conversation if they had ever played solo may shed some light on how open they are. As for this post it reminded me of a couple we met at a MampG where my wife had met a couple and totally was turned on by the guy and knew she really wanted to fuck him. The female was into me but she was not that appealing to me at first. She was a little overweight but cute. As the night went on and we got to know them better she was definitely an upbeat funny and allaround great conversationalist and an expert flirt. Well she won me over and we all headed out to the hotel next door and it was one of the most enjoyable sexual encounters we had ever had. I know my wife had multiple orgasms that night and I had an exhausting time and just kept up with her. We have played many times since then and are one of our good friends outside the lifestyle as well. ,Swingers,cj43rn2,0,t5_2qyei

Everybody has at least  thing that you can be attracted to. Eyes the way they smile their laugh the way they tilt their head that little curl of hair at the nape of the neck thats adorable etc. seek out and look for that  thing and build on that. this is not to say that you should be coerced into doing something you dont want to do or take one for the team. if youre not feelin it then dont do it. but if youre trying to change your perceptive of attraction that might help. ,Swingers,cj7d5t8,1,t5_2qyei

2386087,0,t3_2mqaon,OK weve never encountered anyone trying to blackmail us.The majority of scammers are basically single men who create profiles as a couple looking to meet other couples. Then they chat you up and basically try to get you to send them pictures and that goes into their spank bank. There are forums online theres even a subreddit for trading such pics.The easiest way around that is no risque photos that show faces. So partial nude  lingerie photos should never include your face. When you do send face photos to confirm with other couples they should be vanilla photos and only headshots from the shoulders up. So if your Rrated pics get leaked somehow there is no way to prove they actually belong to you because there are no faces.NEVER send x rated or fully nudes to anyone you have not met and played with in real life. Thats our policy at least. If anyone asks just say no and if they are scammers they will back off right away and go bother somebody else.How to screenLook for certs. You can trust them a bit more.Get face photos.Make the F call you or call the F to confirm.Then set up a date.ANYONE who is unwilling to go through this very simple process is probably a scammer so just ignore them.,Swingers,cm6mn55,1,t5_2qyei

2646250,0,t3_2q5pes,I suggest you do what my wife did when I proposed the concept of swinging to her do some research. There are some books suggested in the righthand column of this subreddit. I would suggest also The Lifestyle a look at the erotic rites of swingers by Terry Gould. What appealed to my wife was that women are in control that is they say what does and does not happen. No always means no. Our first experience was at a swinger club we attended with the idea of visiting three times before we made a decision and we went with no expectations. However our first experience was quite wonderful and we were off an running.. actually it was all I could to do keep up with my wifes enthusiasm.You dont have to have sex with people other than your husband full swap. Many couples just enjoy being in the erotic and sexy atmosphere and play with each other exclusively soft swinging. The whole basis is for you to comfortably express your sexual freedom without pressure or expectations. Learn about it explore it do what feels comfortable for you. I will tell you this my wife calls swinging a relationship enhancing activity. ,Swingers,cn3zwdo,2,t5_2qyei
2673420,0,t3_2qmrxg,For me EVERY relationship moves from secondary to primary.  I think of it as dating phase and committed phase.  I dont know how to describe the difference exactly but I can feel it.  Theres a change and usually a talk that says  I want you a part of my life.  I want to build it with you.  I want you to have significant influence in the same way anyone else in the polyship has influence.  Its what makes me feel comfortable calling my partner when he and our girlfriend get out of a concert yet I wouldnt even text my partner when hes on a date with a new girl.  With the former well they BOTH want to talk to me plus theyre just...hanging out...not really on a date.  She might stay over with him the whole weekend I certainly wouldnt NOT talk to him that long.Yes there are people who use it as a way to rank their partners importance.  But if thats not your thing well just dont date them.  P.S.  I might get over the hangup of equality if I were you.  I get way more time with my first partner than our girlfriend does well much more in person time.  Yet just because we arent treated exactly the same does not lessen her importance.  Just indicates her schedule with him and with me just isnt currently as compatible.,Swingers,cn7je5d,1,t5_2qyei

It is interesting to experience the what do I do with this? response when you have been an owner of the equipment your whole life.  But I got over that.  It has also been my experience in swinging so far that all but one guy we have been with were down for a little guy guy stuff but YMMV.  Mostly I think guys are just afraid to ask for fear of looking gay like theres no middle ground.  I say if it doesnt squick you out go for it...the worst that can happen is you discover you dont like it and if so dont do it again.

3070536,0,t3_2uz1a3,There have been a couple of recent threads about this from the single womans perspective so you might want to go back amp take a look at those for additional thoughts. Im a single woman amp cant say Ive gotten superduper involved in the lifestyle scene e.g. I dont go to parties or clubs and have only met people on or on. So my perspective on this is somewhat limited. But I can tell you that  Like most people my criteria for someone Id have fun with are quite different for my criteria for someone Id consider having a relationship withlooks are certainly not the most important to me and I havent encountered any guys through lifestyle channels that Id consider dating.  This is a personal preference but Id only consider dating someone lifestylefriendly rather than someone lifestylefocused because I dont want my lifesocial life to revolve around swinging. So I think its unlikely that Id ever meet an active lifestyle guy whod be right for me.All that said  in terms of online stuff I second the suggestion to focus on okcupid. In my geo area it seems to attract more unconventional types than other dating sites. You can also answer lots of questions amp designate their importance to you and you can see how a woman answered her questions before you contact her. Its also one of few online dating sites that allows users to select bisexual as their orientation. The fact someone is bi doesnt necessarily mean that shes open to nonmonogamous relationships or to swinging but it could be a clue in some cases. You might also try going to events or joining groups that would attract sexpositive women. I belong to a couple of meetup.org groups focused on tantra and have been contacted by several men through that site who are in the same groups. I would definitely consider connecting with someone through meetup if he seemed interesting to me. Hope that helps! ,Swingers,cog9akv,1,t5_2qyei

It only took  months to go from average weight and not very athletic to having a pretty good physique. Theres a Lifestyle Fitness chat room on Quiver.us that I created would be happy to chat with you there if this is your big concern. Its not a huge deal and honestly at  years old you are still young for the swinger crowd and taking a few months to get in good shape so you can start later in the year is no big deal. You can still start to make friends now honestly taking it slower is probably better we jumped right in and had to learn everything the hard way.The other thing you can do is just have an MFM or two and see how you like that.

She still does not like porn will not read erotica and does not overtly act naughty but we found a wonderful balance. Communication is key! good luck,Swingers,cpjdfuf,5,t5_2qyei

3782698,0,t3_33pp8n,I think youve gotten lots of good feedback here. As a bi woman whos been in several longterm monogamous relationships with men I wanted to throw a couple of additional thoughts out there.  For many including me bisexuality is part of ones identity not just a sexual preference. When youre in a longterm hetero relationship people generally perceive you to be hetero because thats considered the default in our culture and your bisexuality is basically invisible. I didnt have a terrible problem sexually with being monogamous but I have felt like I lose a piece of my identity in that situation and thats tough. I feel different in my relationships with women than I do with men perhaps because I experience more freedom to exist outside of the societal norms for women and I do miss that aspect of myself when Im involved only with a man.  Theres nothing wrong with feeling like you should be enough for your wifethats a value thats drilled into our heads from the time were old enough to read books or watch tv. Our cultures relationship model is very egodriven and encourages us to take personally the things that make our partners human animalsthat were not naturally inclined to be monogamous and that we do crave variety in our sexual partners. Not everyone can or wants to act on that and theres absolutely nothing wrong with that. But for your own sake please start questioning your assumption that something is wrong because youre not enough for her. This isnt really about you and its not personalshes experiencing an aspect of herself that exists outside of our cultural training and theres nothing wrong with that either. You just have to keep talking about it and find a solution that works for both of you. I have a lot of empathy for you and what youre feeling and I hope you continue to communicate with your wife and find a middle way that you can both be happy with. ,Swingers,cqngffj,7,t5_2qyei

TAKE control.  he might be in a daze.  push his head down into your crotch and tell him to get it wet for when hes ready. ENCOURAGE him.  tell him how badly you want him to fuck you.

Talking in person is a much richer experience since there are more nonverbal nontexual cues to pick up on.  Plus some people are not naturally photogenic.  So seeing them in person will give you a different perspective than looking at online photos.

If customs checks your package theyll send you a letter asking you to provide proof that you have a prescription or something similar or just seize it and send you a seizure letter.It usually makes it through US customs fine though and even if it does get seized theyre not going to show up at your house.

For all you know they had a  guy creampie party the very next day after taking the test so it would be inaccurate anyways. You have no proof they had no sexual activity between getting tested and meeting you. So get over your fear play safe accept the risk or just dont bother.,Swingers,cvrvdvp,0,t5_2qyei

It was only up for a half day and I just felt crappy about posting it without talking to my wife first. Kind of disappointing too because only got six clicks on our profile. And then kind of panicked when somebody poked me and I had no idea how to proceed. Even if I was interested I hadnt told my wife yet.  What would I say to my wife?  Hey you remember Monday night when you said we should bring somebody into our bedroom? Well guess what? Were hooking up with some strangers  miles away in Central Texas.

Once I got it to half work successfully there was a huge weight off my shoulders and I was fine and back to normal from then on.For me it was a total mental thing and I just made it worse and worse with each experience.Once I was comfortable with the people I was around it just worked.I wouldnt stress about it if you can help it.

5427878,0,t1_cw5f7u0,Eh every couple is different in the same way each individual is different.Theres nothing wrong with looking for friends in swinging though a lot arent as it adds an extra level of potential complication to a situation that is already ripe with potential problems.  But again there are some who prefer long term friendships but just remember that everyones priority should be their partner.As far as texts...  It depends on the couple and even the person youre talking to directly.  Using myself as an example Im usually very chatty in text quick to respond and joke.  However if Im busy with work or admittedly a video game I might postpone responding till Im done only to forget entirely.  Never anything personal just how I am.Others may take a more professional route and only reply with what is necessary.  Its not being rude its just being curt.  In the end this is about what you want.  If text message frequency is more important to you than the sex portion then look for a couple that texts more.  But it will always be a trial and error just like dating when you were single.,Swingers,cw5gtzw,1,t5_2qyei

5804037,0,t3_3ujm1n,If you have qualms about playing with them then dont play with them. Move on to someone else.You should know that if you are going to play you should just plan on getting tested yourself twice a year. Any more than that and you can end up with either false positives or false negatives. Of course if you notice anything unusual between tests you should have it checked out. And have the complete full spectrum tests done  ones that cover everything  ask the doctor what the test covers and make sure it does cover everything.If you are going to play with others you WILL have a greater chance of eventually catching something. You can accept that fact and play or think that it is too great a risk for you and not play. By the way despite what some may say about condoms being pretty universal in the lifestyle there is a large percentage of swingers that do play bareback with others. Some of those play bareback with anyone and some only with couples that they have known a while. That is not to say that you should play bare if you dont want to just understand that a lot of people will and do.,Swingers,cxgjnfq,1,t5_2qyei

6385822,0,t3_434bbb,Were mid s and have a core group of lifestyle friends. Ive discussed potential male bisexual play with my wife as a fantasy but havent actually done anything. However I wouldnt ever discuss this with our lifestyle friends because they arent open minded enough to accept it. When we first started meeting people at parties etc. I repeatedly heard from the men how theyre straight and are turned off or disgusted by guys that are into guys. Some would tell stories about how they were hit on a by a guy and it became a joke that they tell to others. There are a few more open minded guys who at least say theyd have no problem as long as their own preferences as straight are accepted. I was once talking to this girl and we got into the topic of bisexuality. She said shes straight when I asked her and then she turned it around on me and asked if I would play with a guy thinking that Id say eww never but instead I said who knows Ill try anything once. It really took her aback. I definitely think it shouldnt be that big of a deal but on the other hand I do remember a time when I wouldnt have considered it at all and was actively turned off by bisexual porn.

Clientele seemed mostly on the upper end of that age range. Some definitely older. But because there were so many people there we also saw quite a few around our age . The first time you go you are given a tour by one of the more veteran couples. This was a good ice breaker and certainly helped calm the nerves since we had so many questions. It also gave us an in to play with a couple later on in the night since we had talked previously.There is a main floor with a bar although its BYOB dance floor restrooms coat room which is not attended and even a snack table lol. If you bring liquor you have to give it to the bartender and pay for a mix. For example I brought gin and paid  dollars per drink for ginSprite. If you bring beerwine they just charge you a one time uncorking fee of  I believe. Downstairs is a play room. Its decently dark and has several connected mattresses for groupindividual play. There are also two couches. You do not have to play with others downstairs or anywhere for that matter but you do have to be wearing nothing more than a towel. You get the towels from the bartender. There are lockers for your clothes but no locks. Another restroom down there as well.There is another play room on the second floor. We have not ventured up there yet other than on our tour. There are actually multiple rooms up there. Same rules with the towels. There is a small private room and I think a couple of bigger rooms as well. There is also a big Roman shower that could probably fit a few couples. And finally there is a voyeur room. There is a big window for others to watch through. On top of that the room is filmed by a closed circuit TVcamera. At  or  the video streams to a TV on the main floor near the dance floor. Before that the TV just plays porn. Obviously if you dont want to be on camera just avoid that one room.According to the couple that gave us the tour you are actually free to be nudehave sex anywhere including the main floor. We did see some women walking around toplessnude and some people playing on the main floor but for the most part the action is updownstairs. Everyone seems to head updown around   .Its definitely a good place for newbies. That was our first and so far only club. You can easily just watch if thats all youre comfortable doing. Again we dont have anything to compare it to but we enjoyed it and will definitely be going back. Especially since you have to pay for an annual membership! Annual membership is  per couple. Nightly door fee is . per couple so the first time you pay . Then  per visit after that.The outside does look a bit...sketchy. There are two bouncers who stand on the corner of the street a few yards away from the house. They greet you as you walk up but they dont say anything more than hey hows it going? You have to ring the doorbell to be let in but no one said anything to us. We tugged at the door until one of the members who was outside smoking told us to ring the bell.

I think its really common to not drink or at least take it really easy if you do.  I know I wouldnt want to be really drunk while having a sexual encounter like this and Id prefer not to play with people who are blitzed.  Seems too messy too much opportunity for people to do more than theyre comfortable with in the heat of the moment.  Besides that I know myself and when Im really drunk I can hardly feel anything.

This is an ongoing problem for clubs. Everyone wants to watch and its driving the people that go there to actually play away.  The Green Door is nothing but pervs wandering around like zombies waiting for the action to start.  The last thing we need is the Red Rooster filling up with nonswingers looking for entertainment.

I get horrible headaches if i do it wrong and have found that this works the best. If you are going to play Saturday night and Sunday morning this is what I would do. Dont take anything until Saturday Take a mg clialis at lunchtime with food.  I tend to drink a lot of beer or wine when we play so food and water before and during are critical components to my success. About  min before play I have mg viagras I bite off  of the pill. Normally that is plenty to get things going for at least an hour or more if my performance feels off in the slightest I bite off another . And continue this as the night goes on. Rarely do I take more than mg of Viagra or my headache is murder.  Before bed water food and aspirin. Wake up and you still should have plenty left in your system to keep fucking. If not I would bite another piece off of the viagra and youll be a fucking rockstar.,Swingers,d456dkm,2,t5_2qyei

Weve read and have been told you think you are a strong couple but just wait We get it now. You had better be ready to cut through all the BS and say whats really on your mind. Your partner had better be PATIENT when you are still processing it and looking for the wordsthats the part no one ever says and is monumentally important. We had a breakthrough in our communication because of our experience.  It could have gotten ugly real quick but we remained calm and patient. We realized how important it is to say what we really feel good and not so good. We learned that we have to get it out and just as importantly listen to what the other has to say and try to understand it from their perspective before getting critical. This is crucial If you are in a hetero relationship your partner thinks about and sees things differently than you you are wired differently.  Accept it and understand it. You dont have to change how you think to match your partner but you damn sure need to understand they are coming from a different place and perspective.

9518174,0,t3_5b1l7m,My wife doesnt like anal and shes not fond of double vag either. However Ill do what ever the other woman likes. Its the womens show after all. Im just happy to be there. I dont have any qualms about crossing swords or even being in the frothy mix of a double vag situation. It all washes off. For the down and dirty of it Ive been told the woman is more comfortable if shes on top and can control the man under her as far as vaginal pace goes. The two should stop while the other guy enters her anus from behind. Bottom guys legs close together womans legs outside of those kneeling. Anal guys legs are usually really wide or tucked in behind the womans her ankles flayed out the furthest or up in the air. Either way youre going to touch guy leg. And dare we say unless its cold in the room balls and shafts may rub. If you dont like it just dont do it. LOLAnother approach it for the woman to be on her back. The guy under her is in anally and the kneeling guy and go vaginally. This way the vagina gets more of the in and out while the anal penis moves ever so slightly. Try them both and see which one she likes best. Take your time with this and as always listen to the woman for your cues.,Swingers,d9mbg36,0,t5_2qyei

9749943,0,t3_5e59v1,A lot of people here seem to be discussing about how you need to pump the breaks. One thing to be cautious of and forgive me if someone already mentioned this is that toy pumping the breaks now would only confirm her suspicions that you are trying to guilt her into a hall pass. I would honestly talk to her about taking responsibility for her own feelings. Ask her to think hard about what exactly bothers her about you being with a woman and why it is different than her being with the guy. Be extremely careful not to come across as combative but talk to her about how open relationships require a lot of honesty and emotional intelligence.I have run into days where something is bothering me but I could not for the life of me tell you why. As a simple example Im all kinds of cranky and irritated and combative with everyone and it turned out the onlyreal problem was that I was hungry.  I had to figure that out and that means she needs to consider the idea that she isnt being fair. Give her time to think about it critically. It is a lot harder to see insecurity I yourself than in others. Talk to her and see if she will look. If that makes sense,Swingers,daew7nt,1,t5_2qyei
9767125,0,t3_5exs6d,As a couple looking for a male who previously was only looking for females I can tell you that as a male myself the men that reply to our ads are either abusive very aggressive lying and cheating on their spouse PICTURE COLLECTORS sometimes they ask if my wife wants to make money having a group of other men watch her have sex with him and if they arent doing any of those things or a combination of them then most of them we are just not attracted to. It has turned us off of the idea except in rare cases where we meet someone organically. The truth is women are more docile and less of a bull on a China shop when it comes to this lifestyle. Some men are threatened by other alpha types and other men in general maybe they want to but might be a little insecure in their part of their relationship. Thus the hostility. I am not insecure in my part of the relationship with my wife but I was at one time. And my reaction to single males was a little standoffish. Obviously my opinion has changed. But in truth what Ive seen of males looking for this has not been a pleasant experience and we are in no way PG or closed to almost anything at all. That problem never existed with women. That doesnt change the fact that you are surrounded by other men who destroy the interest couples like us have  in doing it. Best suggestion pay attention to the couples who seem normal and have had experience and are secure. Ask to speak to the male not just the female. Dont jump right into wild things bringing toys being bi voyeurism etc..  Unless they bring it up first and expect that whatever they are looking for is all thats going to happen. Dont be pushy be real. When talking sex initially ask dont assume. Dont be flaky!!! Thats huge. We finally find a guy and hes into it and my wife calls him over for a one on one with her and he replies with Im watching the game or hanging with friends maybe some other time. Its hard enough as a couple with a child to find the time to do anything like this and then when we do to hear watching the game is bullshit. In any case we never had these issues with women. Ever. Occasionally there was a male posing as a women to get pictures on ads we posted. But typically we never had any trouble meeting women organically or through ads I assume because we are both relatively young and been told attractive and sane. ,Swingers,dah0jre,6,t5_2qyei

9810487,0,t3_5fk5mq,My wife and I went two months ago or so. The venue was at first awkward to say the least. They invite you to bring your own alcohol and they have some snacks there available. Youll find couples that are there for a taste and not the whole dinner if you know what I mean. Everyone will act nervous and just stay as couples for a while while the music rages. At this point once you get past the realization youre actually doing this there are already experienced couples in the play room. They let us watch a bit until midnight then it was either youre naked or no entry.At some point I finally talked my wife into going to see another couple we thought were average in looks and everything. That was mostly to break the ice for ourselves. As the night progresses everyone just kind of migrates to the play rooms which is basically one room with drapes in some places.There will be couples watching you have sex and condoms everywhere by the endofthe night. You really have to be proactive to have a goodnight with another couple. But of course thats if being with another couple is what what you want.All that aside I had the feeling Russian mafia were kind of using the joint as a front. There was a club next to twist which was only separated by a paper wall and all the employees were Russian. There were even Russian girls that randomly showed up in the playroom.

Ill credit SDC which is the one we use in GA on at least making some incremental improvements and for being more humancentered towards local communities of swingers. But SLS is a shitshow. Kasidie is interesting because it uses social network mechanisms which I didnt like at first but as were now traveling more it engages on a more national level and works better for the traveling swinger. I think Kasidie is going to eventually win because of this and how its the best for podcasters to engage national audiences. Kasidie fails with their Email because their using some generic rd party editor. SDC has written their from scratch. Quivver is actually the best designed and most modern   usable app. They just have to battle incumbent sites in each region. SLS should buy them and use their platform.,Swingers,de3zy7u,2,t5_2qyei
10914670,0,t1_de5py06,I disagree with your logic here. I believe folks strictly in the lifestyle have a lower risk of STDs than folks predominantly in the singles scene. The LS population is most concentrated with people in their s s and s. They are mature and very aware of health risks. Condom use is the norm. For singles the population is skewed more towards the s. Maturity isnt quite where it will be in another  years or so. Theyre much more likely to engage in sex without protection since its their risk alone. They arent risking health of themselves and a SO. They arent as likely to be on top of testing. Im not saying you shouldnt seek out single men or women.

11174923,0,t3_5z8z2n,  I dont wanna scary you but in situations like the one you are going throughit means your relationship with your wife is skidding off the tracks. First of all in this life style we start as a team and anytime one of the player of the same team pulls offsomething is not right. With all due respect I can assure you that most of the time it comes from the person who was introduced in the lifestyle which I believe you talked to her to get in the lifestyle if I am correct. Regardless we all being an adults and giving consent to have sexspouse swapwith other spouses theres still uncertainties from the person that was introduced in this lifestyle. This person may like it afterward but heshe may pull off at anytime saying that I dont want to play anymore but it is ok for you to keep playing. This is a red flag my friend. She doesnt want to tell you to stop afraid it will hurt your feelings. Try to work on the relationship find why she doesnt wanna play anymore. It takes a lot of courage for  a person facing the nervousness find with strange people for having sex. Its nerve wrecking. Not everybody feel comfortable doing that because some spouses drag their significant other in the lifestyle to fulfill their fantasies. What if she wasnt ready for this lifestyle yet? Probably you told her about it and she said no and after a month you came with the same conversation and she said no but you insisted about it three months later? She may just say yes in an annoyed way even not ready yet. I would recommend anyone trying to bring or introduce their spouses in any lifestyleswinger cuckhold  wife sharing hotwife BDSM polyamorythisif you tell your spouse about entering the lifestyle and heshe say no bring the topic after  months and if the answer still the samethen stop. We are human being with brains that process things in a short and long term memory that could culminate your own spouse coming back to you hey honey do you remember that time you asked me to go out swinging? It can be after  years or even  years later. Why? Because heshe may have heard from a friend coworker who is in the lifestyle how fun and the benefit of it. Also heshe thinks is ready and gained maturity to give it a  try to see where it leads. Trust me there are people in the lifestyle who doesnt wanna be there at first place. There are a lot of issues in the lifestyle. I know many reasons that I could explain right now but I have things to do. But hey I would recommend you to listen this lifestyle podcasts Two or more to tango episode                Swinger diariesep               Getting into the swing of thingsep Remember She has the pussy                 So she makes the rules.notefeel free to ask me anything in a private message.bye,Swingers,deynyad,3,t5_2qyei

11457768,0,t3_63feyf,i think if youre into swinging and youre still very new keep everything between you and your partner not a playmate or potential playmate. it helps you to test the water. trying this with someone new is like diving head first. someone suggest going with your husband and the playmate but for me no. better just go into threesome with the playmate than the swingers club.,Swingers,dfuqahh,1,t5_2qyei
11482814,0,t3_63trw1,Let me just add that Im somewhat against online stuff as a unicorn and I know many other unicorns who feel the same because theres sooooo many guys who pretend to be a couple on SLS or they are a couple but pretend to be the girl messaging me asking if Id ever just play with the male half. Ive never met a couple at a club whos girlfriendwife was so adamantly against participating that she refused to even be in the same locationroom while it went down. Its so overwhelmingly obvious when a male is just using his couple status to try to gain and it really gives new unicorns wanting to try this a really bad taste in their mouth. ,Swingers,dfxkpei,1,t5_2qyei

11698535,0,t3_66vtcz,It never hurts to over communicate in these situation. Also taking some time together to write down or talk about  things what you know turns you on what you are curious about and what you definitely dont like. A lot of times your fantasies when made real are not very fun at all so just get it all out there and talk talk talk! No fear!!!,Swingers,dgm1pwo,2,t5_2qyei
