1543695,0,t3_2bwl5m,I was really excited for this song from the teaser.  This was very very disappointing.  I guess I had super high expectations for it.  I mean its good dont get me wrong.  But I almost with the music of the verses and choruses were flipped.  I hate how it just drops off for the chorus.  Nice guitar work in there though.,TheGaslightAnthem,cj9ry49,3,t5_2swy6

6806402,0,t3_48t6ur,I agree it sounds countryish but it also kind of just sounds like straight up radio rock to me. When he said Butch told him he was going to strip everything back like the effects he used on his vocals...this isnt what I expected to hear. I was going to list out everything it sounds like is going on but Im just having a hard time digging it its not nearly as stripped back as I was hoping for. Its kind of a shame because I dont remember it sounding even close to this live and almost everything I can hear in the song was there. I dunno maybe Im in the minority on this one ,TheGaslightAnthem,d0nsu9g,1,t5_2swy6

8813985,0,t1_d77b4a1,That is one of the best versions IMO. And when I learned that it was about Brians grandmother on her deathbed it completely changed my outlook on it too. I still find it hard not to get choked up when i hear him sing the ending. ,TheGaslightAnthem,d77bkhv,4,t5_2swy6
