7086065,0,t3_4abt2q,Not sure if they could implement this directly as it would be a pretty much  copy of Dynasty Warriors but I wish they had LightgtHeavy combos being unique. Like LgtH Would have say Ruby doing her current horizantle swipe.While LgtLgtH Would have her fire a round damaging her target and sending her backwards away from them Would be a useful dodge as well.But like I said that is pretty much how DW works so not sure if they could pull it off. It would be nice as it would allow them to be able to put in more accurate show moves and let the players mix things up.As for counter I feel like you should have to tap the button a few times to get the stun effect. That way you have to focus on targets that need to be stunned Alphas instead of just tapping for a free stun.,GrimmEclipse,d1jkmfd,1,t5_3ac7c
