4063116,0,t1_criptlb,Mine is mostly silent which is really weird for a Meez. The most I ever get out of him is a quiet lowtone mow and thats when its treat time or Ive been gone for a couple hours and he thought I was never coming back. The longhaired lilac point though wow. Cat was noisyyyyy...pic is a few posts below yoursEdit Pic of Blue when I first met him  he was my dads cat I inherited Blue when Dad passed away. Art Deco indeed. My first reaction was what the fuck kind of alien cat is THAT?!,Siamesecats,crjfaag,1,t5_2uqsa

Looking at her in person she has like a caramely color mixed in with the black on all points and its mottled. We had an outside barn tortoiseshell cat that very much lived up to the naughty tortie reputation. Aside from seeing the markings that I thought fit her...ahem naughty personality made sense too. ,Siamesecats,czrj0w4,1,t5_2uqsa
