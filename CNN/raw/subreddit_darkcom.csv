6769023,0,t3_46fhf1,Totally appreciate what youve put together here I wish I had seen it before I started my experimentation last night!Ive been able to successfully hack a few nodes with the hex pads heres what I have to add The data packets seem to be key.  I hacked a sentinel node that had  neighbors but only  of them including one I had already hacked were transmitting data to the node I was hacking. I could be wrong but I think some nodes DO have an alphabetical id although it is rare.  One hack that I did was a and it lit up e.  I dont remember if that was a  node or not but now that Ive read this post Ill have to incorporate that into my tests.The problems Im facing are distinguishing which hexdigits are the nodes ids and which are something else.   Figuring out the order that the digits have to be entered.  Im not sure if this is even important but the first time that it worked I purposefully entered them in counterclockwise order starting from the top.  This is tricky because I have no idea if Ive failed a hack because I misread the ids or if I just got them out of order.  Ill try again later now that I know that sentinels have a  and the number of firewalls. Im seeing a whole lot of s and s Im wondering if that is representing the number of firewallsHeres a few tips for anybody who is looking to crack this code In the cloud use the  and  buttons to go to the easiest networks available and find one with a nice low difficulty and like  on the trace clock.  That will give you a good  minutes to just mess around and test things out without having to worry about paying attention to the actual hack until the last  minutes. Start simple and work your way up.  Hack yellow nodes with no shields and then work your way up to more difficult nodes.  Eliminate the confusing assumptions like whether or not data packets matter etc.,darkcom,d0jjsbv,2,t5_2zrq8
7190954,0,t3_4dytz1,Ive seen something similar  though I havent unlocked the backbone or anything like that.  Im at around  skill level but when I completed a hack which should increase my skill level if I win and not decrease it if I dont my skill level doesnt change at all. Ive noticed this happening a few times now though I dont think it happens consistently.,darkcom,d1vju5b,1,t5_2zrq8
