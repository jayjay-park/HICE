10553200,0,t1_dd3wsf8,My daughter has severe allergies and my son was a micro preemie who now has some residual health issues. Im very passionate about giving moms grace. Moms are doing the best they can even when they fail. Barring the rare psycho mother every mom is trying even jenelle. My grandmother constantly told me you do your best until you learn better then you do your best there. This judging need for perfection drives me nuts...and makes me terrified to have friends. Im in a new town ok one I grew up in but its been  years and Im so anxious about talking to anyone. My life isnt normal my parenting is usually founded in lack of sleep and desperation and my meals health plan etc tends to be whatever I can throw together. Lol sorry for dumping here but its nice to vent and be semi anonymous ,metateenmom,dd4bo9s,8,t5_3hmyg

I thought Id just make shit up to confuse you. ltsighgtWhy the fuck would you send me PMs to drag me into this if you didnt even trust my knowledge about these things??? First you bother me via private message to help you and then you dont even believe what I tell you. FTSOFgt they are trying to identify usersA pig can try to fly.

10782226,0,t1_ddqazja,Justified criticism of the girls doesnt upset me but it can bother me a bit when people take it to a point where it gets really cruel inaccurate or unreasonable. But its not because I care loads about the teen moms in particular. I find the show interesting but am more or less indifferent to the people on it. When watching the show my primary emotional reaction is usually one of frustration and annoyance with just about everyone on screen. I just dont like seeing anyone being put down or treated unfairly. If this subreddit existed to discuss Joe Shmoe the Safeway manager I would put just as much effort into seeing his side of the story and trying to debunk the really mean and onesided bullshit people posted about him. Assuming something happened to attract me to the subreddit in the first place of course. ,metateenmom,dds3wiz,3,t5_3hmyg

10959363,0,t1_deac8pg,I agree. I  used to be a mommy blogger and it was a nightmare keeping comments civil. I quit after my most recent child was born I  just emotionally couldnt keep up. I  barely do sm these days because of it. I  struggle to understand the users who seem to get joy out of humiliating the teen moms? Does it seem like bullying on a new level? I  wonder about some of these people who say things like Jenelle  is a better mom dead than alive... what if she committed suicide? Words have power and she is post partum we have no idea what shes going through. I  may not agree with all her parenting but Im not going to straight up label her a bad mom over word choice. Ive made mistakes typing too. I  wonder if anyone considered that Jenelle didnt want to go to the filming of Barbara went because the only person she wants to leave  Ensley with is barb? I mean if you look for negative youll find it clearly....,metateenmom,deadpll,12,t5_3hmyg

11333013,0,t1_dfdxb5s,gtThats sick. It really is. Just absolutely fucking appalling. Jenelle didnt even consent to those pictures being released did she?  Actually she might have sold the photo herself. She was completely broke when it came out. Back when it happened the twitter haters uncovered evidence that she was behind its release. However I dont think she was behind it. She was behind the one she took with Kieffer though. ,metateenmom,dfgksun,1,t5_3hmyg

11657922,0,t1_dghds0r,Yeah exactly. Plus the stigma that mothers face makes it so much harder for them to try and seek help if they want to understand why they dont have maternal instincts. Not every mother immediately bonds with their child but society shames women who experience that. There is a lot of sanctimommying on the main sub and its really disgusting sometimes. ,metateenmom,dghfukl,9,t5_3hmyg

11707870,0,t3_671v9q,When I worked at a preschool and would mention to people that I sometimes changed diapers they would be all shocked and shit that a . year old wasnt potty trained. But every kid learns and developed differently. And its very common for kids to sleep in diapers when theyre still learning because accidents happen. FWIW every kid at my preschool over three and still in diapers was a boy. And the preschool was for the children of an exclusive private universitys faculty so no Jenelles in the bunch.
