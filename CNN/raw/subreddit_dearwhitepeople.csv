11805495,0,t1_dgy5vyx,Dude look those are not examples of cultural appropriation. Do you not understand that? Black people wearing jeans for example isnt cultural appropriation because jeans arent integral or just specific towhite cultural. And honestly I dont want to get into this with you because cultural appropriation doesnt work the opposite way. White people hold the position of power  who do you think influences the majority of western culture? Obviously minorities are going to pick it up why? Because like you said America is a melting pot  in order to be American you have to accept American culture and values. Thats not cultural appropriation. Thats social assimilation.Cultural appropriation is taking something from a culture and without understanding its social and cultural value bastardizing it commercializing it using it exploiting it etc. A white man taking my culture and turning it into a costume is offensive because it reduces it to a stereotype and a prop  when it is so much more than that. ,dearwhitepeople,dgy6zcx,4,t5_2wu9f
11807718,0,t1_dgya52d,I finished the series and it gives more insight into Co so dont want to spoil unless youve seen. But she has a scene where she is the voice of lets just survive these racist fucks will destroy us if we give them an opening. So it kind of explains shes very much in survival mode and her plan appears to be play the societal long game. And she can get more done rising from the inside. Very powerful character and resentment is of course a part of her motivation. Resentment is a big part in any power dynamic when someone is on the receiving end.I just meant I dont think resentment makes Co a weak character or that shes behaving from a weak mindset.,dearwhitepeople,dgyg232,8,t5_2wu9f
