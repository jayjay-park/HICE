30057,0,t1_cehu20e,I think there are a lot of different ideas  every person has a different idea and sometimes those ideas overlap and sometimes they dont. With the shapeshifting it started off as an idea for a kitsune character where I was taking inspiration from East Asian folklore which has a sexual motif rather than a lunar motif. Animal spirits are part of neopagan ideas and since I got involved with that interest thats where my username comes from theres a number of different directions you can take it from the standard werewolf idea. Superficially Im writing about innate shapechanging but Ive put my own rules on it. Regarding both of those series  they sound good. I take direct inspiration from nonfantasy sources because I like writing genre fiction without trying to directly let other genre writers influence me but certainly everything I read has an impact one way or another even if its just to reassure me that someone else got that idea published. Thinking about another tumblr post I wrote a while ago about literature its very dangerous to make too many generalisations in this context. When someone complained about the lack of female protagonists in childrens literature I was able to reel about ten examples off the top of my head including some very recent books The Hunger Games and some very old stories Alice in Wonderland.,fantasywriters,cehur8l,3,t5_2t4ad

66917,0,t3_1uubuh,Right I can see where youre needing help with the actual format.Every time another character speaks or takes an action you need to start a new line even if you have only got prose exposition. before it. SoNB Ive altered one of the punctuation marks. A comma is fine if you break the quote in the middle of the sentence to add a tag like said but if you insert the tag between two sentences you need a full stop after said.gt...I quickly adjusted to this and put my foot to the grass covered hill and righted myself. I had successfully made it to the road but I had collected a few bruises and cuts on my way down. gtHe looked at me with a calm curious face. That was quite the tumble you took there son he said. Now whatre you doing running down that hill like your being chased by a pack of wild dogs hm?gt I opened my mouth to tell him but nothing came out. I didnt know how to answer that question. I didnt remember my name or where I was or how I got there. gtThe farmer shrugged and started to walk away.Regarding dialogue tags where you have a line of dialogue and a tag such as asked replied or said those always have small letters regardless of whether your character asked a question question mark made an exclamation exclamation mark or just made a statement full stopcomma. When you close quote marks and theres no exclamation or question mark you use a commaThis is how I would format the relevant passagegtNow what do you mean by remember? he asked as he raised his brow. I inserted another layer of quote marks around remember because Chip is quoting Agur in this instance.gtI have no idea where I am or how I got here I replied.gtYou must have hit your head on that fall boy.gtNo my head is fine. I just barely remember anything before I woke up on that hill. I pointed up to the area where I had found peace and quiet just a few minutes ago. no change because there is no tag.gtWell what do you remember? he said curiously. exclamations are always separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma as are names if the person is being addressed directly.I agree with Kai. If the only dialogue you have essentially repeats what youve been telling us in the exposition passage which probably needs to be broken up into a few shorter paragraphs so its more easily digestible by the reader then you need to think about taking it in a different direction. Obfuscating what Agur tells Chip could be one way. Another way is maybe to continue the amnesia. Would you tell a complete stranger what had just happened particularly after a moment of confusion? Give the conversation a bit more ...flavour. I took a chapter of sample dialogue out of the prologue of my second novel which is on Google docs here which I use as a sample of conversation. Giving some character to the interlocutors  by way of differences in tone reaction and action  is important to the way readers perceive the characters that are interacting together and adverbs like curiously are no substitute for it. The doctor is embarrassed to lift a blanket exposing his male patients backside particularly to a female doctor and also to admit what is actually wrong with Shackleton that needs the intervention of an asylum and I try to convey this through his actions rather than just say he is embarrassed. Likewise Chip is curious  and Agur disorientated. Thered be some mumbling or confused tone of voice some scratching of the head some dead ends...BTW bale is the word youre looking for if youre talking about a hay bale.But good luck. Youve got quite an interesting beginning here and it will be interesting to see how it develops.,fantasywriters,cem1r36,3,t5_2t4ad

126064,0,t3_1vhibg,One of the POV characters in my novel is a golem and while I dont have his functioning entirely pinned down heres the gist of it.The magical system in my novel is shapebased. Each basic element has a shape chemical elements have simple shapes compounds have larger shapes and living things things have massively intricate and twining shapes which in our world we would think of as DNA. In the world of the novel these shapes can be expressed twodimensionally imagine something like a Mandelbrot setSo if you know the shape of a thing you can work magics on it. Iron for example requires carving the shape of iron into and an iron ball and filling the carving in with a magical catalyst.Golems work much the same way. You need access to the shape of a man acquired from blood and a medium similar to the human body in which to carve the shape. Corpses of course would work but the meat quickly rots causing the carved shaped to degrade and the golem to cease functioning. Some success has been had with fleshbased golems in arctic environments.The preferred medium then for crafting golems is a mixture of organicallyrich clay which is analogous to the overall composition of the human body. Such a golem is colloquially referred to as a Siltskin. Siltskins are entirely powered by the shape carved into their bodies. They do not require food or drink or even to breath though they are possessed of an empty cavity within their chests that allows them to draw in breath to speak. The only maintenance they require is preventative care to keep their clay skin from drying out and crumbling rubbing themselves down with mud or blotting themselves with water. Modest crumbling is expected and not always problematic less important features such as fingers noses and ears can crumble off and the golem will continue to function. But if the puckered skin around their carved shapes crumbles then golems animation will cease. Properly maintained a Siltskin can function for several years until the the spell powering them runs out. When they cease functioning it is a simple matter to recast them although any consciousness they have developed will be reset.,fantasywriters,cessc8n,3,t5_2t4ad

429921,0,t1_cfp8ykf,You bring up a lot of good points. I agree with what you have to say about it being the nature of the conflicts that is the mark of YA fiction. The novel Im working on does include issues such as selfdiscovery coming of age to an extent the MCs are  and  so plenty of growing up already happened in back story and first love. But I wouldnt consider it to be YA because it also deals with some darker and more complex themes such as politics power struggles moral dilemmas a general questioning of the nature of morality clashing belief systems and of course a good helping of violence and some complicated sexual relationships. I think its a fair mix of both which will hopefully paint of good picture of a couple characters you are young adults but are forced to grow up and adapt in the face of situations that are ultimately beyond their control. The MCs one of them in particular do change and mature over the course of the book so theres kind of a progression from YAtype conflicts to more dark and mature themes though the overall style remains the same.I do plan for this to be part of a larger broader series Ive been developing though. The sequel will likely feature the MCs aged up about  years and married with a kid but after that theres bigger time skip and a new set of characters are introduced. Kind of like a series within the larger series the first book of which is definitely more of a coming of age story. Not nearly as much actionadventure of the first books but while the MCs are shown maturing from  to about  there is plenty of conflict going on the the background that they grow to understand they are entangled in. The next few books become more actionoriented fantasy again with the nowage MCs finding themselves in the thick of the action in the middle of a war.,fantasywriters,cfpbrci,2,t5_2t4ad

458347,0,t3_1zb91x,It depends I guess on what comes before. Ancient Egypt persisted for thousands of years without putting a man on the moon but it had technological improvement throughout its history. Horses and carriages tells me very little about your current state of technology because its less than  years since everything was completely motorised  the Germans used horses throughout WW for instance. The period we call the Middle Ages in which most vanilla fantasy is set is a diverse period  the world was not the same in  CE as it was in  CE. History isnt a discrete set of eureka moments  technological and social advances always occur over the entire period usually in response to external stimuli such as the Black Death or various wars and work on the assumption that society is always changing not staying exactly the same for millennia after millennia. Developments are contingent on thought processes previous discoveries and other factors such as people realising what inventions can be used for. For example its believed that Rome understood the concept of steam power but metallurgy was not good enough to create steam locomotives or other largescale applications of the science. If the Goddess was interested in human advancement then shed drop a few hints in the ear of a Roman James Watt that his boiling kettle could be used as more than a kettle and also mention how to smelt metals so they could withstand the temperatures involved. And voila you could have a Roman railway network. Eberron in the DampD campaign world stable did it.Once you get one innovation as long as your people have the ability to think for themselves then they will invent further things. Warfare is a great catalyst for technological change. The mediaeval period itself was a time of rapid change over the course of  years we think of the church in particular as antiscience but it was the university system which was under a church monopoly that gave us Copernicus and Galileo. By that time the hierarchy paid lip service to Aristotle and the creation mythology but continued to work around it a bit like how Soviet scientists were compelled to quote Lenin and Marx or their current leadership in papers but did actually get productive nonideological work done. I always suggest Gods Philosophers by James Hannam as a good read about how science developed during the mediaeval period within the universities particularly because it busts some myths about the totalitarian nature of the mediaeval church. Personally I wouldnt hesitate to mixandmatch anything I love World of Warcraft for that very reason. Its your story and youre allowed to break with convention and develop what you want to write. I dispensed entirely with a mediaeval setting and chose to try and add magic and the supernatural to th century Europe. The story begins roughly in  and ends in roughly the s technologically speaking but I condense the development of  years into about . In my case the technology exists but it is controlled by the military which developed it and theres no real counterbalance elsewhere to come up with civilian projects. The military also develops technology based on what is easiest to hide so voice telephony needing massive wiring on the scale of the telegraph network is out but wireless radio broadcasting is a plausible idea for them.Dont hold yourself back. ,fantasywriters,cfsd39l,2,t5_2t4ad

630085,0,t1_cg9rk5h,The funny thing about ASOIAF is that it has a lot of the classical fantasy elements. Dragons are a huge part of the plot and elves were introduced in the most recent book. The overall story arc is how a race of evil monsters from the north wants to destroy humanity with their army of zombies. Jon Snow is pretty much every cliche fantasy hero ever with his cool sword and his cool wolf companion and his mysterious parentage. Progressively more and more magic has been added to the story with each installment.Martins stuff works and feels like a breath of fresh air because he adds a great deal of humanism and depth to his story. Fantasy conventions dont have to be bad as long as theres more to it than DrizztUnoiel must save the kingdom from the Evil Wizard by adventuring into the Marshes of Madness and getting the Magical Talisman of Lorathien. Of course Im sure plenty of lesser writers will think grittiness and grimdarkness are the secret to a good story and go completely wild until those tropes are driven to the ground.,fantasywriters,cgbw3m5,2,t5_2t4ad

704620,0,t3_227c57,Figure out what needs to be said then figure out how your characters would say that.Lets say you have a scene where a knight is told by his son that their home town has been destroyed by a dragon. How do the two of them talk to each other? How does the knight react to his son being there rather than at home? How does the son tell him what happened? How does the knight react?Or lets say you have a smiths daughter and a boy whos a wizards apprentice and you need to get their romantic relationship started. What seeds can you plant into this conversation thatll grow into that relationship? Does either party admit to liking the other? How? What else to the same effect could you have them say?Character voice and conversation stuff isnt half as important as the stuff the dialogue is supposed to convey. Dialogue is often fluff. Its fluff that can be used to develop character serve as exposition or even just fill the page until the chapter is done. Put some meaning into every conversation worth including in your work. It doesnt have to big plot points it can be useful even if its largely irrelevant to the plot. But if its there it should be there for a good reason.,fantasywriters,cgkd9li,2,t5_2t4ad

739418,0,t1_cgoa8vh,Yeah but its a mixture that might be raising eyebrows in certain places. People will simply wonder why didnt the valkyrie feel more at home in Norway? Dont get me wrong I use Norse mythology in my world as well alongside Roman and Slavic myths but its the combination that jars. Also everyone and his dog uses Norse its probably the most overused pantheon in AngloAmerican literature given Tolkiens influence. Why not delve into Canadas own no doubt wealth of First Nation folklore and derive something from that? It may just be as simple as changing the names but I suspect there may be brownie points with liberallyminded publishers for using native cultures these days.Write what you know isnt a hard and fast rule. It means write from experience or write from research or write from analogy. If I had to literally write what I knew I wouldnt be writing fantasy at all since I dont know what its like to live in a world where the supernatural is demonstrably real. WWYK tends to refer to writing what you understand e.g. I was a law student so I could understand my lawyer characters background and some of what he might have studied at university although obviously I am not a late Victorian man who is heir to a vast estate nor have I ever been an inmate in a workhouse although I do inject a bit of my mental health experiences into my first few books and like I said you could always research native Canadian mythology to fit in with the country and territory you understand.I think you need to get a little bit more perspective on the ideas in your book  instead of focusing on the query focus on the way it comes across to other readers first. I would think about running it past an editor to see whether they can suggest what youre getting wrong and why you havent been picked up yet. It could be as simple as there are other better people than you out there having just been turned down for PhD funding I know the feeling but in order to improve and get your book picked up you need to reconcile yourself to changing something about your book or approach and learning about what publishers are looking for.BTW I presume you know dottir means daughter. Its usually used as part of a surname not the whole one e.g. Sigmundsdottir or Gudmundsdottir and then largely in Icelandic which has no surnames only patronymics names changing dependent on the fathers name  see also the Russian middle name system Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov. Surnames usually coming down through the male line which makes the idea of a person with the surname Dottir even if Anglicised at some point a bit ...unusual. I would assume a Valkyrie trying to blend in would choose a more common Scandinavian surname. That kind of detail might also suggest you need to more thoroughly research your chosen subject. You dont need to learn all the Scandinavian languages and speak like a native to write what you know but I found it much easier to write convincingly in my Polish setting by learning Polish because I avoided making mistakes in orthography. And trust me I made much worse ones than just dottir. One of my towns ended up being called Pissville thats how bad it got.As I said the next step for me would be hiring an editor then selfpublishing.,fantasywriters,cgobr1z,3,t5_2t4ad

767599,0,t1_cgrgxlh,Another plotline Id been thinking of  during a school play production of C. S. Lewis The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe I saw recently  was that the sulky antihero Edmund turned out to be the one who betrayed his comrades and the upright righteous boy Peter was the one who was the valiant and steadfast prince. I was tempted to write a story where the weaselly one turned out to be the decent guy and the righteous one was the traitor but...thats just me. I love C. S. Lewis book he didnt write it explicitly as Christian metaphor although he realised that was what hed created before he wrote the other Chronicles of Narnia and tbh it shows but somehow I always find a way to subvert or examine the tropes within it.I dont like writing inquisitorial paladins who go wrong like Arthas because they tend to be the only way fantasy books portray quasimonotheistic religion but I like your idea nevertheless.

773328,0,t1_cgs1k80,Writing is after all a subjective artform which means that there are going to be conflicted opinions when discussing it. For better or for worse I suppose.In the end we could sit here and argue semantics and the finer aspects of linguistics until we all die of starvation and still not arrive at a cohesive answer to whether these words should be used or not but the matter at hand boils down to creative writing being subjectively assessed.Im going to use these words if I see fit and perhaps they will make my literary works less tighter and interesting and you may cut them out entirely because you feel they diminish your writing. That is in fact why I love writing so much and why I love these fora almost equivalently. When everyone can have their own opinion there can be no right or wrong. All that matters is what you think.Does that mean Ill be judged as a bad writer by you and those who may think the same as you? Sure. Not everyone can enjoy the same things and I graciously accept that. But at least I made a conscious choice a choice to write however I see fit instead of following a chosen set of rules I dont happen to agree with.No two writers can be the same and aint the world a better place for it?,fantasywriters,cgs6k3s,2,t5_2t4ad

Im glad the author has found a system that suits them but I felt I had to disagree with almost all of his points for not using Word.

Well.They did not even address Word biggest problem with creating documents and that how it handles images within the text.Personal preference is just that personal.

791896,0,t3_237d6z,umadicienne has given you pretty much the ideas I was going to so Ill just give you a bit of embellishment.Last time you told us about your dragons they sounded pretty formidable. Now they have cannons.Warrens and underground bunkers would do reasonably well and I would think along those same lines. However if the dragons could load those cannons with explosives or some kind of toxic gas those warrens would be tombs. It would be like the beginning of Watership Down.If humans were to dig super deep the dragons might lose the scent or lose interest. They could dig until they find an underground water system or lake with all sorts of bioluminescent fish and arthropods and fungus growing down there.However if there are intelligent dragons with cannons ruling the skies there may be some crueller intelligence that rules the deep. Krakens with harpoons maybe?With regards your second questionMy setting has no magical creatures like dragons but the most powerful military weapon is a bioweapon. Its a lot like smallpox and ebola and can withstand super extreme conditions. Theres really no defence against it except the fact that it has never been deployed.

BUT as a reader I usually find that the less information Im given the more I enjoy it because Ive had to work a bit to figure it out. Sometimes you dont need to include those nuances of the magic system just show the effect and have somebody hint at it or even not discuss it at all. That way the reader has to figure it out for themselves.

845834,0,t3_23ti23,ReptiloidsReptiloids refers to any race that is reptilion in appearance and nature. They have extra light sensory which allows them to see colors that the other races cannot see as well as minor vision improvement in darkness andor having minor heat vision andor a tremor sense.Gatori years A race of Alligatorlike beast men who come from the jungles and swamps of the southern region of the Great Republic. They tend to live in sparse tribal villages that govern themselves except in times of crises a council of tribal elders will assemble. They are naturally about as strong as dwarves and have more dexterity but have less con due to a weak bone structure hollow bones. They are natural hunters and skirmish warriors. They have resistance to disease and poison and can hold their breath underwater for up to four hours. Vision is improved in the dark and underwater.The Gatori are thought to have evolved on the southern end of the great eastern continent. They came eastward toward Basiliscara by island hopping over a period of thousands of years and actually came to the continent pretty recently sometime in the last  years the first elven empire was flourishing at this time SkithThe Skith are a race of kobold like reptiloids from the northern desert region of the southern continent. Typically nomadic or living in vertical stone cave villages carved into the desert cliffs. Being of the desert they are naturally resistant to heat and can go days without food or water. They excel in speed but many choose to avoid combat and make a life trading. They have strong people skills and get the best deals when bargaining or trading.Beast MenBeastmen are humanoid mammals. They have the greatest range of senses but because of this they are also susceptible to sound light and scent based weapons i.e. sonic screech flash bomb pepper spray. Most beastmen come from the Great Eastern Continent named so due to its massive size stretching from the Northernmost Pole to the Southeastern hemisphere.RakasaA race of catlike people whom live in the central grasslands in the East. They are highly stealthy quick witted and charismatic. In addition the Rakasa have night vision and can use their sharp claws in an unarmed attack.The Rakasa are said to be the Eastern answer to elves. They too have created a vast and powerful empire but the difference is that their empire still stands. The Rakasan mainland nation is almost as large as all of Alascara. It stretches from the dry and arid mountain deserts of the north to the lush and wet jungles of the south. Most of the nation is sparsely forested grassland. Rakasan creation myth states that there is only one true god a great lion that called creation from the void with one mighty roar. It is said that he made the land from his dung this has been changed to blood or bones or flesh and traced its outlines with his mighty claws that the oceans are his tears and freshwater the saliva from his tongue that the air is his breath and that the creatures of Thera were created from hairs that he shed from his body. The Rakasans are born from the golden hair of his mane lower animals the more common hairs for his body and finally the more disgusting animals are made from is tail or backside hair. This great lion is considered to be a benevolent god even though he is also the source of all evil. He is seen as a loving and stern father using evil as a form of tough love. Yes a certain event might seem evil in the short term but certainly there is an ultimately good endgame that can only be seen my he whos golden eyes see the infinite. NewThe Rakasan creation myth has also caused political uproar. According to the myth Rakasans are the height of creation and superior to all other beings. The existence of Humans and Elves has caused a legal and theological problem. Right now nonRakasans hold a title of Noble Animals animals that are recognized to have thinking faculties. There is debate as to whether or not a nonrakasan can serve The Golden Lion whether or not all sentient beings should be considered coming from The Golden Lions mane etc. No matter which stance they take Rakasans are very proud of their race and culture. They enjoy the finest of both nature and culture they have freedom under law but a strict religion that limits their behavior. They are proud to have found a balance between the elven Do as I say and the Republican Do as you please. Lupian FenirianA race of wolflike beastmen. They are not werewolves because lycanthropy is a magical polymorph effect that works on the victims a Lupian can still be infected with lycanthropy and transform and lose sanity under the full moon. They come from Wolfwood The Northern Oasis a warm mountain valley roughly the size of New Hampshire deep in the mountains of the Northfrost a land the size of China that is lifeless except for the elementals and the occasional animal that struggles to survive. Most live in the large central tribe in Wolfwood. They are considered a huntergatherer society and feed mostly off of the Elephant sized stags that roam their land. Lupians have strong wolf senses and have a resistance to frost. Not much is known about them as they were only discovered  years ago. Most in academia considered them a myth until a prominent gnomish scientist introduced a living Lupian warrior he had become friends with. Their history is a total mystery. Some attribute the ancient megaliths of Basiliscara to them though the modern Lupians do not work with stone and have no tools or even knowledge concerning stonework. They have an animist mystic religion with witch doctors and shamans acting as conduit to the spirits of nature. They use stone and wood tools have no written language tribal knowledge usually being kept by shamans or seers. Some scientists have proposed studying the Lupians as a way of studying how other sentient races developed thousands of years ago. Lupian seers say that many years ago their land was much larger than it is now. It is said that one of their ancient tribal elders angered the God or spirits or spirit of frost and that caused the frost to consume their land. Proper geological study has not yet verified this claim.    ,fantasywriters,ch0fblx,1,t5_2t4ad

1436094,0,t3_2akgp2,Welcome to reddit and to this sub!  Okay I read through the first chapter and here are some of my thoughts  There was lots of tellinginfodumping. This is one of the most challenging aspects of writing a fantasy because so much of our work involves worldbuilding and it feels odd not to share all of that with the reader. However keep in mind that this is the beginning of your story and to be connected to it  to want to keep reading  the reader needs to feel a connection with the characters rather than the setting. Only include what information is essential for the reader to know to understand the scene most worldbuildy stuff can be slipped in as the story progresses.  Everything in your story should serve one of three purposes  . Driving the story forward. . Buildingdeveloping your characters. . Setting the type of moodvibe the scene requires. Ideally two or even three of these things can happen simultaneously like within dialog but at least one needs to be taking place for it to be included. Otherwise cut it out. I keep a snippets file that contains all the fat Ive trimmed from stuff just in case I want to use it later. gt Whenever he asked her about it grandmamma always said that it was his father who had built it. Thats all she would say about it. As long as Jalen could remember he and grandmamma had always lived alone together he couldnt remember his father or mother. Grandmamma would always say that they were good people but would never offer more than that and over the years Jalen learned not to ask more than that knowing it hurt her to talk about it.All of this could be shown in a quick interaction between Jalen and his grandmother rather than explained to the reader. The part where Jalen spoke to Mr. Aldrych was another place where we could learn about what sort of place Haven is with regards to the artistry and craftsmanship that is so prominent. And why would Jalen think it was stupid to want to create when art is so revered here? There is also a lack of conflict which is essential to keep the readers interest. Jalen wakes up meets his friends goes to a party. Its...well its a bit bland to be brutally honest. The scene with Jalen and Wynn taunting Adia was funny but there was no conflict no challenge no struggle. Im not saying that there needs to be epic swordfights or brawls in every scene but there does need to be some sort of conflict  that urges the reader to keep reading to find out what happens next. Like say Jalen doesnt want to go to the party for some reason but everyone else is looking forward to throwing it so he goes to make them happy. This would intrigue the reader why doesnt he want to go? and reveal something of his character hes a good guy who cares about his friends. With regards to your specific questions without reading the whole thing its hard to say how appealing it would be to a wide audience. My advice to you is to write the story that needswants to be written and worry about the audience later on. Just get the rough draft down then you can start sorting out what you have. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like further explanation. If you feel brave enough to open the doc up to allowing comments I can point out some specific areas that could use some TLC. Best of luck to you! Happy writing. ,fantasywriters,ciwahgk,3,t5_2t4ad

People wont mind if you fudge her incoherence a bit simply to get more emotional impact and relevancy. In some ways a stoic young girl might be an interesting contrast to what normally happens  kids grew up faster in some situations and so in Elsas POV we could see the tension between her instincts as a child and her sense of duty as a member of a noble family.,fantasywriters,cj59dl1,2,t5_2t4ad

1533902,0,t1_cj8hciu,I have this issue too. Ive learned to harness it for example when writing a scene with an overenthusiastic scientist in it I was reading Pratchett and Id always envisaged this character being played by Rik Mayall sadly not possible any more RIP Rik. So by combining Pratchetts tone and visualising Rik in my minds eye I was able to make the scene dance.The novella currently in postproduction was very much influenced by the intensity of The Steel Remains and I think allowed me to get a bit of that sexploitation vibe out of my system.However sometimes it gets very bleak. I had to have a month off writing after finishing ASOIAF I found the sheer expanse and grim tone of the series made me consciously start writing torture into my books. It warped the ending of a draft story Id wanted to end it with the MC being flogged but then I went overboard in the epilogue as well with a scene of prolonged torture being meted out to his hapless friend with his friend completely unable to fight back or escape or have any hope of escaping in the next book.So I do make sure I detox after reading an explicit book just to help my brain settle. I recently read Starship Troopers so Ive settled into a harmless book about the Chicago Worlds Fair to cleanse the palette.,fantasywriters,cj8ju8q,3,t5_2t4ad

1611402,0,t1_cjhxxiv,I think I mention her in another post but her books were very cartoonish and consisted of one ridiculous stereotypecaricature after another from the hot exotic POC foreigner with a mysterious dance to a bullying priest because all established religion is corrupt and misogynistic to the shoddy way she shot the shaggy dog at the end of The Riven Kingdom to the fact that the active POV character was male anyway despite Rhians bolshy teenager approach to the way Rhian was only liberated because shed been raised alongside her brothers thereby reinforcing masculinity  good femininity  bad.Empress was better but there was one single named woman in the entire book the protagonist Hekat.Women writers are by no means exempt from being simply awful when it comes to writing women. Contrast this with Trudi Canavan who wrote Sonea as if she could have written either a male or female protagonist but chose to go with a girl for genuinely diverse reasons didnt fall for the old trick of making Sonea a horny teenager just so she could date boys at school she got the puppy love crush on an older guy bit spot on however and wrote two men as the main romantic plot. Women do have their different perspectives but what we need is plotlines like Soneas which dont automatically revolve around gender or proving ourselves equal. I have written a Cersei Lannisterstyle character into the WIP Im editing  sexpositive generally heterosexual courtesan with a scheming streak to her but I think one of the ways to do active women is to give them their direct indepth points of view the main thing about Aushra was that she was a breakout character. When conceiving the book it was about the MC and his relationship with another dude. Then I wrote her in and the story became more about her as an antiheroine trying to pull off a heist against the MC but failing through sheer greed. As a prequelprelude novella the book has to end with everyone still alive and free so I can take her through a number more adventures before the first actual novel in which she is made a scapegoat.,fantasywriters,cjia8x5,2,t5_2t4ad

1658225,0,t3_2dbgx1,Some parts of the fighting are problematic.This rules of this competition seem quite strange. How is it that youre allowed to choose such a wide variety of weapons? The bow and arrows seems particularly incongruous. You mention the swords are blunted which makes sense. But then you say the arrows are also blunted. I dont know much about archery but Id think a flying arrow would be pretty dangerous even if the tips were blunted especially if you werent wearing armor which the contestants dont seem to be. Similarly a mace is a pretty deadly weapon. If an unarmored man was hit with one hed likely be killed or suffer devastating injuries broken bones broken skull ruptured internal organs. I feel like it would make more sense if everyone was just using swords.Fyrn carries a bastard sword and shield into battle. A bastard sword is generally meant to be wielded twohanded. It is unlikely you would use it with a shield.In Fyrns first fight his polearm wielding opponent moved in close his pole still pressed up against Fyrns shield. What? That is absolutely the worst thing a polearm user could do against an opponent with sword and shield. What was the lad trying to do start a shoving match? He should have pulled his weapon away from the shield to take another swing not gotten closer and compounded his disadvantage. Its like he wanted his nose to get bashed in.gt Fyrn rolled away from it and quickly got on his feet. By the time he was up he couldnt react to a lunge that hit him in the side and sent him sprawlingI dont see many scenarios which would force Fyrn to dodge the mace blow by rolling. If he had just jumped to one side he would have recovered quickly enough to counter his opponents next attack. Speaking of which a blow with a mace heavy enough to send you sprawling would hurt quite a bit. The injuries from that blow would be enough to take Fyrn out of the fight not just give him stabbing pains.,fantasywriters,cjo6kho,2,t5_2t4ad

1800450,0,t3_2f4fww,The questions you have to answer for a reader here I think are What relationship does it have to the story? How does this affect the story? i.e. who is this Champion who is presumably the main protagonist in the story? and Where is this going to occur in the story? Its a nice piece of writing but in contrast to uCandidate impersonal creation myths dont really get me as enthusiastic to read a book as direct concrete hooks. What would interest me is a few specific names such as Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden occurring in Genesis the story of Gilgameshs Flood and his relationship to Enkidu or the names of your gods or their individual arguments.The best creation myth I can think of that made me want to read a book was David Eddings beginning to Belgarath the Sorcerer. That tied the beginning of the world with Belgaraths own life and how he sat at a gods knee for several hundred years IIRC before he went out into the world to begin the arduous process of saving it from an evil deity several millennia later.This works as a good basis with a bit of texture but give me some direct names and places and were talking turkey .,fantasywriters,ck63qwp,2,t5_2t4ad

2041473,0,t1_ckz5976,If this is going for half magichalf steampunk shouldnt it occur during the beginning of the Industrial Age and not Medieval times? Or are you thinking Gallileanesque steampunk or something like that? Oh ok I think I might see now sorry reading and typing on the mobile so my thoughts arent very cohesive. So this main country is basically an old empire that once was great and advanced but is now run by traditionalists that dont like the technological swing it took and are trying to pull it back.Ok so your post brings more questions. Different schools is great with Wizards and Magicians at the peaks got it and it sounds good. Can you go into the magic more? What makes a Wizards magic offensive and what are their capabilities? Magicians can manipulate items into changing or flowing with a show is this like molding a block of marble with a wave of the hand? Or is it more turning a hat into a rabbit? Does becoming a Magician not take years of studying? Sorry I might have misinterpreted what you put down there for that.Your response also makes me wonder on the radio. So there is no physical object does this mean only Magicians can do this with Fier? Im guessing theyd bend the flow of the sound wave or something. What is the structure that houses the electricity or light? I think this would be good to have as a pseudoscience type object where steampunk and magic meet. Oh and whats materialized Fier? Is that what the serial killers gloves are made of? Isnt Fier basically ones soul? How does someone lose their Fier.I love the children needing to learn and the elderly losing focus it adds something to the magic for it not to be stagnant. Questions for that though what type of government do you have in the main country? Having to educate the entire populace is a huge obstacle and burden on a medieval government the taxes would be nuts and paying for other things roads wars buildings would be very difficult. Whats the government getting for educating the people? Also are the elderly dangerous if they lose their focus?Also if there are many cultures itd be interesting to see the different takes on educating the children. In a world where everyone has Fier Id think the parents could pass down the training they have from their parents and so forth since they were all able to survive somehow. And if Fier usage is as widespread as you make it seem Id think kids would pick up on the basics pretty quick. Just look at kids today around laptopsphonesiPads. The world changed and kids immediately adaptedThe plot! Does the serial killers moral reasoning change at all? I could just see his outlook getting darker and darker where at first his friends are onboard with what hes doing but eventually he goes darker and they question him. So he changes them to agree again until the next time they question him that repeats a few times. Eventually his friends are basically puppets just like the others he controls.It sounds like youre ready to really start writing. Especially if its all in your mind get it down on paper.

2145660,0,t3_2jhccy,I think it needs a run through for grammar and other silly errors. And I agree with uArtemisAquarius that it is not very gripping. I dont think you have the historians voice yet. You seem to want to make it his but dont want to give up the general rd person overview narrator perspective too. This is a person. He has opinions. Let them out and let them bias the hell out of it. He seems to know way more about the battle than a person in the midst of the battle really could. It seems like you focus in and out of the narrators voice.  If this is a historical account then read historical accounts of battles. If youre American then theres no better than the Star Spangled Banner. This is a poor poet Francis Key giving his take on the Battle of Fort McHenry during the War of . And its such a good song that its been song by us for  years and will likely be sung for another  too. Contemporary fictional examples would be Duiker from Malazan book  I think. These people are into the rendition pride and bias during the battles. It seems like you think of the living historian as an overseer of the events but they arent. Our overview of facts now from battles long ago comes from many historians giving their different takes.I also cant think of a time where Id expect a historian to be leading a charge when there are soldiers around. Unless the Tinden army was so haphazard and disorganized that a civilian was a better soldier than the soldiers. The whole piece just didnt have a solid voice behind it to me. You seem to have a great story set up between the Tinden and Devarians as well as the reluctant allies to the south so thats a fantastic start.

2153345,0,t3_2jnx2g,As much as a person isnt defined by their sexuality our experiences are largely defined by the culture we live in. What I mean is a homophobic society isnt a minor minor plot point in the life of a homosexual person. For instance questioning whether to be closeted or open and with who friends family coworkers that person they just met is a nearly ubiquitous experience. Because people are varied and unique not defined by their sexuality theyll come up with a thousand different answers for their own lives of dramatic and subtle differences. But theyll all face the question. Depending on how harshly homophobic the society is it could be a matter of life and death torture or imprisonment. Its not fair it shouldnt be how things are but thats the point. A discriminatory society has a very real personal impact on the oppressed. So whats my point? That its difficult to treat the subject briefly without engaging in tokenism or like you said sending the wrong message. If your only gay character is unscrupulous that doesnt look good. If you have two or more disparate gay characters you dont have to worry much about falling into vague stereotypes. But then its not such a minor plot point if youre writing truthfully about their experiences. It can be a subplot rather than a main plot for sure but to just gloss over it would probably be bad.That said Im never going to argue against diversity.

Cyril ConnollyThe quote from Robert Hughes makes a lot of sense. Everyone has doubt in what they do its only natural. And those that dont will never grow and get any better. As for the second quote from Cyril Connolly I think about this quote all the time.

2828535,0,t3_2shtdp,What Id do instead of blogging it is compile it in Google Docs and post occasional requests for oversight on the subreddit. Putting your work out on the internet might harm your ability to get it traditionally published later on should you decide its good enough and quite often posting uncritiqued or raw work as a serial as you write chapterbychapter does you a disservice  either when you have a better idea and want to rework the beginning to suit changes in the story as it develops or because raw writingfirst drafts are very rarely of the sort of quality that will look good to the reading public. You might also end up abandoning the project or taking longer to write it than you planned which will almost look worse than regularly posting unedited drafts if I had done that with the story I started enthusiastically in May Id have lost the readership by now for lack of activity.Also speaking as a mod we frown on selfpromotion that is just posting here to circulate your work. Asking for critique is OK but it would be slightly different if you were posting something to drive traffic to your blog. Blogs arent forbidden as such when youre asking for critique or posting someone elses work but wed raise a few eyebrows if you were serialising something on it and were posting it regularly.I suggest what you do is work on your blog as a place to keep your opinions and tipstricks about writing and write your book in private. If you want to post stuff here for critique go ahead but its generally a good idea to get a first draft down before you seek significant critique. I think its helpful in the early part of working to get comments on direction purpose style and general elements of wriiting but actual major editing cant really be done until you have the whole story completed.So...while I think there are no bad ideas when it comes to plot Id advise against this kind of working. Ive seen other writers deprecate the idea too. I do regularly post short stories on my blog and on Wattpad but am more and more thinking I ought to hold some back to try to sell them to magazines and I wouldnt post a story at all until I felt the story was polished and final. I wouldnt post a serial as I write it Ive done a couple on Wattpad I have done one over New Year twice now since its a good time of year to get work like that done but Ive always had the whole thing in front of me when I copy the chapters over one by one. Anything that I intend to sell apart from anthologies of the blogged short stories Ive hung back on even though Im selfpublished.There are some things that the internet does well social networking but there are still some things you should hold back from it.,fantasywriters,cnpllb8,3,t5_2t4ad
2828643,0,t3_2sh99o,First and foremost is dialogue. The things they say and how they say is probably the part of writing I become most anal about. I need their dialogue and internal thoughts if they are a POV character though the internal thought does not need to be reflected in speech just consisted with other internal thoughts to remain consistence throughout even with different changes in emotion and situation. For major characters I even write down most common words used or vocabularies. The way they walk and move. I often pretend to be my characters in the shower in the morning to figure out how they move. This seems way to artisy now that I write it out but its important to me that a characters history and personality weighs on them physically for some reason that seems to enliven them. It givens a sense of physicality to psychological issues and cultural upbringing.

2903235,0,t3_2tdekj,Here are my notes on the first half. I might come back and finish it up later. Overall I think this is quite well done although I think there are portions which can definitely be cut and simplified. I have a bias towards stark prose and that is evident in some of my suggestions. But more often I think that the deletions I suggested are pretty unambiguous. Mainly the concern information which is bogging down your lines which the reader does not need to be told right now. Let me know if you have questions. gtI was born perfect.Good opening. gtAny less and I would have been slain cast into the pits and my birthmother along with me feed for the hounds my mother keeps for those among her court who enjoy the sport of a hunt.In my opinion you weaken here. It gets wordy. Do we really need to know why she keeps the dogs? Do we need the redundancy of slain and then cast into the pits?Its possible you do the redundant part at least but Id consider cutting this line down to preserve some more of its punch. And the redundancy of slain is problematic because youre breaking the sentence into three parts it really makes it plod in my opinion. Any less and I would have been slain cast into the pits and my birthmother along with me feed for the hounds my mother keeps for those among her court who enjoy the sport of a hunt.Any less and I would have been cast into the pits and my birthmother with me feed for the hounds my mother keeps. Honestly id go even further and remove the part about the birthmother. The fact that she has a birthmother is background information which I think you dont need to hit us with right away. Any less and I would have been cast into the pits feed for my mothers hounds.But these changes are very optional. Though Id definitely recommend removing the part about why the hounds are keptthats just pointless. gtShe is generous my mother. And exacting.This is a good line but I dont know if it really follows even ironically what youve said so far. It sounds great but does it make sense in this context?  gtPerfection is thus a requirement for those who would cling to life perfection as foreseen by the divinedations of by the warlocks who administer her birthing cells. Ten fingers ten toes  I have heard it said this is enough among the commoners of our realm. It was not so for me. I came forth into the world screamingnaked as all children do into the arms of a midwife who had coaxed my birthmother through the last hours of her surrogacy. There ends the similarities between my life and the lives of the commonborn. No sooner had I emerged from the womb than a seer laid hand on me parting the veils of the future to divine my essential natures to ascertain whether the experiment of comingling my fathers seed and mothers blood had produced a worthy offspring.I just suggested some general cleanup here. But notice how you mention the birthmother? So youre giving the reader the same information you gave them in the earlier line but here it doesnt feel unnecessary in my opinion. Its a better place to say it. Ill explain the change from screaming to naked in the last paragraph.gtMy wits were deemed average.gtMy gift with sorcery sorcerous gifts deemed acceptable.To me gift with sorcery sounds fake. It doesnt sound as Id imagined someone would label a skill that is to them just a part of the normal world. gtMy prowess with the weapons of war deemed good considering my sex. It was to be expected given who my father had been.Again deemed good does not sound like someone speaking about real warfare and combat. It sounds like...well... someone writing a fictional book. gtMy command of battlestrategy and skill with intrigue appraised the same also expected in light of my parentage.gtNone of these would have been sufficient.Probably shouldnt say the sorcery was acceptable then. Acceptable  sufficient. gtI have learned since the day of my birth that there is an art to divination. It is a magic known only to the warlocks and strictly forbidden where it touches on the arc of my mothers future  she has wards set to know the precise nature and timing should one of the seers dare to violate her command. And so who can say whether the warlocks appraisals were the product of true visions unclouded by the long shadow my mother would cast over the web of my life? Who can say whether his final proclamation was an objective truth or only his own preference for the features into which I was to grow?This paragraph could be cleaner. In addition to what I took out take that or leave it the subject of the paragraph is a bit muddled. You introduce the fact that the magic is known only to the warlocks first then mention the restriction on her mothers future. But then in the questions you mention the mothers effect first then the warlocks judgement. That reversal muddles things in my opinion. There is an art to divination. It is a magic known only to the warlocks and strictly forbidden where it touches the arc of my mothers futureshe has wards set. And so who can say whether the warlocks appraisals was an objective truth or his own preference for the features into which I was to grow? Who can say whether his final proclamation was unclouded by the long shadow my mother would cast over the web of my life?gtHe named me a perfect beauty and so I was allowed to live.gtOf course I do not recall the events immediately following my birth but I have born witness to enough of my sisters first rites to summarize what must have passed for me. The midwife would have held me aloft judging now for physical defects where the warlocks visions touched only my future self. If Had I was not been breathing on my own shethe midwife would have struck me or pricked my skin yet I have heard it said I was a prodigious screamer even from the moment of my birth. Certainly I have not lacked for constitution it is enough to believe I passed muster easily my cord severed by a pair of long shears kept at hand for that very task. It would be my last physical contact with the woman who bore me though the surrogate would be tended as she passed the suckling flesh that had nourished me in her womb then escorted to fairlyappointed chambers for one of her station.Had I not been breathing on my own the midwife would have struck me or pricked my skin. Yet I have heard I was a prodigious screamer from the moment of my birth. Certainly I have not lacked for constitution it is enough to believe I passed muster easily my cord severed by a pair of long shears kept at hand for that very task. It would be my last contact with the woman who bore me.I removed a lot from here. First earlier I changed screaming to naked here its clear why. If youre going to make whether or not she was screaming the centerpiece of a subsequent paragraph best not to mention it earlier on. Second the beginning lines Of course I do not... accomplish nothing aside from telling us that shes witnessed her sisters births I dont see any reason why we need to know this immediately and it provides an explanation for how she knows what happened when she was born... but later on you say I have heard it said... which accomplishes the exact same thing more or less. So those lines are out. Next I removed physical. Unless she has some other form of contact later on and you need to qualify yourself here its just stronger to leave the statement unqualified. And neglecting to say what happens to her birthmother and just ending the paragraph on last contact instead gives the paragraph far more punch. Is what happened to the birthmother relevant? And is it relevant enough that we need to be told right this instant? I dont see any reason it would be.,fantasywriters,cny3qxd,2,t5_2t4ad

3098568,0,t1_coig4s0,A few points to consider. A large barbaric empire is an oxymoron. Running a vast empire requires sophistication and hierarchy. I dont buy into the idea that unarmed combat is somehow more disciplined spiritual philosophical or hardening than armed combat. Weapons  especially the pseudoMedieval fantasy selection such as swords and bows  require a great deal of strength stamina skill and coordination to use effectively. Moreover we have reallife examples of armed combat intertwining with philosophy. Read The Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi.Many martial arts practiced today incorporate weapons training on advanced levels such as aikido wushu wing chun hapkido some styles of karate... Even if unarmed combat is the cultural ideal people tend to be pragmatic when life is at stake. Say a bunch of powerful unarmed combatants are coming your way wouldnt you grab something big and heavy from the toolshed to increase your chances of surviving? Even if it were highly immoral or illegal better to be judged by twelve than carried by six right? I really dont want to discourage a fellow beginning writer but I must admit that if I picked up a book based on this premise Id assume the author had no experience with martial arts and bent reality too hard for the sake of an idea that seemed cool at the time.If you really wish to develop a world without weapons then magic andor religion are probably your best bet as uAetherealMuses suggested. ,fantasywriters,coj5yli,1,t5_2t4ad

3177911,0,t1_cordcqx,On its own its a small issue but it comes down to believable character creation. You have to think about your characters background and upbringing and how that would influence how he speaks and thinks. Right now your character does not read as a believable heir to the throne. Overall I think you have the potential for something good but it needs work. The speech does not read like something a powerful and educated man would come up with. It could be tightened considerably. one example he says the King was a loved son and brother to my parents and I. The parents and I part is unnecessary and just waters down your prose. I absolutely have no idea from reading this how the heir feels about his uncle. Is he a good man? Power hungry? No idea. Thats something that should come across. ,fantasywriters,core0iw,3,t5_2t4ad

I didnt have modern firearms but the beginnings of them. So while there is electricity and diesel engines the weaponry is way behind. I explained it easily by way of how magic was used for killing people previously so less effort went to developing firearms. So then I tried writing a short story with the same main character...the vibe really called for her using a pistol. Cant exactly change the previous decision to make it more fantasy by limiting firearms. So its not hard to do at all and I wouldnt worry about it.

Start with the premise but reinvent it to take it away from the point where it appears to be fanfic and see if you cant make it your own. Im guessing you dont want to be accused of plagiarism but what I did with a plotline I was enamoured of was to run it through a brainstorming process from the perspective of the characters and make sure you come at things at least from a different angle.

For your cursed sword that explodes your arm if you try to set it down example you can let readers puzzle it out over several references.

If it helps the reader add it.One thing to consider though Amazon sets the start point of your book where it believes the text begins and they do it via an algorithm IIRC so theyd likely skip your cast list when someone picks it up on an eReader.It would probably be better for the flavor of the book overall if you can work it into the actual text. You can do this bit by bit Give us a name tell us an interesting factoid about the person and his or her people move on progress the story. Eventually a picture of your society will begin to form and in the meantime we can track your characters from the tidbits you gave us about them.Like I might see Yahul and think What was his deal? Oh right hes the doctor whose people are really good with the plants... We shouldnt need to know too much else up front to move along with your plot unless its really complicated.If it is really complicated and has a lot to do with crosstribe dynamics or some such you might want to dream up a simple way to ease us into the machinations of the plot anyway since a list of characters often goes out peoples heads the second they turn the page until youve cemented them by showing us who they are.,fantasywriters,cq5bnu4,2,t5_2t4ad

3841201,0,t3_34fgs0,Show dont tell is a guideline that is broken by everyone on every page. The point of the rule is to bring the reader into the story rather than simply have a story. By showing say emotions through actions you give the reader a more enjoyable experience because many times telling me say someone is angry isnt enough to say how angry he was which has to be shown. Its not that you cant tell me things in fact you need to tell me things there is no way around it especially in fiction. The further in the story the more you ought to be telling me. I dont need to be shown what these things are anymore and how exactly a character mannerisms are because youve already shown me that.The problem with telling is that it lacks multiple dimensions its flat you are only saying one thing rather than showing me whats happening and it meaning something more.It focuses you on action and plot while eliminating the need for useless distractions and details. The meat and guts of your story is going to be the characters what they are doing and how they are doing it.

3859195,0,t1_cqw5fbx,I think the important aspects of democracy lies not really in political choice at the ballot box but choices  economic and civic  in daily life particularly the freedom we have to sit here and discuss the downsides of democracy. The USSR conducted regular elections after all but typewriters and photocopiers were tightly controlled and technologies that allowed for freer and quicker dissemination of information such as the humble VCR were instrumental in the fall of the Iron Curtain much like social media is a thorn in a contemporary dictatorships side. I would be interested in reading how your society responds to the imposition of greater control  sure the government was corrupt but there were some civil liberties that are now having to be restricted  and is the control imposed on an economic level too? Is the new junta involving itself in the market economy or is it letting people continue their business as usual? See my answer to uAzincourt about Gorbachevs comment on washing machines.Regarding theme Im interested in reading a good story and extracting the theme from it. IMO the problem is not with the theme itself and more with the way you write it  the problem would come when I decide youre preaching at me or the world ends up black and white with straw arguments on both sides. Fantasy is an entertainment genre first and foremost and writing theme first story second would end up with people finding it hard to get past it. My least favourite books put theme directly to the front they were both about womens position in society and with one writing women just as punching bagvictims without any way in which the protagonist gained agency or even backbone and the other writing a strong woman character who whined at everyone until she got her way because somehow according to the message I was picking up from the author her gender meant she could ignore the rules of decorum and how to be a good stateswoman and diplomat I got frustrated with both books not allowing me to escape properly into a good story. Id argue that short stories do put themes front and centre but then that format is often used to explore a single situation and provide a conversation piece rather than weave a huge yarn that keeps people absorbed for a long period of time.You can write a good book about womens rights Ive put a little bit into a girls head that slapping her little brother about for breaking her doll would be unladylike...but slapping anyone about is also a bad idea its just how she rationalises it but you need to come at it from a position where you dissect unpack and explore the various nuances of the situation rather than force your opinion down the readers throat. The bit about being unladylike is accompanied by what being a woman is like in my society  being learned and studious and taking on adult responsibility as well as wellmannered Im trying hard to write feminine characters with backbone as much as I am strong women who kick up a fuss at the slightest provocation.In actual fact your chosen plotline explores the dashed promises of a revolution rather than any problem with democracy the characters intentions are definitely sympathetic which is largely whats needed.

If you have trouble sticking to something else what I do and I write on word is I have two files open so I have somewhere else to make notes on those ideas that pop up that have nothing to do with what I am currently working on. Then I can always come back and my brain thinks ooh thats done and concentrates on the task at hand.And the other thing that helps is having some limits REALLY helps. Time word count style and content restrictions good to focus the mind. Its funny but as youve already noticed doing something else actually helps with your main WIP youll be surprised what your subconscious will sort out for you. And when you do sit and commit to a start remember you can always change it! And also for everyone its always a risk and a bit nervewracking but you have to start somewhere! I love my WIP but I dont love the beginning. Its tough because the beginning is so important. But Ive tried a number of things and they dont work. Ive asked a few people what they think and they say it is fine and it didnt stop them from reading. So I have decided to leave it move on learn from it and hope to do better next time.

3968746,0,t1_cr8bd6o,Could you give me a quote about obsession with racial purity in Christianity? As a liberal Christian myself one of the tenets is that Christianity is open to all as a universal faith not kept culturally within a specific community otherwise it may never have spread to Gentile Rome it was Pauls decision deliberately to take it outside Judaism. Islam is similar in that it spread quite widely from the Middle East outwards. Judaism accepts conversion but doesnt seek it. Yes there are probably racist Christians Jews and Muslims but its far from an essential part of the faith absent local cultural tradition which could be xenophobic and racist  but then the Christians took the faith outside Europe just as the apostles took it to Europe in the first place and it seems a very sweeping statement to make even to prove a point about demographics within specific geographical areas which I generally agree with.,fantasywriters,cr8o5na,2,t5_2t4ad
3975387,0,t1_cr9cul2, I underline the thoughts because thats how I was originally told to do it when I first started writing I found out much later that my source of information was outdated. At this point I do it only because its what Ive always done. Manus is a minor political position in the Empire so its correct in terminology. The switching around is just lack of inconsistency sorry. Nox Cappilus is a bit of a social caste in the Empire its translation being night hair. Though the words have little bearing in other regions in the world such as Firdauss homeland being deemed Nox Cappilus is a horrid thing within the dominion of the Empire. Yes we are in the Black Mountains. I got a bit carried away with worldbuilding and started adding irrelevant information thats all. My apologies. Again another inconsistency. Sorry. Shock. I guess I was a little too vague with that part. Yeah Firdaus calling them friends after he deserts them was bad on my part. MargarHandur is well known by the Empire yes. He is a major part of the novel being one of the  viewpoint characters. Blackhaired people are Nox Cappilus and they comprise of the Empires untouchable caste. They are treated this way due to the way the Empires chief religion depicts blackhaired people. The NoxSol Cappilus concept becomes a major ordeal in the novel as one of my characters has to deal with their blonde hair being turned black by the antagonist and the social repercussions that creates.You are right about the people in the mountains being banished there. Its an Imperial colony and prisoners are sent to mine in the mountains because of the high mortality rate the job presents. Ogre is basically a derogatory thing to call the Bronntonns as they are perceived by the Empire to be savage animals. My fantasy place names arent really based on much of anything at least not the country names. However I have a rule that places with similar cultures have similar names but thats about it.Thanks for the critique.

Fantasy more than arguably any other genre is truly unlimited in its scope. Authors are free to create anything they want and wrote about it so seeing the same races pop up again and again becomes tiring. Simply changing their name isnt enough either as theyre fundamentally the same.

4237555,0,t3_39at4d,Hey! I really like that lion. I think what needs the most help is the text. There needs to be more padding on all sides. Hopefully this isnt stepping on your toes or anything but I took a second to just illustrate what Id consider a more dynamic yet balanced layout.

4240385,0,t3_39i8x1,I think question needs more conttext.Are you asking about a fantasy world with enough technology that guns exist and whether we find that interesting? Answer very much yes. Just imagine LOTR with the only difference being s cannons and rifles etc. Makes a lot of things very interesting and different feeling than other typical medieval fantasy. Apply that further and you can mix magic with machines such as genres like steampunk and that creates diverse aesthetics. Think of the tension creates between mysticism and science jedi in star wars for example or the guns used in Princess Mononoke gave those narratives vital character.Or are you referring to the craft of writing involving gunsethical issues? I was born and raised in South Carolina and cant speak to the latter as I have no qualms about escapism  guns but it seems to me characters drive the specificity with guns. ExampleA gun expert like Larry Correia writes his protagonists as enthusiasts and experts and it seems effortless that they should speak about the specifically and confidently. Brandon Sanderson does the same thing in Steelheart however he himself is not an expert and it seems forced. Like someone showing off research and imitating an enthusiast. There he should have created a protagonist in my opinion with skill involving firearms but no the feigned technical expertise and enthusiasm.It also comes down to what is important. Specificity only matters if that specificity is vital to plot and characterization. Just knowing something is a revolver works fine if that character is only that familiar while perhaps a specops soldier would know the weapon like a lover. The in between is someone like myself who knows his own weapons by name and calibre can clean and maintain them but is not an expert at all weapons or an enthusiast exactly.,fantasywriters,cs3lge9,18,t5_2t4ad
4247371,0,t3_39i8x1,I think guns are a natural fit for any fantasy world. The underlying physics of a gun makes them a very useful weapon and while the physical engineering of them could be a challenge for your fantasy society it isnt necessarily so.If your society can craft things out of steel or has stronger metals mythril adamant etc. why wouldnt they have guns?If they can work magic why wouldnt they use that instead of gunpowder for propelling the bullet?If they can put magical runes onto weapons surely ammunition is the next sensible step.Be aware too that crossbows vs rifles as an example each have some pros and cons. The penetrative power of a crossbow bolt is TREMENDOUS at the cost of projectile speed much harder to hit a moving target.If I were hunting say Dragon Id definitely want me a ballista or crossbow versus a rifle.,fantasywriters,cs4e2ze,3,t5_2t4ad

I used to and it was fun but Ive had enough.  Ive even had enough of writers endless new takes on these tropes e.g. urban elves ubervampires etc.  It doesnt make it fresh for me.What I look for now in fantasy in terms of the types of racesspeciesmonsters is originality.  I find it very attractive and interesting when a writer has created a species or a handful of species from the ground up.  Populating a world with something new is more difficult in terms of worldbuilding because you cant just rely on established tropes but have to create backgrounds yourself and make everything cohesive so it makes sense.

4501841,0,t3_3cqmex, EM Sense  not a problem.Humans already have a form of this we can see the visual light band of the EM Spectrum.  The issue is that air isnt a good conductor of electricity and magnetism follows the inverse square law.  Intensity of a field is related to the distance from its source the farther away the weaker the field The weaponry  bit more of an issue.Some things are naturally magnetic like lodestones. Others can be magnetized by having their atoms line up together like by running a current through a wire. And the rest just kind of catch fire when you try to run a current through them like wood.And in rare circumstances given a powerful enough field some things get caught in the field anyway.  For example An MRI machine only operates at . Teslas. A fridge magnet is  mT. And the LHC operates at  T.So with all that said it would be difficult to explain how he can magnetize a object thats not in his hands without a lot of collateral damage.  The Collateral damage would be in the form of objects following his magnetic field lines and hitting things and eventually him.But anything he holds he could mess with the magnetic field or the charge of. ,fantasywriters,csy3ywt,2,t5_2t4ad

But...gt  He didnt know how. He didnt know where. He didnt even know why such a thought would cross his tired mind.This completely loses it again.  You dismiss it as being a valid concern.  Heres a suggestion on an alternative way to getting this across far from perfect but just intended to demonstrate the way you can maintain the mystery without dismissing reasons altogethergt He was going to die that night.  Couldnt have said how he knew it maybe just something in the black glower of the storm clouds biting from the west. Maybe something in the stench rising from the overflown gutters or the way that child had looked at him too long. Maybe just because hed been running on luck for longer than he was due and that river was running dry.Then we go into what I call Patrick Rothfuss backstorying.

4570524,0,t3_3dkr9m,Caught my interest as well though having just read Name of the Wind it did seem a bit too familiar nevertheless I was able to get past that part since its a minor point. I can foresee a few problems some of which you probably already have solutions for . . . .  Research especially a rough draft is really hard for someone else to make meaning from. A rough draft like the one described would have all kinds of information the reader doesnt need to know as well as not having some crucial connections that the researcher would have to make. A solution is needed to explain why the material you will present in your book is better curated than the disorganized pile you introduce.. Minor One line reads You are the last person alive who lived through the Great War. How would Sam possibly know this? How would anyone verify it? Wouldnt it be better to say might be the last person alive?. Minor The Almightys introduction into the conversation seems forced and therefore a little clumsy. .  Having the story told through multiple genres with multiple view points seems very ambitious. Its just that for a reader to identify with a POV already requires so much work and then adding on the difficulty of several different POVs plus the difficulty of different genres well to me that adds up to an awful lot of trial and error to get right. Not trying to dissuade you just pointing out the staggering amount of work this concept will require..  Some method will be needed to provide context about each different piece so that readers can have some sense of what the characters in the story would know about them. Either one of the characters can talk about each piece of course but there is great risk of monotony there I think. In any case mentioning the original Gerard letter does not have the impact on the reader you seem to expect. To me it sounds trite not majestic. This could be fixed if I had even a tiny bit of context.. Stylistically much of the writing seems somewhat stilted. I can see the tone you are going for a sort of archaic courtly way of speaking and writing but I dont think it has the effect you intend. Indeed I feel it has the opposite effect. Instead of feeling authentic at all points it feels contrived at some.,fantasywriters,ct6q532,2,t5_2t4ad

4621752,0,t3_3e8iz5,Im probably not your target audience but here are my comments on your first chapter.It is well written thats for sure. The narrative is engaging and moves at a brisk pace. I have to say that I really didnt care for your third paragraph that style really irritates me and I almost stopped reading. Im glad I persevered because the rest was much easier to read.The first time I saw the word Ashhead I read it as Asshead and it stuck with me throughout the piece.I think you should be careful with the following sentencesgt Left ear meant gay right?gt Her dancing partner gave her the once over. Never been with a black chick beforeIts OK if Zuri is a bit of a stereotyping homophobe but make that clear in the text. Come back to that idea later. I would advise against leaving this as a single throwaway line in case you offend anyone. Additionally are you seriously telling us that Jamie couldnt tell Zuris ethnicity just because it was a bit dark?gt  thats how they had seemed in her youth at least.How old is Zuri? In my head she was ageing up and down as I read through this. Young old then young again. She regards Jamie as a boy so she must be relatively older. Perhaps she is old but has the physical appearance of a young woman? Not clear.gt his mud eyes.What are mud eyes?gtIs that blonde hairnatural?Should be Is your hair ... naturally blonde?Now the sex. Sex scenes are my least favourite part in any novel but this was written quite well. Zuri comes across as a knowing predator during this part and frankly I disliked her even further for murdering this poor boy. Perhaps that was the intention.gt Her blue eyes poked through like sapphire jewels in the hell.I have a problem with this. Youre writing from Zuris perspective so this line sticks out. The camera has swung from over her shoulder to face her and then swings back over her shoulder. If youre writing in third person limited then you should stay that way.gt Zuri blinked as she looked up through the flames sapphire eyes widening when she saw her savior.Saviour? Someone grabs her wrist as shes suddenly saved? Shouldnt Zuri be utterly astonished that anything or anyone could grab her wrist at this point? gt Zuri tried to tell him to get away  to save him from Jamies fate  but there was no need.Why would she care for the welfare of this man when she seems to hate and fear them? I was expecting her to struggle free and try to escape not save the guy. In fact at the end she does exactly that.There were a few minor grammatical mistakes and the odd use of vocabulary here and there his head remained oblivious?! but otherwise the text is very well written.

4731613,0,t1_ctqunky,gt But if youre trying to tell a good story then worldbuilding is essential.This is provably wrong.Take Glen Cooks awesome and classic fantasy The Black Company.  The world is scarcely detailed. Part of what makes it so good is the complete lack of detail given.  Cook crafts only a few vague details of history the entire world history can be summed up in a two lines without missing any details he gives no information at all about material culture religion or anything else unless it directly impacts the plot.  It is a story first and a world second and no less awesome for that.In terms of GoT people really need to stop counting it as an example to recommend to writers.

4746283,0,t3_3fuzp0,Honestly dont worry about dates in terms of musical instrument invention. It is your world what does it matter when an instrument was invented in our world. If you are troubled by other inventions just dont have them show up. It could even lead to interesting world building as well since it could suggest that instead of focusing on weapons guns in your case your cultures focused more on art creativity and peace. In my own writing I often sprinkle in lots of references to music. I love bombastic orchestral pieces and attending concerts so I always try to make a note of music. I event names on the fly Zerwicks Fifth March Uthels Violin Concerto and toss them in.  I also make sure to bring up other cultures music as well either mentioning that they are playing a famous piece on their own instruments or playing something entirely new that the POV character has never heard before. It brings a sense of liveliness to the world especially if you throw in a short description of the music. Just saying its a haunting string melody or a piece dominated by the brass instruments goes a long way painting an interesting mental picture...or mental melody as the case might be. ,fantasywriters,ctstb69,1,t5_2t4ad

4860854,0,t1_cu6vcdb,Unfortunately what is called good philosophy in modern academic circles is rarely interesting philosophy. Philosophy as fantasy like with Nietzsche is rebellion against academic philosophy to a degree. So whether it would be considered good by academic standards is really up to chance and whether anyone gets it but Im hoping it would be at least a little interesting to lay readers  it largely explores the question of where should the world go from here? by creating analogues to modern day ideas and problems. The premise is that two nations were at war one side dominated by learning to master dragons and the other side began to turn the tables by creating a God. A peace treaty was signed to prevent the war from dragging out but the result is a Cold War scenario that the narrative begins in the thick of. I feel it necessary to point out how the ever possible threat of war skews resources towards militaries which becomes a selffulfilling prophecy. The problem of war is not in the leaders who wage it they are perhaps the most used by the system called government but the structure of the society which enables it and other problems like massive wealth disparities.The antagonist was born symbolically from the war  the desire to end all wars with the creation of a oneworld government. What would you say against someone who knows he could end all wars by becoming immortal and immeasurably powerful? How could you say such a man was evil when one sees daily the damage war has wrought and the corruption at the highest level of every government? He dons a full suit of pure white armor that masks his identity because he has been using magic to go from body to body to maintain the illusion of immortality  losing his sense of self along the way and becoming the symbol of an ideal that of absolute justice. Thus his conflict with multiple protagonists is not resolved by his defeat it is only finally resolved by the protagonist that becomes a symbol for a new ideal. There are multiple protagonists who all eventually come to their own ideals. One of them being the traditional fantasy cliche of being the hero of prophecy and not literally the one true king that will bring peace to the land without waging a war against all. Effectively his answer is to maintain current national boundaries and settle all conflicts peacefully. He becomes increasingly disillusioned with the government as it corrupts him to its own purposes and his unwillingness to use force bites him in the ass eventually causing him to lose faith in his own ideal and become the next body haunted by the spirit of the white knight.The various kingdoms represent different political structures and examines all of their flaws. Id like to think Ive taken the basis of these countries to their logical and somewhat absurd conclusions. The country with dragons has the typical pseudofeudal set up the country with a God obviously a theocracy inspired by ISIS but draws a lot from Asian cultures such as Chinese dynastic cycles and Tibetan Buddhists politicized religiosity all under the guise of the medieval church. But theres a third country which represents our modern liberal democratic state a blend of the US and UK where feminism is in full tilt  a matriarchy as a play on their conceptualization of the patriarchy. It tries to remain isolationist but when the war breaks out again the country is easily manipulated by Bushesque politicians to gain support for entry.Long story short war is a problem under all  major human civilizations. The th civilization is an anarchic horde of nomadic polyamorous halfdragon shifters. The real difficulty of this story is idealizing them without romanticizing them. It is not a utopia no place by any means but in avoiding the problems of political structures can at least be a eutopia good place. ,fantasywriters,cu78wzc,4,t5_2t4ad

5042381,0,t3_3jydt4,I aim to be at least kind of comical in my writing so perhaps this advice isnt flawless for you but sometimes I find the best exposition is in reaction to The Thing. So for example a citys wagemage or what have you shouts a lamp lighting warning before unleashing a massive fireball above a crowds head but they dont really react except to pull up their collars or avert their eyes as the fire sweeps over their heads to ignite the lamps.

5104019,0,t3_3kwd8f,The biggest question with time manipulation has always been how the author handles paradox. In your story Nior meets himself but also kills himself. Does that mean that once he sees the others betrayal at the camp and starts the chain of events to get his revenge that hes inevitably going to end up dead a second time only to repeat the cycle on an endless loop?Its a clever story with good character development in a short space but I would think that to any avid reader of scififantasy the plot was telegraphed pretty early on. I held out hope that there were two timeshifters and that Nior was going to discover how to use his powers during a timebattle of some kind. But instead the instant that you mentioned that his opponent was cloaked in shadow and about his same height I had figured out where the story was headed.So then it became a question of how you would handle the paradox. Blanking Niors memory after he reads the runes was convenient but ultimately the problem comes from the first encounter between the two selves. Having Timeshifter Nior approach his past self with such naivet not thinking about his own reaction to someone coming at him him out of the darkness just rang a little false. Just like the fact that the first words out of his mouth were about the others betrayal rather than Hey guess what Im you from the future  please dont kill me.There are a lot of nuances that can be explored with time travel and I think you have the bones of a decent story but I also think the issue of paradox and of your protagonists reaction to his newfound powers needs to be addressed with more subtlety and perhaps more logic toward the character reactions.You have a good very conversational writing style but the story could use an edit especially to catch some of the subtleties that pop up if English isnt your native language. Ex log of wood is redundant since logs by definition are made of wood.I hope this story eventually finds its intended purpose. Good luck with your future writing or your past writing that was brought from the future  so hard to tell when dealing with timeshifters.,fantasywriters,cv183fu,2,t5_2t4ad

The idea is that over time the sheer number of human deaths from wars and diseases in tightly populated cities exceeded anything that had previously occurred in the natural world so the barrier between life and death weakened and fractured.

5120948,0,t3_3l4adh,Your work sounds more like what Ive heard about Malazan than GRRM.I think you definitely need feedbackcritique from people outside your social circle before you submit and you need a good query letter which doesnt tout your book as the next BIG HIT here  you need to focus on selling your story rather than someone elses. Try posting both an excerpt from your book here for feedback and a query letter  then well be able to assist you with this. Or go to rwriting where theres a more general community who run regular query letter critiques.Firstly theres a few things you need to know about the publishing industry. From a new author publishers want to see a relatively short book in the region of  words  page counts are meaningless because they dont say how big a page is so start thinking in words rather than pages  for comparisons sake though I selfpubbed a book of K words which was pp long at a normal paperback size from Lulu so you might need to think a little bit more conservatively at first before youve made the breakthrough that can stand alone as a complete story so it can be sold as a test of their investment in you with a sequel hook if you do well you will gain a fanbase and so be able to sell the rest of the series more easily but if you dont sell well then the publisher hasnt lost anything by signing you up for a longer series. The truth is that these rules can be broken in exceptional circumstances but dont go into it with the attitude that youre the best thing since GRRM try to make your expectations more realistic and get outside your social circle to do so. Anything else is a bonus even Brandon Sanderson took eighteen books to sell one and sold a standalone Elantris before getting a series greenlit with Mistborn.Selfpublishing doesnt exactly follow the same rules but as someone who does that its hard to make a huge impact. I make most of my sales through print at the moment at conventions which means I publish shorter works to keep those printing costs down and generally pass the costs on to the consumer so I get my writing out there. There are people who have made reasonable incomes selfpubbing but its something you have to be reasonably astute at business to do well in because you are still competing with the traditional publishers who largely still set the rules of the genre. Word of mouth does very little without shrewd marketing and regular engagement with people to whom youre selling a good cover and marketing platform. Being confident is great but you cant just sit back and watch copies fly off Amazon and you have an uphill battle getting into ordinary shops so you may have to go to things like conventions and spend a long time sat in the dealers room with an eyecatching display to attract passing trade.So I cant fault your enthusiasm  but its going to be hard work and you may need to make some accommodation with the publishers on this one. I would recommend certainly that you try to get your first book into K words as a story that can standalone fairly well and when you do approach publishers dont give them any BS just give them the hook of your novel the synopsis and trade mostly on the strength of the story and any other actual publishing credits rather than my friends love this. Be enthusiastic  but be realistic at the same time.,fantasywriters,cv39ltl,1,t5_2t4ad

5343478,0,t1_cvun09n,Distinct difference is something a perspective character might notice certainly my Dostoyevskian student might consider his landlady beneath him because she was a redhead from the minor Russian nationalities and mention with contempt the ginger Udmurt who keeps knocking at his door demanding that he gives her her rent or shell feed him to Satan. Of course there are also times when someone might recognise someone else from another place  my student might have met a charming young lady on the street and then recognise her dark curls when she turns up in his courtyard hanging out her laundry. She might recognise his shoulderlength blond hair.I have a slight awkwardness about describing peoples skin colour because sometimes it gets a bit analytical  Id much rather emphasise a difference in culture or put the reader into the atmosphere of a culture where everyone is nonwhite say one based on the Middle East or East Asia and describe that than subject nonwhite characters to the sort of examinatory gaze that could tip over into objectifcation. But good description creates an atmosphere through the eyes of a character not painting me a detailed but outofcharacter image that takes up too much time and doesnt go anywhere. When I describe I take what is most important for the perspective character  for instance he notices a foreign guest in his lieutenants cabin and clues into the amount of jewellery he wears on his suit and his flippant attitude towards magic rather than giving us a full portrait. Likewise on board a ship with a lot of different nationalities amongst the crew a captain might single out a Xian or a Yian by their skin colour or their hair colour or whatever but he wouldnt stand on the deck and describe his crew one by one telling us that soandso had red hair soandso was darkskinned and soandso was wearing a green tunic just to fill in the details for a reader. That could get tedious particularly repeated throughout the book for each new character or location.Get into character and tell me what they notice rather than feeding me a laundry list of detail that they wouldnt notice. Its not difficult to feel whats relevant and whats not after a while and its smoother to read in general. Its fair enough that people say they want to know what colour a characters hair is but its generally up to the writer to make this as seamlessly integrated into the story as possible. A lot of fantasy fiction depends so much on character impressions and perspectives that its hard to do fixed laundrylist descriptions of people or places without it feeling dry and uninteresting. The secret is to try and mix it into the narrative so that people get the general idea but are still seeing things directly from the perspective of the character.I think the best way to explore this is to read a few modern books and see how much information the author actually gives you and how they do it. I have read very few recent books where a characters appearance has been explained fully  its usually a few details here a few details there so you get some idea of what they look like  but you dont tend to get exhaustive descriptions of everyone and everywhere.,fantasywriters,cvuosu3,2,t5_2t4ad

5352001,0,t3_3o30sa,Here is my rewrite of your first paragraphs and comments below.Blood Sweat and ThornsThorns pierced Tanions arms.  Their needles drew blood but not fear.  Fear drew panic and he forced his athletic body through the underbrush.  High brambles ripped into his face but his heart simply pumped harder faster and threw blood into his arteries like a general throwing battalions into a hopeless battle.Between the roars of the chasing beast Tanion thought he heard an angel plead Wait! Razor teeth however outweighed both the needle thorns and the imaginary voice.  The beast howled and the voice cried again Stop you idiot!That was no angel.  Tanion shielded his eyes and received a thorn a minijavelin through the back of his hand.  His heart said Enough and fear slided to the spectrum of desperation.  Tanion halted drew his short sword and crouched.  If the beast leaps he could gut the monster through the heart.  His blood will pour and replace my blood.CommentsI like your writing and I think you are on your track to a good novel.  That being said what I did is look at the archtype of your introduction.in medias res  youre using the Latin technique of starting in the middle of the action and I think that is fine.  Its a bit overdone however so you need to make it perfect.  Some writers rewrite the intro page  to  times.  Lets look at Star Warsthe first movie stars in the middle of a ship attack with a rebel frigate running from overwhelming odds in full danger etc etc...see how your fantasy intro has some of the same themes... I dont mean that in medias res is a bad way to intro a story but you need to do it better since everything from Star Wars to everything else uses this technique.Next I looked at the Jungian archtypes present in your writing and wanted to enhance them.  Your first archtype is the chase followed by  lethal monster pursuit followed by unknown savior followed by deus ex machina which means the character is saved by divine intervention.  All these themes are fine.What I did is use metaphors and similes to bring out the desperation in the action speed up the action and add more violence to the scene.  If someone is being chanced through brambles we need blood and thorns etc.  Finally I added a plot twist so what Tanion thought was an angel is simply someone he knows.Your final bit about the monster not being dead is a bit harder... Dont fall into the boss monster writers trap where every encounter builds and builds until the monsters get harder and harder.

5381826,0,t3_3omh28,Trying this for the first time with one of the many fantasy books in my head that never fully make it out onto the page. So itll be my first complete novel hopefully! I have very little of the worldbuilding sorted aside from a Windows Paint map halffilled in and some general ideas about the international locations. However the majority of the story is set in a huge industrial city called Thaumgert which Ive fleshed out much more. Its a kind of oddball fantasy burgeoning on dystopian fiction  which I guess arent mutually exclusive or unique. Gonna figure a lot of it out as I go. The main arc of the story revolves around Zekas absorption into the corrupt class of Thaumers basically magicians who exert power through runes scarred into their skin from the class it actively oppresses. The main themes I want to deal with identity in childhood and beyond especially through acceptance application and rejection of harmful ideology to inform the conception of the self. Sounds really pretentious I know but hopefully doesnt come across that way in the prose. Need to get disciplined though! Already have K down but thats been over two months of writing it. My main goal is just to finish. Im not sure why but I never see the actual book out to completion despite planning things out beforehand. Good luck to everyone! ,fantasywriters,cvzl7qo,2,t5_2t4ad
5425690,0,t1_cw4e3rl,I second this.  The most important part I feel is the ending.What is the main characters journey?  What is their goal?  How will they get there?  What ethical and physical challenges will they face?That and I think a story about the mom carrying her child and trying to find her place in the world would be a much better story than my baby got stolen and im trying to find himherit.Im in favor of the main character keeping the child throughout her journey because you have the present danger of always trying to guard and protect the kid in dangerous situations.  Itll also be an interesting journey for your character to learn how to be a mother and try to define what motherhood is. You can also do the classic the newborn is crying while youre trying to hide trope to add more tension.Whats more what if the tribe sends a few people after her to get the child back?  What if the mom the child was supposed to be given to was barren?  Was it wrong for your main character to leave knowing that she lacks the maturity to take care of a kid and that her baby wouldve been better off with an adopted mother?Just a thought. ,fantasywriters,cw56scd,1,t5_2t4ad

5468595,0,t3_3pz26n,I dont know why it is formatted how it is formatted but it is. Can IShould I change it? Anyways heres the rest of what I wroteTo get to the Nexicron Desert where the Temple of Kashkar supposedly is Yorin and Rolf turned their trusted steeds south out of the Mohill woods and into Nexicron. The Temple was abandoned when it was raided for a final time by the Sons of Amesakht whose religion was opposed to that of Kashkar. It was an ancient feud but this rash act of violence was unheard of. Normally it was considered taboo to attack a Temple as in every religion in Unthial Temples are sacred no matter what. These young men who swear they are protected by Amesakht will be punished if they have not already been punished. Many days of riding lay ahead of Rolf and Yorin. They used the directions from the Dark King to follow the stars and soon were in sight of the crumbling Temple. Twenty stories tall it was the ruins of a once magnificent Temple. The Sons of Amesakht had done their damage with one whole set of pillars collapsed and the northwest wall also concave. Rolf and Yorin held back and did not immediately approach. They feared that someone might be waiting for weary travelers to happen upon this place and assume it to be some type of watering hole or shelter for adventurers. This waiting someone would then strike and using the element of surprise overcome their unsuspecting subject. As Rolf and Yorin watched and slowly approached they relaxed and began to notice that they were very warm and thirsty. After riding in the heat of the desert on the backs of hot animals they had both diminished all their bodys water supply. Famished and parched they started towards the Temple first slowly but soon quickly. They needed some type of respite something to quench their thirst. Their minds were blank and they each only had one concern water. Yorin and Rolf made eye contact and Rolf said We must NOT drink the elixir it will doom us but Yorin was already staring into the enticing pool. I cannot let you do this Yorin Rolf shouted rushing over to his recent acquaintance even though I do not know you very well I know that I should not allow this! So I will not!. After saying this Rolf swung the hilt of his sword down upon Yorins forehead and rendered him unconscious. Rolf hoped that Yorin would be appreciative. He remembered what the Dark King had said to him that the elixir taunts you in ways you dont imagine before hand. Rolf filled the flask as the Dark King had asked and turned to leave. As he walked away he heard a faint cry from behind him. He looked back through a doorway at a the back of the chamber. The room with the pool in it was just an entrance there was much more to the Temple that Rolf and Yorin had not seen. It was from one of these such unexplored crevices that Rolf heard a second plaintive cry. He figured he had two hours of daylight left so he wandered back to where this cry was coming from wondering what it could involve. He drew his sword and passed into another room one where there was some light from small windows in the walls. He peered around the gloomy den and started noticing shapes and forms like those of men but not of men. As his eyes adjusted to the darkness he realized he was looking at men old weak frail men. Some seemed to only be skeletons vaguely dressed in loose skin draped with wrinkles and falling tufts of hair. They all yawned and croaked and tried to move but were too weak. Rolf recoiled when he realized what the scene he had happened upon was. He jumped back and decided it was time to leave before some tragedy claimed him. He figured that what he had witnessed was the remains of the Sons of Amesakht. They had drank the elixir and grown too weak to leave the Temple. The elixir keeps you alive but it doesnt do anything else Rolf figured and that it could lead to eternal agony in a number of ways. On the ride back to the Mohill Forest Rolf explained all of this to Yorin who was nursing a serious bruise on his forehead. He ultimately thanked Rolf for knocking him out and saving him from eternal misery. The Dark King received the flask willingly but did not drink any of it immediately. Rolf found this interesting but took no further note of the fact. The Dark King agreed to gift Rolf with a pack horse and two satchels full of Silbren Wood. As a gesture of his supreme debt to Rolf for the Elixir he gave away a sack of Silbren Seeds treasured items by the Dark Elves of Mohill. These would prove valuable to Rolf as he tried to build some wealth for himself. He rode out of the woods that day with a second horse and Yorin a man whom was lost to the Empire of Formaroth and its army. Although it had taken a fortnight longer than expected Rolf returned to John Reftar with Silbren Wood. John payed Rolf what he deserved to be payed. John was surprised that the Dark King had sent Rolf off with such a gift as a horse. The Dark Elves pride themselves on their horses for speed and silence and Rolf did not realize it fully at the time but he would learn to cherish his horse for its abilities. Rolf inquired about arboretums and went to meet with a man named Oriel the Arborist. He appraised the seeds that Rolf had been given by the elven king praising them for their rarity and quality. He payed Rolf a large bag full of coins of every denomination. Finally after being robbed and beaten he was able to buy a suit of chainmail armor a new sheath and a new sword named Nightruin. This new sword was enchanted by an ancient sorcerer allowing it to set an enemy on fire when attacking. ,fantasywriters,cwanxuo,1,t5_2t4ad

5612445,0,t3_3rzmhl,Plot needs to be front and centre  you cant really write for K words  the length of my Masters thesis which was sixty pages of doublespaced A and likely the same in paperback format  and not have anything that resembles a plot and expect a reader to continue with it. There are books where the characters are the plot of course  The Blade Itself is one and Mark Lawrences Prince of Fools is very episodic and characterfocused for much of the first third  but Joe Abercrombie does have something in there which contributes towards the books overall arc and Lawrence does have the characters going in a particular direction with particular goals.If youre at K words and dont feel youve got to the point of the book then you need to cut back K is what publishers would expect as the length of the first novel for a debut writer. You may have some interesting moments in there but if its all roleplay with no clear direction few people are going to have the patience to digest that much. Readers can see motivations clearly through the characters adventures how they react to plot stimuli etc. You may worry that they wont understand but its probable they wont understand because the motivations are meaningless without any plot or adventure and the reader struggles to retain that information rather than anything youre not telling the reader.What you have is a trunk book detailing your characters in a moreorless static situation if you literally have no plot and simply sliceoflife exposition. Use it to write a pacy adventure story  something that a reader rather than a writer would enjoy.As I said some writers have managed to put character before plot with some success even then I think Abercrombie had a solid plot with his characters obviously doing something towards an ultimate goal. His books worked because they were about engaging characters doing something interesting there werent a lot of daring do shenanigans or explosions or car chases but there was something there to keep the reader interested. But normally plot and characters need to be intertwined firmly together before a reader will put up with what they would perceive as extensive roleplay rather than an interesting novel.,fantasywriters,cwss0ir,2,t5_2t4ad

If the character is an observer of the battle it will be closer to omni but limited by the vantage point and thoughts of your MC. If it is said royal she would probably focus on the actions of her guardsmen.If omni I would follow nameless soldiers until they die then follow the soldier that killed them until they die rinserepeat. End up following one of your characters guardsman. Maybe have him get killed by an archer somewhere focus on that archer having your character in his sights and how hes about to take her out. Before he can he takes an arrow to the forehead from an archer in the fortress who sees the royal escape to safety.,fantasywriters,cww80fc,3,t5_2t4ad

Having a reader just say they lovedlikedhated I think is actually helpful. Its very broad feedback and while not very helpful on its own is very useful when you have more than one person reading your stuff. Sometimes you just need someone to say they love your work. Then you need someone who reads the more they read the better. The more they want to provide feedback the better. Im sure you know at least one opiniated person. Because that teaches you to sort through the useful stuff and the stuff you want to stand by.Look around at your family and friends. Look around at the people you come across and may only know slightly. Join a writing group online or in real life. But whatever you do be prepared for people making assumptions.

6186682,0,t3_408rie,I genuinely like the idea but as a lot of people have already pointed out theres not a lot of internal logic in the Order telling Adrianus to take Basa with them if hes not already a proven warrior.What would make more sense is for the Order to basically be desperate maybe some spiritualdivine or political pressure upon them for not being able to get the key back. Maybe even movement from the rival keyholder groups looking to somehow take advantage of the key being missing.Basically you have to define the function of the key outside of the MacGuffin trope. Do they serve an important religious or political function? Are they the main way that the temples can commune with their gods? Are there other ways to commune. How is your pantheon established which each god having a role amp function not only within the pantheon but the story itself? How do these gods shape the society of the story?Parallel to this you have to consider if Basa follows these gods or the gods of his original country? Does his beliefs or lack of cause tension with his fellow Venators?As well as clearly defining the goals amp motivations of the antagonist. Does she seek to overthrow the gods? Does she want revenge against the Venator or the political elite? She must be defined because the actions your protagonist and tritagonists are in reaction to her whims amp plans.Returning to your characters though you may want to have it that Adrianus either willingly takes him or he goes as a compromise to getting Tiberius out maybe Basa has some powers that others do not which allows him to subdue people like Tiberius?As for the th character mentioned you might want to drop the rivalcumhelper older figure trope for something more akin to the jaded master who becomes the mentor to Basa that the others are not because he does not take issue to his outsider status. Or even have the th character as another former student of Aelias who is looking to redeem himself or herself for some past sin.Youve got a lot to play with so do hope that you keep working on it.

The big climax of the entire story was Luke discovering his Jedi abilities and toppling the Empire. But this doesnt happen until the second story. And the toppling of the Empire really doesnt happen until the end of the third story. However a smaller climax does occur in the first story. That is the destruction of the Death Star. And the fallout from that climax carries the audience into the second story. So I advise you come up with some sort of minicrises for your character in the first book that will lead her to the discovery. Something to hook and lead your audience so they get a taste of your story and want to stick around for the second installment. Does that make sense?

6445763,0,t1_czlck07,The problem is the word ogre has such negative cultural connotations that you cant get away from it and the noble savage idea is also deprecated when applied to real life cultures because human cultures are complex and any look into indigenous societies reveals stuff that makes a mockery of stereotypes read up on what happened at native American feasts to the passenger pigeon while it was so abundant...there was a lot of excess in both white and native communities  they were human beings after all  and the way the indigenous peoples actually did terraform North America in various ways   is a good place to start. Yes they were brutally oppressed but that doesnt make them saints in themselves.I have a parallel Earth thing going on in my work but this is precisely why I avoided nonhumans. Because then youve got to apply a human language to a stereotype plus youve got the baggage of what ogre means in real life and in existing fantasy and that gets ugly or patronising fast.,fantasywriters,czm1604,1,t5_2t4ad
6445974,0,t3_43yqxv,I havent used any of them. Fantasy arguably more than any other other genre gives the author free reign to let their imagination go wild it seems a waste of that potential to include typical elements unless they directly serve the story. I get that for some people fantasy means elves and wizards castles and epic battles. Personally I look for stories that break that mould and try something different. If someone did something truly original with these races I might be interested but on the whole seeing elves dwarves orcs etc on a blurb is enough to make me put that book back on the shelf. If you want elves and stuff then go for it theyre just not for me.That said I agree with Mathemagics the undead arent as overdone as most other fantasy races simply because theyre often done very differently. Tolkiens undead were ghostly spirits seeking to reclaim their honour GRRMs undead are reanimated corpses that act as a ticking clock in the background of the story and Mark Lawrences undead are horrifying constructs made from multiple corpses. In each case their portrayal and role in the story is wildly different. The problem with elves dwarves orcs etc is that their cultures tend to simply be copied from The Lord of the Rings or Dungeons and Dragons. Elves are generally proud and aloof living their long lives in forests and mystical places. Dwarves live underground in vast subterranean cities and fight with axes. Greenskins tend to be tribal and warlike in nature while orcs are a corrupted version of another race. Weve seen these races countless times and while some authors add an extra quirk here or there theyre fundamentally the same a lot of the time. The undead meanwhile are a lot more varied because they dont have a traditional fantasy variant. They can be spirits walking corpses animated skeletons etc. Tolkiens version of the undead a spirit army never caught on the same way that his elves and dwarves did. The undead are also often a key part of the plot rather than simply being included to make the story more fantasyesque. ,fantasywriters,czm1yak,6,t5_2t4ad

6483272,0,t3_44fwio,Didnt like the hate my life part over n over again. Not only is it a sad opening sentence that would put me off of your book. Remember readers dont read to become sad. Also if you want to show a character that hates his life make him sit in the anvils and be grumbling to his master. That will really show us he hates his life rather than putting him in a spot he loves and have him thinking it which is not very engaging. And... If you go to your favorite spot you should usually feel cheery after being there. Thats why its your favorite.Next...You suffer from too much telling and to little showing.If you saw a guy in dark garb with a bow youd get up and say hey who are you? That gives us the info that you dont know the person and that they could be dangerous. Id highly recommend you watch some of Brandon Sanderson youtube lectures. They will cut the learning time a lot!I definitely enjoyed the idea. I dont get through most stories so I would say your flow is really good and one of your strengths.

6607620,0,t1_d02pxs6, the other half remained dormant within the sole survivor of that massacre Dante. You might want to get your own story straight. It seems the power of Tempest is constant and averaged across everyone who of the bloodline. Hence half to the big bad half to Dante. Innate in that its in his blood his genes his personality type. Whether thats how its channeled or where it resides it means its not available to everyone. The Force is innate too if its strong with this one. Archetypes arent a problem per se but they easily become flat characters that only exist to play their role. But giving them a quirk or some extreme personality or backstory doesnt necessarily make them better. It how well its integrated into the main story and how readers respond to them as characters that matters. That reminds me of the opening to the JJ Abrams Star trek reboot. And again I think that aspect is more interesting than the other elements here. But thats me. Your main character is named Dante. If thats not drawing on religious mythology I dont know what is. Hallowed obviously. Celestial tree with a fruit that heals. Even your choice to describe Aubry as angelic suggests youre drawing on various religious allusions even if youre not aware of it. Thats a tricky subject to work with since doing it poorly upsets religious readers and regardless of how its done it can label your work as a statement on religion for or against. Yeah its difficult to establish the threat without having had the bad guy around previously in a more powerful state that he can regain if not surpass. You can write about a new evil rising. You can write about a known evil inheriting power. You can write about a great power falling into the wrong hands. But its difficult to both introduce the bad guy and the power he can have without using this particular trope. It combined with other more generic things makes the whole work seem more generic. Thats why its good to be aware of this stuff when you plot the whole thing. People may complain about this trope but its both effective prevalent and successful. I dont think itll be a problem.,fantasywriters,d02s802,11,t5_2t4ad

6627897,0,t3_46gbfq,Everybody is going to have different answers for you but I can tell you whats worked for me.The first part of your question when to start writing is an easy answerright now.  Writing is a learned skill that takes practice.  The first couple of things you write are going to be shit.  You may not know it when you write it but if you were to put those pieces in a drawer and then come back to them three or four or ten years later youd cringe.  Trust me.  So with that out of the way go ahead and get started!  Its just like playing an instrument or training for a sporting event.  The sooner you get started the sooner youll get better at it.  Once you do it and do it and do it some more youll start to find your voice and skillset.The second question where to begin has a bunch of different answers.  Again what worked for meSet limits.  Dont start out trying to write an epic fantasy novel.  You wont have the skillset to do it.  People are going to argue this point below Im sure but its true.  People who want to learn the violin dont start out playing Tchaikovsky on their first day.  People just learning to write dont pen Jonathan Strange amp Mr Norrel.  And yes I know it was her debut novel but it sure as hell wasnt the first thing she wrote.  And it took her a decade.Start out writing short stories or even just scenes of dialogue.  When I started writing in middle school with a friend of mine we used to pick a single virtue honesty bravery etc. or vice treachery greed etc. and write a short story with that theme.  That taught me how to weave themes into a work.  From there you can move to write short stories with a specific plot hook in mind in this story the hero is defeated at the last moment in this story we examine peoples responses to the end of the world in this story a character is losing his mind but doesnt know it etc..  Write them and write them.  Write stories with specific challengesa story without dialogue a story without violence a story without names what have you.Once youve worked all that out youll have a pretty good idea of what youre good at and what you like to do.  And youll have a full tool kit when you go to write larger works.Writing a novel is far different than writing a short story or at least it was for me and I tried to write one for ten years before I finally didand the reason is that even after writing for years prior to that during high school and middle school I just wasnt ready to make the jump.Dont get discouraged if you dont get it right away.As a side note the importance of reading on writing cannot be overstated.  And Im not talking reading only in the genre you want to write inread all kinds of things.  Read Big Important Works and dont be afraid of them because of their reputation or their mystique.  Theres a reason classics are considered classics and theres a reason why masters are considered masters even if it isnt immediately obvious when you first begin the work.  Read Salman Rushdie.  Read Thomas Pynchon.  Read Nabokov.  Read Hawthorne and Poe and Lovecraft.  Read James Joyce.  Reading is the key to writing.PS  Other people will disagree with me on this but just remember Im right and theyre wrong.PPS  Thats a joke.PPPS  But only sort of.,fantasywriters,d04vqzq,2,t5_2t4ad

6685651,0,t3_470dv9,To get to the point that was a rough read. It was mentally exhausting to plow through all of the flowery adverbs and adjectives to try to figure out what was actually happening. And once I did I found that there wasnt much there. What I think happened was that there was a big ugly ship in orbit around Saturn with two soldiersguards inside and one of them committed suicide by taking off hishersits mask? No reader will want to work that hard for such a small payoff.I felt like I was being physically assaulted by a thesaurus which kept breaking my concentration. As a result I found my eyes glazing over before the end of every sentence. There were ornate descriptors that were mismatched with ornate descriptees lets say thats a word. There was some unusual punctuation. There were times when I couldnt tell which words were describing which things. Focusing more on nouns and verbs would help a lot.Theres an entire aside where its described to us what the walls would see if the walls could see. Say what? The third person omniscient perspective is hard enough to keep connected to readers though it can be done well. But it is not served well when another perspective layer is added to it further insulating the reader from the story theyre trying to read. The simple advice is to keep it simple. Just tell us whats happening.Whats the goal here? To write a story that people would want to read or to impress people with a peculiar type of rhetorical masturbation? I would start with a first draft that reads like a police report  just the facts  this is what happened this is where it happened this is who it happened to. If its a good story you can begin filling it out with later drafts and trimming it back down with drafts after those. If you feel the need to bury it in an avalanche of flowery prose it probably means that you feel like the story cant stand on its own. In that case Id examine the story itself to find whats not working instead of trying to camouflage it with wordplay.,fantasywriters,d0aus55,2,t5_2t4ad

6701683,0,t1_d0c8cm2,The same can be said about wizards dragons castles horses and humans. Its better to have a familiar world with a good story than spend most of the text describing a weird world at the expense of the story. Use familiar things either traditional or easily explained as a shortcut to get ideas across to the reader. A phoenix is a familiar thing. You dont have to explicitly explain that e.g. a muarach is a large bird associated with fire and rebirth if you can just as well call it a phoenix and get the same idea across in a single word.But if they dont impact the story why are you using them at all?

6764598,0,t3_48e9pi,It doesnt sound like your use of duke is in error but its hard to say without reading the story. Different cultures in Europe and around the globe have had different names and ranking systems but I think its fair to say in general that you have the hierarchy in the correct order at least. The duke is below the king and the king is below the triumvirate presumably representing an empire. So the dukes duchy is part of the kings kingdom which in turn is part of the emperors empire. Except in place of an emperor you have a triumvirate which is fine as long as you understand that historically such governments have been unstable.But Duke and King are terms that come from a specific cultural context Medieval Western Europe so its possible youve violated the expectations of that context in other ways. You mention the king marrying the widow of the former duke and in some places and times that would have been totally fine while in others completely ridiculous. More problematic in my eyes is the use of the term triumvirate which reads Latin to me and from a very different place and time than the others. So in short I think your use of duke is fine but its your use of triumvirate thats questionable. However that said its a fantasy so who cares? Using a term from a different time and place is by no means unheard of in this genre. If you posted some writing where it shows up and asked people what they thought of how you handle such matters in the story youd probably get some more specific advice ,fantasywriters,d0j1orf,1,t5_2t4ad
6769720,0,t3_48fwe8,I think watching your children grow up having grandchildren etc would be alright. Some people seem fixated on the fact that you would have to say goodbye to them but to me it that sounds like projection. Their own fading youth their own fear of death coloring that perception. As you age I think theres a natural tendency to accept the cycle of life things come things go. As an immortal you could stay in one spot and watch the river of life float by. Its a very western thing to see death as an end I dont think it has to be like that. We are all little parts of a grander picture little winding threads being woven into the tapestry of time. Immortality would eventually grant one considerable clarity in seeing the grand design and our personal seemingly brief connections would become a natural part of lifes unending ebb and flow. I think a passionate immortal would be filled with two fundamental drives as a result of longliving. The first would be an enthusiastic embrace of the moment. You would know as a hard fact that every moment every person is fleeting. I think it would be easier to set petty fears and anxieties aside and just jump into a deep and personal relationship. There would be an urgency there a need to connect hard and fast to get the absolute most out of a relationship before its gone. The second would be the urge to push the world in the right direction. Seeing the big picture would mean that you would come to understand how each little thread can affect it. I think if the world was populated with thousands of your children and grandchildren etc you would take a personal and invested interest into how things play out. You know how you can see a family resemblance? Imagine that entire towns or parts of the world held part of your familys face. How motivated would you be to protect them? To see that they were doing well? Given that individual relationships would pass by so quickly I think you would develop bonds with a genetic archetype instead. You might have a flavour favorite and live a whole life with that person every time that particular genetic combo came around.     ,fantasywriters,d0jmn29,2,t5_2t4ad

Antagonist while I typically see it as a person or being could easily be your disease. Antagonists are just an opposing view or force against your characters.

7070139,0,t3_4cfvof,I go through this every time I open my WIP. I usually start my writing sessions by rereading what I wrote last or even going back and reading chapter one again. And again. Making tiny nonsensical changes that have no effect on my overall word count or the storys plot. Even right now I am doing this. And it gets worse when I feel I am stuck with where I am currently in my story.What advice I can maybe give and what I will be doing from now on is to just push aside everything you have already completed and start a new document for where you are currently. Then when you finish that chapter add it to your completed MS and go back to a blank document to type the next one. I might even save my completed chapters onto a flash drive and leave it at home and start new documents on my laptops hard drive. The importance of the first draft is to get your story down on paper. All of it. Then once you have that you can go back and add more to scenes and rewrite scenes you didnt like but doing that now will only slow you down. Push forward!

7474298,0,t3_4he3f2,Heres something that I typed up really quickly. Its not anything that I wrote for any particular story Im working on but I figured this could be a fun exercise.gtMira studied her captors as they marched her and the other prisoners towards the looming iron gates of Fiore. In the gloom of the early morning she could make out twenty of them wielding halberds and wearing the steely iron masks of the Lawspeaker. Too many. She had considered going for the dagger in her boot but the thought left her quickly. To take on a justicar of the Lawspeaker let alone twenty was suicide. She couldnt have anyway bound in chains as she was as were the nine others locked in the iron cage with her. Mira was crammed into one corner another womans elbow digging into her ribs while a man curled up beside her and wept into his hands.gtMira inched away from the womans elbow chains rattling and turned to her. Do you know where theyre taking us?gtThe woman stared straight ahead with dead grey eyes.gtMira tried again. The way I see it theyre probably going to take us to an inquisition. Or an execution. Or possibly an inquisition followed by an execution. Im not sure though the Lawspeaker isnt one togtA justicar moved closer to the cage gripped her halberd and whacked Mira in the head with the wooden end. Dhsa no eldraan! Nacroghash da meerlan! Her voice was sharp and clear even through the iron mask.Mira winced gritting her teeth. She didnt understand most of the justicars words save for one Nacroghash. Necromancer.        gtShe tugged at her wrist manacles the suppression runes on them glowing as she moved. No use trying that here then. There were no bodies around either none that she could see. Even if there were she doubted they wouldve done much good against the plate armor the justicars wore especially ones carved with protective runes. Seeing no means of escape Mira could do nothing but sit and wait.        gtSo she waited. And waited. And waited. They had arrived at dawn before them a line of people twisting and winding all the way to the gates of the city. Merchant caravans barefooted pilgrims men women and children from all over Nedara. For what seemed like hours they waited to move to the gates. By the time they got there the sun soared high above the walls.gtYa uln ne! Ya uln ne! a plateclad guard shouted as he and three others pounded the ends of their halberds on the ground. On the battlements above Mira could see four others wielding firelances the sunlight reflecting off the thick metal tubes. One of the justicars stepped forward exchanged some words with the guards and in the next instant they went through.     ,fantasywriters,d2rs7s8,2,t5_2t4ad

Your personal life will have no change regardless of whether you understand gravity or not. Gravity is something that affects everyone but peoples opinions on it are irrelevant.Were talking art here. If the heros journey applies to literally everything in fantasy literature. Then discussing it is as productive as discussing whether a story needs conflict or not.If that is the case then what we think of it is absolutely worthless. Our opinion has no bearing on things that we cannot change and are just set in stone by default. If the answer isnt ambiguous then the discussion will go nowhere. Its not a discussion.Understanding what the heros journey entails is also pointless because if it is present by default we are writing it by default. If throughout history that has been a pattern then it is interesting but absolutely useless to your craft as a writer.It is the same as having characters it is the same as having conflict a plot and a story.Its like having tropes in your work you will have them whether you like it or not.Therefore if we assume that the Heros journey is a default and it is present one way or another. It is not a useful topic of discussion. Itll go nowhere.If you want to study culture and story telling in history then that has absolutely no place in this sub. This is more of a matter of sociology and psychology rather than writing at this point.Understanding patterns and things people have done with their writing throughout the ages will not make you a better writer. In fact contrary to what you said. Knowing psychology and sociology will in fact make for better sells which doesnt mean automatically good writing. Sales are a very sketchy thing to base quality on when it comes to art. But were writing the stories we want to write.Essentially. To put it short. If we assume that the heros journey is a default in storytelling then it is a moot discussion to have. You cannot discuss it. You can just retell facts and explain it. Thats not a discussion. There is no debate. There is no opposition. Contrarians and idiots do not count as opposition. So were trying to discuss whether water is wet. There MUST be room for opinion. Water is wet. There is  room for opinion here.I am going off the assumption that the heros journey is present no matter how or what you write. Where is the room for discussion here?,fantasywriters,d3p5zyd,-5,t5_2t4ad
7772861,0,t3_4lrzf5,gtSupernatural AidgtOnce the hero has committed to the quest consciously or unconsciously his guide and magical helper appears or becomes known. More often than not this supernatural mentor will present the hero with one or more talismans or artifacts that will aid him later in his quest.gtCampbell For those who have not refused the call the first encounter of the hero journey is with a protective figure often a little old crone or old man who provides the adventurer with amulets against the dragon forces he is about to pass. What such a figure represents is the benign protecting power of destiny. The fantasy is a reassurancepromise that the peace of Paradise which was known first within the mother womb is not to be lost that it supports the present and stands in the future as well as in the past is omega as well as alpha that though omnipotence may seem to be endangered by the threshold passages and life awakenings protective power is always and ever present within or just behind the unfamiliar features of the world. One has only to know and trust and the ageless guardians will appear. Having responded to his own call and continuing to follow courageously as the consequences unfold the hero finds all the forces of the unconscious at his side. Mother Nature herself supports the mighty task. And in so far as the heros act coincides with that for which his society is ready he seems to ride on the great rhythm of the historical processgtI think if you study the mythos of the supporting character you will figure out what you want. But you indecision... you really need to study what you want from your book on a whole and what messages are you trying to potray. You need to look at the big picture and once you do the answers will be pretty obvious. Each of the characters you describe represents different things but they are all of the supernatural category. But they also have spefefic meaning which take on a larger message in the book. A Dragon represents sometimes for example absoulute greed and what it does for people as hoarders piling up gold. Sometimes they are just a force of natural in books they are just a source of evil like the devil. In modern lit maybe the dragon is just another sorcer or socreress who lives long. IE the mythical beast turned into a merlin or gandalf type character for whatever reason. gtMy other ideas I had would be an angel a demonIs the main character religious? Does god what the main character to succeed? Does the devil want to the main character to succeed? Angels and Demons are generally very subverisent. The whole book will put into an entirely different context if a angel helps the MC out or the Devil.  I will say something else though before i continuegtThe personthingcreature would work as a benchmark that generally stays the same strength throughout the storyat the beginning the others might be far weaker than it. Eventually maybe they are at the same strength. Finally the main character would be above it. This is a terrible idea. Its a terrible idea because you are making a character that does not grow at all you are making a wooden sort of guide character that basically helps the hero out and does nothing else with their life and has no other ambitions or goals. To think of a character as a benchmark is horrible. Do you want to be considered a benchmark to your friends? Well I helped my friends out through college and then they got jobs like me and then one of them now owns a business! And you want to make a dragon or demon character who are generally power hungry just to let this happen?You can make wooden character whatever but arcs are much much better. You point at any supporting character in literature and often times they have their very own arcs and sometimes end up much better than the MC. Supporting characters dont carry the weight of the MC with having flaws heros journey and all that and generally can do very interesting things once their role is done. Also you have good ideas here but you are just ingoring them because you think its diffcultgtMain requirement is I do want the personthingcreature to be fine in normal society doesnt just cause chaos by being there. Could mean it is not using its full power or that it is just a normal being. By what would be normal generally most humanoid creatures. Therefore a dragon in dragon form or a golem or some sort of other creature or being would not work. Why not have a dragon or golem amongst humans? Why not see thier conflict of humanities reactions to these things?You probably have very good reasons why not but you need to think of the mindset of Drama! and what causes trouble for the hero and the guardian. That things that occur should not be And then but rather To make things even worse...  The supernatural aid almost always comes after the refusal of the call. Its the trickster or the annoying wizard luring in the hero with promises of grand adventure and character realization. And when you talk about guardians like Dragons Golems Demons AngelsWizards...there is a very deal with it attitude going with most of them that are super powerful. Like a dragon wizard could probably destroy human city if she wanted to.gtthey would grow too much in their magical power such that they would take away from the main character.Again thats conflict! thats the stuff you need to look for and the characters needs to deal with when they hit that crossroad. People do like when its bad guys vs good guys...but they love when its good guys vs good guys as well. Many stories are just dramas and dramas often dont have bad guys but rather characters dealing with each other as they try to accomplish their goals. Personally I would make an Angel Dragon Wizard because that sounds pretty cool. Or a Demon that tells the hero he is doing a good job on quest that seems like a good and honorable quest and it makes the hero question what the fuck is going on. ,fantasywriters,d3ppmor,4,t5_2t4ad

If that use of destitute is deliberate Im afraid it didnt do it for me personally.I would be tempted to work more on the symbols to bring out that mental image more  i.e. the tree of life the trees roots the heros veins the different generations grandfathergrandson i.e. echoes of a family tree in the figurative as well as the literal sense maybe the pencil and the book can be made more treelike.In short though yes Im intrigued but I think it needs to be more polished to pull someone in and its really too short to make any real judgment on how likely Id want to read on to the end of the chapter  book.,fantasywriters,d3zyfex,1,t5_2t4ad

7918153,0,t1_d45zf5k,I too hate overlystuffy academic works. I love high literature as much as the next person but my favorites tend to err on the side of stuff like The Count of Monte Cristo and One Hundred Years of Solitude. And of course I love science fiction and fantasy. The garbage shat out by Continental Philosophers literally makes me want to vomit and some of the type of novels you mentioned make me squirm. Its just masturbation for masturbations sake. One of my favorite novelists however is Virginia Woolf. Her works tend to be postmodern structurally wise she wrote an entire book of various streamofconsciousness voices which meld into one another called The Waves and rich with lush prose. Gene Wolfe hailed as one of the greatest living science fiction and fantasy writers I also love. He writes with dense prose oftentimes full of antiquated words particularly his Book of the New Sun series to conjure up worlds in which the only anchor the reader has is the narrative voice he is also known for his unreliable narrators who gloss over certain crucial events or leave questions unanswered. With many of his works the reader is forced to do guess work and some even take multiple rereads to get the full meaning. Neither of the above I think upon reading them were pretentious well maybe Wolfes Fifth Head of Cerberus though I still liked it They use lyrical prose uncommon narrative styles and often very big words. If I ever write a book it will very likely not be in this style. But its something I like and I wanted to try my hand at it. There is some ambiguity because its a local legend and subtlety to it and maybe you might have to read it twice though the story is quite simple. I hate all manner of pretentious storytelling but I dont hate subtle storytelling. I was trying to emulate a style and some readers dont like it then thats fine. ,fantasywriters,d462pz9,2,t5_2t4ad

8071089,0,t3_4ppud0,Tolkien is a fascinating visionary.That being said he is an absolute garbage imo story teller as another comment here said. I think that part of the reason he was so successful was because he brought something new to the world. He envisioned things to such a great and wonderful detail and such an immersive world where it felt truly alive and for that I believe he was praised.I read a whole lot of other fantasy before LOTR. The first true fantasy novel I really got into was Harry Potter. Harry Potter is fascinating in its own right too because it really just changed the way that people saw the wizards. Even now theres still Harry Potter copycats left and right.I think where you get into true success is when you truly change the way that the world sees something like a wizard or the introduction of elves goblins orcs etc. and you make it truly believable. It is much harder in todays age where we are constantly overloaded and bombarded with everything. I have a theory that nothing will ever be as big as LOTR or Harry Potter again because back then the internet didnt realllly exist.Anyways the Hobbit is a fantastic read I thought. e idk if I really answered your question. He did great in coming up with something new and was great in concept building. He did awful in writing another example of this is  shades of grey smh.

8306892,0,t3_4t9j6q,First off and this is a purely stylistic thing but maybe you should ease up on the adjectives and adverbs. It makes the writing feel stuffy but thats just my opinion and others may like it. The majestic figure of the eagle the gleaming surface etc. I feel like I dont need to know that the doorbell ringing creates a pleasant melody for example. But again thats just me and others may not mind.Also Id avoid forcing awkward moments of exposition in the narration. Like when they go out to the horse and carriage you take an entire  lines to talk about how there are automobiles in your world and there was this inventor who also invented the light bulb and the locomotive. I dont see that as entirely necessary to whats going on at the moment and it takes away from whats happening during the scene. If you want to establish that electricity and cars exist in your world it might be better to bring it up via dialogue or have a character interact with the device in question at some point. Like where the delivery guy gets on the car and drives off? Thats where you could have done that explaining maybe. Since rich people only go to this carnival also bring up how rich people only drive this automobile that the delivery guy is driving.Be careful with using realword terms in your fantasy world. My mind goes to where you used Ferris Wheel in the commercial. The Ferris Wheel is named after a person in our world named George Washington Gale Ferris Jr who invented it. Does this person exist in your world? If not try for a different name.There are a couple awkward grammatical things but I think we all do that and its an editors job to fix that because we arent perfect.As for the actual storyworld Im not sure if Im snagged. Your protagonist I guess I like because hes a good guy who takes care of orphans and I feel like we dont have enough just generally good protagonists anymore but be careful you dont go into Mary Sue territory. I rolled my eyes when you mentioned that he was smart and athletic and has beautiful blue eyes but people didnt like him because he was shythats a little cliche to me. I also dont like The story begins with our hero dreaming about being a hero and then waking up to his normal life.Whats the overarching conflict? And I ask this in terms of the world and the protagonist. You hint at this goblin who stands falsely accused and possible on and off interspecies war but theres nothing in the first chapter that hints at the idea that some major shit may be going down in the future. What does Dante want out of life? In a weird way this chapter kind of reads like a whole lot of nothing a day in the life sort of thing. Even if everyone around him dies the reader may not be invested enough to continue reading until that happensyou should use some good oldfashioned foreshadowing or some proper exposition to let us know that these cute little orphans are eventually fucked. The mystery of someone buying him a ticket to this festival is good at least but like I said I dont feel snagged or particularly compelled to invest myself in this world youve created.Id be interested in reading your original Chapter  if it introduces us to some of the more interesting concepts of your world the conflict and the antagonists.Keep writing.,fantasywriters,d5fx2a5,2,t5_2t4ad
8341776,0,t3_4ttpub,Please take my critiques with a grain of salt and know that Im not trying to be rude or harsh with anything I say  I just happen to be known for being a difficult proofreader and I tend to be picky. My first impression this is the kind of book that I would pick up in the library read a chapter and then put back on the shelf. Let me explain. The first page even wasnt too smooth to read. We see the MC casting a spell but it took me a reread to understand that was what was happening  as a reader Im new to the world and dont understand the parameters nor the cost for casting magic so Im starting off a little lost until I can figure it out a bit. Theres also an issue with saying too much at once I think  pointing out her brownish hands her negative thoughts toward an ex the fact that she stole the magic book it all feels like its trying too hard to build the world all at once especially since we get a more natural introduction to these things with the dialogue later. Its probably not necessary and just makes it more confusing this goes for a lot of this so I wont touch on it again. Youve got pages and pages to show the reader your world dont do too much in the first chapter.Then the character  who has been speaking to herself aloud which feels like a tell dont show situation when it should be opposite  is put into a Tense Situation. I know its supposed to be a Tense Situation because were told again not shown that she might be in danger but I dont really care because Ive just met her two pages ago and nothing shes done has any context for me. At this point the MC switches back and forth between angry to tired to scared to angry within a few paragraphs and with little provocation that I as a reader have context for. Even the line about the troll raping a woman doesnt give much reason for me to worry about the new creature in front of MC because without good context for the tensionprejudice between magical creatures and humans in this world I know that humans rape too and it seems like theres no reason for MC to immediately jump to that conclusion. The next lines just back up my feeling that this is a wild conclusion to immediately jump to Trolls are Rudelings. My city is at war with Rudelings. There is a Rudeling spying on me at three in the morning on the Carved Mountainwhere I have never ever come across another person before. What else could you possibly be here for?About a million other things actually including the illegal activities that MC is doing  it just seems inconsistent unless we find out later that MC has had unsavory experiences of the sort before if this is the case then she would have a more intense reactionwouldnt give up the accusation so easily. Ill stop here because Ive just about covered my issues with it so far. To recapYou seem to tell rather than show a lot. Instead of saying Jane was tired maybe try Janes limbs were heavy with the weight of repeated spellcasting.It feels like the pilot episode of a TV show that has to set up backstory on every character all at once. But you dont need to do that here even making small changes to the sentence structure and flow could make a huge difference with this. I dont get Jane. At all. Her moods snaps back and forth erratically her motivations seem shaky her attitude is frankly frustrating to try to read and understand. For example she immediately assumes that shes going to be attacked by the Rudeling attempts to kill it and then pulls a complete  in the course of a few sentences she just instantly lets go of prejudice that has readers have been led to believe been ingrained in her society  in her  for years and has even led to a war. I know the idea is to draw a parallel between racism and the divide between humans and Rudelings but jeez no one not even the most openminded individual gets over ingrained stuff like that in a minute. She can still accept that shes not in danger still ask for him to teach her but at least let her struggle between what shes been taught and whats she experiencing for a few more pages.Whew I hope that didnt get too wordy and again I dont mean to sound overly harsh. Feel free to ignore any of what Ive said and let me know if you want clarification. Best of luck!,fantasywriters,d5k9y4n,4,t5_2t4ad

8471118,0,t3_4vp42i,First character Serana Red Velson Ok Serana  or Red each character of the scout group is bestowed an ironic nickname by her is as previously described the foulmouthed leader of a ragtag scouting group. Initially shes presented as abrasive eccentric and very volatile and impulsive. Her larger than life personality is what makes her the leader however. She gets shit done and she does it well. In the initial arc shes established as the person above pioneering in numerous expeditions and keeping morale high in dark times. As it progresses however and two of the group die in what can only be described as a negotiation with demons going to shit she takes a turn for the worse. She becomes more distant and brooding her jesting insults becoming all too real and her nature slowly degenerating as shes worn down. This occurs about halfway through. Now established as an antihero of sorts she becomes more merciless detached and seen as less of a lead figure. In the climatic battle she forges a path of blood and gore only to be struck down at the last moment.Presumed to be dead she was riddled with bullets she wakes up in a medical room noting people are acting distant despite an impossible recovery. She learns from another character that she survived by displaying the regenerative powers of a demon. As shes left pondering this she truly shuts off holing up in her room as she simply loses her sense of self. In another characters POV she is found dead in the last page of the book crucified and with her heart torn out. This is the only way to kill a demon.As a cynic perpetuating the facade of a nihilist Red established a great relationship with a pair of siblings in the group known as Craft and Honey real names never revealed. When they die this triggers her degeneration. With the rest of the crew she is just idolised and throughout the whole settlement she is seen as a force of resistance. Her best friend in the group is an insomniac called Drowsy who essentially anchors her during her phase of sadness. Her final notable relationship is actually with the abomination whos called Abaddon. Both bare a similar outlook on life being extremely morbid about it. They just sort of click and all facades are dropped when they speak alone which is on a few ocassions.,fantasywriters,d60fhr4,1,t5_2t4ad

8528173,0,t3_4wcnos,There are a few things that are really important to consider when writing about a topic as heavy as incest. Ill try to keep this from rambling too much but here goes. . When writing about a topic as intense as incest you have to have a really good reason. People often put very sensitive topics into their works for shock value to or try and prove a point that can be made in a different way. For example if you really want to portray this brothers obsession simply having him be jealous of time or connections your MC makesspends with others. Have him be violently overprotective or hostile to the love interest simply because he doesnt think she understands what the MC has gone through or because he sees her as unworthy for some other reason. . Write as if a broad variety of people might read this story. That includes both survivors of incestuous abuse and people who get off on it. Im not really sure which is worse but when exploring complex topics you have to be really careful about who you might either harm or attract in throwing it in. . I cant really pinpoint why your only mentioned case of same sex attraction in your story being incestuous and unhinged leaves a bad taste in my mouth but its there all the same.And finally while unrelated I would avoid killing off the love interest. Regardless of why it happens the trope of female characters being killed off to further the emotional pain and development of their male leads is overused to the point of being exhausting. ,fantasywriters,d67l2t6,1,t5_2t4ad

8576574,0,t3_4x8r5m,I dont think its the chosen one trope that youre trying to avoid here but some of the other tropes which come alongside it. What youre describing sounds exactly like the chosen one a character with a unique ability who also happens to be in the right position to fulfill the plot. He may not have been prophesied but something whether it was the gods fate or the author have still manipulated things so the right person is in the right place at the right time  he was chosen.Not that theres anything wrong with what youre trying here though. I like a lot of what it sounds like youre trying to do here. Especially getting rid of the prophecy theres too much prophecy in fantasy.There are a couple of things Id like to comment on howevergt Orri...shows no signs of magic at all until he is  and even then its like small gold speckling in random parts of his body... gt No one at this moment is worried about it being Eralis because the way it has manifested in the past was with the person being completely overrun with glowing gold symbols etc and it is heard of for people to develop slightly later.If both of these are true then I see some problems with attempting to avoid everyone knowing what is going on. I think if everyone knows about the gold markings then it would be fairly obvious he probably has this power. They would be watching him very closely to see if he has Eralis or something else equally as dangerous and treating him very carefully in case he did. This is going to make it obvious to him that there is something special which is obviously what youre trying to avoid.I would make it much more subtle. If you dont make it somehow much less obvious the reader is probably going to wonder why the people of this world are so stupid that they havent already figured this stuff out.gt Something i really want to avoid is the harry potter thing where EVERYONE knows who he is he doesnt have a regular school or home life at all.This is actually kind of funny to me because Rowling was breaking a part of the chosen one trope here. Before Harry Potter it was normal for the characters to not find out they were the chosen one until well into the series. A good example comes from the Belgariad series by David Eddings older than  years ago so spoiler rules do not apply where it wasnt revealed that the main character was the chosen one until halfway through the series  only two or three characters knew it before that. Rowling was playing around with this trope by letting the other characters know about it and talk about it in front of Harry in the beginning. And considering the circumstances it would have been weird and stood out to the reader if the other characters hadnt known or hadnt treated him special.gt I also want to avoid the LOTR style thing where hes destined for it but hes extremely unpreparedno one thinks he can make it.I dont think that was the case in LOTR at all. There was no destiny and a lot of characters agreed with Gandalf that a hobbit was the right person for the job or the fellowship wouldnt have happened. So Im not exactly sure what about the LOTR you are trying to avoid. Note that there is no real chosen one in LOTR either Frodo wasnt the only one who could have destroyed the ring he was just the only one in the right place and the right time to do it. Gandalf said a hobbit was the best choice but that still applies to a lot of people. It could have been destroyed by Sam Merry Pippin even Rosie Cotton for all we know. The only reason it fell on Frodo was because Frodo already had the ring. ,fantasywriters,d6dnl7j,4,t5_2t4ad

8774233,0,t1_d72exrl,Thank you for this wonderfully detailed response! All of this is very good advice. I do understand the importance of character driven narrative and Im still very much fighting against the walls of my own amateurism so I hope youll bear with me.The problem here is that Im actively rebelling against some of these tenets and I would like to open a case that it might not be a bad thing if I may. My influences of late have been of the third person omniscient variety such as Steinbeck and I feel like it is not an impossible fit for fantasy. Not that I want to write an entire story like this it was my thought to open the book or several chapters with a broadstroke painting before dissolving into the character narrative. I dont think this is impossible or something that should be dismissed out of hand. Prose itself can be rewarding for its word choice and the concepts evoked. A good metaphor a sly nod toward irony any number of things can make something worth reading even without a character. It was in this context that I was hoping to be evaluated. Please dont think Im an ungrateful receiver of criticism Ive already forced at least one person to quite after two sentences so Ive obviously failed.If I were to invoke famous books of my own the one that I have most in mind for this style would be Heinleins Stranger in a Strange Land. He begins by stating that The first expedition to Mars was selected on the theory that the greatest danger to man was man himself. He goes on to use not two large paragraphs but the first two pages to describe a failed expedition to mars in omniscient in which there are no characters that are involved in the rest of the book. Considering it is the modus operandi of literary criticism to scream showdonttell at every opportunity I suspect this book would be torn apart if he were to post it looking for constructive feedback today yet it is engaging to read. That first sentence is an insidious hook a clever statement on the nature of humanity that is expounded upon as he dryly explains how it is overcome by the mission parameters and it works perfectly well to grab a reader.  Even beyond the opening Heinlein continues to open chapters with cosmically broad strokes sometimes using completely unrelated events for nothing more than set dressing sometimes pointedly describing the death of a bitcharacter in newspaperheadline style. Little if any of this has any relevance to the characters driving the story but it works every self contained detail interesting or clever enough to stand on its own as a conceptually appetizing nugget.Obviously I havent managed to do this but I hope you can understand where Im coming from I made a conscious decision to use this style and wanted to know if the prose was fit to carry it but instead I am only told that the decision itself was wrong. But I know it can be done! When I wrote that it should be natural that curiosity should win out I was hoping that it would be read as a clever comment on the nature of humanspresumptive of me I knowand that it might evoke the visages of frustrated conservatives in the face of changing times. Did I fall flat in that effort? Is there a way I could achieve that goal? Thats the kind of feedback Im looking for. I wanted this to be taken at face value as a characterless opening and whether or not it might be conceptually or linguistically interesting or how I might make it so. Trust that I do intend to write the vast majority of my material with character focus but I cant accept that it is impossible to stray from this for more than a sentence or twonot when that would invalidate so many of my own favorite books.,fantasywriters,d72g279,1,t5_2t4ad

8799659,0,t1_d75j12l,Because I like numbers I did some calc stuff. I now have a simple population growth formula using a few of the previously suggested numbers.With numbers roughly representative of the western world I made it from a generation of  couples to a generation of a population of one million in around  years.With numbers representative of your year lifespan I count each couple would have  kids that grow to adulthood proportions of pregnancynonpregnancy per woman the same as in the western approximation and the size of a generation would reach a million after  years. Thats in about  and a half generations. And it just keeps exploding from there. Lets reduce the number instead.With  kids per couple were looking at about  years for a generation population size of M just shy of  generations. With  kids something like  years  generations.  kids  years ish generations.  kids  years  generations.  kids ish years  generations. Thats assuming an equal distribution of male and female offspring. If you want to skew the gender balance halve the number of kids and assume were counting towards k women.These are sizes of generations not total population count which would include previous generations which can go back many generations depending on lifespans. But since generation would be counted between average age of childbirth it might not inflate the numbers too much.This should give you some idea of the amount of history and population youve got room for without wars and other ways to control your population. Though if those measures dont prevent women from having children e.g. the killing of all men in a defeated region it might not affect the birth rate and thus not generation size growth.,fantasywriters,d75lkwq,1,t5_2t4ad

And there were just too many epic high fantasies and as a writer I really didnt know where to explore so that I could call a story my own. After that I stared wondering about small scales novels where there is a large world at there but the events in the story  arent so large. Thats what I started writing and I like it better.

9118577,0,t3_5564ud,It is awkward since its used for inanimate objects. I would just use he. Historically speaking that is the pronoun most used in the situation. You could also use she similar to how ships are universally considered female in Wstern civilization. Consistently using they for a specific individual would be very confusing IMO. Heres the other thing. Does it matter at all to your story that this dragon is nongendered? Are all Dragons nongendered in your world? Do dragons come from a distinct evolutionary line that never evolved sexual reproduction? Does a huge plot point revolve around the fact that this dragon or all dragons are nongendered? Is this a well known fact in your world and unlikely to come up in conversation in he same way that we dont bother to point out that horses come in two genders? If you dont mention this fact at all and just call the dragon he or she and dont dig any further into the semantics is it going to harm your story?Unless theres a compelling reason to bring it up it might not even be worth mentioning this fact just for brevitys sake. The strongest thing for your writing might be to simply choose a pronoun and not go into dragon husbandry unless its absolutely necessary.,fantasywriters,d87wle3,4,t5_2t4ad
9122148,0,t3_5564ud,In my science fantasy work nonbinary people are an accepted and common part of society. Ive found very little problems with using they as singular they is both generally understandable and has been in use for quite a while to describe someone of unknown gender. You may end up having to shift your words around to avoid confusion  instead of they for multiple people I find myself using The group actioned or similar usage. I also like to use themself to fit with himself and herself.Using he or she has too much connotations with the gender binary and will bring associations of gender roles to the readers mind. It tends to be dehumanising as it is also used for objects and animals though if you want to portray the dragons as alien or inhuman it could work. Other pronouns run the risk of being too underused in the real world and may be distracting to the reader.,fantasywriters,d88c00v,2,t5_2t4ad

9976845,0,t3_5iddhv,What you want to do is mention the propaganda not in great detail but in passing. It should be an ordinary and normal thing to people unless its new in which case it should be noteworthy. If its not new and novel they will see it and continue on past. Blend it in as a sidedetail rather than as the main focus.Examplegt Shen dragged the collar of her coat up around her neck as she crossed the plaza. Winter had come down hard that year freezing the city ponds and turning the sewers into tracks of solid grime. Above the plaza a huge mural on the wall of Parliament House showed the Chancellor smiling down from above great red letters that read Do The Right Thing  Report A Red Today. He didnt seem to be feeling the cold up there dressed for a summer that felt a thousand months away. She wondered whether the man the mural represented felt the cold at all either.The trick is not to throw it into the face of the reader by making it subtle. Here the story is developing because we learn that its winter and we learn something about the Chancellor no doubt some kind of antagonist. The propaganda message is not used simply to show that theres propaganda but as character building for the Chancellor and by showing Shens dislike we learn something about her too.Repetition of the same messages will help too. If Report a Red is shown on coffee mugs on the side of a bus tattooed across the moon then readers will pick up on the feeling of having messages thrust upon them.,fantasywriters,db80efc,6,t5_2t4ad

When I mean signs I mean medical signs. A sign is a very welldefined technical term then a hint is just your everyday sign. A medical sign is swelling rash sneezing etc etc.Zoran realizes she is possessed thanks to his experience just by the way she acts. He has something called a clinical eye which enables health professionals to recognize diseases at an almost intuitive level. This is all from HIS POV. Everything revealed about the girl is his conclusion. He realizes why she is acting like that she realizes she is a prostitute. People dont know she is infected. They just know that something is wrong with her by the way she is acting. They dont know she is contagious they just feel something is wrong with her but are not sure what.Ok so that is what I wanted to convey and most clearly didnt do it successfully.

10200198,0,t3_5lycux,Perhaps I have missed something in the development of modern writing but I dont understand a Chapter . If you have a prologue it is a prologue...I have to say no Im afraid I would not keep reading. Your sentence construction problems are interfering with comprehension. You would need to improve these before I felt inclined to read more than a page. But that does not mean I wouldnt encourage you to keep writing work on improving and enjoy what you are doing. Browse other critiques here for advice and especially see if that advice can be applied to your own writing.As uDiis says you have structural issues here that need addressing. While not all of us have perfect grammar and punctuation you have quite a few problems here. Reading is a way of learning good construction and I recommend that for you. Someone has put some good examples on your document but if you need more consider thisgtJames yelled he chased Lucy through the dusty streets of their village  nipping between houses under carts as she broke away the pair called out  to slow down but Lucy continued to fly like the wind her long chestnut coloured hair flowing behind her. He... is a new sentence. You would need and to continue on this sentence. Read this sentence out loud and see if you can do it in one breath. This can indicate the sentence is too long. Consider what you are trying to say and the flow of sentences building up your image.Who are the pair? James is chasing Lucy noone else is mentioned in this sentence.gtnipping between houses under cartsBecause you have left out the comma between houses and carts it now reads as if the houses are under the carts. Technically Lucy is running like the wind unless she is actually flying which is possible in a fantasy story.This is actually a nice image but needs tidying up for it to be more interesting and have more impact.Keep working keep reading look at advice and practice. If you love writing you will get there. ,fantasywriters,dc08zmb,2,t5_2t4ad
10202318,0,t1_dc0g8hp,Okay. I looked quite closely at the first two pages mostly looking at content structure and clarity. Considering the premise well I cant see anything wrong with the idea so far. But you are doing two things consistently that is spoiling a reader understanding and enjoying your tale.Telling not showing. And you do it waaaaay too briefly. Youll see where I have indicated this. Sentences actions descriptions are floating around in space with no connection to anything else in the scene. And this is basically your second problem. There is a lack of content and flow in your ideas and description. We bounce around from idea to idea with little to connect them and not enough info to understand how they are connected. There is some good stuff here dont get me wrong. But grab a paragraph or two from your favourite book work out where they put and think about why they do that. Look at the subjects of the paragraphs and how we know automatically which subject they are talking about in each sentence. I dont claim to be an expert on sentence structure but have a look at my comments and see if you get where I am coming from. Otherwise keep going. I would say this needs work to be the best it can be but also as I said thats just my opinion.  ,fantasywriters,dc0hn4h,2,t5_2t4ad

By breaking from one post where a reader reads the story to another fresh new post where they have to remember to go and vote we will drop readers from making the effort to go and vote. By having the option to vote on the same post as reading stories this increases the chances readers will stay and vote. And dont forget readers need to be aware of the dates as well. If they are prepared to be fair they will make sure to read as many stories as they can before they vote. gtgood stories wont be ignoredThis can happen just as easily with two threads.

10251468,0,t1_dc60e1r,That introduction is that long.As far as Estri goes if you dont think having her step forward and cover her hair isnt exciting enough rewrite the intro to her character.  It is up to you the writer to craft something that makes the reader want to stay in your world.  Let me offer two examples of what I mean from radically different time periods and writing styles although both are in the fantasy genre.First lets consider about JRR Tolkiens The Hobbit.  Sure a lot of people consider his style something to avoid and indeed he starts his book with a long bit of description.  The thing about his description though is that a hes got a very catching opening sentence and b he spends a lot of his description on the character of hobbits in general while relating them to things we know and understand.  For instance hobbit holes are not holes like we might be thinking because they arent full of worms nor or they dry ad empty.  Secondly consider GRR Martins Game of Thrones which begins with a prologue something else to avoid but his prologue is pretty much a straight grabyourattentionwithsuspenseandhorror action sequence.  From there he moves out to the loveableandsoontobedead Stark family as they are in the woods and encounter some dire wolves and a dead stag.  In the course of this Martin sets up some things about his world and even informs us of two major housess sigil.  What he does not do is begin his story telling us about the Castle Winterfell and who the Starks are and what the sigil of their house is and then who Robert Baratheon is and why hes king and what his house sigil is and then finally that hes coming to visit.Both writers despite writing very differently and in very different times and with very different worldviews manage to keep the focus on character and plot rather than detailed description.  ,fantasywriters,dc626h2,9,t5_2t4ad

Bethrim sounds like a girls name probably because it starts with Beth. The isnt really a big deal though. The dialogue sounds pretty natural which is good but its hard to keep track of whos talking at times. I thought the beginning dialog between Bethrim and Darya was good and it showed the contrast between the two characters. Having the princess who is younger having to stop the two from arguing is good and shows that she is not incompetent. I think the two of them could play off each other more throughout especially in regards to the injured man.

Not telling us what it is might artificially add mystery but it also makes the motivations of the two main characters unclear. Id be a lot more sympathetic toward thieves who messed up and accidentally started a fight. Since in this excerpt I dont know what they want or how the fight happened Im forced to assume Revan stormed it on purpose and Steffon reluctantly joined in. The character dynamic is somewhat interesting but it makes Steffon feel kind of passive at the same time.Personally I would start the story even earlier so we can see what the item is why they want it how they found out about it and also how they found the caravan. Currently there are no stakes so theres no tension and the only conflict is on the surface ie the literal fight. As a reader I want to know what makes these characters and this event important to the overall story.,fantasywriters,de2mol0,5,t5_2t4ad
10891155,0,t1_de37pwj,Thanks very much for the suggestions!Im having trouble reconciling my own writing style with the advice I readhear about concerning writing and I think thats partially why some of my style comes off as labored. I might be forcing a round peg through a square. I need to take a more exacting knife to my work and separate between whats there for the readers benefit and whats there to actually advance the story.Thanks again!,fantasywriters,de3cfyr,2,t5_2t4ad

Once it was apparent the boomsticks were killing them theyd run away and hide and maybe try to figure out a way to counter them. Imagine if you encountered a swarm of angry bees  if they were in your house and threatening you you would run away but youd also return to battle em. If the angry bees were bothering you during a picnic youd run away and leave them be afterwards.,fantasywriters,de70rus,4,t5_2t4ad

Hes dabbled in sorcery dabbled in soldiering dabbled in trade and thieving and fraud. Now too old to start anything and be taken seriously he is a vagrant who scours battlefields and offers his minor talents in sorcery to those in need for a penny. He cant stay in one place he lacks the discipline. In his mind he is a free spirit but he is forever bound by the chains of failure and when opportunity strikes for fortune and appreciation he makes stupid impulsive decisions.,fantasywriters,deaurh0,3,t5_2t4ad

Someone else made a great point about the main conflict being the reason for the pledge I think thats definitely key.You could even take it further have him under the influence of something slightly hallucinogenic? Maybe hes had a problem with it that hes been hiding from his friends taking it too regularly and this time in his celebratory mood takes a little too much..?

11420977,0,t1_dfqh177,gt Surely thieves guilds make it more of a  thing? What about blacksmiths sons and woodcutters?The setting for this challenge needs to be th century or modern.The closest thing to a thieves guild would be organized crime like The Mob. But being a Goodfella still isnt doing manual labor for a paycheck.Blacksmithing is a niche profession nowadays but could be considered bluecollar. Its a stretch but woodcutting or modern logging could be too.gtI want more ridiculously classist fantasy where the hero was born to it and doesnt earn or learn anything because hes divinely appointed and fabulously wealthy.This probably isnt the challenge for you then.,fantasywriters,dfqk13y,7,t5_2t4ad

Most of the times I do come I see for example that a moderator has put the kibosh on a great subthread where someone referenced existing fantasy literature in a discussion about writing fantasy literature. Then I push the downvote button on the mods post note that its greatly negative so the mods must be aware that this is an unpopular move swallow my disappointment and try to find something else to read or contribute to.It is great that the moderators of this subreddit take their job so seriously. It is usually a thankless job so they deserve the benefit of the doubt and have the right to shape the sub as they see fit.

11747735,0,t3_67mrkf,This is good considering youre ESL. Most of what you need to work on here is deepening the narrative voice  give your characters internal voice more room. Try reading a bit in English until you can get both whats happening externally and what the character feels about the situation in better balance and a bit more developed.The allcapitals title isnt necessary. It reads too much like you as the narrator intruding on the characters perception. That used to be something that happened but nowadays its not really done. Punctuation matters in English writing. Dashes arent a substitute for full stopsperiods just look up a style site such as www.theeditorsblog.net and read up on stylistic issues. If youre writing in past tense all verbs must be in past tense except when in quote marks. Some languages allow for present tense interjections but not English.I think you have the beginnings of a story here but you will need a lot more exposure to and immersion in Englishlanguage fiction before you acquire the fluency necessary to write a whole book in English. Having tried it the other way round as an English speaker trying to write in Polish I ditched the idea because I was much more comfortable in my first language than in my second. I made the same sort of mistakes in that language as youre making in English not basic grammar but the intangible style that fiction needs to be comfortable to read.Im not going to bullsht you here. This will take you a long time  the payoff will be more worth it for you than it was for me writing in Polish since English is a large market for fantasy but to be honest the best thing to do at the moment is continue to study the language get to grips with English punctuation and read a lot. You just need practice and to learn the conventions and deeper nuances of good EL fiction.Best of luck.,fantasywriters,dgrmvk5,3,t5_2t4ad

The qualifiers i.e. what his smile was not werent really necessary imo. I think this line tells more about the character than just playing with word pictures like some of the others.

11797172,0,t3_68btfp,You probably want to avoid a realworld name like Damascus capital of Syria which I assume you knew to avoid reader assumptionsassociations with the name.  Britannia is also pretty much the same  Rule Britannia carries some overtones of English jingoism particularly if youre using it as a ScotsIrish culture. Its the Roman word for Britain but the Celtic tribes are divided into the Gaels modern Highland Scots and Irish and the Britons modern Welsh and so you really want to avoid mixing the two. Hibernia and Caledonia are the equivalent names used by the Romans for Ireland and Scotland although Hibernia means winterland in Latin because of the miserable Irish weather particularly if you come from southern Europe so has very little to do with actual Irish culture. Warhammer used Bretonnia but that just has overtones of Brittany in France.If I were you Id go a little deeper into Gaelic inspired names for the ScotsIrish culture and brush up on actual Egyptian or Persian  two very distinct cultures the first is Arab the second is a nonArab culture additionally ancient Egypt was a third culture and ended up ruled by the Greek Ptolemies  for the second. At the moment both names just sound fake and you need to research a bit more to find something that is more authentic and doesnt conjure realworld spectres.I speak from bitter experience one of my towns was named after Polish slang for pee and one of my male characters originally had a female name. You want to get your names so that noone makes an awkward realworld association with them. Asking on rworldbuilding would be a good idea.     ,fantasywriters,dgx901h,3,t5_2t4ad
