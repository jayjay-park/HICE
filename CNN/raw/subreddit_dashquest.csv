6720096,0,t1_d0eex07,I have  atm with Sorcerers Orb  Ivory Staff   from skills. Its pretty ridiculous. Already with that I had so many lightning storms and monsters on screen because of haste that the game crashed. So its pretty fun p,dashquest,d0eezmo,1,t5_3ad04
6721666,0,t1_d0ejgid,You can still buy items with coins and epic coins. But pet orbs doesnt have a secondary purpose. Maybe they should implement some pet items or consumables that can be purchased with orbs,dashquest,d0ektt3,1,t5_3ad04
6792080,0,t1_d0m3jxr,It states in game that Legend points will be awarded to me when I reach level which Im too lazy to grind.Ive gotten all armors weapons gears epic shop gears items spells skills maxedfully bought and pets max level with full items.It does suck to have everything wiped well. Ill just farm back slowly till then.,dashquest,d0m665g,2,t5_3ad04
7048436,0,t3_4c34hg,Thanks for your reply  since posting I have managed to grind to lvl  and by upgrading lightning  chakra to lvl  I can now run classic mode until the game crashes earning over  gold and on a good run can only use  of my pots  of these on the last  castles!.My INT is  I was looking at the ivory staff but apart from the obvious damage advantages it seemed to have a higher spell cooldown and mana use which I think would see me struggle more?At present ive worked out if I use Holy then  seconds later use lightning I can always have a damage spell hitting.Im not sure I could personally be bothered to reset again for the sake of legend points and go through the whole grind process again...it would kill me...i literally ground for  hours as much as possible to lvl my spells!!!,dashquest,d1faqob,2,t5_3ad04
7220491,0,t1_d1yv6go,Yeah that is the latest patch. It could be an issue try to contact TapTitan Studios on facebook theres a link on the sidebar. Theyre great at getting back to you and whether its a patch issue or server issue or what,dashquest,d1ywxxm,1,t5_3ad04

7259237,0,t3_44sc8m,The campaign mode needs a choice whether you can keep going or want to try it on a harder level instead of exiting out and having to go back in. I know its just a minor thing but makes things a little less of a hassle. Also more skillsspells would be awesome even though I already like everything about the game but also have it to where the spells can be made for different types of runs. Like some that like to go as fast as possible have a skill set for pure runners or skill set for pure physical defense dodge or crit hit.,dashquest,d23bo61,1,t5_3ad04
