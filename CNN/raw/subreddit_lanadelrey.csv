1889302,0,t1_ckgt059,A lot of people on here arent concerned with Lanas personal life and thats probably a good thing but Im pretty invested in her life as a whole so let me give you the rundown...Barrie and Lana were together for about three years. They met when Barries agent sent him Video Games with the subject Your future exwife he was infatuated with her after seeing it werent we all? and they were introduced soon after. He was the only relationship Lana has had since she achieved fame prior to Barrie she was pictured with Shannon Leto Axl Rose Marilyn Manson etc. but nothing serious. Barrie is a musician and a talented one at that so there was always this Bob DylanJoan Baez vibe between the two of them. Everything seemed to be going great they were pictured buying a new home together and rumor has it that Barrie proposed to her on the birthday before last. Lana refers to him as her fiance in a French magazine her father confirms the engagement to fans and refers to them as soulmates.Then suddenly Lana is pictured with some rando while leaving the Chateau Marmont. Oh thats just her manager! the fans scream holding onto hope of Larrie. But they were wrong. The new man is douchemaster supreme Francesco Carrozzini. He actually might be the nicest guy in the world but I have this weird thing that when I couple I love breaks up I immediately despise the next person they get with. They go away on a trip to Italy his home country together and pictures of them kissing are published. Interviews begin to come out that confirmed that her and Barrie are no longer together that they are both very depressed people and that they sort of fed off each other and only became more depressed. Barrie is about to release his new album and it is presumed that this song was recorded while they were still together he also helped in the recording of Ultraviolence. Though after they were broken up both Barrie and Lana commented that they would like to further collaborate...though everything points to Lana being the one that wanted to separate.As of today Lana and Francesco are still together Its all very upsetting. Apologies to anyone who likes the two of them together. I just cant. Ill like the next one. ,lanadelrey,ckgupjw,6,t5_2tegk

4556841,0,t3_3dgumv,I dont dislike Honeymoon but one thing Ive learned with Lana is that if you like her then you can never say that you dont really like one of her new things so quickly. Everyone I know who likes Lana myself included have songs that grew on us even though we didnt like them very much at the start. Give it some time DBut I did expect Honeymoon to be a lot faster and less UVlike. Perhaps this was the first choice for the single from the album precisely because it wasnt so different. It might have been too much of a shock if it were. She also said there was some muddy trap energy in one of the other songs on the album so with that as evidence I am expecting not only more diversity in the album but also some fast songs in that diversity.,lanadelrey,ct50d66,8,t5_2tegk

Her bourbon is not literally speaking to her but she is pointing out the fact that they both have something in common. unless shes drunk I suppose. I forgot to add this in the alcohol theory post but in her video Kinda Outta Luck  Lana is drinking from a Jim Beam bottle  and  . Perhaps supporting the fact that Jim B. is her favorite drink? also referencing bourbon in Cruel World.Crying tears of gold like lemonade is a reference to the nature of a lemon. A lemon can sting because of the sourness but when you drink it make lemonade  its sweet. Referencing back to her drinking.

Dont get me wrong I feel like her style and production values and her repertoire have matured immensely only getting better and better but for some reason that song from years ago just sums up Lana for me. Its relatable articulate beautifully sung. Paints such a gorgeous picture and I feel like really paved the way for the artist she wanted to become. imo it structured the soundscape and visuals that shes so wellknown for today and its stuffed full of all those gorgeous faded Americana references that make up her world.Also v much in love with Pawn Shop Blues Queen of Disaster TV in Black amp White and Never Let Me Go. ,lanadelrey,cvb5df6,4,t5_2tegk
