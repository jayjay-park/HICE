2529917,0,t1_cmomn1c,I felt the same thing.  Unfortunately as it was my first episode I didnt have a whole lot to do.  I recorded my second ep.  Which is mostly sped up footage but my third is going to be a caving ep Where I talk about who I am and projects I have coming up in other series and things.,SMPdoneSensible,cmosojc,0,t5_354jj

3165950,0,t1_copr488,Apart from the standard games I have subscribed to a superfight mod which I havent tried out yet. I also have recreated my magic the gathering decks in it so if you or anyone want to play you can just borrow a deck I have three plus an extra that actually belongs to a friend of mine.Other than that I have prepared material to create robo rally in the game an epic boardgame where you program robots to race and compete against eachother. Just ask Baj he knows it x  I just need to find the motivation to actually finish making it ready.You can find me on steam if you search for Ulvra or you may simply go here ,SMPdoneSensible,coq5e88,1,t5_354jj

5232682,0,t3_3mlj1x,Bleagh logistics... But yes it could be fun. I agree with Ulvra though we should look at alternative game types as well as UHC doesnt have to be a PvP focused thing.How many Mindcrackers have official fan servers? If we somehow surpassed all organisation expectations its not too difficult to imagine some kind of competitive UHC playoffs between them all. Each server plays every other server once maybe with some kind of Final for the top two. Or maybe some kind of Battle Royale with every fan server submitting a team of  into the same game...Anyway back to work...,SMPdoneSensible,cvgq8zj,1,t5_354jj

6187089,0,t3_408u5p,Ill throw my hat in the ring here.One of the biggest issues I have with recent UHCs is that they are waaaay too long. People spending hours gearing up apart from making for terrible video is frankly boring as heck.Sure there will be those that see nothing wrong with spending hours at a spawner but consider thisLimit the maximum caving time to  minutes. This will ensure that ALL teams are on the surface and skirmishing far sooner.Limit the map size so that people actually do come across each other and fight it out.PVE v PVP  it is far more satisfying to watch people fight each other than get polished off by a skeleton no one saw. Think about permaday after  minutes. This has the added effect of making caving after that point less desirable.It is fine having quests for this and that but keep in mind the scale to which the game will be elongated by it. Not everyone can play for an unlimited amount of time due to commitments the next day.TLDRKeep it simple short and fun.Random,SMPdoneSensible,cyswo79,5,t5_354jj
6203088,0,t1_cyukrz6,Prob the same if some teams get diamonds diamond armour potions and first kills just saying i think its a good way to get people up on the surface.,SMPdoneSensible,cyuq44d,1,t5_354jj
6611179,0,t1_d02yqlu,Its the south tunnel. I looked at that fortress and there are a couple intersections that could work but they are half embedded in netherrack. If you go to east from northeastern part of that fortress there is another one I made a path behind a blaze spawner through the rack. That one has a couple of intersections that are more out in the open and over the lava which I think would make it easier to build. I was hoping to branch off of the south tunnel to go east past the first fortress and the over to the other one. I will be making another video today and I will show where the location is and the farm I am probably going to use.,SMPdoneSensible,d035gz6,1,t5_354jj
6766113,0,t3_48by8r,After reading some of the comments about updating to . and some the features etc and removing some. It reminds me of when . came out when they broke the game with . and no body will ever play again then . with the zombie AI and OMG they track you from how far away. . errr new terrain we were happy with that . the Redstone Update they broke so many things designs Im never playing again....    I just woke so my recollection of what it was for each update might be a bit off but here we still are playing the game after each update that broke the game for me there hasnt been an update yet that Ive hated maybe took a few days to get accustomed to it.   I feel like once we start going down the path of removing core gameplay mechanics its a slippery slope to removingadding other things then being in a right pickle when . comes out and whatever we are playing might then be far away from whatever it would be.   If we really needed to do something after we update because we have people dying left right and centre putting the server onto Normal difficulty would be my preference until we get accustomed to it.,SMPdoneSensible,d0j7vlu,1,t5_354jj
