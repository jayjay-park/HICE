10505355,0,t1_dcwfff0,Sure. That seems to be the attempt. Unless they were going to do a happily ever after thing not having him pursue someone would only leave us with one option  lonely Frasier. Both dad and brother happy with wives while he has no one. It just wasnt believable though. They could have shown him resolve his issues and find someone maybe reunite with Claire. But without resolving that stuff even introducing another great woman would have been pointless because of his recordpattern. So whatever it is what it is. At least we didnt get a full season of Charlotte. Bleh.,Frasier,dcyw6fv,2,t5_2s4en
