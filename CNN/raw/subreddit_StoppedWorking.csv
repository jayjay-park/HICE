In my understanding this just mean ANY water like rivers seas ocean a runnel pool. I just didnt want it to limit it to one. Again correct me if Im wrong!Is how to swim really better? In German this would be the more convenient way swimming would be better because it says the same thing with less words. Plus its not an unnecessary paraphrase. But English is not German so Im asking.So if I want to emphasize with the too I should say We too dont freak out when we ...?

A very small amount can kill the dog and can lead to a lot of long term effects including weakness reduced lifespan etc.Feed your dog hydrogen peroxide if heshe ingests anything toxic this will cause them to vomit it out before the toxins can be absorbed. Hydrogen Peroxide is poisonous but our body has a very good defence mechanism against it and immediately vomits it out and starts producing enzymes to break it down.,StoppedWorking,dd5im92,22,t5_38e1c

Okay Im on board.So when Budgies were imported as pets from Australia they started adapting and changing in different ways isolated in these new regions especially in America and England as they were interbred in these regions.In America they were bred for bright colors and proliferated and thats what youll find in North American pet stores.  They come in a metric fuckton of different color mutationsIn England they were bred for size and plumage and theyre not only bigger than their American or even Australian counterparts they have silly forehead tufts.  I believe this actually started from the royal family and their preferences as they were some of the first adoptersadapters of pet budgies but I heard that story word of mouth.Here is an image comparing an English budgerigar left next to its American counterpartsAnd of course you still have the Australian budgies who in the wild are all pretty much green and there are some pet variations which are also distinct from the American color mutations but not physically significantly different.There are also all kinds of factors between the different subspecies? groups? whatever its called affecting health longeivity behavior etc.,StoppedWorking,dg9uqjv,2,t5_38e1c
