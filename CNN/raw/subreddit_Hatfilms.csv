4480508,0,t1_csv24bc,Im pretty sure the idea that this is filler comes from the old TV show convention of having a flashback or clip show episode at some point in the season. The idea of creating more episodes based on stock footage or old content repurposed to something else. It meant less work for the actors... and that is where the confusion lies. You guys are both the actors and the crew. So while the actors are having a week off you still had to put the effort in to comb through old footage and edit it all.It is weird to think about how old TV conventions still affect peoples opinions of new media like youtube.,Hatfilms,csvfopf,6,t5_2uvqu

And if you care about the fucking wellbeing of an animal  buy organically raised livestock meat. Then the animal would have had a lovely life and I have seen animals being slaughtered.

9299721,0,t3_57sys0,Fun fact for Smith Here is Leonardo Da Vincis resume for the future Duke of Milan when he had to look for work in his early s around  so a bit before the Renaissance truly settled in. Its all interesting but the bolded part is what you want.Most Illustrious Lord Having now sufficiently considered the specimens of all those who proclaim themselves skilled contrivers of instruments of war and that the invention and operation of the said instruments are nothing different from those in common use I shall endeavor without prejudice to any one else to explain myself to your Excellency showing your Lordship my secret and then offering them to your best pleasure and approbation to work with effect at opportune moments on all those things which in part shall be briefly noted below.. I have a sort of extremely light and strong bridges adapted to be most easily carried and with them you may pursue and at any time flee from the enemy and others secure and indestructible by fire and battle easy and convenient to lift and place. Also methods of burning and destroying those of the enemy.. I know how when a place is besieged to take the water out of the trenches and make endless variety of bridges and covered ways and ladders and other machines pertaining to such expeditions.. If by reason of the height of the banks or the strength of the place and its position it is impossible when besieging a place to avail oneself of the plan of bombardment I have methods for destroying every rock or other fortress even if it were founded on a rock etc.. Again I have kinds of mortars most convenient and easy to carry and with these I can fling small stones almost resembling a storm and with the smoke of these cause great terror to the enemy to his great detriment and confusion.. And if the fight should be at sea I have kinds of many machines most efficient for offense and defense and vessels which will resist the attack of the largest guns and powder and fumes.. I have means by secret and tortuous mines and ways made without noise to reach a designated spot even if it were needed to pass under a trench or a river.. I will make covered chariots safe and unattackable which entering among the enemy with their artillery there is no body of men so great but they would break them. And behind these infantry could follow quite unhurt and without any hindrance.. In case of need I will make big guns mortars and light ordnance of fine and useful forms out of the common type.. Where the operation of bombardment might fail I would contrive catapults mangonels trabocchi and other machines of marvellous efficacy and not in common use. And in short according to the variety of cases I can contrive various and endless means of offense and defense.. In times of peace I believe I can give perfect satisfaction and to the equal of any other in architecture and the composition of buildings public and private and in guiding water from one place to another.. I can carry out sculpture in marble bronze or clay and also I can do in painting whatever may be done as well as any other be he who he may.Again the bronze horse may be taken in hand which is to be to the immortal glory and eternal honor of the prince your father of happy memory and of the illustrious house of Sforza.And if any of the abovenamed things seem to anyone to be impossible or not feasible I am most ready to make the experiment in your park or in whatever place may please your Excellency  to whom I comment myself with the utmost humility etc.So clearly point  is what eventually became Landships which he would have tried to power with steam a concept he tried many times up to an automated kitchen witch ended in absolute failure.In the end though he was hired as a sculptor since the rest was deemed to be absolute bonkers by his peers. From his biography it was what Leonardo preferred anyway seeing as he only mentionned war in his resume since it was a common thing back then to apply for amongst the upper court and his love was more for art.,Hatfilms,d8ut1a6,9,t5_2uvqu
