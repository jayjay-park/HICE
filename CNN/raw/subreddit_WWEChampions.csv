If youre at a point where youre a ways away from having the tokens you need then I might suggest spending it on building your roster with pulls from the MegaPremium Superstar lotteries.Whatever you do...I dont suggest spending it on health packs training points or props.,WWEChampions,derv4yz,4,t5_3d2ee

11502683,0,t1_dfzku91,Jen in another post you recently mentioned that you thought Loot box drops are talent based.  Did you mean that the posdible drops are based on the talent level of the wrestler you are fighting OR is it the relative talent between your wrestler and the computer opponent  i.e. a  talent computer wrestler wont drop TP or tokens as often against your  talent wrestler as he would if you used a  talent wrestler yourself.   Certainly xp amounts awarded at end of match are based on relative talent.,WWEChampions,dfztv45,3,t5_3d2ee

11596967,0,t1_dg9quyr,Im probably not much more experienced that you but it doesnt seem like a dealbreaker. Cenas choose gems move links to his nd move not his finisher is  gem less amp so to me doesnt seem as powerful as Andres at the same level. Personally I was abandoning Cena for Andre till I saw all the hype about Cena based mainly on his tag boosts as the dealbreaker then when I upgraded his moves to get him to  gold I saw he could only choose  gems on the Level green move so decided to evolve Andre to  instead. Im hoping that Andres red move eventually goes back to  choosing  gems that plus the extra HP from being a Showboat would make him a beast!Check the farmers guide spreadsheet on the sidebar for Cenas list of tag boosts  if you dont already have one of these guys at  then I think the tag boost you get with Andre  a  Orndorf would still be really good amp fun to play with.,WWEChampions,dgaiwba,1,t5_3d2ee
