8415426,0,t3_4uw3zj,Nope. Used Urien a lot online against friends and sometimes even against strangers nothing happened. Itd be a very anticommunity and stupid not to mention a gigantic waste of resource to enforce their threats. I already spent  extra in Capcom store intentionally not using FM for many things just to support capcom as I have done all these years if they decide to ban people who love the charactergame enough to go through the lengths of mod to play theyd be losing the respect and potential lifelong consumers of their product. I doubt anythings gonna happen. If something does oh well I wont be sour ill just put my time to better use lol.,StreetFighterMods,d5tgzo1,5,t5_3c2ce

8790543,0,t3_50e41c,Got my FM reset too and I find it strange nobody mentionned that most importantly the warning message also says that still using the trainer could lead to the deletion of your CFN ID but most outrageously ANDOR your Steam ID too !Well given how Cashcom is handling this by threatening the purchases of all the games in a Steam account which have no ties at all with the money they wish us to pay instead of grinding their own game before even punishing efficiently the rage quitters and adding the daily objectives for bonus FM that they announced for months I am so glad I could fck their abusive system by skipping hours of tedious survival and still keep the purchases I made with the easy FM.Damn just look at the number of fighters stages amp super moves for each char in KOF XIV included at launch and compare this to Shitty Fighter V !,StreetFighterMods,d74hs2d,1,t5_3c2ce

9916136,0,t1_db0264q,Hi first of all thanks for liking the mod  Now onto your issue like AliaSun mentioned just use one PAK file. You cannot use multiple at once they are different variants of one mod so for example if you like long hairs with barefoot the most then use that PAK only. Also the costume is meant for Story costume C so make sure you have that pick that during selection screen and the mod should appear.,StreetFighterMods,db03hs0,8,t5_3c2ce
